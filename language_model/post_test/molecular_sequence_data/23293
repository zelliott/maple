zzso is a major zzso zzso transport motor that binds to one of its zzso the zzso by means of a zzso zzso When one of the members of this zzso complex is zzso the zzso clump in the zzso region of the zzso and are transferred zzso to the developing hair, leading to a dilution of coat zzso zzso of a fourth zzso dilute zzso zzso suppresses this coat color zzso zzso is required for the peripheral zzso of zzso in zzso but its role in zzso transfer to neighboring zzso and the hair is zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso for zzso transfer, although zzso incorporation into the hair in zzso mice is uneven, probably due to the zzso of zzso that occurs in the zzso region of zzso zzso We also show that zzso is caused by a zzso zzso in a unique zzso protein that appears to function in an zzso zzso to alter zzso incorporation into the zzso zzso zzso identifies a unique protein involved in pigmentation of the zzso zzso
