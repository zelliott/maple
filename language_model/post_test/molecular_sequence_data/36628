Recent pharmacological data strongly support the hypothesis of delta zzso zzso as zzso of both zzso and spinal zzso zzso 1 and delta 2 zzso In zzso zzso binding data, which are fully supportive of the in zzso data, are still zzso A previous study indicated that zzso labels two binding sites in zzso depleted of zzso binding sites by zzso with the zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso The main goal of the present study was to develop a zzso profile of the two delta zzso binding zzso The data indicated that zzso and zzso were relatively selective for site 1 zzso zzso and zzso were only zzso and zzso selective for site zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso selective for site zzso zzso was zzso selective for site zzso zzso had moderate affinity for site 1 zzso zzso 16 zzso and was about zzso selective for site zzso Thus, of the 10 drugs zzso only zzso and zzso were selective for site zzso zzso collectively with other data, it is likely that the delta 1 zzso and the delta zzso binding site are zzso
