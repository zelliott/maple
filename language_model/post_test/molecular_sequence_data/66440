The structure of the membrane protein zzso was determined in zzso aligned zzso zzso by solid-state zzso zzso With two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso loop, this truncated construct of the mercury transport membrane protein zzso has sufficient structural complexity to demonstrate the feasibility of determining the structures of zzso membrane proteins in their native zzso zzso environment under zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso experiments were applied to zzso and selectively zzso samples to resolve and assign the backbone zzso zzso and to measure the associated zzso chemical shift and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as orientation constraints for structure zzso zzso zzso experiments were applied to selectively zzso and zzso samples to complete the resonance assignments, especially for zzso in the zzso regions of the zzso A single resonance is observed for each labeled site in one- and two-dimensional zzso zzso each zzso has a unique zzso and all protein molecules in the sample have the same three-dimensional structure and are oriented zzso in zzso zzso zzso Combined with the absence of significant intensity near the zzso resonance frequency, this demonstrates that the entire zzso including the loop and terminal regions, has a zzso stable structure in zzso zzso
