zzso zzso is widely distributed from Southwest China to Northeast China and in the Russian Far zzso The distribution of this species was thought to be influenced by the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso To reveal the imprints of geological events on the spatial genetic structure of zzso zzso we examined two zzso segments ( zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso individuals from 47 zzso 

A total of 16 zzso was identified, and significant genetic differentiation was revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso The survey detected two highly divergent zzso lineages connected by a deep gap with zzso zzso the southern lineage with higher genetic diversity and differentiation in the eastern zzso zzso and the northern lineage in the region outside the zzso zzso The divergence between these two lineages was estimated at zzso zzso A correlation between the genetic and the geographic distances indicates that genetic drift was more influential than gene flow in the northern zzso with lower diversity and zzso However, a scenario of regional equilibrium between gene flow and drift was shown for the southern zzso The feature of spatial distribution of the genetic diversity of the southern lineage possibly indicated that zzso fragmentation was dominant in the collections from the eastern zzso zzso 

The results revealed that the zzso of the zzso zzso likely resulted in the significant divergence between the lineage in the eastern zzso zzso and the other one outside this zzso The diverse niches in the eastern zzso zzso created a wide spectrum of zzso to accumulate and accommodate new zzso The features of genetic diversity of populations outside the eastern zzso zzso seemed to reveal the imprints of extinction during the zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso Our study is a typical case of the significance of the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in spatial genetic structure of eastern Asian plants, and sheds new light on the evolution of zzso in the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
