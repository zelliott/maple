zzso is an zzso zzso protein containing two highly zzso zzso zzso at positions 7 and 14 in the zzso zzso The simultaneous substitution of the two zzso increases the zzso of the zzso chain to zzso causing zzso zzso under zzso condition, zzso neutral pH and room zzso The role played by zzso zzso in driving the folding process has been investigated by examining three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso by an integrated approach based on zzso zzso circular zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso and complementary zzso zzso attention has been devoted to examine the zzso and dynamic properties of the equilibrium intermediate formed at pH zzso since it represents the early organized structure from which the native fold zzso The results show that the W zzso F zzso at position 7 and 14 differently affect the structural organization of the zzso zzso of zzso The combined effect of the two zzso in the double zzso zzso the formation of zzso contacts and favors zzso zzso leading to protein zzso and zzso zzso
