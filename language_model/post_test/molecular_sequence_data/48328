zzso colonies of the zzso zzso zzso are capable of zzso and territorial zzso zzso of independent zzso zzso zzso can recognize each other as foreign and establish a visible boundary where they zzso in contrast, genetically identical swarms zzso The zzso zzso which zzso self-identity zzso are necessary but not sufficient for this territorial zzso Here we have identified two new gene zzso one zzso encodes zzso products, and another zzso encodes a putative type VI zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins function independently of each other in zzso transport and in territorial zzso however, these zzso systems are linked via this type VI zzso zzso The zzso system is required for export of select zzso and zzso zzso Our results provide a zzso and zzso basis for the fundamental behaviors of zzso and zzso in a bacterial model zzso 

Our results support a model in which zzso in zzso zzso is achieved by the combined action of two independent pathways linked by a shared machinery for export of zzso zzso zzso These proteins together form a zzso network for zzso that can serve as a foundation for examining the prevalent biological phenomena of territorial behaviors and zzso in a simple, bacterial model zzso
