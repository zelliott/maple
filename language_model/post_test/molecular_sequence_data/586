zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of bacterial fruit zzso zzso a threatening disease of zzso melon, and other zzso Despite the economic importance of zzso relatively little is known about basic aspects of the zzso biology and the molecular basis of its interaction with host zzso To identify zzso zzso zzso zzso genes associated with zzso we generated a zzso zzso zzso library on the background of strain zzso a group I strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and screened it for reduced zzso by zzso zzso with zzso Here, we report the identification of a zzso zzso with reduced zzso that is impaired in zzso which encodes a protein involved in assembly of type IV zzso zzso Further characterization of this zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso for twitching zzso and zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso reductions in zzso and zzso formation as well as zzso of twitching were also observed in zzso zzso affected in other zzso zzso We also provide the first evidence that group I strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso can colonize and move through host zzso zzso
