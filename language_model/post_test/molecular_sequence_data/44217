zzso is an zzso zzso zzso from a clinical isolate of zzso zzso that encodes resistance to zzso zzso by zzso extended spectrum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of the zzso resistance is difficult to zzso which could have clinical zzso A region of zzso containing five resistance genes and two putative zzso was characterized by restriction mapping and partial DNA zzso One zzso appears to be class I zzso zzso the second lacks a recognizable 3' zzso zzso Neither zzso has the zzso site predicted for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from other bacterial strains appear to be closely related to zzso by restriction zzso analysis, but have zzso zzso regions that vary in size and content from that of zzso zzso zzso might be responsible for genetic divergence in a widely distributed family of zzso zzso
