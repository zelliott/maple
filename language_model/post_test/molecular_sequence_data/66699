zzso zzso zzso also called prion diseases, are characterized by zzso loss linked to the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso of the cellular prion protein zzso Although the molecular and cellular bases of zzso zzso are not yet fully zzso increasing evidence supports the view that zzso zzso interferes with zzso normal zzso in zzso In the present work, we exploit the properties of zzso a synthetic zzso encompassing zzso zzso of zzso to investigate into the mechanisms sustaining zzso zzso zzso This zzso shares many zzso properties with zzso and is zzso in zzso and in zzso We examined the impact of zzso exposure on zzso zzso cells, their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso triggers zzso oxygen species zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sustained zzso and zzso signals in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, while having no effect on zzso precursor and zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso relies on cell surface expression of zzso recruitment of a zzso signaling platform, and zzso of zzso zzso Altogether, these findings provide actual evidence that zzso zzso injury is caused by an amplification of zzso signaling responses, which notably promotes zzso stress zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso cells could hence represent a zzso event in zzso zzso zzso zzso
