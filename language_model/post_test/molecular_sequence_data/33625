Genes for zzso 1 zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso crucial for zzso and Lewis blood group zzso zzso They are highly zzso and ethnically and geographically zzso 

zzso variations and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions and zzso sequences were analyzed in 100 zzso blood donors by systematic zzso zzso were verified with zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso determined zzso and Lewis blood groups were correlated to respective zzso 

Two novel zzso zzso were defined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the latter located in the zzso domain of the zzso Five new zzso of zzso were zzso three were characterized by new zzso and two resulted from new combinations of known zzso The new zzso zzso zzso also is located in the zzso zzso A new zzso zzso based on the presence of zzso zzso was zzso Another zzso zzso may have resulted from an zzso crossover zzso zzso analysis revealed seven novel zzso partly based on the new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso is placed in the zzso domain and functional, zzso is placed in the zzso zzso 

Multiple common and sporadic sequence variations including 14 new zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Four novel zzso result in zzso acid substitution in the zzso Three of them are predicted to have adverse effects on the zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso was zzso
