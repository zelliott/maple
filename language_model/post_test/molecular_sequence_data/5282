A zzso agent zzso designated zzso G virus zzso was recently zzso In this study, we examined the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso sequences in the putative envelope region from 72 zzso obtained from diverse geographical zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso region of zzso was determined from 12 zzso and compared with three published zzso The most zzso was observed in 400 zzso at the N zzso of zzso We next zzso this 400 zzso envelope variable region zzso from an additional 60 zzso zzso This sequence varied considerably among the 75 zzso with overall identity ranging from zzso to zzso at the zzso level, and from zzso to zzso at the zzso acid zzso However, zzso regions were not zzso zzso analyses indicated that the 75 zzso zzso belong to a single zzso A zzso distribution of evolutionary distances was observed among the 15 zzso sequences and the 75 zzso zzso In contrast, 11 zzso of zzso were zzso and showed a zzso distribution, representing zzso zzso and zzso The 75 zzso of zzso fell into four clusters on the zzso zzso Tight geographical zzso was observed among the zzso zzso from Japan and zzso
