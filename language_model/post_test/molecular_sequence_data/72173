A zzso zzso to that zzso sheep zzso protein was cloned from a human lung zzso zzso The full-length sequence encodes a zzso acid protein which belongs to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso is widely distributed in human zzso with the highest abundance in zzso zzso cells expressing the human zzso protein showed an elevated response to zzso acid zzso in a serum response element reporter gene zzso which was zzso zzso and specific to zzso compared to other zzso zzso of human zzso in zzso cells correlated with increases in specific binding of zzso Recently, the mouse counterpart of zzso protein also was identified as a zzso for zzso zzso et zzso 1996, zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso it is concluded that the human zzso protein functions as a cellular zzso for zzso
