The inverse of a folding problem is to find the ideal sequence that folds into a particular protein zzso This problem has been addressed using the zzso zzso zzso algorithm, capable of calculating a score zzso of an arbitrary zzso zzso At first, the search is conducted by zzso zzso of the energy in sequence zzso It is shown that using energy as the only design criterion leads to zzso solutions with incorrect zzso acid zzso The problem lies in the general features of the protein energy surface as a function of both structure and zzso The proposed solution is to design the sequence by maximizing the difference between its energy in the desired structure and in other known protein zzso Depending on the size of the database of structures zzso zzso sequences bearing significant similarity to the native sequence of the target protein are obtained using this zzso
