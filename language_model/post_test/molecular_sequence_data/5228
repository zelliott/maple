Analysis of the crystal structure of zzso zzso reveals a cluster of zzso zzso near the active zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso we find that zzso and zzso are critical for the functional interaction of zzso with viral zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to zzso led to a loss of both 3' processing and strand transfer activities in zzso while maintaining the ability to interact with zzso DNA and support zzso However, zzso of both zzso to zzso produced a synergistic effect eliminating nearly all zzso DNA interaction and disintegration zzso In addition, virus containing either of these changes was zzso at the step of zzso zzso using zzso zzso suggests that zzso interacts at the zzso position of the zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso bond of viral zzso zzso conservation throughout zzso zzso and certain bacterial zzso zzso zzso supports the premise that within those families of zzso zzso these zzso are strategic for DNA zzso
