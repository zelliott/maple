The zzso zzso has been identified as an integral zzso membrane protein in zzso where zzso zzso lack zzso remnant zzso Although not proven in higher organisms, a role of this gene in the early zzso zzso is zzso We report here the zzso cloning and the zzso structure of the mouse zzso zzso The 2 zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso The gene spans a region of 30 zzso contains 12 zzso and 11 zzso and is located on band A of zzso zzso The putative promoter region exhibits characteristic zzso zzso zzso expression was identified in all zzso zzso with the strongest signals in liver and in zzso and could not be induced by zzso The data presented may be useful for the generation of a mouse model defective in zzso in order to clarify the yet unknown functional impact of disturbances in early zzso membrane zzso
