Many complex viruses package their zzso into empty protein shells and zzso of the zzso family provide some of the simplest models for zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso uses chemical energy to zzso zzso zzso zzso precursors into the zzso We previously dissected the mechanism of zzso zzso for one such zzso 12, and have now investigated three further highly zzso zzso zzso zzso (from 6, 8 and zzso zzso crystal structures of the set of zzso allow a zzso zzso analysis, which reveals that these proteins form a distinct zzso of the zzso zzso Although the proteins share a common zzso core, they have different zzso and control mechanisms, which we map onto divergent zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso loading and tight zzso of zzso activity with zzso zzso in 8 zzso is due to a remarkable zzso structure, which wraps right around the outside of the zzso to insert into the central hole where zzso binds to coupled zzso and zzso zzso whereas in 12 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a specific hydrogen bond to the zzso of zzso ring to zzso zzso specificity for the 12 zzso
