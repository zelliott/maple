A zzso for the rat zzso precursor was identified, by differential display of zzso zzso as zzso in zzso rats and subsequently was zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences show a high degree of zzso to human and zzso zzso zzso When used as a probe for Northern zzso analysis of zzso from rat zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso to a single species of zzso that was zzso more abundant in zinc zzso A tissue distribution survey indicates that although the small zzso expresses a disproportionately high level of zzso this hormone precursor is also expressed in the zzso stomach, zzso zzso and zzso The induction by zinc zzso is the first reported case of gene regulation for this zzso These results also suggest a potential mechanism to explain, at least in part, the beneficial effects of zinc supplementation for zzso zzso prevalent in many areas of the zzso
