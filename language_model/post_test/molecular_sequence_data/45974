The alpha zzso of the zzso of all bacteria contains a php domain, initially identified by its similarity to zzso zzso but of otherwise unknown function zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26, zzso zzso of 60 zzso from the zzso zzso of the alpha php domain destroys zzso zzso The minimal zzso php domain, estimated by sequence alignment with zzso zzso is insufficient for zzso zzso However, a zzso segment including sequences that immediately zzso the zzso domain binds zzso with the same affinity as the zzso full-length alpha zzso A subset of zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso present in the php domain of all bacterial zzso resulted in defects in zzso zzso Using sequence zzso we show that the zzso zzso Pol C, which contains the zzso and zzso activities within the same zzso chain, has an zzso sequence inserted in a surface loop near the center of the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the php domain serves as a platform to enable coordination of zzso and zzso activities during zzso zzso
