A series of zzso zzso coli shuttle zzso were constructed which contained the replication and maintenance functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The utility of the newly constructed zzso was demonstrated by the successful cloning and expression of several genes that had previously proven difficult to express in zzso zzso Additional zzso which permit the generation of zzso and zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso reporter gene were also produced and subsequently employed to determine the relative strengths in zzso zzso of a number of zzso By utilizing the zzso replication functions of zzso the shuttle zzso described largely avoided the zzso and structural stability problems frequently encountered with zzso zzso zzso In addition, these plasmids represent zzso which are suitable for the analysis of genes in zzso zzso at low copy zzso
