A zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from an agricultural soil which quickly zzso these zzso This zzso designated strain zzso grew on zzso as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen with a doubling time of 3 h in a mineral zzso zzso The aromatic nucleus of the zzso was not zzso and zzso zzso accumulated as the end product of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were similarly zzso with each yielding the corresponding zzso zzso zzso contained two plasmids zzso and 130 zzso A probe cloned from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles of zzso and strain zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso of strain zzso is very similar to zzso On the basis of the results of zzso tests, zzso zzso sequence analysis, and membrane zzso zzso strain zzso was found to be a zzso unique type II zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells increased zzso when strain zzso was grown in the presence of 100 zzso of zzso per liter as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen or as the sole nitrogen source in the presence of zzso Growth on zzso resulted in the induction of zzso required for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso on a zzso found in organisms from different geographic areas and that the specific activity of zzso degradation may increase in response to zzso zzso
