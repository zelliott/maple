We have solved the zzso X-ray structure of the complementary zzso zzso and zzso The zzso duplex was zzso as zzso but contains a single zzso base pair that does not follow the alternating zzso rule for zzso zzso This is the first crystal structure which serves to illustrate the structural consequences of placing a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, since these sequences are not zzso the individual strands of this zzso zzso are unique in sequence and therefore distinguishable in the crystal zzso Nevertheless, the crystal of this duplex is zzso with other zzso zzso zzso The asymmetry of this zzso sequence required that the structure be solved using two unique models, which are distinguished by the orientation of zzso in the crystal zzso In one model (the zzso zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso is packed against the terminal zzso base of a zzso zzso while in the alternative model (the zzso zzso this zzso sits exposed in a zzso channel of the zzso We find that neither model alone can completely account for the observed electron zzso The two models ultimately were refined zzso A composite structure consisting of zzso zzso model and zzso zzso model refined to an zzso of zzso which was significantly lower than refinements using either model zzso A detailed analysis of these two structures shows that, in spite of the zzso zzso base pair, the features characteristic of zzso have been zzso Both models, however, show significant local structural adjustments to accommodate the single zzso base which is forced to adopt the zzso zzso in each zzso In general, it appears that in order to relieve the energetically zzso zzso contacts between the zzso base in the zzso zzso and the zzso sugar, the base is forced into a highly buckled zzso and that this large buckle in turn alters the zzso of neighboring zzso This unusual zzso also significantly zzso zzso interactions between the zzso in zzso and the adjacent zzso in the zzso and affects the exposure of the bases to zzso We conclude that this crystal structure provides a molecular rationale for why zzso bases are energetically zzso in zzso
