The Japanese zzso zzso zzso has a 400 zzso zzso with high gene density and minimal zzso complexity, and is therefore an ideal zzso model for sequence zzso The identification of regions of zzso zzso between zzso and humans would greatly accelerate the mapping and ordering of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso as a first step in an attempt to characterize the region in zzso zzso to human zzso zzso The 11 zzso of the zzso zzso gene share zzso identity with human zzso and span zzso zzso of zzso zzso By comparison, human zzso spans 90 zzso representing a zzso difference in zzso We have also determined by zzso sequence scanning that zzso a zzso zzso gene which also maps to human zzso lies zzso zzso from zzso in a head-to-head or zzso to zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso locus is a region of zzso zzso zzso scanning of overlapping zzso has identified two other zzso zzso and zzso both of which map to human zzso zzso and lie adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso indicating the boundary between two zzso zzso
