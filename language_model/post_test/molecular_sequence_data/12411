We have previously derived and identified a highly avid zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells zzso At the time, the closet zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated only zzso zzso with zzso To identify the zzso counterpart of zzso zzso DNA from the same zzso arthritis zzso patient from whom zzso was derived was used in the zzso chain reaction zzso Four of the six closely related zzso genes that we zzso had zzso regions that were identical with the zzso region of zzso zzso These six zzso sequences differed in their zzso regions, suggesting that they were zzso but closely related zzso zzso To further evaluate the extent of these related genes we identified nine additional zzso genes having zzso zzso that were zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we examined the zzso nature of the zzso zzso gene using single strand zzso zzso zzso and identified two peaks, confirming the existence of highly zzso zzso The sequence and zzso data suggest that: zzso the zzso region of the high zzso zzso zzso was derived from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by a zzso gene belonging to a set of zzso genes within the larger zzso family; and zzso in addition to zzso zzso of zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and conversion events of zzso genes could be important in generating diversity and zzso among zzso zzso zzso
