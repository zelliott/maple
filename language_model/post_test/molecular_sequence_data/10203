zzso studies on soluble proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and other structural methods in general require large quantities of zzso enriched zzso Human zzso is a zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso The development of a high yield zzso system for human zzso is an important prerequisite to using modern zzso zzso in the characterization of the solution structure of the protein and to characterize interactions with a soluble zzso zzso zzso amounts of the protein were expressed using an zzso synthetic gene in a high yield expression zzso Gene synthesis was accomplished through the zzso of six zzso composed of zzso zzso The zzso fragments were further amplified by a zzso chain reaction and then zzso into the zzso zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso However, the induced protein accumulated in the form of inclusion zzso Initially, the protein was zzso under zzso conditions and zzso in these zzso conditions by passage through a single zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, protein zzso was initiated in the presence of 2 M zzso followed by zzso This protocol yielded 40 zzso of biologically active, zzso protein from 4 zzso of minimal medium thus zzso structural studies by zzso The strategy described may be of immense value in the production of significant quantities of zzso zzso proteins for structural and other zzso
