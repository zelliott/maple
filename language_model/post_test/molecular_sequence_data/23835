An zzso zzso was extracted from the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso by using ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The specific activity of the zzso was enriched zzso with a recovery of zzso The zzso was a zzso and the molecular mass was zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso had optimum activity at pH zzso and 60 degrees C and was stable over the pH range of zzso It showed specificity of zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso values of the zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso acid composition and zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso were determined, which provides useful information for cloning of this zzso
