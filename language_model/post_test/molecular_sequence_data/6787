zzso zzso growth factor zzso known as vascular zzso zzso been implicated in the regulation of blood vessel formation, zzso zzso and zzso High amounts of zzso zzso and protein have been detected during embryonic and tumor zzso but it remained unclear whether the level of zzso correlated with the extent of zzso in a given organ or zzso We examined the role of zzso and the high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the avian zzso In a gain of function zzso approach the zzso expression zzso zzso was used to increase the level of quail zzso during critical periods of avian limb bud growth and zzso In contrast to basic zzso growth factor, which recently was demonstrated to induce zzso zzso when zzso in this system, zzso of zzso in the limb bud exclusively resulted in zzso as reflected by an increase in vascular zzso However, cartilage expressing the construct was not zzso zzso Thus zzso was probably due to the zzso of the zzso signaling mechanism in a zzso zzso In addition to zzso vascular zzso was dramatically increased, leading to local and in some cases to general zzso This is the first indication of a link between the functions of zzso as a vascular growth factor and as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso only in those areas where zzso was zzso This implies a positive feedback system of the zzso zzso on its own synthesis and would provide a basis for a zzso system in which zzso concentration is critical for the extent of tissue zzso Our results show that the zzso system is specific and sufficient for the formation of new blood zzso They also have implications for zzso gene therapy of diseases which are characterized by a lack of blood vessels such as chronic zzso diseases of heart and zzso
