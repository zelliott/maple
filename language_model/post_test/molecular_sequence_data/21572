The genetic diversity of zzso in zzso buffalo rumen was studied by amplified zzso DNA restriction analysis, zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso and zzso zzso analysis zzso Three animals were fed diet comprised green fodder zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso mature pasture grass zzso zzso and concentrate mixture zzso crude zzso zzso total zzso zzso A zzso primer zzso and a zzso primer zzso zzso were used to amplify a zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso from rumen zzso A total of 91 clones were examined and identified 14 different zzso zzso sequences based on zzso zzso These 14 zzso were distributed into four zzso zzso zzso database sequences and identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (11 zzso and zzso (9 zzso zzso analyses were also used to zzso the makeup of zzso communities in the rumen of zzso zzso Out of 14 zzso 8 sequences zzso zzso clustered with the zzso zzso clone and 4 sequences (13 zzso were also zzso placed with the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, 2 zzso (9 zzso were related to zzso zzso zzso In addition, the number of zzso zzso gene copies of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in per zzso zzso zzso
