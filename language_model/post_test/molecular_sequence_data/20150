The zzso Cinnamon zzso rat has a spontaneous zzso T helper zzso zzso which causes a markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso Here we zzso clone the locus and identify a deletion in the gene zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso that led to complete loss of the zzso The rat zzso gene exhibits zzso identity with the human and mouse counterparts and is expressed most abundantly in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in mouse immature zzso by zzso interference zzso the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso maps to the zzso locus and that functional zzso is crucial for lineage commitment or progression of zzso T zzso We also found that zzso appears to function in parallel with or downstream of zzso (also known as zzso a master regulator of T cell lineage zzso
