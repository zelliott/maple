zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the primary zzso zzso in avian liver and is therefore analogous in function to zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso liver, zzso zzso is zzso and its distribution is restricted to a few zzso around the terminal zzso These cells do not express zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we show here that there is little or no zzso of zzso zzso in avian zzso Rather, it is broadly distributed to most zzso much like zzso zzso I in zzso zzso In zzso zzso with a cloned zzso zzso zzso probe showed the distribution of zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and avian liver to zzso to the distribution of zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso are strictly zoned in liver of the Texas tortoise or of an Argentine tree frog, both of which possess a complete zzso cycle but which may also rely on zzso zzso for zzso zzso These latter results suggest that the mutually exclusive expression of either zzso zzso I or zzso zzso may be unique to zzso zzso
