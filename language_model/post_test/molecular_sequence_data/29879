A novel alpha zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from a bovine brain zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is that of a zzso zzso The structure is similar to that of the other zzso receptors as well as the larger family of G zzso receptors that have a presumed zzso domain zzso The greatest sequence identity of this zzso protein is with the previously cloned zzso alpha zzso zzso being approximately zzso within the presumed zzso zzso zzso on different human zzso provides evidence that the bovine zzso is distinct from the zzso alpha zzso zzso The bovine zzso clone expressed in zzso cells revealed zzso higher affinity for the alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso as compared with the alpha zzso zzso results similar to zzso binding properties described for the alpha zzso zzso Despite these similarities in pharmacological profiles, the bovine alpha zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso by the zzso agent zzso unlike the alpha zzso zzso zzso In addition, a lack of expression in zzso where the alpha zzso zzso exists suggests that this zzso may actually represent a novel alpha zzso zzso zzso not previously appreciated by pharmacological zzso
