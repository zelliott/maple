Early molecular zzso studies of zzso created considerable confusion about the zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Though this matter has recently been zzso routine identification of these species based on the commonly used zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequence has been zzso This is because, in the available sequences attributed to the species in zzso a clear zzso distinction does not appear to zzso In the present study, zzso the ITS regions of several anomalous zzso is shown to eliminate this problem, which was mainly based on read errors in older zzso zzso generated sequences and recent zzso additions are zzso to show that zzso zzso appears to be uniform in ITS sequence worldwide, while zzso zzso is also uniform, zzso a zzso change found in one otherwise typical zzso Analysis also reveals a zzso as yet incompletely classified Asian zzso that may belong to one or the other of these zzso Standard ITS zzso zzso are proposed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso is designated to anchor the latter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is further evidenced as very closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the anomaly of its zzso zzso is discussed in a population zzso zzso
