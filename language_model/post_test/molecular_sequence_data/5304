Two zzso TIM and zzso physically interact to control zzso cycles of zzso and per zzso in zzso zzso In the present study the structure of TIM protein expressed by zzso zzso was determined by isolation and sequence analysis of zzso DNA zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso of v zzso and m zzso zzso revealed high conservation of the TIM zzso This contrasts with poor sequence conservation previously observed for the TIM partner protein PER in these zzso zzso of the v zzso sequence suggests an alternative structure for most TIM zzso zzso forming an zzso in a previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to be most often translated to produce a longer TIM protein in both zzso The zzso sequence of zzso and sequence analysis of zzso DNA from several strains of zzso zzso suggest that only one of two possible translation initiation sites found in zzso zzso is sufficient to generate zzso rhythms in zzso zzso TIM translation may be affected by multiple zzso zzso that appear to have been zzso in sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso
