The zzso structure of zzso the first identified scorpion toxin acting on zzso channels, has been zzso by zzso and molecular zzso Thirty-nine solution structures were calculated using zzso distance and 42 zzso zzso The average atomic zzso zzso between the refined structures and the mean structure is zzso A for the backbone zzso zzso adopts a zzso scaffold constituted of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to a zzso zzso zzso through two zzso zzso A comparison between the zzso structure of zzso and those of other structurally and functionally related scorpion toxins zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso capacity of the zzso and a zzso in the relative zzso between the zzso and the zzso These two features highlight the plasticity of the zzso scaffold and offer a structural explanation for the capacity of the fold to accommodate an additional zzso zzso in the zzso pattern of a previously proposed consensus sequence zzso et zzso (1991) Science zzso zzso Our structural data also emphasize the possibility that the zzso of zzso is implicated in the capacity of zzso to recognize zzso zzso zzso
