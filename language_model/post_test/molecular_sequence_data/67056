The zzso zzso zzso factor R belongs to a group of proteins with important functions in the regulation of metabolism and development through the cooperation with zzso zzso zzso Here we show that in addition to the zzso and the zzso zzso R contains a zzso region located zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso interaction domain is important for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso by contributing to the recruitment of the C1 zzso factor to the C1 binding sites present in the promoters of zzso zzso zzso The R zzso region bares structural similarity to the ACT domain present in several zzso zzso zzso fold recognition analyses resulted in the identification of similar zzso zzso in several other plant zzso zzso We show that at least one of these related motifs is capable of zzso zzso zzso These findings underscore the function of R as a zzso site for multiple zzso interactions and provide evidence for the presence of a novel zzso domain in multiple plant zzso zzso
