zzso maintenance proteins zzso form a family of zzso molecules that are essential for initiation of DNA zzso All zzso contain six zzso zzso proteins that function as zzso zzso The sequencing of the complete zzso of several zzso has shown that zzso proteins are also present in zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains a single zzso zzso Here we report on the expression and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in both zzso coli and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso protein assembles in large zzso complexes consistent in size with being double zzso We demonstrate that zzso contains zzso activity that zzso uses zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The intrinsic zzso activity of zzso is abolished when a zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso binding site is zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA duplexes in a 3' zzso zzso direction and can unwind up to 500 base pairs in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso of zzso support its role as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso This strongly suggests that this function is zzso for zzso proteins in zzso where a zzso zzso has yet to be zzso
