The role of the two ends of the zzso protein zzso in its interaction with zzso was challenged by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells for the ability to bind and insert into the zzso membrane and to promote the release of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso end confirmed the zzso function of this zone, known as zzso regulation of targeting zzso On the other hand, zzso at the zzso end of the protein support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso is not required for the zzso of zzso In addition, three zzso (a zzso single substitution in the zzso zzso a zzso double substitution at the end of the zzso and a zzso zzso in the loop before zzso exhibited a strong binding capacity, a strong zzso as well as high ability to induce zzso c zzso Considering the positions of these zzso and their potential effect on the movement of zzso zzso we propose that the zzso end of the protein behaves like a second zzso Also, opposite to a zzso that changes the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso in the zzso part of the protein impaired the zzso effect of zzso zzso over zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of the zzso plays a significant role in zzso zzso
