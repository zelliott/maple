zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso has been determined and refined at zzso zzso zzso The zzso molecular structure of zzso is similar to other zzso including the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, in contrast to other zzso zzso zzso binds both zzso and zzso with Hill zzso at zzso zzso of the other zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also has a unique structural zzso a long zzso zzso that interacts with the adjacent zzso to enhance zzso interactions in the molecular zzso The zzso zzso appears to be essential for both formation of the functional zzso and zzso activity, since truncated zzso without the zzso zzso zzso and has only zzso of native zzso zzso The active sites of zzso and zzso are similar, with the exception of the zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso sequence found in knotted zzso and is zzso A zzso search of all available zzso indicates that 35 bacteria, most of which are zzso have an zzso gene zzso zzso located near the genes that zzso zzso zzso and zzso consistent with the zzso role of zzso in the zzso degradation zzso zzso comparisons indicate that the zzso zzso identified in this zzso structure will be found in all other zzso identified, suggesting that it is the signature feature of the zzso family of zzso
