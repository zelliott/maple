The zzso zzso c zzso 1 zzso genes of two zzso of each of the seven mating types of zzso zzso were zzso and found to differ by zzso zzso in zzso sequence and to be identical by putative protein zzso As this gene was highly zzso in this species, the zzso gene sequence was determined for four pairs of zzso species identical in their small zzso zzso gene zzso The following pairs of species showed from zzso to zzso divergence at the zzso level, enabling discrimination of all these zzso zzso zzso zzso strain T and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso However, because of the synonymous nature of the majority of zzso the pairs of species were identical based on the putative protein zzso
