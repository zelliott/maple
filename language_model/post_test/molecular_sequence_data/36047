We have investigated the human zzso zzso that bind to two different classes of bacterial zzso zzso with the conventional zzso type b zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses dominated by clones that use heavy chains structurally related to two zzso of zzso zzso while in a minority of subjects zzso from the zzso or zzso families are zzso In contrast, the zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso A zzso represents an unconventional zzso zzso zzso zzso is bound by a large proportion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is bound only to zzso from the zzso family, which can be zzso by at least four different zzso zzso zzso zzso binding is independent of zzso zzso zzso by flow zzso zzso is bound by zzso zzso of zzso B cells, but not to T zzso zzso In zzso stimulation with an zzso containing zzso zzso the zzso production of zzso bearing a zzso zzso Taken together, these studies characterize a zzso family restricted binding interaction that is distinct from the properties associated with conventional zzso such as zzso zzso Based on these data we propose that zzso represents a zzso for a B cell zzso
