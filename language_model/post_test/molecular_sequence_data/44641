We have isolated and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso protein shows a significant zzso to those of the other species, and especially its zzso region zzso zzso acid zzso is identical to those of the zzso By Northern zzso analysis, we found that two transcripts with about zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in various chicken zzso though only one type of the zzso transcript was reported in zzso A primer extension study demonstrated a single zzso start zzso The analysis of the zzso structure of zzso with the sequences of the two types of zzso zzso and zzso revealed that the alternative zzso generates two transcripts with different zzso regions zzso indicating a putative role of the different zzso on the stability of zzso zzso
