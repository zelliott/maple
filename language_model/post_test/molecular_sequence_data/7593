zzso levels from the zzso promoter of zzso virus type 2 zzso are zzso regulated by the zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the absence of helper zzso We have identified a zzso negative zzso element of the zzso promoter between the zzso zzso box and zzso start site by using zzso and 3' deletions of the zzso promoter fused to the zzso zzso zzso This element contains four imperfect zzso repeats similar to the zzso recognition sequences zzso in the zzso zzso terminal repeats and in the zzso preferred integration locus in zzso zzso Band shift analyses showed that human zzso cell nuclear extracts containing zzso or zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso formed zzso complexes with this zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso at position 273 in the zzso sequence to zzso abolished zzso binding to the zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso within a full-length zzso zzso which abolished zzso zzso resulted in a 40 to 50% reduction in the ability of zzso zzso to inhibit the zzso of zzso transcripts in zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso was unable to zzso this zzso zzso These results indicate that there are at least two mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of zzso transcript levels by zzso one involves zzso binding to the zzso zzso and another requires the region of zzso containing the consensus zzso zzso Furthermore, our studies of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and/or zzso elements suggest that zzso factor zzso binding to the zzso start site of zzso interferes with zzso repression of the zzso zzso
