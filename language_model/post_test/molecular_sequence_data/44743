The zzso patterns of zzso and zzso have been widely used to distinguish zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso previously called zzso and zzso zzso zzso differ clearly in sequences of many zzso zzso a conversion between the two has been reported by several laboratories, in each case showing the conversion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An apparent mobility shift of this zzso may either be due to zzso modification or processing, or to the appearance of a new zzso zzso by a second zzso In this study we observed that the four observed bands in the zzso patterns of zzso and zzso forms of zzso were correlated with four different zzso and that the four zzso zzso produced in zzso coli zzso with their natural zzso zzso chain reaction zzso experiments did not reveal hidden genes which might be responsible for conversion zzso These results strongly support the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as two closely related species zzso zzso and zzso zzso
