One of us recently described an apparently novel zzso syndrome characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a number of Saudi zzso zzso with the presumed zzso inheritance in one of the original families, we show that zzso maps to a single zzso locus on zzso in which zzso sequencing revealed a zzso zzso change in zzso zzso sequencing of this gene in four additional zzso with the same zzso revealed three additional zzso changes in zzso including two nonsense zzso zzso the zzso of all zzso overlap on the same zzso zzso further supporting the zzso mapping of zzso to zzso zzso encodes a member of a family of zzso that are known for their role in zzso zzso zzso and previous work has shown a strong expression of zzso in the developing zzso Our data suggest that zzso plays an essential role in early eye development and that zzso zzso cause a distinct eye zzso that is mainly characterized by zzso and zzso
