Early gene expression in zzso T4 is controlled primarily by the unique early zzso while zzso zzso zzso promotes degradation of many early messages contributing to the rapid shift of gene expression from the early to middle zzso The regulatory region for the genes clustered upstream of DNA zzso gene 30 of T4 was known to carry two strong early promoters and two putative zzso zzso Here, we present the comparative analysis of the regulatory events in this region of 16 zzso zzso The regulatory elements for control of this gene zzso such as zzso zzso at least one early promoter, the sequence for zzso structure, and the zzso zzso sites have been found to be zzso in the zzso zzso Also, we present experimental evidence that the initial zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso enables degradation of early zzso zzso by the major zzso coli zzso zzso zzso
