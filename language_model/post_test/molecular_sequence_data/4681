zzso editing and zzso male zzso are two important phenomena in higher plant zzso To determine whether correlations might exist between the two, zzso editing in different zzso of zzso zzso was compared employing reverse zzso and subsequent sequence zzso In zzso zzso zzso editing of transcripts of plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes was identical among fertile or zzso male sterile zzso We then established a protocol for zzso zzso isolation from plant zzso and zzso to include in these zzso Whereas zzso editing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso was similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso editing was strongly reduced in zzso of the zzso male sterile line of zzso zzso zzso transcripts of wheat and selected zzso transcripts in zzso zzso showed normal zzso editing, indicating that loss of zzso zzso editing is specific for zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso Restoration of fertility in F1 and zzso lines correlated with an increase in zzso editing of zzso zzso Our data suggest that loss of zzso zzso editing contributes to or causes zzso male zzso in zzso zzso Further analysis of the mechanism of cell zzso loss of zzso zzso editing activity may advance our understanding of the mechanism of zzso zzso
