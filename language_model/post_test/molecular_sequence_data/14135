zzso We have characterized zzso the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso Y zzso zzso in human cerebral zzso zzso zzso and several of their derivatives with well defined affinities at the known zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Moreover, we tested the ability of the new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to antagonize the zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso with high affinities at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strong, long lasting and zzso zzso of human cerebral zzso zzso with zzso affinity such as zzso or zzso either zzso a zzso contraction at high zzso or failed to induce any significant zzso zzso Also, the application of zzso or the specific zzso zzso zzso to human cerebral vessels zzso with the zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso responses identical to those obtained when these compounds were tested without prior application of zzso zzso The order of zzso potency at the human cerebrovascular zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which corresponded to that reported previously at the zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to human cerebral vessels caused a parallel and rightward shift in the zzso zzso zzso without any significant change in the zzso zzso zzso The calculated zzso was zzso zzso zzso a value compatible with the reported affinity at the zzso and human zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso receptors exclusively, mediate the zzso contraction in human cerebral arteries and we show that zzso zzso is a potent and competitive zzso of this zzso zzso
