The three zzso class II zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are in strong linkage zzso and zzso most of the genetic risk to multiple zzso zzso zzso in zzso presentation by these class II molecules would allow recognition by a single zzso of identical peptides with the different restriction zzso zzso T cell zzso and providing one explanation how a zzso zzso zzso could be linked to a zzso T zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso libraries and B cell lines expressing single zzso zzso we show that two of five in zzso and likely zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell clones use multiple zzso zzso class II molecules as restriction zzso One of these T cell clones recognizes zzso identical foreign and human peptides using all DR and zzso molecules of the multiple zzso zzso zzso A T cell signaling machinery tuned for efficient responses to weak zzso together with structural features of the zzso complex result in this zzso zzso class II zzso
