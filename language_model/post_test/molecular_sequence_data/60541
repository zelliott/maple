We examined the effects of zzso on zzso DNA zzso both in the presence and absence of 5 zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso activity to a level zzso greater than that obtained with zzso alone, and adding low levels of zzso zzso zzso to zzso containing 5 zzso zzso greatly zzso zzso Increased activity was primarily due to more efficient zzso of zzso as reflected in a lower zzso for zzso Under conditions of zzso zzso zzso had minimal effects on both the rate of initiation zzso zzso zzso and zzso The effects of zzso involve multiple metal binding sites on zzso and may involve both the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso levels of salt can inhibit zzso activity due to the presence of an zzso binding site and low levels of zzso significantly decreased this salt zzso The implications of these results with respect to the biological role of zzso are zzso
