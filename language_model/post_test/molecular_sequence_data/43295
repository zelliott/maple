In zzso mass zzso there are frequently peptides whose masses cannot be zzso These are usually attributed to either a missed zzso site during the chemical or zzso cutting process, the lack of reduction and zzso of a zzso protein modifications like the zzso of zzso or the presence of protein zzso zzso However, they could equally be due to database zzso unusual zzso events, zzso of a protein in a population, or zzso protein zzso Unfortunately the zzso of each of these possibilities can be tedious and zzso To better zzso zzso protein databases for the understanding of zzso mass zzso data, we have written the program zzso This program generates the theoretical zzso masses of any protein in the zzso database, or of any sequence specified by the zzso If the sequence is derived from the zzso database, the program takes into account any zzso for that protein in order to generate the zzso zzso In this manner, the user can obtain the predicted masses of peptides from proteins which are known to have signal zzso zzso transit zzso simple zzso zzso and zzso zzso Users are also warned if any zzso masses are subject to change from protein zzso database conflicts, or an zzso zzso zzso The program is freely accessible to the scientific community via the zzso World Wide Web server, at the zzso address: zzso
