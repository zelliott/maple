zzso zzso derive from zzso of bone zzso zzso Because zzso from patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso contain the Philadelphia zzso zzso it seemed probable that tissue zzso in zzso would originate from the zzso zzso Using powerful molecular techniques, we studied pulmonary zzso zzso zzso from two patients with zzso zzso from Patient 1, a patient in chronic phase studied before bone zzso transplantation zzso contained the Ph by Southern zzso zzso Patient 2, an accelerated phase patient, was studied after zzso zzso zzso from this patient not only contained the zzso but also expressed the zzso message documented by a new zzso junction in zzso zzso zzso This new technique allows detection of zzso zzso and determination of zzso zzso in individual zzso These data confirm the continued zzso of zzso from peripheral blood zzso in zzso settings and represent the first direct evidence that tissue zzso are derived from the zzso clone in patients with zzso
