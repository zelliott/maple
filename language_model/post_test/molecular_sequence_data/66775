zzso cycle between an inactive zzso state and an active zzso state, serving as molecular switches that coordinate cellular zzso We recently used zzso display to identify a series of peptides that bind G alpha zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jones, zzso zzso zzso zzso Watts, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2005) zzso 13, zzso Here we describe the structural features and functions of zzso a zzso that binds selectively to zzso zzso zzso and zzso states of G zzso zzso zzso blocks interaction of G zzso with its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso interferes with zzso protein binding and zzso GAP zzso A fluorescent zzso zzso was found to act as a sensor for activated G alpha in zzso The crystal structure of zzso bound to G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals binding to a zzso zzso groove between switch II and zzso zzso and, along with supporting zzso data and previous structural zzso supports the notion that this is the site of zzso interactions for G zzso zzso
