The activity of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso was measured under different culture zzso The activity was markedly increased when the zzso were incubated in a zzso salt zzso During zzso significant amounts of zzso were found in the slime layer on the surface of the zzso An increase in activity was not observed in the presence of zzso D or zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso are known to differentiate into either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, was not always observed during zzso and zzso zzso Attempts to detect zzso zzso that bind to the zzso were unsuccessful but we found that the zzso could bind to zzso zzso produced by zzso coli zzso The bacterial zzso were zzso and partially zzso They contained zzso zzso which appeared to be important for binding with the zzso It is possible that the zzso play a zzso role in the interaction with these zzso
