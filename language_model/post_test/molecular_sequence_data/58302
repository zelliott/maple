Many zzso exert their biological effect through members of the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso to the common zzso zzso we have cloned from human zzso cell zzso libraries various forms of the zzso that was recently shown to bind the obesity hormone, zzso zzso zzso long and short forms of the human zzso zzso were found to be zzso in a range of human and zzso zzso zzso and a subset of cells from these zzso bound zzso at the cell zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines revealed that the long, but not the short, form of the zzso zzso can signal proliferation and zzso zzso In cultures of zzso or human zzso cells, human zzso exhibited no capacity to stimulate cell survival or zzso but it enhanced zzso production and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that, in addition to its role in fat regulation, zzso may also be able to regulate aspects of zzso and zzso zzso
