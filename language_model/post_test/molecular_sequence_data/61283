The interaction of a zzso derived from the sequence of zzso zzso zzso with a model zzso surface has been investigated by zzso zzso zzso labeled at the zzso with zzso zzso bound to small zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso constant of 6 zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso shift in its zzso maximum and zzso consistent with zzso of the probe into the zzso zzso polar environment provided by the zzso zzso The small zzso shift of the zzso zzso permits electronic energy zzso between peptides on the zzso surface and results in zzso of the zzso zzso At high surface zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso probe was zzso lower than in corresponding samples in which electronic energy zzso was prevented by the addition of an zzso zzso The efficiency of energy transfer between zzso was not consistent with a random distribution of peptides on the zzso surface, indicating instead the zzso of zzso zzso We propose that the role of this sequence in zzso is not only to mediate binding of protein to a zzso surface, but also to stabilize the zzso complexes by zzso with other zzso zzso within zzso and with other zzso
