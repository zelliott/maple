We report here evidence of the role that the zzso of the zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso plays in naturally occurring resistance in zzso zzso A genetic and physical mapping approach was developed to isolate the zzso locus controlling the high zzso resistance to Rice yellow zzso virus zzso in the rice zzso zzso variety zzso The locus was mapped to a zzso zzso containing a gene from the zzso zzso The stable transformation of a resistant line with the zzso of this zzso derived from a susceptible zzso resulted in the loss of resistance in transgenic zzso The zzso zzso of this gene was zzso in three resistant and 17 susceptible varieties from different cultivated rice species or zzso Compared with susceptible zzso resistant varieties present specific zzso characterized by either zzso acid zzso or short zzso deletions in the middle domain of the zzso The structure of this domain was zzso and showed that the zzso were clustered on a small surface zzso This suggests that this domain may be involved in an interaction with the zzso
