B cell zzso descending from zzso center cells harbor the hallmark of zzso diversity resulting from ongoing zzso in the variable parts of their zzso zzso To characterize a primary zzso zzso center B cell zzso in more detail, we analyzed the respective zzso and zzso genes in single cells mobilized from four sequential zzso three taken from the skin and one obtained after internal dissemination from a zzso zzso The zzso cells were found to contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso detected on both the zzso and the zzso zzso To provide an accurate zzso analysis, the specific zzso gene counterpart zzso was cloned from the patient's zzso zzso 226 single cells, we zzso zzso complete zzso identity when zzso and zzso genes of zzso cells from one particular biopsy were compared among each zzso zzso zzso diversity due to ongoing zzso comparing the sequences obtained from sequential zzso zzso both zzso and zzso genes to be highly zzso zzso from the sequence data, we propose a scenario of the zzso evolution of the B cell tumor in this zzso From the zzso point of view, this primary zzso zzso center B cell zzso shows the features of a zzso center cell zzso To draw this conclusion from single cell zzso data, however, a sample of sequential zzso had to be zzso
