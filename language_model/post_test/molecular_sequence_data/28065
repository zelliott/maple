We have characterized the structure and expression of zzso zzso zzso the fast and slow skeletal muscle zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso clones were isolated from mouse and rat muscle zzso clone libraries and were used as zzso zzso in Northern zzso and in zzso zzso zzso These studies showed that the zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in skeletal muscle, but not cardiac muscle or other zzso and that they are zzso expressed in individual muscle zzso zzso typing on the basis of in zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso content showed an excellent correlation with fiber type as assessed by zzso zzso zzso These results directly demonstrate that the differential expression of skeletal muscle zzso zzso in the various classes of zzso zzso muscle cells is based on gene regulatory mechanisms which control the zzso of specific zzso zzso in individual muscle zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso are zzso at comparable levels, in differentiated cultures of rat zzso and mouse C2 muscle cell zzso Thus, although zzso input has been shown to be an important factor in determining fast versus slow zzso expression in skeletal muscle, both zzso and zzso genes can be expressed in muscle cells in the absence of zzso zzso of the deduced zzso zzso zzso acid sequences with previously determined rabbit protein sequences showed that zzso with potential zzso zzso function are present in several discrete zzso two of which are located near previously identified zzso and zzso C binding zzso
