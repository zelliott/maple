The zzso promoter region of zzso a gene that codes for a protein that regulates the transport of zzso zzso contains two zzso responsive elements zzso therefore, we studied the expression and function of zzso at different oxygen zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured in either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso were depressed in hypoxic conditions, as were levels of zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso was involved in the zzso response, zzso zzso cells were exposed to varying oxygen conditions and zzso expression was zzso zzso of zzso resulted in low levels of expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso explored the binding of zzso to zzso zzso and showed that zzso is able to bind to the zzso of zzso more avidly in zzso than in zzso Furthermore, functional studies of zzso activity using zzso reporter zzso of zzso and zzso zzso showed that only zzso binds zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in growth plate and zzso cartilage was low in hypoxic regions of the zzso and higher levels of zzso expression were observed in the zzso and zzso in regions that have a normally higher oxygen zzso The data suggest that zzso expression and function in zzso and in zzso are zzso in hypoxic environments and that the effect is regulated by zzso
