zzso of the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso are constructed by replacement of the two zzso zzso in each zzso in order to assess the effects on equilibrium and kinetic zzso properties of the folding zzso The three kinetic zzso detected by intrinsic zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso are also observed in folding of both zzso 19 to zzso and zzso 99 to zzso single zzso demonstrating that these zzso zzso to global rather than local zzso zzso zzso of equilibrium zzso zzso zzso Mann, zzso & Matthews, zzso 1993, zzso zzso 2, zzso and circular zzso transition zzso induced by zzso shows that replacement of either zzso 19 or zzso 99 results in zzso zzso Unlike the zzso protein zzso zzso & Matthews, zzso 1990, zzso 29, zzso zzso and/or zzso structures are disrupted at lower zzso concentration than is secondary zzso The equilibrium results can be interpreted in terms of enhancement in the population of a zzso folding intermediate in which the lone zzso zzso is highly exposed to zzso but in which substantial secondary structure is zzso The location of both zzso at the interface between the two zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1987, Nature zzso zzso provides a simple explanation for this zzso
