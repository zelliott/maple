Using a synthetic 66 zzso zzso template containing a stable hairpin structure derived from the zzso zzso six zzso zzso zzso products are found during DNA synthesis zzso by zzso zzso These major zzso zzso sites correlate well with the pause sites seen during primer zzso zzso zzso & Johnson, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso submitted for zzso Thus, the zzso H and zzso activities of zzso are coupled as zzso reads through the zzso secondary zzso The distance between the two active sites of zzso zzso is zzso base pairs of zzso zzso when the next template base is not zzso The zzso region was enlarged by 2-3 base pairs once zzso encounters the template zzso A model for this change is zzso At the pause sites, the burst zzso of zzso zzso are larger than the corresponding reaction zzso of next zzso incorporation at the zzso zzso zzso of the steady state rates of zzso zzso confirms that all zzso zzso slowly from zzso These results suggest that while zzso are bound zzso at the zzso site, they are still bound zzso at the zzso H active site of zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso H activity is not critical for zzso to read through the zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso does not increase the zzso of zzso zzso but zzso DNA zzso by blocking the binding of zzso to DNA zzso
