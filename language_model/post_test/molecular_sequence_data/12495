In common with all zzso the human zzso virus type 1 zzso contains duplicated long terminal repeat zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso These zzso contain identical zzso signals, which are both transcribed into zzso zzso to allow efficient viral zzso a mechanism must exist to either restrict zzso zzso site use or enhance the activity of the zzso zzso zzso We have examined the use of both zzso sites using zzso zzso zzso of the previously defined upstream zzso sequences of the 3' zzso zzso site decreases the efficiency of zzso when placed in competition with an efficient downstream processing zzso However, in the absence of competition, these zzso have no effect on zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso site is zzso whereas a zzso zzso site positioned in its place is zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso initiating from the 3' zzso promoter zzso the 3' zzso zzso signal zzso zzso the main zzso of the differential zzso site use appears to be neither proximity to a promoter element in the zzso zzso nor the presence of upstream zzso sequences at the 3' zzso Instead, we show that the major zzso donor site that is immediately downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso The fact that this zzso site is active in a zzso clone when the major zzso donor site is zzso suggests that the selective use of zzso signals in zzso is zzso by a direct zzso of the zzso zzso site by downstream zzso events or factors involved in zzso
