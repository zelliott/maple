The molecular zzso of zzso and other repeated sequences in the human zzso provides clues to events during zzso zzso A zzso of human zzso has been previously identified as zzso insertions within members of the medium zzso frequency zzso class of repeats, reflecting the complicated sequence of zzso and radiation events leading to the current human zzso zzso One zzso zzso is located within a previously unidentified zzso family member, in the first zzso of the human T4 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a frequency of approximately zzso in Europeans and Africans and is zzso in 20 Asian zzso zzso chain reaction amplification, direct DNA sequencing, and Southern analysis using zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso was derived from the zzso zzso by loss of part of the inserted zzso zzso with a tightly linked marker within the human zzso and studies of zzso DNA samples revealed that the original zzso was a relatively early event in zzso evolution, but that the zzso sequence loss leading to the zzso has occurred much more zzso Loss of zzso insertions therefore represents one mechanism for the generation of human zzso zzso
