zzso texture in barley is an important quality character as zzso zzso have better zzso zzso In zzso texture is considered to be determined by the zzso a group of basic zzso proteins present on the surface of the starch zzso Hard zzso have been proposed to lack zzso a or to have zzso forms of zzso b which do not bind to the zzso zzso Analysis of six barley zzso (three zzso and three zzso showed that all contained proteins zzso to wheat zzso zzso but zzso analysis failed to show any differences in zzso acid sequences similar to those which have been proposed to determine textural differences in zzso Southern zzso analysis showed two zzso b genes which were isolated and shown to zzso proteins with zzso sequence zzso zzso of zzso b zzso occurred in the starchy zzso and zzso layer of the developing seed, but not in the zzso Analysis of seven soft- and six zzso barley varieties showed that all contained zzso a except two hard varieties zzso zzso which were subsequently shown to both lack zzso a zzso It was therefore concluded that there is not a clear relationship between the presence of zzso a and grain texture in zzso
