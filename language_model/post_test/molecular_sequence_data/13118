To understand the relationship between zinc and zzso zzso zzso in inducing colon cancer zzso in human and zzso 

Human zzso tumor and normal cells were obtained from Departments of Surgery and zzso at the Kaiser zzso Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA and US VA Medical Center, North Hills, zzso zzso zzso tumor and normal cells were isolated from the rats that received two injections of 50 zzso of zzso zzso in 2 weeks and then kept 30 weeks in the animal zzso Then, the effects of zinc on the zzso synthesis and zzso on zinc metabolism in tumor and normal cells were zzso 

zzso zzso in both human and zzso rat zzso tumor cells increased compared to those in adjacent normal zzso whereas zzso alpha zzso did not zzso Gene expression of zzso form of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in rat zzso by zzso growth factor and by zzso zzso zzso (a tumor promoter and zzso only in the presence of zzso zzso binding activity of rat zzso was maximum at 15 zzso of zinc zzso plasma zinc zzso but zzso synthesis activity increased for the first 15 minutes when zzso zinc zzso were either higher or lower than the normal zzso zinc zzso However, variations in zzso zinc zzso did not change the rate of zzso alpha synthesis in the normal rat zzso zzso significantly increased zinc zzso rates of zzso tumor cells but zzso alpha showed only moderate zzso 

These results suggest that zinc is required for zzso gene zzso that maintaining an optimal zinc zzso is important for normal PG synthesis of zzso cells, and that only zzso synthesis mechanisms rather than zzso gene expression are altered in zzso tumor cells resulting in the abnormal zinc zzso of these zzso
