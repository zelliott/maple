zzso molecules regulate zzso trafficking in many different zzso and zzso transport pathways in zzso zzso In zzso zzso has been proposed to play a crucial role in regulating synaptic zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in synaptic transmission, we isolated and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar to the mouse zzso zzso these zzso survived and exhibited only mild behavioral zzso In contrast to the mouse zzso synaptic transmission was zzso in these zzso zzso zzso recordings revealed that synaptic transmission in the zzso nervous system was zzso Furthermore, zzso animals were resistant to the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso transmission was generally zzso zzso synaptic zzso populations were redistributed in zzso zzso In motor zzso zzso populations at zzso were depleted to zzso of normal levels, whereas in zzso regions of the zzso zzso populations were zzso On the basis of the zzso defects at zzso zzso we zzso that zzso may regulate recruitment of zzso to the active zone or zzso of zzso near release zzso
