Venezuelan zzso encephalitis virus zzso is one of the most zzso members of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of this virus depends strongly on the sequences of the structural proteins and on the zzso in the zzso promoter zzso by the zzso untranslated region zzso of the viral zzso In this study, we performed a detailed investigation of the structural and functional elements of the zzso promoter and analyzed the effect of multiple zzso introduced into the zzso zzso on virus and zzso zzso The results of this study demonstrate that zzso replication is determined by two zzso functioning zzso zzso One of them is a very zzso zzso zzso which is not involved in the stable zzso secondary structure, and the second is a short, zzso zzso zzso An increase or decrease in the zzso stability has deleterious effects on virus and zzso zzso In response to zzso in these zzso zzso zzso zzso machinery was capable of developing new, zzso sequences in the zzso either containing zzso zzso or zzso repeats or leading to the formation of new, zzso zzso Analysis of the numerous zzso zzso suggested that at least two different mechanisms are involved in their zzso Some of the modifications introduced into the zzso zzso of the viral zzso led to an zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso which suggested to us that there is a direct involvement of these proteins in promoter zzso Furthermore, our data provide new evidence that the 3' zzso of the zzso viral zzso in the zzso zzso zzso intermediate is represented by a zzso zzso Both the overall folding and the sequence determine its efficient function as a promoter for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
