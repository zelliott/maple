Three types of zzso zzso zzso which converts a protein zzso zzso to a zzso zzso are widely distributed in animal zzso Little is known about zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso activity in human zzso leukemia zzso cells was induced with the zzso agents zzso acid and zzso zzso and with the zzso agent zzso zzso We cloned and characterized a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso base pairs long and zzso a zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso had zzso zzso acid sequence identities with the three known zzso and zzso identity with the recently cloned zzso zzso The zzso zzso differs in kinetic properties from the known zzso zzso and Northern zzso with an zzso against the zzso and the zzso respectively, showed that a protein of approximately 67 zzso increased zzso with increase of zzso of approximately zzso zzso during zzso zzso During zzso differentiation the same zzso and protein increased as in zzso zzso Neither the zzso activity nor the protein was found in zzso zzso These results suggested that expression of the zzso gene is tightly linked to zzso zzso
