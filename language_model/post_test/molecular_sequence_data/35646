zzso highly selective for two functionally distinct regions of diphtheria toxin zzso were prepared using synthetic zzso zzso as zzso Three peptides were selected for zzso sequence zzso on zzso A, which contains the putative protein zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso B, selected on the basis of forming a predicted surface zzso and zzso on zzso B, forming a part of the region containing the putative zzso binding zzso All of the zzso zzso recognized the corresponding zzso and also reacted with the zzso specifically with the zzso containing the sequence against which they were raised, confirming the utility of this approach in generating zzso zzso The zzso zzso with the highest binding zzso both to the zzso and to the native toxin was the one prepared against the sequence with the highest surface and loop likelihood zzso of the three peptides zzso The similarity of the zzso profiles with zzso and native and zzso toxin is consistent with the prediction that the region selected occurs in a surface loop and that the structure of the zzso is similar to the zzso of this region in the native zzso The zzso for two of the zzso zzso were zzso The results indicated that even though the zzso were raised to peptides containing 14 zzso acids zzso they were directed predominantly against a narrow region within the zzso consisting of only 5-6 zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
