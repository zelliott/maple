Renal synthesis of a zzso zzso to zzso zzso factor zzso has been zzso The aim of the present study was to determine if zzso of the zzso gene occurs in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was extracted from whole zzso and, zzso from the zzso and outer and inner zzso of rat zzso zzso with rat zzso did not reveal a zzso message in Northern zzso analysis, even when large quantities of zzso were used at low stringency zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso followed by 35 cycles of zzso chain reaction zzso was used to search for the zzso message for zzso Two zzso zzso encompassing the 450 base pairs zzso of the coding region of the gene were zzso Each cycle consisted of zzso at 56 degrees C, extension at 72 degrees C, and zzso at 94 degrees zzso The zzso product was proven to be identical to the zzso gene by high stringency zzso which revealed the expected zzso hybrid zzso Furthermore, the sequence of this product was identical to that of the coding region of the zzso zzso We used an zzso zzso to obtain this band as a single reaction zzso We conclude that the transcript of the zzso gene exists in the zzso at extremely low zzso The low abundance of the zzso message raises major concerns about its zzso zzso zzso evidence for the translation of this transcript, and its zzso and zzso is still required to determine its zzso
