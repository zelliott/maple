Heat shock protein zzso 72 is a ubiquitous protein that is rapidly induced in response to stress and is thought to constitute an zzso protective zzso Previously, work has focused on the effect of zzso of zzso 72 in various cell zzso We were interested in testing the hypothesis that blocking the increase in zzso 72 that occurs in response to zzso or zzso would be zzso thus showing that the zzso response in cells, particularly cardiac cells, is an important line of defense against cell zzso 

zzso adult zzso zzso were treated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 72 and then exposed to mild (8 zzso or severe (12 zzso zzso With mild zzso an increase in zzso release, a decrease in zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso ratios were seen in zzso cells compared with control cells and cells treated with the complementary sense sequence or with AS to major zzso complex zzso AS treatment converted mild hypoxic injury to a pattern of cell injury seen with severe zzso After severe zzso all treatment groups showed an increase in zzso a decrease in zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso cells had the greatest increase in cell zzso AS treatment produced a zzso decrease in zzso 72 levels after zzso compared with control cells treated with zzso A zzso study showed zzso of the increase in zzso 72 with as little as 5 zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso an increase in zzso 72 with AS increases the zzso of adult cardiac zzso to hypoxic zzso zzso zzso 72 is an important part of the normal cell response to stress and is important in protecting cardiac zzso from zzso and zzso
