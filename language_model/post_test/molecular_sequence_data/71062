zzso of genes expressed from the zzso zzso promoter is very rapid and zzso at low zzso zzso We describe here two zzso that interfere with the expression of genes cloned under zzso zzso Both zzso map to the zzso promoter and stimulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso the same zzso One zzso is a large deletion that creates a more efficient zzso region zzso changed to zzso whereas the other affects the initiation site zzso changed to zzso The zzso gene is expressed at extremely low levels in zzso growing zzso cells and is not induced by zzso zzso of zzso has no zzso effect on cell zzso Thus, zzso appears to be zzso under usual laboratory growth zzso The zzso gene encodes a membrane protein with 12 putative zzso zzso zzso belongs to the largest family of bacterial secondary active zzso the major zzso zzso which includes zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is strongly decreased in zzso strains zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this zzso very high zzso zzso can compensate for the negative effect of zzso zzso zzso Our studies zzso indicate that zzso when zzso zzso contributes to the control of the zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate a new way to zzso the zzso of induction of cloned zzso
