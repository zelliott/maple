The zzso of genetic zzso between isolated populations is thought to lead to the evolution of intrinsic zzso zzso The molecular basis for these mechanisms, however, remains poorly zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso provides unique opportunities for addressing zzso questions regarding the early stages of zzso hybrids between highly divergent populations are fertile and viable, but exhibit reduced fitness at the zzso or later zzso Given the current zzso of zzso information in zzso at zzso stages of zzso isolation, we zzso zzso zzso zzso to characterize a substantial fraction of zzso regions (the zzso of zzso zzso Our sequencing effort was divided equally between two divergent populations in order to estimate levels of divergence and to reveal patterns of selection across the zzso Assembly of sequences generated over 40,000 zzso unique transcripts zzso for each population, zzso of which were zzso between zzso zzso searches of public databases determined protein identity and functional features for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on rates of zzso and synonymous zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with at least zzso zzso we identified 229 potential targets of positive zzso Many of these genes are predicted to be involved in several zzso zzso and to function in zzso zzso and binding zzso The library of zzso zzso coding regions, zzso with their predicted functions and level of zzso will serve as an invaluable resource for zzso molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of zzso
