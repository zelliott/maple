zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso are two classes of small zzso regulatory zzso which have been much investigated in recent zzso While their respective functions in the cell are zzso they share interesting zzso similarities, and recent sequencing projects have identified processed forms of zzso that resemble zzso Here, we investigate a possible evolutionary relationship between zzso and box zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso locations of reported zzso and zzso reveals an overlap of specific members of these zzso To test the hypothesis that some zzso might have evolved from zzso zzso zzso regions, reported zzso regions were scanned for the presence of box zzso zzso zzso Twenty zzso precursors show significant similarity to zzso zzso as predicted by zzso These include molecules predicted to target known zzso zzso zzso sites in zzso for which no guide zzso has yet been zzso The predicted folded structures of these zzso zzso zzso zzso precursors reveal molecules which resemble the structures of known box zzso zzso The zzso regions surrounding these predicted zzso zzso are often similar to regions around zzso zzso including the presence of zzso zzso target site zzso and zzso zzso zzso We further show that the precursors of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to zzso a specific protein component of functional box zzso small zzso zzso complexes suggesting that these molecules have retained some zzso zzso zzso The detection of small zzso molecules that share features of zzso and zzso suggest that these classes of zzso may have an evolutionary zzso
