More than 10 genes are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso which anchors many zzso cell surface proteins to the zzso zzso nocturnal zzso zzso is caused by a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso gene within the zzso stem zzso The zzso gene zzso has been found to be zzso in all patients with zzso This is probably because all other zzso synthesis genes are zzso hence two zzso zzso must occur to cause zzso whereas one zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso zzso with this notion, three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Here we isolated a zzso clone of another zzso zzso zzso and mapped it to zzso zzso further supporting this zzso zzso is an zzso zzso We found an zzso zzso of zzso zzso and mapped it to zzso zzso The presence of a processed zzso is a common feature of zzso zzso and zzso
