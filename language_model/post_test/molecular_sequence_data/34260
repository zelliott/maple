The zzso Delta zzso zzso zzso which is well adapted to the environment of the human cell, is an excellent candidate for the future development of zzso zzso On top of this, a new generation of zzso zzso now exists that benefits from the addition of a specific zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso which greatly increases both the zzso specificity and its zzso zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso the designing of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso given zzso species has never been the object of a systematic zzso study, even with their recent use for the gene zzso of various zzso This report aims at both improving and clarifying the design process of zzso zzso Both the zzso and the targeted zzso zzso were analyzed in order to provide new criteria that are useful in the selection of the most potent zzso zzso The crucial features present in both the zzso zzso and blocker, as well as at the target site, were identified and zzso zzso rules were derived and tested using zzso C virus zzso zzso as a model zzso Overall, this method should promote the use of the zzso zzso in a plethora of applications in both functional zzso and gene zzso
