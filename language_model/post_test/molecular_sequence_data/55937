The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have shown to inhibit human zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso a competitive inhibitor of the zzso partially protected the zzso from zzso To identify the zzso modified by zzso and zzso the zzso sequence of zzso fragments of modified zzso were analyzed zzso A comparison of the determined zzso sequences with the predicted primary structure of zzso revealed that zzso within the zzso zzso was zzso In consequence, the role of zzso in zzso activity was investigated by zzso zzso zzso was replaced by a zzso zzso acid or zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells, and the resulting proteins were zzso to apparent zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited specific activity of zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were found to be inactive zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that the polarity and/or length of the side chain of zzso zzso are important for the zzso zzso
