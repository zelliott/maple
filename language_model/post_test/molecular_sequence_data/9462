Proper disease control is very important to minimize yield losses caused by zzso in many zzso Today, zzso control is partially achieved by breeding for resistance, but mainly by application of zzso mode of action zzso including the zzso acid zzso zzso Despite having mostly specific targets, zzso activity can differ even in species belonging to the same zzso but the underlying mechanisms are often poorly zzso In an attempt to zzso the zzso basis and underlying molecular mechanism of sensitivity and tolerance to zzso the cellulose zzso 3 zzso gene was isolated and zzso zzso the target site of this zzso zzso The zzso gene was present in all 25 species included in this study representing the orders zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and based on zzso zzso enabled good resolution of all the different zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that only species belonging to the zzso were inhibited by the zzso zzso data provided evidence, that the observed difference in sensitivity to zzso between zzso and zzso tolerant species is most likely caused by an inherent zzso acid zzso at position zzso in zzso possibly affecting zzso zzso The present study not only succeeded in linking zzso sensitivity of various zzso to the inherent zzso target site zzso but could also relate it to the broader zzso zzso
