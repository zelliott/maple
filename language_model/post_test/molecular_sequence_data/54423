zzso is the scaffold zzso of the zzso complex, whose binding zzso for zzso and zzso protein zzso are thought to enhance formation of activated zzso complexes competent to recruit zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso region zzso in the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso can functionally substitute for the zzso segment to rescue the function of an zzso zzso impaired for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association in cell extracts suggests that zzso the zzso domain, and two zzso elements zzso and zzso between these segments have overlapping functions in forming native zzso zzso In zzso experiments confirm the role of zzso in stabilizing zzso association, and further indicate that zzso and zzso promote zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso association is only one of several interactions that stabilize zzso complexes, and emphasize that zzso zzso formation via zzso interaction is zzso in zzso Interestingly, two other zzso regions in zzso have critical functions downstream of zzso zzso
