The zzso Y zzso has unique characteristics compared with the zzso or X zzso Here we report the finished sequence of the zzso Y zzso zzso including zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region 1 and zzso zzso of the zzso region of the Y zzso Greater sequence divergence between the human Y zzso zzso and zzso zzso than between their respective whole zzso zzso confirmed the accelerated evolutionary rate of the Y zzso Each of the 19 zzso zzso genes analyzed had at least one zzso zzso and 11 genes had higher zzso substitution rates than synonymous ones, suggesting relaxation of selective zzso positive selection or zzso We also identified zzso changes, including deletion of a zzso zzso from the zzso region of zzso expansion of young zzso families in zzso and zzso of young zzso elements and long terminal repeat zzso in zzso Reconstruction of the common ancestral Y zzso reflects the dynamic changes in our zzso in the 5-6 million years since zzso
