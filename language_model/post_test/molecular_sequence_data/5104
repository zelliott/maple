By using a cloning method termed the signal sequence trap as well as by searching for zzso zzso sequences in the database of expressed sequence zzso zzso fragments potentially zzso novel zzso zzso were initially zzso Using these zzso we have cloned five novel human zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are zzso expressed especially in some zzso zzso with individually unique expression zzso The zzso proteins are all found to be selectively zzso for zzso but not for zzso or zzso Each zzso appears to interact with a class of receptors on zzso that is not shared by any other zzso so far zzso Furthermore, we have identified zzso as the specific zzso for zzso zzso as that for zzso zzso and zzso as that for zzso zzso Only the gene for zzso is mapped to the traditional zzso zzso gene cluster at zzso zzso whereas those for zzso zzso zzso and zzso are localized at different zzso zzso these five zzso zzso may constitute a new category of zzso zzso that are involved in trafficking and zzso of particular zzso of zzso in particular zzso tissue zzso
