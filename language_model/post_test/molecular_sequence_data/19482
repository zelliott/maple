Small insertions and deletions zzso and single zzso zzso zzso are common genetic zzso that are thought to be associated with a wide variety of human zzso zzso to the zzso size and complexity, manually characterizing each one of these variations in an individual is not zzso While significant progress has been made in automated zzso zzso discovery from the sequences of zzso zzso products, automated and reliable detection of zzso continues to pose difficult zzso In this paper, we present zzso an zzso and software zzso designed to provide de zzso zzso zzso detection and improved zzso identification in the context of zzso medical zzso Tests on a human zzso zzso sequence data set, consisting of zzso traces from 13 zzso indicate that zzso identified approximately zzso of the 151 consensus zzso sites and approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso previously identified by manual zzso Tests on zzso data show that zzso better identifies zzso low-level zzso as compared with other zzso detection zzso Moreover, zzso identification improves when reprocessing the results of other zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a useful role in the post human zzso project research zzso
