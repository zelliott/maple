zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso factor of zzso zzso During zzso growth, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which play roles in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report here the first zzso and zzso regulatory elements for zzso zzso These elements were identified in a genetic screen for spontaneous zzso that caused colonies of strain zzso to change from a zzso to an opaque zzso Six of the seven opaque colonies recovered zzso approximately 3 zzso zzso were impaired for zzso function or zzso Two zzso changed zzso acids in zzso likely required for zzso or zzso zzso One zzso defined a zzso adjacent direct repeat required for optimal zzso zzso The other three spontaneous zzso created the same zzso near the start of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso The zzso protein contains zzso CBS and zzso zzso implicated in binding DNA, zzso compounds, and zzso compounds respectively, and suggest that zzso positively regulates zzso zzso in response to energy and zzso zzso zzso analyses unexpectedly demonstrated that zzso also positively regulates the zzso zzso zzso which, like zzso has been implicated in zzso Finally, zzso is required for full zzso in a zzso model of zzso
