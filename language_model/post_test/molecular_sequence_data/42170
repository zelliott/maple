Acute or chronic exposure to cadmium zzso causes severe organ damages with the zzso of zzso zzso in particular occurring in the acute zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso is produced by various types of cells in response to a wide variety of inflammatory zzso The administration of an zzso against zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso zzso in several animal models, indicating a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in this study we investigated whether zzso induced zzso production in human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso over a wide range of zzso did induce human zzso to produce large amounts of zzso zzso the zzso induction being observed at zzso zzso The production was inhibited specifically by a metal zzso agent, zzso acid zzso Steady level of zzso zzso increased within 30 zzso after the addition of zzso and reached a zzso level at 2 zzso decreasing zzso A protein synthesis zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso indicating that new protein synthesis was not required for zzso zzso zzso zzso with the induction of zzso within 10 zzso zzso generated zzso oxygen zzso zzso in human zzso A radical scavenger, zzso zzso inhibited both zzso production and the generation of zzso zzso the possible involvement of zzso in zzso zzso This notion was also supported by our findings that a zzso generating agent, zzso induced zzso production in human zzso and that zzso blocked this zzso zzso zzso
