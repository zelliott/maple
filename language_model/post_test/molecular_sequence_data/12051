A zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizing an zzso in the V gamma zzso gamma zzso gamma 4 chain of the zzso T cell zzso has been zzso Using this zzso we have zzso the occurrence of V gamma zzso zzso T cells in the developing zzso and in the zzso zzso and several zzso of adult zzso The V gamma zzso cells constitute a minor zzso T cell zzso during fetal and early zzso life, but they constitute a major population of zzso T cells in the zzso and in the peripheral zzso zzso in adult zzso In addition, we found that V gamma zzso cells comprise a large proportion zzso of the zzso T cells present in the zzso zzso zzso in all strains of mice zzso V gamma zzso zzso are present in zzso zzso mice and in zzso mice, demonstrating that they can develop zzso and that their presence in the zzso zzso is independent of the zzso load of the zzso Our results show that V gamma zzso zzso account for the largest population of zzso T cells in the zzso This population includes a zzso component that homes to the secondary zzso zzso and a zzso component that constitutes a major fraction of the zzso zzso
