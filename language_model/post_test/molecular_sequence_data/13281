A number of zzso plasmids for expression of artificial genes zzso human zzso colony stimulating factor zzso were zzso A hybrid gene was obtained that contains a sequence zzso the leader zzso and a tandem of two zzso zzso of protein A from zzso zzso zzso through an zzso zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso The construction enables zzso coli to carry out zzso of the hybrid protein and its subsequent transport into the zzso space of zzso Another hybrid zzso combining sequences for the signal zzso of the zzso outer membrane protein zzso and zzso was obtained using zzso chain zzso The zzso of the mature protein produced by the hybrid gene was found to depend on the strength of the promoter zzso
