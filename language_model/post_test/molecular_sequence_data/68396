zzso oxide zzso produced from zzso by NO zzso zzso is a zzso known to be involved in diverse biological zzso including zzso zzso and blood vessel zzso We describe a novel role of NO as a signaling zzso in zzso gene zzso We demonstrate that induction of zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines activates zzso binding by iron regulatory factor zzso the central trans regulator of zzso involved in cellular iron zzso zzso binding of zzso to zzso elements zzso specifically zzso the translation of zzso zzso indicator zzso as well as the zzso of the cellular iron storage protein zzso These findings define a new biological function of NO and identify a regulatory connection between the zzso zzso and cellular iron zzso
