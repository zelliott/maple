A zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso with zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso tidal flat of the zzso coast in South zzso zzso were zzso zzso rods showing zzso and zzso zzso Growth of strain zzso was observed between 15 and 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso and between pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the sole zzso zzso and summed feature 8 zzso and/or zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the major zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and an unidentified zzso as polar zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso formed a zzso lineage with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso between strain zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso was zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and molecular properties, strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
