zzso binding zzso or zzso are engendered with the ability to bind specific zzso structures, thereby zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are distinct from zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as they do not carry out zzso or zzso zzso zzso and they are of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have become prominent in recent years due to their unique zzso traits, such as exhibiting novel protein folds and unusually high zzso zzso and ability to zzso inhibit zzso entry through high affinity zzso interactions with the zzso envelope zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains two high affinity zzso binding sites, is one such zzso Here we used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to show that one of the two zzso binding sites of zzso can catalyze the zzso of zzso fragments (such as zzso to zzso to determine the mode of zzso binding to and zzso of zzso to identify zzso as the primary zzso zzso involved in this zzso and to solve the solution structure of an inactive zzso of zzso in complex with this unexpected zzso These studies represent the first demonstration of dual zzso activity and zzso recognition for discrete zzso at the same zzso site in a zzso zzso comparisons between the zzso and zzso of zzso together with the sequences of new zzso zzso identified through zzso provide insight into the evolving roles of zzso zzso
