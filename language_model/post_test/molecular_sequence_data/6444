zzso efforts have led to the development of methods for stringent zzso of adult zzso zzso cells zzso particularly from peripheral blood zzso The zzso procedure previously reported by our group zzso zzso provided a high zzso frequency, but yielded a low zzso recovery zzso or zzso zzso We therefore developed an improved zzso methodology based on zzso negative zzso selection zzso zzso by addition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the previously zzso panel of zzso This simplified procedure consistently allows not only high level zzso but also abundant recovery of early zzso the final Step zzso cell population zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso donors, mean zzso features an zzso zzso frequency and a recovery of zzso of the initial zzso The zzso zzso bear the primitive zzso zzso zzso they are consistently zzso largely zzso and in part zzso In zzso zzso culture, the zzso zzso zzso give rise to zzso colonies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size zzso This zzso methodology compares favorably with previously reported procedures in terms of combined zzso frequency and zzso availability of a large number of highly zzso early zzso will provide an experimental tool for analysis of the zzso basis of early zzso We have investigated by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso the zzso expression of zzso B zzso cluster genes in zzso zzso induced in liquid suspension culture to gradual zzso or zzso zzso zzso differentiation and maturation by differential growth factor zzso zzso Only B3 is expressed in zzso zzso After zzso treatment B3 expression is enhanced in the initial 24 h and then through zzso and zzso differentiation and zzso zzso and B5 are induced at slightly later times and expressed through maturation in both zzso while B6 is selectively induced in zzso zzso B2 is zzso expressed at low level in the zzso pathway, while it is detected only in advanced stages of zzso zzso B8 and zzso are essentially not zzso zzso studies were performed with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso a striking blockade of both zzso and zzso colony formation, 2) zzso selectively and markedly zzso zzso colony formation, 3) zzso and zzso cause a zzso less pronounced decrease of both colony types and finally, 4) zzso and zzso zzso exert little and no effect zzso
