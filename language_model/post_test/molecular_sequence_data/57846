A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso library constructed using liver zzso of zzso zzso adult males treated with zzso The probe used to screen the library was a zzso DNA zzso obtained by means of the zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso clone encodes a putative protein of 62 zzso zzso of which 20 are zzso zzso The position of all the zzso zzso is zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this zzso zzso zzso designated zzso shares between zzso and zzso identity with various zzso zzso Overall, the structure of zzso is no similar in sequence to zzso than it is to zzso zzso of various zzso Ten different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were partially zzso and turned out to be zzso suggesting a single species of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso DNA reveals that the zzso gene is present in at least two zzso This result is consistent with the suggestion that a zzso zzso occurred in a zzso zzso zzso The in zzso response to increasing doses of zzso zzso and zzso metal zzso was zzso In the liver, all three metals proved to be potent zzso raising zzso zzso levels between 50- and zzso The maximum response to zzso was at 12 zzso after injection and to zzso at 24 zzso after zzso High levels of zzso were maintained for more than 48 zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso in all zzso examined zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso synthesis in the zzso
