zzso a zzso zzso protein of Mr 37 zzso is zzso expressed in human zzso A synthetic zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acid zzso 20 through 44 of the native zzso zzso has been shown to mimic the zzso activity of the native zzso An analog of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in which the zzso zzso at positions 26 and 42 were replaced with zzso zzso zzso zzso This resulted in a zzso that no longer exhibited zzso zzso The effect of different zzso of the active zzso zzso zzso zzso and its inactive zzso zzso zzso on artificial zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso was studied using zzso X-ray scattering and differential scanning zzso The results indicated that zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso structure as shown by small angle X-ray zzso while the effect of the inactive zzso is not as zzso zzso scanning zzso further confirms that zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso as indicated by increased zzso of the transition and decreased peak zzso Moreover, it completely zzso the zzso temperature of the zzso zzso The effect of the inactive zzso zzso zzso on the zzso properties of zzso was zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso the zzso structure of zzso zzso and further suggests that the zzso action of the zzso may be through its interactions with the zzso components of the Gram negative bacterial zzso
