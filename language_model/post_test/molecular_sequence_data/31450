Two strains of zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from root zzso of the South African zzso zzso zzso and zzso on this zzso Based on zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso belonged to the zzso zzso with the highest degree of sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso genes zzso and zzso were zzso since zzso zzso gene sequences are highly similar between closely related species of the zzso zzso The results obtained for both zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest degree of sequence similarity of the novel strains towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data, including fatty acid profiles and respiratory zzso data supported the assignment of strains zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of strains zzso and zzso from the most closely related species of the zzso zzso with zzso published zzso We zzso therefore, that these strains represent a novel species for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
