zzso zzso zzso was found to produce a zzso zzso zzso active against zzso A gene was isolated zzso a specific zzso that zzso to this size and belongs to zzso zzso family zzso A zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso activity was obtained when the cloned zzso gene was reintroduced into zzso zzso zzso by use of zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso gene was also expressed upon introduction of the zzso construct zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso although zzso activity was 8- to zzso lower than that in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso showed a zzso of zzso zzso per zzso and a zzso of 338 zzso of zzso zzso per zzso per zzso of protein with barley zzso as the zzso The zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the ability of this zzso to zzso starch by degrading structural zzso present in zzso cell zzso
