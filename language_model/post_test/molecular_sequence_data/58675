zzso proteins comprise a family of zzso factors that are required for appropriate development of zzso zzso In order to understand the zzso regulation of zzso zzso we have cloned the human zzso gene and identified and characterized its zzso zzso with the zzso zzso promoter demonstrates highly zzso zzso box zzso which are essential for appropriate zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso the human zzso gene lacks zzso binding motifs within the first 800 zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the human zzso promoter has two highly zzso zzso sites that resemble the binding site for a recently described zzso zzso factor, zzso These zzso DNA sequence motifs provide strong candidate regions for the regulation of zzso
