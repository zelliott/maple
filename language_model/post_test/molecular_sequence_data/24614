Analysis of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso using zzso zzso has identified three putative cell wall proteins that are directly regulated by zzso the major zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso of iron zzso were more highly expressed in strains grown in low zzso of iron and in strains in which zzso a zzso active zzso of zzso was zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcript levels were increased zzso in response to iron deprivation in an zzso zzso zzso was localized exclusively to the cell wall by indirect zzso zzso of the zzso zzso individually or in zzso resulted in diminished zzso of iron bound to the zzso zzso B and zzso without diminishing the zzso of zzso iron zzso or the zzso zzso C and zzso zzso strains exhibited increased expression of zzso target genes as measured by a zzso reporter gene or by zzso Western zzso indicating that cells respond to the absence of zzso genes by zzso systems of iron zzso zzso zzso in zzso strains occurred when either zzso or zzso zzso were used as sources of iron during growth, suggesting that the zzso genes enhance zzso of iron from both zzso zzso zzso of the cell wall resulted in the release of significant amounts of iron from cells, and the relative quantity of iron released was reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may function by increasing the amount of iron associated with the cell wall and zzso zzso
