We have developed a zzso zzso zzso system for tamoxifen zzso zzso zzso from a zzso integrated zzso zzso This system, which we have named zzso zzso a zzso carrying elements for both zzso and zzso screens in zzso We show that the zzso zzso can be efficiently mobilized from a range of zzso zzso with high zzso and low background generating insertions that are randomly dispersed throughout the zzso Furthermore, we show that once the zzso zzso has been mobilized it is not zzso producing stable zzso zzso in all daughter zzso To illustrate the efficacy of zzso as a screening tool we set out to identify zzso of resistance to zzso and the zzso drug zzso by performing zzso screens in mouse embryonic stem zzso From these zzso screens we identified multiple independent insertions in the zzso resistance zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso resistance to drug zzso zzso we also show that the zzso zzso system is functional in other zzso cell lines such as human zzso zzso and zzso cells suggesting that it may be used in a range of cell culture zzso zzso represents a flexible and potent system for zzso zzso zzso with many potential zzso
