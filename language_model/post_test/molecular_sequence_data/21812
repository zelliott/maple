Respiratory zzso virus zzso is a major cause of zzso and pneumonia in zzso the zzso and the elderly in both developed and developing zzso zzso are common, and G protein zzso is one mechanism to overcome zzso zzso This is illustrated by the appearance of the BA zzso with a zzso zzso dominating the zzso B zzso in zzso zzso To investigate the evolution of zzso B in South Africa since 2002, the genetic zzso of the G protein was analyzed in all recent strains isolated over 4 years zzso to zzso in South African zzso zzso analysis revealed a replacement of all zzso B zzso previously identified in South Africa with the BA zzso since 2006, while zzso A zzso identified in previous years are still zzso Compared to BA strains from other countries, the evolutionary rate of the South African BA zzso was shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and drift was zzso The most recent common zzso zzso of the South African BA viruses was determined to date back to zzso All South African BA zzso clustered with the zzso zzso and the appearance of new zzso within this branch may occur if drift zzso zzso of the complete G protein of selected South African strains revealed an additional zzso zzso Acquisition of the zzso zzso appeared to have improved the fitness of this virus, and more recent zzso B strains may need to be included in experimental vaccines to evaluate their efficacy in the current setting of evolved circulating zzso
