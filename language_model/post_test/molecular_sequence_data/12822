We previously identified a human zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which is predominantly expressed in the brain and has a unique zzso domain consisting of two zzso zzso and two zzso type III zzso zzso zzso In attempts to define the functional role of the Sky zzso we cloned a rat sky zzso and localized the sites of expression of sky transcript in the adult rat brain by Northern zzso and in zzso zzso analyses using the cloned rat zzso as a zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rat Sky has an overall sequence and a domain zzso highly zzso with human Sky zzso overall identity and zzso identity within the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that a single zzso sky zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and in various regions of the adult rat zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed widespread but confined zzso populations in adult rat brain that express sky zzso prominent zzso signals were detected in the inner zzso layer of the zzso bulb, zzso area of the zzso zzso cell layer of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and wide regions of zzso layers zzso The high level of expression of sky zzso in zzso in restricted brain regions suggests that the Sky zzso may play an important role in development, function, and maintenance of specific zzso populations in the central nervous zzso
