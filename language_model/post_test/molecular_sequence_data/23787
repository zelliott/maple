A screen of zzso zzso lines resulted in the identification of zzso which encodes a small zzso single repeat zzso zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso Plants that zzso this gene have fewer zzso The gene is closely related to the previously identified negative regulator zzso and has a similar pattern of expression as TRY in developing zzso As previously shown for zzso zzso protein can inhibit the interaction between the positive zzso regulators zzso and zzso and likely limits zzso initiation via this zzso While TRY and zzso are closely zzso they are not completely functionally zzso When placed under the zzso control of the TRY promoter, zzso can only partially rescue the try zzso Interestingly, zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso while TRY expression is greatly zzso The zzso in zzso causes a reduced interaction between the zzso and zzso proteins and results in fewer leaf zzso that develop in zzso The differential expression of TRY and zzso in this zzso can be used to explain how its altered zzso pattern in zzso zzso is zzso
