It has been established in a number of studies that the zzso state of zzso (the zzso zzso is composed of a compact zzso lobe and a largely zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated the residual structure in the zzso state in more detail, using limited zzso to isolate and characterize a tightly folded core region from this partially zzso zzso The isolated core region zzso to the 141 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which in the fully native state forms one of the two zzso of the zzso A comparative study using zzso and CD zzso has revealed, however, that the zzso lobe contributes a substantial amount of additional residual structure to the zzso state of zzso CD zzso indicate in addition that significant zzso zzso structure is present in the zzso lobe of the structure when the zzso lobe of zzso is either unfolded or removed by zzso This study demonstrates that the structure of zzso in the zzso state is significantly more complex than that of a fully folded zzso lobe connected to an zzso zzso zzso
