zzso immunity after resolved zzso C virus zzso infection has been zzso However, the breadth of this immunity has remained controversial, and the role of zzso zzso has not been zzso In the present study, two chimpanzees zzso and zzso with resolved zzso zzso zzso zzso infection were zzso with zzso zzso zzso virus about 12 months after viral zzso zzso became persistently zzso and zzso had transient zzso lasting 2 zzso zzso was subsequently either partially or completely protected following five zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and after six zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a final challenge with zzso resulted in persistent zzso zzso In both zzso serum zzso zzso against zzso zzso bearing the zzso envelope proteins were not detected during the initial infection or during zzso However, zzso cellular immune responses developed during the initial zzso zzso in particular in zzso which developed a persistent zzso zzso sequences of viruses recovered from zzso after the two zzso zzso that resulted in transient zzso were identical with the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso sequences of viruses recovered from both chimpanzees after zzso zzso resulting in persistent infection had numerous zzso These findings have important implications for our understanding of immunity against zzso even in the zzso scenario with zzso zzso low-level viral persistence was seen in the presence of primed zzso zzso
