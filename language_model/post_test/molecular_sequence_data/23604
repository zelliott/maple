The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of type I collagen play crucial roles, in zzso and in zzso in the assembly of collagen zzso regulating the zzso alignment of the molecules within a zzso zzso zzso of neighboring zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures of the zzso are not available from X-ray zzso studies, but zzso methods permitted prediction of the zzso structure within a zzso Here, using a suite of molecular modeling software, the more complex zzso zzso of human type I collagen has been built from the correct sequences and energy minimized and the energy minimum confirmed by molecular zzso The zzso triple zzso was modeled on the basis of the zzso Data Bank coordinates of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to its zzso showed that zzso interactions involving the short zzso zzso are crucial zzso of its zzso orientation within the zzso zzso A zzso zzso can interact with only one neighboring zzso The two zzso zzso chains in the zzso chain zzso do not have identical zzso zzso and one of the zzso zzso chains appears to be favored for formation of a zzso between its zzso and a zzso zzso Prior studies showed that a zzso zzso can interact with two adjacent collagen zzso forming a tightly packed zzso A recent X-ray analysis showed the zzso and zzso regions pack differently, with the zzso region being less densely packed than zzso zzso This difference between zzso and zzso zzso structures demonstrates how unique and specific packing can occur in the zzso at each boundary of the type I collagen gap zzso
