A zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated, using a zzso probe from zzso zzso zzso by zzso plaque zzso from a zzso library constructed in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso isolated from mature zzso zzso The zzso had a coding sequence of zzso zzso acids including a zzso zzso signal zzso A zzso zzso gene was detected by Southern analysis in the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso experiments showed that the zzso protein was zzso present during seed development and in all the studied zzso zzso zzso zzso roots, zzso and zzso at two growth stages zzso and zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso and zzso protein was triggered by salicylic acid treatment as well as by zzso zzso light and zzso and zzso stress conditions zzso zzso zzso In zzso leaves, zzso zzso zzso was present at a higher level than that of another zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso (a zzso and that of the zzso We suggest that one role of the zzso zzso could be in the defense of the plant against zzso infection, though our results do not exclude other functions for this zzso
