The success of any zzso depends not only on niche adaptation but also the ability to survive environmental zzso from zzso a situation generically described as zzso Although zzso mechanisms to combat zzso have been zzso the production of heat shock proteins zzso such as zzso is universally described across all zzso Members of the zzso gene family zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso members, plus zzso zzso zzso 78 zzso a related zzso family member, were cloned using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso from two evolutionary divergent Antarctic marine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso The expression of the zzso family members was surveyed via quantitative zzso after an acute zzso heat shock zzso Both species demonstrated significant zzso of zzso gene expression in response to increased zzso However, the temperature level at which these responses were induced varied with the species zzso degrees C for zzso zzso and zzso degrees C for zzso zzso compared to their natural environmental zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso expression of the genes under zzso Previous work on Antarctic fish has shown that they lack the classical heat shock response, with the zzso form of zzso being permanently expressed with an expression not further induced under higher temperature zzso This study shows that this is not the case for other Antarctic animals, with the two zzso showing an zzso heat shock response, at a level probably set during their temperate evolutionary zzso
