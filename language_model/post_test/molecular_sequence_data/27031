Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from soil samples collected from zzso zzso Russian Far East, as zzso zzso to the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as members of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene zzso The strains contained zzso as the major fatty acid zzso and zzso as the major zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strains zzso and zzso exhibited high similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no clear differences in the zzso characteristics and zzso and zzso data between the novel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso values of 56 and zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis confirmed the differences between the new zzso and reference strains that were observed with the zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the results described above, it is proposed that the zzso represent a novel subspecies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
