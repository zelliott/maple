zzso of zzso zzso were previously zzso based on DNA zzso into at least four groups zzso Here, we report the characterization of plasmids of group B and zzso The sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicates that this zzso contains zzso zzso five open reading frames zzso and replicates via the zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and six zzso Two zzso likely zzso a zzso and an zzso Northern zzso experiments demonstrate that these two zzso are transcribed within the three strains containing plasmids of group zzso zzso zzso gel zzso shows that zzso replicates via a zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a zzso replicating via a zzso mode in zzso zzso Finally, a zzso of 20 zzso zzso zzso plasmids into six groups based on their mode of replication is zzso
