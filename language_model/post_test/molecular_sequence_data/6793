The zzso zzso of the zzso is the first tissue to differentiate in the zzso zzso and gives rise to all cells of the zzso zzso These cells form the majority of the fetal component of the zzso which is critical for zzso zzso Our interest in the molecular zzso of zzso lineage development has led us to undertake an analysis of the regulatory region of a zzso gene termed zzso The zzso start site was mapped by both primer extension and zzso protection zzso We show that cloned zzso upstream sequences are able to zzso the correct zzso and spatial expression pattern of zzso on a reporter gene in transgenic zzso In addition, we have characterized a zzso region, zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start, that is sufficient for the specific expression of zzso in cells of the developing zzso in transgenic zzso zzso of a zzso zzso regulatory region will facilitate the identification of factors that may regulate the development of this zzso
