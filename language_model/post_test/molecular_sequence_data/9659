Nowadays the most successful strategy for the prediction of the zzso structure of proteins is the zzso zzso using known zzso A real chance to predict the general fold of a protein arises only in cases with a sufficient sequence zzso zzso zzso over 100 zzso In this analysis we examine the phenomenon of inverse sequence similarity zzso in proteins and its structural zzso In sequence data bases we found a lot of examples for zzso up to zzso identity over 204 zzso and a surprisingly large number of zzso protein zzso By inspection of inverse similar sequence pairs with known zzso structures we observe that inverse sequence alignments above the threshold indicating structural similarity generally do not imply comparable folds for zzso From our analysis we conclude that the straightforward employment of zzso for protein structure prediction fails even above the known threshold for zzso zzso
