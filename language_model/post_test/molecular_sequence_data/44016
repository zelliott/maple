zzso regulation of the mouse zzso zzso c zzso zzso gene was studied by examining zzso interactions in its zzso zzso zzso and liver nuclear proteins bound to the zzso zzso gene at sites zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso suggesting interactions with ubiquitous nuclear zzso zzso present in liver nuclear extracts bound to a fourth site at zzso to zzso whereas protein present in zzso nuclear extracts bound to a zzso of this site at zzso to zzso The sequence from zzso to zzso bound by liver but not zzso nuclear zzso is similar to that of the binding site of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Lastly, different nuclear proteins from mouse liver and zzso bound to a region from zzso to zzso that contains a putative Y box at zzso to zzso zzso shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies have established that this putative Y box binds a zzso mouse zzso zzso of the zzso germ zzso zzso protein and a competing zzso protein present in both liver and zzso nuclear zzso These data suggest that the zzso expression of the mouse zzso zzso gene during zzso may be regulated by the differential binding of zzso nuclear proteins to its zzso promoter zzso
