A major problem of using red cells as the solid phase in zzso systems is the difficulty to bind them strongly to appropriate zzso We report here on a number of zzso of different zzso which were examined for their ability to bind red cells to polystyrene zzso zzso zzso The use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mushroom and zzso zzso zzso proved the most useful for zzso reverse zzso zzso plates were also compared with plates coated with zzso and bovine serum zzso for the binding of zzso zzso and were found to be zzso We also describe the zzso detection of the solid phase red cell zzso reaction by using an indicator zzso and zzso zzso zzso
