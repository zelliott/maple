zzso seasonal and geographical patterns in ocean microbial communities have been observed in many studies, but the resolution of community dynamics has been limited by the scope of data sets, which are seldom up to the task of illuminating the highly structured and rhythmic patterns of change found in ocean zzso We studied vertical and zzso patterns in the microbial community composition in a set of 412 samples collected from the upper 300 m of the water column in the northwestern zzso Sea, on cruises between 1991 and zzso The region sampled spans the extent of deep winter mixing and the transition between the zzso and the upper zzso zones, where most carbon fixation and zzso zzso A zzso pipeline was developed to zzso zzso and align terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso data from three restriction zzso and link zzso zzso to microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso statistics resolved three microbial communities with distinctive composition during seasonal zzso a surface community in the region of lowest zzso a deep zzso maximum community and an upper zzso zzso A fourth microbial community was associated with annual spring zzso of zzso zzso that occur in the northwestern zzso Sea as a consequence of winter zzso mixing that zzso nutrients to the zzso Many bacterial zzso zzso in seasonal patterns that shifted with the progression of zzso These richly detailed patterns of community change suggest that highly specialized adaptations and interactions govern the success of microbial populations in the zzso zzso
