zzso in cerebrovascular regulation related to vascular zzso stress have been implicated in the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease zzso but their role in the zzso deposition and cognitive impairment associated with zzso remains zzso We used mice zzso the Swedish zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso as a model of zzso to examine the role of zzso oxygen species produced by zzso zzso in the cerebrovascular zzso zzso deposition, and behavioral deficits observed in these zzso We found that 12- to zzso zzso mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso do not develop zzso stress, cerebrovascular dysfunction, or behavioral zzso These improvements occurred without reductions in brain zzso zzso zzso levels or zzso zzso The findings unveil a previously zzso role of zzso zzso in the behavioral deficits of zzso mice and provide a link between the zzso dysfunction and cognitive decline associated with zzso zzso
