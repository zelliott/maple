The zzso increase in skeletal zzso zzso synthesis in pigs is due, in part, to increased zzso To characterize the factors responsible for its zzso regulation, we have cloned and determined the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso which contains the complete coding region of zzso distributed over seven zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso zzso region and zzso zzso of 3' zzso zzso The major zzso start point zzso of zzso was determined to be 840 zzso zzso to the zzso start zzso by primer extension and zzso protection zzso To demonstrate that the zzso promoter was functional, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso with a construct zzso linking the zzso zzso promoter to the zzso zzso reporter gene zzso Cell zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were analyzed for zzso zzso zzso activity was detected only in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso promoter is regulated in a zzso and zzso specific zzso
