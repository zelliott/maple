zzso zzso syndrome virus zzso is a newly emerging zzso zzso causing avian diseases in zzso The infection occurs in laying ducks characterized by a severe drop in egg production with a fatality rate of zzso The virus was found to be most closely related to zzso virus zzso an isolate from mosquitoes in zzso zzso Here, we have zzso and characterized the full-length zzso of seven zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso regions zzso We also report for the first time the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso virus zzso another closely related zzso isolated from diseased zzso We zzso the zzso and zzso relationships of zzso in relation to the Asian viruses zzso and zzso and other representative zzso Our results confirm the close relationship between zzso and zzso and we discuss their probable evolutionary zzso We have also characterized the zzso sites, potential zzso sites and unique zzso of these zzso Additionally, zzso sequences in both zzso and zzso were identified and the predicted secondary structures of the terminal sequences were zzso zzso zzso comparisons of zzso with related zzso zzso identified a surprisingly close relationship with dengue virus zzso and raised the question of whether or not zzso may have a potential infectious threat to zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently recognized by a broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso derived against zzso The significance of these studies is discussed in the context of the zzso evolution, zzso zzso and zzso of the newly emergent zzso
