This research presents the first extensive zzso study of zzso zzso acids necessary for activity of a bacterial zzso class zzso zzso zzso Our studies on zzso zzso reductive zzso zzso revealed that, similar to other zzso class zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso play critical roles in zzso binding and their zzso results in functional and structural changes to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased the apparent temperature optimum (by 6-10 degrees zzso and maximum (by 5 degrees zzso of zzso Also, zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in structural changes that were accompanied by the emergence of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso adversely affected the rate of the zzso reaction, but not on the zzso zzso This study adds to the knowledge that, despite low sequence zzso for the zzso zzso protein family, differences in preferred zzso zzso and the manner in which zzso is zzso in zzso zzso from zzso and zzso organisms rely upon the same critical zzso acids for zzso zzso
