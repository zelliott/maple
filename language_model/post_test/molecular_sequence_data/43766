We report here zzso and characterization of zzso zzso protein complexes zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso two zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso reveals two major forms of zzso The zzso form is a zzso of zzso and zzso whereas the zzso form contains three additional zzso One of them is identified as a zzso of the zzso zzso protein whose zzso shows a zzso in zzso zzso zzso targeting of zzso is zzso and is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso as demonstrated by zzso and rescue zzso Our results suggest that the zzso complexes represent the most abundant structural components of zzso zzso and play a central role in driving zzso zzso
