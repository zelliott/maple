Juvenile hormone zzso plays a key role in the regulation of growth, development, zzso and reproduction in zzso The regulation of zzso zzso in the insect body is therefore crucial throughout zzso zzso One of the major pathways of zzso metabolism is degradation by a highly selective zzso juvenile hormone zzso zzso We obtained a full-length zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso sequence is comprised of 1989 zzso with an open reading frame of 1785 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The deduced protein sequence of zzso showed high zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and moderate zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript was expressed mainly in the fat zzso zzso transcript levels were low until day 3 of the 5th zzso zzso zzso then steadily increased reaching a peak on day 13 (the zzso zzso coinciding well with the peak zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso of larvae after a period of feeding zzso the expression of zzso zzso while feeding the larvae with zzso zzso its zzso These results are discussed with reference to the induction of precocious metamorphosis in this zzso by zzso
