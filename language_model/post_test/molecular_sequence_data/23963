Through a zzso and a genetic approach, we have identified several plant genes zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso involved in recycling of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso from rice zzso zzso is zzso zzso in size and shows cooperative zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are the first genes to be identified from the zzso cycle in zzso zzso zzso of the unique zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso resulted in an inability of plants to grow on zzso as a supplemental sulfur zzso zzso zzso plants were not impaired in growth under standard conditions, indicating that the zzso cycle is a zzso zzso zzso in zzso when sulfur levels are zzso In rice, zzso genes were strongly zzso in shoots and roots when plants were exposed to sulfur zzso Gene expression was largely unaffected by lack of nitrogen or iron in the zzso solution, indicating that zzso regulation was linked specifically to sulfur zzso
