Genes of the major zzso complex zzso play a fundamental role in the zzso immune response and are amongst the most zzso genes in zzso zzso It is generally agreed that the highly zzso nature of the zzso is maintained through zzso zzso Two zzso mechanisms of selection are supposed to act on zzso zzso superiority of zzso zzso individuals zzso and an advantage for rare zzso zzso However, the precise mechanisms and their relative importance are still zzso Here, we examined zzso dependent zzso load in European rabbits zzso zzso from a distinct population with low zzso diversity (three zzso six zzso Using a zzso approach, we tested for associations of individual zzso class II zzso constitution and the zzso zzso burden with zzso and zzso zzso having a particular zzso showed lower zzso with zzso zzso zzso However, a comparison of all six zzso in the population revealed that carriers of this zzso only benefit when they are zzso and zzso zzso zzso in general did not affect individual zzso zzso In conclusion, this study suggests an zzso basis of European rabbit resistance to zzso zzso which can strongly limit survival to maturity in this zzso Our study gives a complex picture of zzso zzso unveiling the limits of the classical hypotheses of how zzso zzso is maintained in natural zzso
