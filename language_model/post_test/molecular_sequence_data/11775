A protein that binds specifically to zzso zzso zzso was found in pools of normal human plasma when this zzso was used in affinity zzso zzso These samples represented the negative control in experiments aimed at the zzso of putative human zzso to the zzso zzso region from AIDS zzso In this article we describe the zzso characterization of this zzso which turned out to be complement factor H zzso We propose a functional role for this protein in the complex, early steps of zzso zzso zzso
