The small zzso zzso zzso has been classified on the basis of sequence zzso to be a member of the zzso zzso This family, which includes the zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been shown to regulate a variety of apparently diverse cellular processes such as zzso zzso organization, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cell cycle progression and zzso In order to begin a study of zzso biological function, we expressed wild type and various zzso forms of this protein in zzso cells and investigated both the zzso zzso of the expressed proteins and their abilities to stimulate known zzso zzso zzso Wild type zzso was located predominantly in the cell membrane (apparently in the same regions as zzso zzso zzso defective zzso and zzso defective zzso zzso were located predominantly in zzso zzso regions, and a deletion zzso lacking the zzso terminal zzso required for zzso zzso was located predominantly in the zzso The zzso defective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of long zzso zzso activated zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso activated serum response factor zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso with an activated zzso zzso to transform zzso zzso In addition, wild type zzso function is required for full zzso transforming zzso We demonstrate that an intact zzso domain and zzso terminal zzso signal are required for proper zzso function and that zzso signals to at least two zzso downstream target zzso In addition, zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in both a zzso zzso library screen, and an in zzso binding zzso Taken together, these data support a zzso of zzso as a member of the zzso family, and in particular, suggest that zzso functions to regulate cellular signaling to the zzso zzso and processes associated with cell zzso
