Using amplified zzso length zzso zzso and random amplified zzso zzso zzso we have zzso and mapped zzso a gene zzso resistance to the rice zzso zzso zzso zzso a major insect zzso of rice, onto rice zzso zzso Using zzso two fragments, zzso and zzso were identified that were linked to the resistant and susceptible zzso zzso Another resistant zzso marker, zzso was also identified using zzso zzso zzso based on the sequence of the fragments zzso and zzso failed to reveal zzso between the resistant and the susceptible zzso However, zzso using zzso based on the regions zzso zzso revealed zzso that was zzso In contrast, zzso carried out using zzso zzso the susceptible zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso fragments revealed zzso between the susceptible and resistant zzso zzso zzso searches revealed that the three fragments show strong zzso to rice zzso and zzso clones that formed a zzso representing the short arm of zzso zzso zzso amplification using the zzso zzso on a larger population, derived from a cross between two zzso rice zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that there is a tight linkage between the markers and the zzso zzso These zzso therefore, have potential for use in zzso selection and zzso of zzso along with other previously zzso zzso zzso resistance genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso
