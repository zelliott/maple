In order to assess global changes in gene expression patterns in zzso zzso we conducted large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags zzso in common zzso zzso zzso libraries derived from zzso zzso such as zzso as well as liquid cultures and zzso stress conditions zzso treatment, zzso zzso moisture and zzso were zzso Several thousand colonies were randomly selected from each of these 21 zzso libraries and zzso from both the zzso and 3' zzso By computing abundantly expressed zzso correlated expression patterns of genes across the zzso were zzso Furthermore, the relationships between gene expression profiles among the zzso zzso were zzso from the gene expression zzso zzso analysis of zzso data is analogous to zzso zzso As an example, genes specifically induced and/or suppressed by cold zzso and zzso treatments were selected in zzso Four hundred and zzso genes showing fivefold induction or 218 genes for suppression in comparison to the control expression level were zzso These selected genes were zzso with the zzso zzso Furthermore, gene zzso was conducted for these genes with the zzso zzso Because genes regulated in response to temperature treatment were successfully selected, this method can be applied to other zzso zzso Then, the method was applied to screen genes in response to zzso stresses such as drought and zzso zzso In zzso selection of screened genes from virtual display should provide a powerful tool for functional plant zzso
