The zzso coli zzso apparatus is a zzso protein zzso that serves to export folded proteins zzso with zzso zzso signal zzso The essential zzso component of the zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein probably containing six zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and the role of these zzso was assessed by single zzso zzso This approach identified three classes of zzso zzso Class I zzso included zzso zzso and zzso which were completely devoid of zzso protein export activity and thus represented zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso experiments with class I zzso showed that zzso of zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso an active zzso zzso These data suggest that different class I zzso may be blocked at different steps in protein transport and point to the zzso of at least two zzso molecules within each zzso zzso Class II zzso identified zzso important, but not essential, for zzso activity, the most severely affected being zzso and zzso Class III zzso showed no significant defects in protein zzso All but three of the essential and important zzso are predicted to cluster around the zzso zzso and first zzso loop regions of the zzso zzso
