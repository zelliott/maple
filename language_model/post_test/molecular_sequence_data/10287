A zzso zzso containing sequences zzso to the rat zzso zzso zzso gene was recently identified on human zzso zzso Here we report the location of this zzso in zzso zzso near the zzso zzso We also report isolation of zzso clones containing the complete coding region of the human zzso zzso and use of this sequence to determine the zzso structure from overlapping zzso Human zzso spans approximately 25 zzso and is composed of 10 zzso containing coding zzso The two zzso binding zzso are located within a single large, zzso zzso zzso zzso An alternatively processed zzso 6 potentially interrupts the zzso zzso zzso 10 is largely composed of the 3' untranslated region, which is unusually high in zzso content and contains a segment that is zzso zzso identical with the 3' zzso of the zzso rat zzso A survey of expression patterns reveals differential processing of the 5 and zzso zzso transcripts in all sources zzso The difference in transcript size likely results from alternative processing in the 3' zzso Potential relevance of zzso of zzso to the development of the Down zzso zzso is zzso
