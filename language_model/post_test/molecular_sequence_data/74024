To characterize the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso library was constructed and screened with allergic zzso from zzso zzso One zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso sequence of 934 zzso length shows a zzso reading frame which encodes a zzso acid protein with a zzso zzso zzso No potential zzso site was found in the predicted zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence has no zzso to known zzso It has a zzso fatty zzso protein zzso signature at zzso zzso acid zzso zzso identity with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso from zzso zzso bovine and zzso The protein was expressed as a zzso fusion protein and the zzso zzso used for dot zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The frequency of zzso binding of allergic zzso to zzso was low zzso and usually zzso One positive serum did, however, show strong zzso by zzso and dot zzso and zzso could inhibit zzso of the zzso binding of this serum to the zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso encodes a zzso zzso with zzso properties, which are pronounced in some zzso zzso
