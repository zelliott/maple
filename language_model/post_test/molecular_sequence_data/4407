The zzso sequence on both sides of the zzso zzso zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals the presence of ten genes that are involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso strains carrying targeted zzso in eight of these genes indicate that three zzso zzso and zzso act in zzso zzso or attachment, while the other five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are devoted to zzso zzso or zzso The remaining two genes zzso and zzso appear to function in zzso zzso based on computer analysis and earlier genetic zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso lie between the zzso and zzso genes on one side of the zzso zzso zzso while the remaining seven, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lie upstream of the zzso gene on the other side of the gene zzso The deduced products of these genes show similarities to: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene resembles a zzso zzso but lacks the zzso zzso zzso responsible for coordination of the zzso iron, while the zzso gene displays no meaningful similarity to other known zzso From the predicted function of these and other known zzso and zzso zzso pathways for the zzso of zzso and zzso have been zzso
