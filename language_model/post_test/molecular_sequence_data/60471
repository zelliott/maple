zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is required for the light zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso In most plants examined to date, there are two zzso of zzso zzso arising from alternative zzso that differ only at the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate with zzso proteins that in zzso the larger zzso has a unique role in the regulation of zzso zzso At zzso ratios of zzso the zzso zzso has minimal zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in comparison with the zzso zzso Analysis of a series of zzso deletion and Ala substitution zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that the presence of zzso zzso at positions 411 and zzso were essential to preserve a low zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso zzso incubation of the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso increased both activities, whereas zzso with zzso alone or with zzso were zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso However, zzso both zzso before conducting a reduction and zzso cycle demonstrated that the activity of both zzso could be zzso Reduction and zzso also modulated the activity of native zzso proteins isolated from either zzso or spinach, but not zzso which only has the smaller zzso These findings suggest that in plants containing both zzso zzso zzso regulates the activity of zzso in response to zzso changes in both the zzso ratio and the zzso potential via zzso
