zzso zzso occupy enormous areas in the Arctic and the northern zzso mountain ranges and have undergone major range shifts during their comparatively short zzso The origins of individual zzso species remain largely zzso In the case of the Purple zzso zzso zzso an important model for zzso plants, zzso studies have remained zzso about early stages of the zzso zzso diversification but have provided evidence for long-range colonization out of a presumed zzso origin to cover today's zzso zzso We re-evaluated the zzso large-scale range dynamics based on a geographically extended sampling including crucial areas such as Central Asia and the zzso European mountain ranges and employing up-to-date zzso analyses of a zzso sequence data set and a more restricted zzso data zzso In accordance with previous studies, we detected two major zzso DNA lineages also reflected in zzso zzso suggesting a long and independent zzso zzso Although we were unable to determine the zzso area of origin, our results point to Europe (probably the zzso and Central Asia, respectively, as the likely ancestral areas of the two main zzso zzso data suggested that contact areas between the two zzso in the zzso Northern zzso and western Greenland were zzso In marked contrast to high levels of diversity revealed in previous studies, populations from the major arctic zzso zzso did not exhibit any zzso sequence zzso Our study shows that adequate sampling of the zzso zzso populations is crucial for understanding the range dynamics of zzso zzso
