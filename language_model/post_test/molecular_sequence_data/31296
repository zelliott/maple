We report the cloning and characterization of a full-length zzso zzso the human zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso protein that shares structural zzso with zzso and zzso The gene encodes zzso zzso acids with zzso sequence identity at the zzso acid level to chicken zzso muscle alpha zzso zzso expression in zzso cells produces a protein of approximately 104 zzso that zzso on zzso with native alpha zzso This alpha A gene is localized to zzso zzso by zzso cell hybrid and in zzso zzso zzso zzso gel analysis of human zzso DNA revealed zzso sized fragments when zzso zzso for alpha A and zzso zzso were zzso the latter gene has been previously localized to zzso 14, band zzso These observations indicate that the genes for zzso alpha A and zzso are, in all likelihood, closely physically linked and that, in accordance with their similar structural features, they arose by partial zzso of an ancestral zzso
