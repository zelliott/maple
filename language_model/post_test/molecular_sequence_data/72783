zzso peptides of different size, zzso the zzso processing site of zzso were studied by CD under several experimental conditions in order to ascertain the ability of different zzso to stabilize secondary structural zzso such as zzso tracts and zzso A combination of zzso methods and empirical calculations zzso the contributions due to zzso structures from the zzso suggests that in solution zzso mainly two distinct families of ordered zzso containing structurally different zzso are present, zzso the relative stability of the different zzso depends from the nature of the zzso and zzso in the case of the larger zzso a population containing an zzso zzso is also zzso From the biological point of view the presence of at least two families of ordered zzso could be in line with current theories assuming that the zzso effect of the zzso zzso may be zzso in shifting the equilibrium toward the active zzso
