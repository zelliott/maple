Several zzso zzso use a secondary fluorescent zzso the green fluorescent protein zzso in an energy transfer reaction to produce green zzso The most studied of these proteins have been the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and the sea zzso zzso zzso Although the proteins from these organisms are not zzso they are thought to have the same zzso which is derived from the primary zzso acid sequence of zzso The differences are thought to be due to changes in the protein environment of the zzso Recent interest in these molecules has arisen from the cloning of the zzso zzso zzso and the demonstration that its expression in the absence of other zzso proteins results in a fluorescent zzso This demonstration indicated that zzso could be used as a marker of gene expression and protein zzso in living and fixed zzso zzso plant and animal (including zzso cells all express zzso The zzso expression of the zzso zzso has also meant that it could be zzso to produce proteins with different fluorescent zzso zzso with more intense zzso or zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso
