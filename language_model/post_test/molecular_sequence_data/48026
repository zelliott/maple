Three related zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a developing mouse brain zzso zzso zzso is the zzso portion and zzso is the zzso portion, respectively, of zzso zzso and zzso have open reading frames of 199 zzso acids zzso and 189 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso has both zzso and zzso zzso zzso but seems to translate only zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests that all of the three related zzso are transcribed from the same single zzso The intervening region of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso contained a promoter sequence for zzso zzso which is transcribed from the corresponding zzso zzso Very recently, a zzso zzso human zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso a different mouse zzso of zzso zzso tumor virus zzso were zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso these apparently unrelated proteins are transcribed within an adjacent or overlapping area on the zzso suggesting the same origin of the two zzso zzso
