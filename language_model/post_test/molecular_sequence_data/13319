zzso zzso of zzso zzso a variety of biological regulatory mechanisms in zzso zzso We present here structural and zzso characterization of a zzso DNA zzso duplex containing the dam sequence zzso in the zzso zzso (both zzso and zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso show that the free energies for zzso zzso of the zzso duplex are zzso and zzso zzso for zzso respectively, and zzso zzso for full zzso In all cases, a large zzso zzso change is partially compensated by a favorable zzso zzso CD zzso indicates an overall zzso difference between the zzso zzso duplex and its zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso probe sensitive to zzso is enhanced in the vicinity of the zzso site of the duplex, consistent with loosening of base pairing at this zzso zzso of the zzso patterns of these zzso duplexes by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicates that the zzso site of the zzso duplex represents a site of enhanced zzso for these zzso On the basis of these thermodynamics and structural features, we suggest that the zzso base pair exists in two different zzso states, which require local transient opening of the duplex for zzso
