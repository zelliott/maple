The zzso domain of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso contains zzso regions that show striking zzso to sequences known to bind to zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso region of the zzso zzso interacts with specific zzso zzso in zzso zzso domain binding zzso were zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso domain but not to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso suggests stable association of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso domain plays an important role in the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso domain alters zzso zzso activity, zzso was expressed alone or with zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was readily observed when zzso was expressed zzso However, zzso of zzso with zzso or full-length zzso inhibited zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso indicating a requirement for the zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso did not inhibit the zzso activity of zzso which contains two point zzso in the zzso zzso domain that release the negative zzso regulation by the zzso zzso In contrast, the full-length zzso zzso partially inhibited the zzso activity of both zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso may interact at multiple zzso Taken together, the data in this report provide the first evidence for a novel zzso interaction between the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
