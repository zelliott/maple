The zzso protein family members are well known for their high affinity towards zzso and high structural zzso These properties make zzso valuable tools for a wide range of biotechnology zzso We have identified a new member of the zzso family in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso The protein is highly expressed in the zzso of both male and female zzso and in the zzso of male fish, but our data suggest that zzso is not crucial for the developing zzso zzso and structural zzso of zzso revealed distinct properties not found in any previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and native mass zzso suggest that the protein forms zzso in the absence of zzso at low zzso strength, but assembles into zzso upon binding zzso zzso binding was zzso using radioactive and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the crystal structure of zzso in complex with zzso was solved at zzso zzso resolution and unveiled unique zzso binding and zzso interface zzso the zzso details support our zzso zzso
