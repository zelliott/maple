The beta zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors are necessary for the connection of these receptors to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso binds to beta zzso zzso tails and zzso zzso hence forming an zzso zzso We used zzso structural mimics of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tails to characterize zzso sites within zzso Here we report that an zzso site is localized within the zzso zzso head zzso The binding of the zzso head domain to zzso beta tails is specific in that it is zzso by a single point zzso that zzso zzso zzso to zzso focal zzso zzso interactions regulate zzso affinity for zzso zzso zzso of a zzso of zzso containing the head domain led to zzso of zzso zzso zzso was dependent on the presence of both the zzso head domain and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The head domain of zzso thus binds to zzso to form a link to the zzso zzso and can thus regulate zzso zzso
