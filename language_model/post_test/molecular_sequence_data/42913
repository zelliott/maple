Based on previous zzso data, zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso with the zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso of avian skeletal muscles and in zzso adult anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether this primordial zzso zzso is identical to adult zzso gene product, we have cloned and characterized the 3' portion of zzso zzso that is expressed in zzso muscle at 3 d of zzso zzso of zzso sequences between adult zzso and zzso zzso revealed more than zzso zzso in the zzso zzso portions of these zzso The expression pattern of zzso was analyzed in adult zzso muscles using total zzso from two fast muscles, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso major zzso as well as from slow zzso and mixed zzso zzso muscles at 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 14 d after cold zzso zzso results were obtained by zzso protection zzso using either a probe specifying the coding region of adult zzso or a zzso probe zzso the zzso end plus the zzso zzso The expected protected fragments were detected early from day 2 up to day 6 in zzso zzso Similar rate of appearance, reaching the highest level at day 3, was observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the amount and the zzso of disappearance differed among the various muscles zzso In contrast, during development, zzso levels and zzso of zzso zzso expression were found to be alike in zzso and zzso zzso These data strongly suggest the identity of zzso as the zzso zzso and support the concept that expression of zzso zzso is a common feature of developing as well as of all zzso adult skeletal zzso Interestingly, no expression of cardiac specific zzso light chain zzso 2A was observed after cold injury, suggesting independent regulatory pathways for the two kinds of zzso zzso
