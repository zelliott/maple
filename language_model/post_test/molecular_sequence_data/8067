The adult zzso wing (as the other zzso is subdivided into anterior and zzso compartments that exhibit characteristic zzso The zzso zzso gene has been proposed to be paramount in the zzso of the zzso compartment zzso Here, we explore the adult en function by targeting its expression in different regions of the wing zzso In the anterior zzso zzso en expression gives rise to the substitution of anterior structures by zzso ones, thus demonstrating its role in zzso of zzso zzso The zzso cells in the anterior compartment also induce high levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene products, which results in local zzso of anterior zzso Besides, zzso is able to activate en and the zzso gene zzso zzso in this zzso In the zzso compartment we find that elevated levels of en product result in partial zzso of the zzso en and zzso zzso indicating the existence of a negative zzso zzso We propose that en has a dual zzso a general one for patterning of the zzso achieved through the zzso of zzso proteins like zzso and zzso and a more specific one, determining zzso identity, in which the zzso gene may be zzso
