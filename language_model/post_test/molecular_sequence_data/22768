In an initial study, we compared quantitative zzso data across mouse brain territories using the serial analysis of gene expression zzso Among the novel regional markers that we discovered, we focused on a zzso transcript with no available experimental zzso zzso Here, we report its zzso gene structure, and detailed distribution in mouse zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso demonstrated zzso expression in zzso zzso We therefore named it zzso for zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso is a zzso zzso without any registered zzso in zzso zzso It contains no recognizable motif other than two predicted zzso zzso zzso When expressed in fusion with a fluorescent zzso it localized to the zzso apparatus in two zzso cell zzso Interestingly, we observed a significant zzso of zzso zzso levels in two zzso models of Huntington disease, indicating a possible contribution to the zzso of this zzso
