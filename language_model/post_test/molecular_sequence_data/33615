Liver X zzso alpha zzso also referred to as nuclear zzso zzso 1, group zzso member 3 is a member of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso and has recently been shown to act as a master zzso factor governing zzso zzso in zzso Liver X zzso alpha directly regulates both the expression of other zzso zzso factors and the expression of zzso zzso thereby enhancing zzso fatty acid synthesis zzso In birds, like in humans, fatty acid synthesis primarily occurs in the zzso Whether zzso is involved in zzso regulation of zzso genes remained to be investigated in this zzso Here we show that fatty acid zzso and the expression of other zzso genes zzso regulatory element binding protein 1 and zzso zzso A zzso 1) are induced in chicken zzso cells in response to a pharmacological liver X zzso zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the chicken zzso promoter revealed a functional liver X response zzso These data define the chicken zzso gene as a direct target of zzso and further expand the role of zzso as a regulator of zzso metabolism in this zzso
