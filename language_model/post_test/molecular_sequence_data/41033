Even deadly zzso may be widespread in nature if they spread by infection faster than they kill off their zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were not found in 70 wild zzso while zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso of the same zzso zzso prion infection occurs only by zzso balancing the zzso effects of carrying the zzso We estimated the frequency of zzso mating as about zzso of zzso zzso from the known detriment of carrying the zzso DNA zzso zzso and its frequency in wild populations zzso We also estimated the fraction of total zzso that are zzso zzso zzso from the fraction of zzso at the highly zzso zzso locus zzso These results show that the detriment of carrying even the zzso forms of zzso zzso or zzso is greater than zzso We find that zzso zzso in wild strains include several premature stop zzso zzso that cannot zzso zzso from the reference zzso and others with several small deletions and point zzso which show a small transmission zzso Wild strains carrying zzso are far more likely to be zzso at zzso and other zzso than are zzso zzso probably reflecting its being a sexually transmitted zzso Because sequence differences are known to block prion propagation or zzso its zzso effects, we zzso that zzso of zzso was selected to protect cells from zzso effects of the zzso zzso
