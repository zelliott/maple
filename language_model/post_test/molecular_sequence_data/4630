zzso zzso of terminal zzso zzso was investigated by screening zzso activity present in 37 human tissue specimens toward the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures containing a zzso zzso zzso on either zzso Two distinct types of zzso zzso were zzso One zzso zzso was specific for the zzso zzso zzso linkage and the other zzso zzso was directed toward the zzso branch zzso linked to the blood group T zzso zzso activities found in breast zzso were unique in showing a strict specificity for the zzso zzso or zzso did not serve as zzso for Group A but were very active with Group zzso An examination of activity present in six human zzso revealed a specificity of the serum zzso toward zzso linked zzso particularly, the zzso without zzso zzso Group A was highly active toward zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso less active toward zzso zzso zzso zzso and least active toward bovine zzso zzso zzso Group B was moderately and highly active, respectively, with the latter two zzso noted and least active with the first zzso Competition experiments performed with zzso zzso and zzso zzso having a zzso zzso zzso or zzso on either Gal reinforced earlier findings on the specificity characteristics of Group A and Group zzso Group A displayed a wider range of optimal activity zzso zzso whereas Group B possessed a peak of activity at pH zzso zzso zzso Group A zzso and Group B zzso whereas zzso zzso Group B zzso but inhibited Group A zzso zzso zzso Group B zzso but inhibited Group A zzso Group A and Group B zzso appeared to be of the same molecular size zzso zzso as observed by zzso zzso zzso column zzso The following effects upon zzso zzso activities by zzso zzso and other zzso on the zzso chains were zzso zzso A zzso or zzso zzso on zzso of zzso diminished the ability of zzso zzso to act as an zzso for Group zzso zzso An zzso zzso on the zzso branch in the zzso core structure did not affect the activity of Group A toward Gal linked zzso to zzso zzso zzso Lewis zzso and Lewis a terminals did not serve as zzso for either Group A or B zzso zzso zzso of Group B activity on Gal in the zzso branch zzso to the presence of a zzso or zzso group on zzso did not hinder any action toward Gal linked zzso to zzso zzso zzso Group A activity on Gal linked zzso to zzso remained unaffected by zzso of the zzso zzso The reverse was true for Group zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was increased somewhat upon zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso loss of zzso zzso A novel finding was that zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso of the zzso zzso became zzso inactive and zzso to zzso active, respectively, in their ability to serve as zzso for Group zzso
