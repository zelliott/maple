In 4 infants with a new lethal zzso sensory zzso with clinical features similar to familial zzso as well as zzso we identified a deleterious zzso in the zzso zzso using zzso mapping followed by zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso results in an unstable zzso Interestingly, zzso is significantly more abundant in cells of familial zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso of controls, suggesting that zzso of zzso is responsible for the milder course in familial zzso zzso mapping followed by zzso sequencing is a successful approach to identify zzso genes in rare zzso zzso
