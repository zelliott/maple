The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso hormones, such as zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone releasing hormone zzso zzso resistance to zzso by conventional zzso Specialized zzso zzso zzso are able to cleave an zzso zzso zzso and thus control hormonal zzso Until now, no direct or zzso three-dimensional structure was available for any zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso zzso I zzso from zzso zzso has been determined to zzso A zzso The zzso zzso unit of zzso is a zzso of four identical zzso related by zzso 222 zzso The protein folds into an zzso zzso domain with a zzso core consisting of a twisted beta sheet surrounded by five alpha zzso The structure allows the function of most of the zzso zzso in the zzso family to be zzso The zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso site does not have a conventional zzso hole, although zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso of an alpha zzso could all stabilize a negative zzso The zzso site has an zzso pocket lined with zzso zzso zzso to accommodate the zzso zzso Aside from the zzso pocket, there is no clearly defined zzso zzso region, consistent with the lack of zzso zzso Although the overall structure of zzso resembles some other zzso twisted zzso structures, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso there are important differences in the location and organization of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso belongs to a new family of zzso zzso
