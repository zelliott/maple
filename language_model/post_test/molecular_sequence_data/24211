Plant genes that are induced during the formation and function of a root zzso are called zzso zzso Cloning and functional analysis of zzso gene products are of valuable help in establishing the role and requirements of the host plant for the specificity and effectiveness of the zzso A zzso clone zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library derived from zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso transcripts are accumulated from early to late stages in root zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies indicated that zzso transcripts are highly accumulated in zzso vascular bundle and infected zzso The deduced zzso protein contains a highly zzso zzso with signal zzso zzso and a zzso extension with high identity to the zzso zzso found in zzso lens zzso and other small zzso zzso These zzso have not been previously described in other known zzso but have been observed in small zzso proteins found in plant zzso exposed to elevated temperature and zzso zzso zzso when it is zzso in zzso coli, cells zzso protection against zzso stress suggesting its possible role in plant host protection from zzso toxicity during the zzso zzso
