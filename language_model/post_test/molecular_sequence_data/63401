zzso of zzso replication and its cell zzso regulation bear crucial and fundamental mechanisms in most cellular zzso zzso coli zzso protein forms a zzso complex with the replication origin zzso zzso zzso unwind the duplex within the zzso unwinding element zzso In this study, structural analyses suggested that several zzso exposed in the central pore of the putative structure of zzso zzso could be important for zzso Using zzso zzso we found that, of these candidate zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso for initiation in zzso and in zzso Whereas zzso zzso and zzso proteins retained normal affinities for zzso and DNA and activity for the zzso zzso change of the initiation complex in zzso zzso complexes of these zzso proteins were inactive in zzso unwinding and in binding to the zzso zzso Unlike zzso complexes including zzso or the zzso zzso zzso complexes specifically bound the upper strand of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences within the strand were required for zzso The corresponding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso an ancient zzso were also required for zzso zzso consistent with the idea that the mechanism and regulation for zzso unwinding can be zzso zzso These findings provide novel insights into mechanisms for zzso origin zzso zzso regulation, and zzso loading of the initiation zzso
