A general method is described for altering specific genes of zzso virus zzso We demonstrate and evaluate the procedure by gene zzso using a dominant zzso marker in conjunction with zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso based on the sequence of the target gene enable amplification of zzso arms and their subsequent attachment to the zzso cassette that zzso resistance to zzso zzso Linear zzso zzso are zzso into cells infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses with zzso inserted into the target gene by zzso zzso are then selected by growth in the presence of zzso This technique was applied to the zzso virus zzso zzso gene and compared to the traditional method of constructing zzso plasmids by zzso The zzso scheme was found to be highly efficient and could theoretically be used to insert any foreign DNA element into any zzso target gene for which partial or complete sequence information is zzso The procedure can potentially be used for a wide variety of genetic zzso including the zzso of foreign zzso with zzso and other DNA zzso zzso of zzso such as bacteria and zzso that can be transformed with linear DNA, are also candidates for manipulation by this zzso
