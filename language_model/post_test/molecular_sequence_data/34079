zzso zzso play a key role in the viral life zzso zzso viruses particularly require a sequence of fusion and zzso events between the viral envelope and the target zzso for entry into the cell and zzso from zzso These processes are controlled by one or more viral zzso that undergo zzso changes favoring the necessary zzso and zzso zzso zzso Multiple regions from these zzso are thought to interact with the zzso according to a concerted zzso in order to generate the distortion necessary for zzso In this work, we perform an zzso study on the role played by the membrane composition in tuning the interaction between zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso that are highly zzso fragments of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results show that both peptides interact with zzso zzso zzso the local zzso zzso zzso zzso close to the zzso zzso surface, while zzso zzso deeply into the zzso zzso zzso by the peptides increases in the presence of charged zzso Finally, cholesterol does not alter the ability of zzso to penetrate deeply in the zzso whereas it limits penetration of the zzso zzso to the more external zzso The different modes of interaction result in a higher zzso ability of zzso towards zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso mixing zzso These results suggest that the mechanism of action of the zzso and zzso zzso is modulated by the properties and composition of the zzso zzso
