zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated previously that different zzso zzso are induced during acute zzso Here we show that the mouse zzso zzso are zzso localized in cellular compartments and that their zzso is controlled by several independent zzso Nuclear import of the full-length zzso is predominantly regulated by a nuclear zzso signal at the C zzso zzso which consists of a zzso basic zzso acid motif plus the last 39 zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso causes the truncated zzso protein to be retained in the zzso The addition of this sequence to zzso zzso causes the zzso protein to be localized within the zzso The zzso of nuclear zzso is determined by a dynamic balance between the zzso binding activity of the zzso zzso signal zzso in the middle of the protein and the exporting activity of the nuclear exporter signal zzso near the N zzso The zzso consists of a typical zzso cluster of basic zzso followed by the third zzso zzso zzso These signals act zzso however, zzso function can be completely silenced by the zzso when a regulatory motif within the zzso domain and the zzso are zzso Thus, the zzso distribution of the various zzso zzso is determined by zzso zzso zzso and a regulatory zzso
