The zzso family of proteins has more than 1000 representatives, which despite sometimes relatively low sequence identity have a surprisingly high level of structural zzso This fact makes this family of proteins ideal candidate for various types of modeling based on protein structure zzso A number of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, and 19, play a role in the metabolism of zzso zzso of these proteins could be very promising drugs for hormonal treatment of zzso breast zzso zzso studies have yielded a significant amount of data describing the relationship between single zzso zzso zzso in DNA and cancer risk related to these zzso A combination of zzso analysis with protein structure prediction can be a very useful strategy in investigations of zzso relations of zzso proteins and zzso drug zzso Here we will demonstrate how protein structure prediction combined with genetic zzso analysis can be useful for potential drug design and zzso individual treatment of breast zzso
