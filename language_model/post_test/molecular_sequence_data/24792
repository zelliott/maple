The lack of knowledge about the natural host of zzso virus zzso along with the description of human infections caused by zzso after zzso zzso has increased the need to characterize zzso isolated from the zzso Moreover, in the past years zzso have been widely studied as potential vaccination tools, with the discovery of several genes implicated in the evasion of the host immune response involved in virus zzso Among them, an zzso zzso protein was identified in the zzso of zzso strain WR infected cells coded by the zzso zzso It was shown that many other zzso also zzso and express this soluble zzso although some zzso strains such as Lister and modified zzso which were less zzso vaccines, do zzso The zzso zzso virus zzso has been recently characterized and proposed to be an zzso zzso was also shown to be less virulent in animal models than zzso zzso Here we report the identification of an zzso gene in the zzso zzso with zzso of sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso The identified gene encodes a zzso zzso binding protein as demonstrated by its capacity to inhibit the zzso protection of zzso cells against zzso zzso In order to better characterize the virus we have searched for the A type inclusion body zzso gene currently used in the zzso of zzso but did not detect it in the zzso zzso We have also zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which, as expected, showed high zzso with the zzso gene of other zzso zzso trees were constructed based on sequences of the zzso and zzso genes from several zzso and in both cases zzso was placed in the same cluster as other zzso zzso These observations strengthened the hypothesis that this virus is a zzso of the zzso vaccine used in zzso However the explanation for the zzso lack of zzso remains to be zzso
