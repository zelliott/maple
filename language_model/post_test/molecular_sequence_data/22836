zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with a blocked zzso and a zzso bridge between the zzso zzso at positions 7 and zzso zzso of zzso were used to examine the structural requirements of zzso for zzso activity on spontaneous zzso zzso of zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso Breaking the zzso bond between zzso and zzso by reduction reduced the potency of the zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso is important for its biological zzso When either of the zzso zzso were replaced with zzso the zzso analogue had no measurable zzso zzso substitution at zzso was as potent as zzso all other zzso substitution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso but less potent than native zzso to varying zzso zzso with zzso substitution at zzso acids with aromatic side chains zzso and zzso were the least zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso and zzso were inactive whereas zzso was fully active but not as potent as zzso The results show that zzso acid zzso both inside and outside the zzso ring are important for biological zzso
