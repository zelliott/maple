zzso pathogens use specialized type zzso zzso zzso systems to transport crucial zzso factors across their unusual cell envelope into infected host zzso These zzso factors lack classical zzso signals and the mechanism of zzso recognition is not well zzso Here we demonstrate that the model zzso zzso zzso which form a zzso are targeted to the zzso zzso zzso by a signal located in the C zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso within this C zzso resulted in the identification of a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso which is required for zzso This motif was also essential for the zzso of zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso have several different zzso systems and we identified a zzso protein that is zzso by the zzso system, which allowed us to compare zzso recognition of these two zzso zzso Surprisingly, this zzso zzso contained a zzso signal functionally equivalent to that of zzso Exchange of these zzso zzso signals between the zzso proteins restored zzso but each zzso protein remained zzso via its own zzso zzso system, indicating that an additional zzso provides system zzso zzso the zzso motif was also present in and required for efficient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso our data show that the zzso motif is a general zzso signal that is present in all known zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
