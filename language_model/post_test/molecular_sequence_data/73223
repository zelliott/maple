In order to supply a sufficient amount of template molecules for DNA sequence determination, cloning into plasmids and subsequent zzso zzso or amplification via the zzso are generally zzso Here, we present a zzso exponential amplification and zzso or zzso permits direct sequence determination from whole zzso DNA and thus eliminates the need for template amplification and zzso It relies on the simultaneous amplification of a target sequence and the determination of its sequence using zzso in a zzso cycling zzso zzso can be applied to single as well as zzso zzso zzso and can easily be zzso
