A barley leaf zzso library has been screened with two zzso zzso designed to zzso to zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso genes from higher zzso Two zzso zzso clones were identified as zzso strongly to one or both zzso The larger clone zzso contained a zzso zzso insert which was shown by primer extension analysis to be an almost full-length zzso Both clones were more closely related to zzso for the zzso form of zzso zzso from pea and zzso zzso than to zzso for the zzso form zzso A sequence identical to an zzso sequence determined from a zzso preparation of the mature zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso at zzso zzso indicating a zzso of at least 45 zzso zzso The zzso has only limited sequence zzso to the zzso of pea and zzso zzso zzso zzso but is similarly rich in basic zzso and possesses some of the structural features common to the targeting sequences of other zzso zzso The molecular zzso responsible for the zzso zzso of eight zzso zzso of barley were investigated using a zzso probe from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso and an zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso Three classes of zzso were zzso class I, in which absence of zzso material was correlated with low or zzso levels of zzso zzso class II, which had normal or increased levels of zzso zzso but very little zzso zzso and class III, which had significant amounts of zzso protein but little or no zzso zzso
