A bacterial strain named zzso with highly effective zzso degradation zzso was isolated from soil after zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso identification system zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing methods, strain zzso was identified as zzso zzso Further experiments were carried out to zzso the growth of strain zzso and the zzso degradation activity by high performance liquid zzso zzso The optimal conditions were found as zzso initial pH zzso incubation temperature zzso zzso concentration 6 g zzso zzso amount zzso and incubation time 5 zzso Under the optimal conditions, stain zzso zzso zzso of zzso This is the first report on zzso zzso with a capacity to zzso zzso zzso and it can degrade zzso zzso up to 12 g zzso zzso of zzso by strain zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso indicated that two concurrent pathways were capable of degrading zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso breakdown in zzso zzso zzso was achieved by the zzso zzso activity and the zzso zzso zzso
