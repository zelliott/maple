The pea zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene was zzso It codes for a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and has zzso zzso zzso activity, catalyzing the three step zzso of zzso to zzso acid in the zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso gene because in three independent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has altered zzso and the zzso zzso when expressed in zzso failed to metabolize zzso The zzso zzso of pea are zzso deficient and have reduced zzso zzso and root zzso One zzso zzso also causes a large increase in seed zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso zzso including zzso roots, and seeds, and appears to be a zzso zzso zzso in sensitivity to the zzso synthesis zzso zzso between the zzso appear to result from the distinct nature of the genetic zzso These differences may also explain the zzso differences between the zzso
