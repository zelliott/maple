zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso remain poorly zzso and parts of the zzso remain zzso This situation may be explained, in part, by the difficulty of expressing active, functional zzso forms of these zzso The use of newly available expression plasmids and hosts has allowed the expression and isolation of zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso This accomplishment has permitted studies that zzso to the best of our knowledge, the first characterization of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization indicates that, under optimal zzso conditions, which include 4 M zzso the zzso exhibits zzso efficiency and zzso zzso at zzso levels comparable to those reported for the zzso from zzso zzso This zzso is unique in that it is the first zzso zzso zzso that is insensitive to feedback zzso zzso by zzso The zzso supports reaction zzso in the presence of various organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso by zzso a specific inhibitor known to affect zzso and zzso forms of the zzso with zzso determined Ki and zzso values of zzso zzso 120 zzso and 17 zzso 3 zzso zzso In in zzso experiments, zzso blocks the propagation of zzso zzso cells, indicating the critical role that the zzso zzso plays in zzso zzso by these zzso
