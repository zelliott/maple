The zzso organ zzso detects zzso in many zzso species but is likely to be vestigial in zzso zzso a gene that is essential for zzso function in the zzso is a zzso in zzso Because zzso is expressed only in the zzso the loss of selective pressure on this gene can serve as a molecular marker for the time at which the zzso became zzso By analyzing sequence data from the zzso gene of 15 extant zzso species, we provide evidence that the zzso was most likely functional in the common zzso of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys and apes, but then became vestigial in the common zzso of Old World monkeys and zzso We propose that, at this point in evolution, other zzso notably the development of color vision, may have largely replaced signaling by zzso
