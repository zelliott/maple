zzso zzso critical to muscle function, is dictated by the zzso filament zzso which acts as a molecular zzso To date, the molecular events underlying the mechanics of the folded zzso chain remain largely zzso We have zzso the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso from the elastic zzso fraction of zzso and validated its zzso in solution using small angle zzso zzso The long-range properties of the chain have been zzso by electron zzso on a zzso zzso and modeled for the full skeletal zzso zzso show that zzso zzso transition motifs generate zzso in the structure of the filament, where zzso stiff segments zzso with zzso hinges form a regular pattern of dynamic zzso leading to zzso flexibility in the zzso zzso hinges support molecular shape zzso that dominate chain behavior at moderate stretch, whereas stiffer segments predictably oppose high stretch forces upon full chain zzso There, zzso zzso can be expected to act as an energy barrier to prevent zzso unfolding while, instead, triggering the unraveling of zzso springs formed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose a zzso model based on freely zzso rigid segments that zzso the response to stretch of zzso zzso according to molecular zzso
