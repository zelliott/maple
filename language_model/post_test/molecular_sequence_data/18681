zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly sensitive and specific markers of zzso arthritis zzso Identification of zzso zzso that may detect different zzso of zzso patients might have diagnostic and zzso zzso We have investigated zzso and zzso zzso pairs derived from zzso collagen or zzso and compared this zzso panel with the zzso zzso conventionally used to detect zzso Furthermore, we studied if the same zzso identify zzso cells in in zzso cultures of zzso B zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and collagen zzso zzso were tested by zzso zzso system, by indirect zzso and by a zzso zzso B cells were zzso from blood by negative zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso The panel composed of zzso zzso of zzso collagen and zzso was recognized by zzso zzso with a sensitivity and specificity comparable with the currently used zzso Moreover, the combined zzso panel including the new short zzso zzso of zzso zzso also identified nearly one-third of zzso cases that were negative for zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or for zzso zzso The results with the zzso zzso have shown that although most zzso recognizing the four zzso peptides are zzso some of them specifically recognizing zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso are zzso and so may be produced either by newly formed activated B cells or by zzso B memory zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso and zzso detect zzso cells, and so could also be applied to study the B cells of zzso zzso
