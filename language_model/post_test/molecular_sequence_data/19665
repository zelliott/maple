In contrast to zzso zzso which are assembled into zzso during DNA zzso zzso zzso can be incorporated into specific regions of the zzso throughout the cell zzso Recent findings suggest that zzso zzso associate with factors zzso their deposition into specialized zzso zzso The mechanisms of their targeted deposition, their zzso and their zzso modification are not yet fully zzso Emerging evidence indicates that zzso zzso and associated factors are essential for the zzso control of gene expression and other cellular zzso Thus, zzso zzso and complexes involved in their exchange are likely to play major roles in controlling zzso architecture, and their deregulation is expected to be linked to zzso infertility, mental disorders, zzso and degenerative zzso
