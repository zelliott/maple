Recent major advances have been made in understanding how zzso events are achieved in the course of protein zzso Specifically, several studies have shed light into the dynamic process of how nascent chains emerging from the zzso are supported by protein zzso factors to ensure both processing and folding zzso To take into account the awareness that coordination is needed, a new zzso zzso recently proposed simultaneous action of both processes on the zzso In the model, any emerging nascent chain is first encountered by the zzso trigger factor zzso which forms an open cradle underneath the zzso exit zzso This cradle serves as a passive router that channels the nascent chains to the first zzso event, the zzso event performed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso this model clearly raises more questions than it zzso Does the data used to develop this model stand up to scrutiny and, if not, what are the alternative mechanisms that the data zzso
