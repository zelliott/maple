Most proteins exported from zzso cells contain a signal sequence which mediates targeting to and zzso into the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso Involved in this process are the zzso particle zzso and zzso protein zzso the zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the signal sequence on nascent zzso chains and zzso their further zzso which resumes only after interaction of the arrested zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso particle zzso a zzso zzso and six zzso with relative molecular masses zzso of 9,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins are essential for zzso arrest and the zzso zzso is required for zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso protein binds to the signal sequence when it emerges from the zzso zzso protein consists of two zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso No components structurally zzso to zzso and zzso protein have yet been found in zzso or zzso zzso To understand the molecular nature of the interaction between the signal sequence and its zzso we have characterized a complementary DNA coding for the zzso protein of zzso zzso sequence zzso was found to part of zzso alpha and two zzso coli proteins of unknown zzso The zzso region includes a putative zzso zzso
