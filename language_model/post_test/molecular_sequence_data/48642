zzso are highly zzso insects and show a division of labor zzso zzso distinct individuals specialize in distinct zzso In the lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals form the worker and soldier zzso which specialize in helping zzso zzso care, cleaning, zzso and defense behaviors, zzso Workers are zzso juveniles that can either undergo status quo zzso or develop into soldiers or zzso zzso This zzso differentiation can be regulated by juvenile hormone zzso and primer zzso contained in soldier head extracts zzso Here we offered worker termites a cellulose diet treated with zzso or zzso for zzso or held them with live soldiers zzso or live zzso zzso zzso We then determined gene expression profiles of the host zzso gut and zzso zzso zzso using custom zzso zzso containing zzso individual zzso 

zzso was the most influential treatment zzso total zzso zzso followed by zzso (24 zzso zzso (12 zzso and zzso treatments (6 zzso The majority of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were of host and zzso origin, zzso in contrast, zzso zzso and zzso treatments had more uniform impacts on host and zzso gene zzso Repeat zzso zzso investigating combined zzso impacts in relation to individual zzso and zzso treatments on a subset of zzso genes revealed zzso zzso and zzso treatments had opposite impacts on gene expression and zzso zzso impacts on gene expression were generally intermediate between zzso and zzso 

Our results show that zzso impacts hundreds of zzso and zzso genes within zzso strongly suggesting a role for the zzso gut in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, differential impacts of zzso and zzso treatments were observed that are in strong agreement with previous studies that specifically investigated soldier zzso zzso However, it is likely that gene expression outside the gut may be of equal or greater importance than gut gene zzso
