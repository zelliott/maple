zzso is a potent full zzso at both the human zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is a potent full zzso at the zzso zzso but is a similarly potent competitive zzso at the zzso zzso To delineate the structural zzso of zzso versus antagonism in these species zzso we expressed a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cells and assessed the capacity of zzso and zzso to mobilize zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the corresponding region of the zzso zzso resulted in a zzso that was activated zzso by zzso whereas replacement of the second zzso loop zzso of the zzso zzso with that of the zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso that was activated fully by zzso and near fully by zzso albeit with lower zzso than those observed at the zzso zzso These zzso were increased, and zzso was converted to a full zzso by replacing both the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso with the corresponding regions from the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the five divergent zzso acids in zzso between the two receptors revealed that three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the capacity of zzso to impart zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the second zzso loop and the zzso zzso form a functional motif that plays a key role in determining whether zzso functions as an zzso or zzso at zzso zzso zzso
