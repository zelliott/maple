To clarify the functional mechanism of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso particularly in the regulation of insect development, the zzso zzso a zzso of zzso proteins was cloned from the cabbage zzso zzso zzso named zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso cell proliferation in a zzso manner of zzso and zzso cell lines that were derived from fat bodies and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso was detected using zzso and zzso as zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that during the zzso development the level of zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso cells and in the zzso zzso of zzso cells, which suggests that zzso protein may execute its zzso zzso activity at the zzso zzso of zzso cells to convert zzso into zzso
