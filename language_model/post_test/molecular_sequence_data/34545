In an attempt to determine a cold defense mechanism in plants, we have attempted to characterize changes occurring in the expression of zzso transcript levels in the hot pepper zzso zzso using zzso zzso analysis, combined with Northern zzso zzso After zzso a zzso K hot pepper zzso zzso we isolated a total of 317 cold zzso zzso We selected 42 genes which were zzso and three genes which were zzso due to cold treatment, for further zzso Among the 45 genes which appeared to be zzso by cold, 19 genes appeared to be simultaneously regulated by salt zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso we identified a variety of zzso factors, zzso a family of 4 zzso element binding protein zzso designated zzso to zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso Ring domain zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso As mentioned earlier, several genes appeared to be induced not only by cold stress, but also simultaneously by salt zzso These genes zzso zzso zzso putative zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso abundant protein 5 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and the putative zzso zzso transfer protein zzso
