This paper reports an improvement in the zzso of zzso zzso expressed from zzso coli by inverse transition cycling zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso libraries having zzso and zzso zzso zzso and molecular weights ranging from 4 to zzso zzso showed greater salt sensitivity in their inverse transition behavior than purely zzso zzso zzso yield of zzso zzso was an unpredictable function of guest zzso zzso but reducing the molecular weight of the zzso tag generally increased zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is the shortest zzso used to purify any protein by zzso to zzso A zzso zzso zzso with a guest zzso composition of zzso of zzso was found to be the optimal zzso tag to purify zzso as it provided 50% greater zzso yield and only required one-fifth the added zzso for zzso of zzso as compared to previously used zzso zzso zzso
