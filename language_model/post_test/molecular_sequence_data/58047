The zzso half of the heavy chain of zzso toxin zzso contains the domain required for binding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structural requirements for the interaction of zzso with zzso were studied by generating zzso of zzso with deletions at either the zzso or zzso zzso and characterizing their zzso A deletion of 10 or more zzso acids from the zzso zzso resulted in a major loss of zzso binding to zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso cells, whereas a deletion of the zzso 5 zzso acids did not affect zzso The removal of up to 263 zzso acids from the zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso Each of the truncated proteins was much more sensitive to zzso than was full-length zzso suggesting an zzso in zzso The zzso binding activity of zzso was not retained in a zzso corresponding to the zzso 20 zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso region of zzso is important for maintaining a zzso necessary for binding to zzso
