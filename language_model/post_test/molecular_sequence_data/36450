zzso zzso zzso are composed of approximately 15 zzso zzso of similar sizes zzso weight zzso zzso zzso but different charges zzso point zzso zzso Previously, we deduced the primary structures of 6 zzso of rat zzso by zzso DNA zzso In this paper we report the zzso sequences of 4 other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso determined from zzso clones isolated by screening a rat zzso zzso cell zzso library with the zzso of their human counterparts as zzso The zzso deduced from their zzso sequences consisted of zzso zzso 202, and 219 zzso acid zzso with calculated molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and calculated zzso points of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results and previous findings indicate that the primary structures of the zzso of rat zzso show considerably high zzso zzso but can be classified into apparently distinct zzso suggesting that rat zzso genes form a zzso family with the same evolutionary origin, but have zzso during evolution to acquire possibly zzso zzso
