Members of the zzso zzso 3A zzso catalyze the metabolism of zzso zzso environmental zzso and clinically important zzso compounds, such as prescription drugs and therapeutic zzso In particular, the zzso and zzso genes play an especially important role in zzso since they metabolize zzso of the drugs on the zzso However, known genetic zzso at these two zzso are not sufficient to account for the observed zzso zzso in drug zzso We used a comparative zzso approach to identify zzso coding and zzso regions at these genes and zzso them in three ethnically diverse human zzso We show that remarkable zzso differences exist with regard to frequency spectrum and zzso zzso The zzso samples are characterized by a marked excess of rare zzso and the presence of a homogeneous group of long-range zzso at high zzso The zzso zzso which is likely to influence salt and water retention and risk for zzso hypertension, was zzso in zzso individuals from 52 worldwide population zzso The results reveal an unusual geographic pattern zzso the zzso frequency shows extreme variation across human populations and is significantly correlated with distance from the zzso Furthermore, we show that an zzso zzso zzso zzso previously implicated in hypertension and zzso exhibits a similar geographic distribution and is significantly correlated in frequency with zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso that influence salt zzso were the targets of a shared selective pressure that resulted from an environmental variable correlated with zzso
