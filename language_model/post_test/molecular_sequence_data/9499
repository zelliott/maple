zzso are main reservoirs for zzso worldwide, which is an important public health issue because it constitutes one of the big challenges in rabies zzso Yet, little is known about how the virus is maintained among zzso and the zzso relationships remain poorly zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the distribution of the rabies virus zzso in bat zzso and zzso and to genetically characterize virus zzso from naturally infected zzso zzso The zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and sequencing using zzso to the zzso coding gene were zzso The results showed a dissemination of the zzso in different zzso and zzso particularly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and feces, suggesting other possible forms of zzso elimination and the possibility of transmission among these zzso The zzso analysis confirmed that different zzso of zzso are maintained by zzso bats in nature and have similar tissue distribution irrespective of bat species and zzso zzso
