We have recently zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which is expressed predominantly in adult visceral and vascular smooth zzso Here we show that the adult vascular smooth muscle cell line zzso which retains the capacity to zzso zzso (a marker of the zzso zzso also expressed zzso However, an embryonic smooth muscle cell line zzso which lacks zzso expressed low levels of zzso zzso of zzso increased in zzso zzso and A10 cells, and were elevated in response to zzso zzso zzso is therefore a good marker of the zzso smooth muscle zzso We have zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter and shown that it lacks a conventional zzso zzso There are multiple zzso start sites, the most zzso of which are inside an zzso sequence zzso which is close to two CT boxes and a zzso zzso A minimal zzso construct zzso containing the zzso a CT box and zzso element directed high-level zzso zzso zzso expression in the differentiated smooth muscle cell line zzso and low-level expression in the embryonic smooth muscle cell line zzso This fits well with the pattern of expression of the zzso zzso A construct zzso containing all of the zzso initiation sites directed a reduced level of zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the major zzso start site displayed even lower zzso zzso comparisons suggest that the zzso promoter evolved from the main zzso promoter which is active in wide range of cell zzso The zzso promoter may have acquired negative regulatory elements as expression of the gene became zzso
