A portion of the human zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso the translated portion of the zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso The primary templates for sequencing were isolated from a human zzso library zzso positive plaques from 400,000 screened initially with a zzso zzso zzso or were produced by zzso amplification using zzso zzso DNA as the amplification zzso Potential hormone response elements zzso were identified at either end of the zzso These zzso have sequences based on the consensus zzso of zzso hormone response zzso although it is unclear whether the structures are functional zzso Other potential regulatory elements also were identified towards the 3' end of the zzso
