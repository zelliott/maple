zzso zzso has become the focus of systems biology research for improved zzso crop zzso In plant systems biology, several comparative studies have been carried out using liquid zzso shotgun mass zzso zzso and zzso protein identification analyses in combination with the spectral count for relative zzso In order to receive optimal protein identification rates and spectral count zzso zzso tandem mass zzso with zzso separation of more than 1 h is zzso Thus zzso analyses time is the bottleneck for zzso research of experiments with high sample zzso describe a novel method, called zzso zzso selective zzso zzso that allows for comparative zzso of target peptides combined with a significant reduction in zzso analysis zzso In future, it will be a useful tool to detect zzso selected zzso patterns for the targeted analysis of protein turnover and zzso We provide a first reference library of selected target peptides generated for zzso zzso leaf zzso These peptides are also suitable candidates for selective reaction monitoring zzso
