The aim of the present study was to characterize 24 zzso of group C zzso zzso by analysis of DNA sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of several Brazilian zzso 

All zzso strains were confirmed by zzso gel zzso and were characterized by sequence and zzso analysis of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Analysis of the zzso gene from Brazilian strains revealed that the zzso are more closely related to each other than to those of other strains previously zzso The zzso gene showed high zzso to Indian zzso The sequences of zzso and zzso genes showed two lineages circulating in Brazil in the same region and at the same zzso 

These results confirm the transmission of zzso in zzso zzso infection appears to occur occasionally despite the low detection rate of the zzso
