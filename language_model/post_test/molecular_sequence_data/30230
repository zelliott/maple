The gene zzso the zzso of zzso zzso binding regulatory proteins zzso has been cloned from the zzso zzso zzso The predicted 340 zzso acid sequence matches the highly zzso zzso acid sequences of previously isolated zzso zzso from zzso and zzso The coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been mapped to the zzso zzso zzso II, is interrupted by eight zzso Southern analysis indicates that zzso zzso has only one zzso zzso A zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso bases or zzso transcript derived from this gene could be zzso
