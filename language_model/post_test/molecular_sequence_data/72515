For the first time, an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistently zzso with serum samples from zzso patients has been zzso and zzso and its coding gene zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso is a zzso with four zzso sugar chains zzso zzso zzso each) which are not necessary for zzso with immune human zzso The zzso part is zzso as a zzso precursor of zzso zzso that after zzso of a putative signal zzso of 16 zzso zzso zzso a mature protein of 261 zzso acids with a molecular mass of 29 zzso and a zzso of zzso (as deduced from the zzso The zzso protein is zzso identical to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso identical to an unpublished zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso and most of the zzso sites are perfectly zzso in the three zzso suggesting a similar but yet unknown zzso Analysis of the primary structure of the zzso coding gene zzso has allowed the establishment of a clear relationship between several previously reported zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
