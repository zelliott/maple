zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zinc fingers zzso domain are implicated in a broad variety of biological zzso including DNA zzso regulation of gene zzso and organization of zzso zzso zzso domain containing zzso proteins like zzso and zzso display limited sequence similarity with the zzso zzso from zzso a protein zzso with a zzso zzso We show that mouse zzso a zzso zzso protein that we named zzso and human zzso bind zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso is also zzso In contrast to zzso zzso binding by zzso and zzso was specifically inhibited by excess zzso The zzso binding pocket is located in the zzso half of zzso Our findings indicate that zzso but not all, zzso domain proteins possess an zzso zzso binding zzso
