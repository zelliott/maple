African women frequently acquire several genetically distinct human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso from a zzso partner, whereas the acquisition of multiple zzso appears to be rare in zzso To determine whether newly infected individuals in other risk groups acquire genetically diverse zzso we examined the viral envelope sequences in plasma samples from 13 women and 4 men from the United States infected with zzso B viruses and 10 men from Kenya infected with zzso B zzso zzso envelope sequences differed by more than zzso in three zzso women, one zzso man, and one Kenyan man near the time of zzso These findings suggest that early zzso genetic diversity is not exclusive to women from Africa or to infection with any particular zzso zzso
