zzso zzso is a major zzso pathogen that has the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We previously found that a cell surface component on zzso zzso is able to induce zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso signaling in zzso cells and that this component can be zzso by zzso In this study, we zzso this component from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obtained two candidate zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso analysis showed that the zzso with molecular masses of 123 and 43 zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which we refer to as zzso zzso A zzso reacted with zzso that could effectively inhibit the activity of zzso to induce zzso zzso in zzso cells, but zzso did zzso To further determine what protein is responsible for the zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso and zzso zzso deletion zzso from zzso When zzso cells were exposed to those zzso the zzso deletion zzso did not induce zzso zzso whereas the zzso and zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso cells induced by zzso was partially inhibited by zzso against a zzso protein expressed from the zzso third of zzso These results indicate that zzso is one of the factors that induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso gene was present in four of seven zzso zzso strains zzso This restricted distribution might be associated with the zzso potential of each zzso
