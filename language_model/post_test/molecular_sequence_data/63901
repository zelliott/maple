One effective way to study the biological function of a protein in zzso is to zzso it and see what happens to the zzso For proteins that are zzso for cell zzso the corresponding gene can simply be deleted from its zzso zzso The study of essential proteins is more challenging, however, because the function of the protein must be zzso zzso Here, we describe a method that allows the target protein to be depleted rapidly and zzso so that the immediate effects on the cell can be zzso The zzso locus of a budding zzso gene is modified so that a zzso zzso zzso is added to the N zzso of the zzso zzso causing it to be zzso by a specific zzso zzso when cells are shifted from 24 degrees to 37 degrees zzso zzso requires recognition of the zzso cassette by the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is associated with a zzso zzso To promote rapid and conditional depletion of the target zzso we use a zzso strain in which expression of the zzso gene can be either zzso or strongly zzso zzso strains are constructed by a simple zzso approach using the zzso chain zzso
