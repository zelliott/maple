Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were previously isolated from breakdowns of cheese manufacture in zzso Complete zzso sequence analysis indicated that both zzso contained linear zzso zzso zzso zzso in length for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 48 open reading frames zzso were identified for zzso and zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis showed that these zzso shared many similarities with the eight previously studied zzso and zzso infecting different zzso zzso zzso In particular, part of the zzso zzso was highly similar to a region of zzso zzso which was thought to be unique to this latter zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso identified three major proteins and seven minor zzso Parallel structural zzso analysis of zzso revealed seven protein bands, two of which were related to major structural zzso as expected for a zzso zzso zzso to other zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso diversity is not extensive in worldwide dairy factories possibly because related zzso bacterial strains are used in starter zzso
