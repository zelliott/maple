In this work, we have analyzed the relative importance of secondary versus zzso interactions in stabilizing and guiding protein zzso For this purpose, we have designed four different zzso to replace the zzso of the zzso domain by a sequence with strong zzso propensity in zzso In particular, we have chosen the sequence of the second zzso of the zzso domain, which populates the native zzso in zzso solution to a significant zzso The resulting protein has roughly 30 % of its sequence duplicated and maintains the zzso of the zzso zzso but with lower stability (up to -5 zzso The loss of intrinsic zzso stability accounts for about 80 % of the decrease in free energy, illustrating the importance of local interactions in protein zzso Interestingly enough, all the zzso zzso included the one with the duplicated zzso zzso fold with similar rates as the zzso zzso Essentially, it is the nature of the zzso step in the folding reaction that determines whether a particular interaction will speed up, or not, the folding zzso While local contacts are important in determining protein stability, zzso involved in zzso contacts in combination with the zzso of the native fold, seem to be responsible for the specificity of protein zzso zzso with non-native secondary structure tendencies can adopt stable folds and be as efficient in folding as those proteins with zzso zzso
