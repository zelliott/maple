zzso zzso are zzso chemicals perceived mainly by the zzso organ zzso for zzso zzso zzso apes, and Old World zzso monkeys lack functional genes responsible for the zzso signal zzso and are generally insensitive to zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that the evolutionary deterioration of zzso sensitivity occurred because zzso communication became redundant after the emergence of full zzso color vision via the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in the common zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, full zzso also evolved in the New World zzso zzso monkeys via an independent zzso of the same zzso Here we zzso from three species of zzso monkeys an essential component of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, the gene zzso the zzso channel zzso In contrast to those of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequences have none of the characteristics of zzso This and other observations indicate that zzso monkeys have maintained both their systems of zzso communication and full zzso vision, suggesting that the presence of full zzso alone does not lead to the loss of zzso zzso We suggest that the ecological differences between zzso and zzso zzso particularly in habitat selection, may have also affected the evolution of zzso zzso
