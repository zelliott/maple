A comparison of the efficiency of sequencing random zzso DNA fragments versus random zzso for the discovery of new genes in African zzso was zzso zzso DNA was sheared to a zzso zzso size distribution, cloned into a zzso and the sequences at both ends of 183 cloned fragments zzso zzso of both zzso and nuclear DNA were zzso New coding regions were discovered for a variety of zzso including cell division zzso an zzso protein and a zzso of the zzso surface zzso zzso In some cases, each end of a zzso was found to contain a different zzso demonstrating the proximity of those genes and suggesting that the density of genes in the African zzso zzso is quite zzso zzso sequence elements found included zzso zzso repeats, 76 zzso repeats associated with zzso gene expression sites, 177 zzso satellite repeats in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso sequencing, no zzso protein genes were zzso For the sake of comparison, the sequences of 190 expressed sequence tags zzso were also determined, and a similar number of new zzso zzso were found including zzso of another putative surface protein and a human zzso zzso zzso We conclude from this analysis and our previous work that sequencing random DNA fragments in African zzso is as efficient for gene discovery as is sequencing random zzso zzso
