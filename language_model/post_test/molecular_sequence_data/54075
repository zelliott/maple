Gene therapy applications of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso have been limited to introducing genes into dividing target zzso Here, we report genetically engineered zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso necrosis virus zzso which are capable of infecting zzso zzso This has been achieved by introducing a nuclear zzso signal zzso sequence into the zzso protein zzso of zzso by zzso zzso This increased the efficiency of infecting zzso cells and was sufficient to zzso the virus with the capability to efficiently zzso zzso human T zzso and zzso primary zzso zzso We demonstrate that this zzso actively zzso the nucleus of a target cell, and has potential use as a gene therapy zzso to transfer genes into zzso zzso
