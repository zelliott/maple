Type zzso and type zzso zzso each possess the ability to pass one DNA duplex through another in an zzso zzso The role of zzso in the strand passage reaction is poorly zzso particularly for the type zzso zzso zzso zzso We have solved the structure of the zzso zzso of zzso VI zzso in two zzso an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso We find that zzso is highly structurally zzso to the entire zzso zzso zzso region of type zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso leads to zzso of the protein and causes dramatic zzso changes within each zzso Our data demonstrate that type zzso and type zzso zzso have descended from a common zzso and reveal how zzso turnover generates structural signals in the reactions of both type II zzso zzso When combined with the structure of the A zzso to create a picture of the intact zzso VI zzso the zzso motions of zzso reveal a simple mechanism for strand passage by the type zzso zzso
