We have investigated the mechanism of zzso termination in zzso by spinach zzso zzso zzso using templates zzso zzso of the zzso structure zzso of the regulatory region of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Fourteen sequence zzso located within its zzso zzso and zzso regions were zzso We found that the zzso integrity in the zzso structure is necessary for termination but that its stability is not directly correlated with termination zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso itself also influences zzso Moreover, the zzso template stretch at the 3' end of the zzso plays a major role in termination efficiency, but base pairing between the A and U tract of the transcript does zzso From the studies using deletion zzso and a series of zzso that alter the sequences immediately downstream from the zzso termination site, we found that termination of zzso by spinach zzso zzso zzso was also modulated by downstream DNA sequences in a zzso zzso The second base immediately following the zzso tract is crucial for determining the termination efficiency by zzso zzso zzso but not of the zzso or zzso zzso
