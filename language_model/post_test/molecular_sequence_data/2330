The zzso virus zzso zzso contains two zzso elements which are required for stable zzso zzso maintenance in zzso infected zzso The first consists of 20 zzso zzso repeats, each of which contains a zzso site for zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso the zzso factor required for zzso zzso The second element is composed of a zzso zzso zzso containing four zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed which reduce the number of zzso sites in the zzso repeats, alter the number of zzso sites in the zzso region, or zzso the zzso zzso The effect of the deletion zzso on zzso maintenance was examined by zzso zzso zzso containing both the zzso zzso sequences and a drug resistance marker, into zzso zzso The plasmids were tested for their ability to generate drug-resistant zzso cell colonies and their capacity to be maintained in an zzso form without undergoing extensive zzso zzso plasmids with 12 or 15 copies of the zzso repeats were wild type in both zzso zzso with just two or six copies of these repeated elements failed to generate drug-resistant colonies at a normal level, and normal zzso plasmids were not detected in the resulting zzso zzso colonies of cells resulting from zzso of these two- or zzso zzso contained zzso zzso forms of the input zzso The zzso most often produced zzso zzso containing a minimum of eight zzso repeated zzso The rearranged plasmids were shown to be zzso for zzso maintenance in that they yielded zzso or greater numbers of drug-resistant colonies and persisted at the zzso or a greater zzso copy zzso By use of an zzso zzso that contained no zzso zzso no zzso could be zzso One to five copies of a synthetic zzso corresponding to a consensus zzso repeated element inserted into a zzso with no zzso elements now permitted the generation of zzso zzso forms of the zzso test zzso These experiments demonstrate a requirement for a minimal number (six to eight zzso of the zzso repeated zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region had little or no effect upon the ability to generate enhanced numbers of drug-resistant zzso zzso indicating that the zzso repeated element is predominantly required for this zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
