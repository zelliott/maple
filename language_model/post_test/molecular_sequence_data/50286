Basic zzso zzso regulatory proteins are known to bind to a single DNA consensus sequence referred to as an zzso The zzso is present in the regulatory elements of many zzso controlled zzso including most zzso genes such as zzso I zzso Although the zzso consensus is minimally defined as zzso the adjacent zzso of functional zzso are variable for genes regulated by the zzso zzso In order to examine how zzso regulatory regions containing different internal and zzso zzso function when placed within the context of a single regulatory element, the zzso region zzso zzso present within the zzso zzso was zzso with the corresponding zzso sequences derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso regulatory elements as well as from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso the zzso sequence derived from cardiac zzso was inactive whereas the corresponding sequence from the zzso right zzso efficiently restored zzso zzso activity in muscle zzso Intermediate levels of gene activity were observed for zzso enhancers containing zzso derived from the zzso left zzso site or from the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding studies of zzso protein complexes with each zzso zzso zzso confirmed that DNA binding activity in zzso mimics the relative strength of the enhancers in zzso These studies demonstrate that the specific zzso composition of individual zzso which are contained within the regulatory elements of most if not all zzso zzso contributes to the complex regulatory mechanisms governing zzso gene zzso
