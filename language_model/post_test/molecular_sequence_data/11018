While zzso genes zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso each have a single zzso all of the other insect zzso genes reported so far are zzso We analyzed four zzso genes linked to the two zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso Three have a single zzso at the same position as zzso and zzso the fourth is zzso and lies between zzso bearing zzso Finally, in addition to its zzso one gene zzso was recently interrupted by zzso zzso analyses show that the six genes in zzso zzso zzso share common ancestry with five zzso genes in the zzso related species zzso zzso and that a zzso ancestral cluster predates the divergence of the two zzso One gene in the ancestral cluster gave rise to zzso in zzso zzso and duplicated in zzso zzso zzso to create zzso and zzso From zzso calculations of evolutionary distances since zzso zzso zzso and zzso evolved zzso while zzso in zzso zzso evolved slowly compared to other zzso genes in the zzso While these four zzso are under selective pressure, we suggest that most zzso zzso genes were not selected for their unique zzso Instead, we propose that high gene copy number itself was selected because conditions favored organisms that could zzso more zzso High gene copy number selection to produce more of a useful product may be the basis of forming zzso families, all of whose members initially accumulate neutral zzso while retaining essential zzso Maintenance of a large family of zzso genes not only ensured high levels of zzso production, but may have facilitated the extensive divergence of zzso into as many as zzso zzso
