zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso occurs prior to zzso zzso specifically at the site of impending zzso infection zzso Cook, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Howell, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plant Cell 7: zzso We examined the distribution and structure of zzso transcript throughout zzso zzso We determined that expression of zzso in root tips is correlated with the competence of this zone for symbiotic association, whereas after zzso infection zzso transcript is specifically associated with the zone of zzso development, including nascent zzso zzso zzso transcripts are characterized by multiple zzso sites distributed within 200 to 400 zzso of the translation stop site, and a single major zzso initiation site in close proximity to the zzso open reading zzso Thus, zzso expression is likely to be zzso through effects on a single zzso zzso Immediately zzso of the zzso zzso unit DNA sequence analysis identified a zzso DNA element containing extensive repeat structure that is widely distributed in the zzso zzso zzso
