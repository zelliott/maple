zzso acid zzso zzso genes were isolated by a differential screening procedure from a human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso Among yet unidentified genes zzso zzso one codes for a protein with multiple finger motifs and has previously been detected in zzso cells after tumor necrosis zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso et zzso zzso the second one codes for a zzso of the I zzso B family zzso et zzso 1991), and a third one for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the expression of these zzso zzso But the extent of the respective induction correlated neither with the number of the two receptors alpha or beta nor with the level of zzso zzso zzso on zzso Although zzso were less abundant than zzso zzso binding sites were estimated for zzso zzso zzso zzso 20,000 for zzso zzso zzso zzso 35,000 for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso was significantly less than that evoked by zzso some of the investigated genes were more strongly induced by zzso We discuss how the differences in the biological potency of the zzso zzso may reside in different functions of the two receptors by zzso of alternative signaling zzso
