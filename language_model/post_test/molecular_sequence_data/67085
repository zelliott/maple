The human zzso zzso zzso binds to a linear 10 zzso acid zzso that is present within the zzso region of the zzso envelope zzso of zzso Here we show that this short sequence zzso can function as a tag for the detection of zzso proteins using zzso zzso The zzso tag was recognized by zzso whether present at the zzso or zzso of zzso proteins and zzso zzso proteins could be zzso with multiple zzso techniques such as zzso western zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso of zzso using different constant regions or constant regions from different species enhances the convenience and range of use of this system which we term the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso System or zzso
