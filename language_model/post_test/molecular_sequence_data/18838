In this work, we present experimental data, supported by a quantitative model, on the generation and effect of potential zzso across a zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso with, to the best of our knowledge, novel zzso A challenge to generating potential zzso across zzso arises from the zzso coordination chemistry requiring an zzso metal such as gold, resulting in any zzso applied zzso source being zzso coupled to the zzso This in turn causes any potential across the zzso assembly to zzso to zero in milliseconds to seconds, depending on the level of membrane zzso zzso zzso applied to zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso can, however, provide zzso zzso data that may be used to measure the zzso dependency of the membrane zzso We show that potential zzso zzso zzso induce membrane defects that permit the zzso of zzso zzso Further, we report here the novel (to our zzso use of real-time modeling of conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify whether the zzso arising from the zzso of a zzso is uniform or zzso on scales of zzso to zzso across the zzso The utility of this zzso architecture and these techniques is demonstrated by characterizing the resulting zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso
