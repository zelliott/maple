Signal recognition particle zzso is a zzso complex involved in the targeting of zzso proteins to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contains the protein zzso which is an important structural and functional zzso believed to promote the assembly of the zzso We have zzso the human zzso protein to zzso from zzso bacteria which zzso the zzso and have studied details of the binding to zzso zzso via gel mobility shift and zzso sensitivity zzso zzso interacts with two zzso zzso zzso with different affinities such that the more compact zzso species is bound more zzso Furthermore, binding was found to be highly zzso zzso zzso and Hill zzso were determined for several zzso zzso zzso in which individual zzso zzso were zzso These results confirmed that both zzso zzso zzso 6 and 8 are important for zzso zzso zzso zzso structure probing of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the corresponding zzso complex showed that zzso may be due to zzso zzso changes in the large domain of the zzso zzso Finally, zzso bound specifically not only to zzso zzso but also to the zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso thereby indicating structural similarities between these two zzso zzso
