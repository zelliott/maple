zzso zzso 5 zzso is found in an active form only in zzso zzso zzso by virtue of association with the zzso zzso proteins zzso (or its truncated form zzso and zzso is the only mechanism currently shown to regulate zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso other members of the zzso family require for zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the case of zzso that is zzso in all zzso except zzso This site is zzso by zzso zzso which, however, do not zzso zzso To examine the possible existence of a zzso regulatory mechanism in the case of zzso we have metabolically labeled zzso cells with zzso and shown that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso expressed zzso also can be zzso by zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso cell zzso results in a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is zzso to the regulatory zzso in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso did not show similar zzso which suggests that zzso is also regulated by zzso at this zzso Like other members of the zzso family, zzso zzso activity is influenced by both zzso binding and zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso is distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that was reported previously to neither zzso zzso nor affect its zzso We also show that zzso zzso I, but not zzso zzso II, can zzso and activate zzso in zzso
