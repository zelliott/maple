zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to form zzso in de zzso zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso of ancient zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein was found to be a zzso zzso containing a single zinc zzso Although there is no other zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein completely lacked zzso activity at any temperature zzso However, zzso formed an active complex with zzso zzso zzso from the same zzso Whereas the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was close to the value observed for the zzso zzso the K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso showed that the complex exists as a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso probably in rapid zzso Complex formation protects both zzso and zzso against zzso degradation at temperatures near 100 degrees C where the zzso grows zzso These results lead to the zzso of both zzso zzso previously considered a Class C zzso now falls into Class A, whereas the zzso is a Class zzso zzso CD zzso indicated that association with zzso does not involve a significant zzso of the zzso secondary structure, but the visible zzso spectrum of a zzso zzso is appreciably altered upon complex formation suggesting a change in the electronic environment of the active zzso The association of zzso with zzso probably serves as a molecular switch that ensures that free, zzso zzso in the cell remains zzso At pH zzso the equilibrium ratio of zzso zzso to zzso is 17 and complex formation may drive the reaction in the zzso zzso
