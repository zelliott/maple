zzso zzso are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative maladies including Alzheimer's disease and the prion zzso The structures of zzso zzso are composed of zzso oriented zzso to the zzso axis zzso zzso zzso We previously reported the design and characterization of a zzso library of de zzso zzso proteins that zzso into zzso structures resembling zzso The libraries were designed by using a zzso zzso strategy, in which the locations of polar and zzso zzso are specified zzso but the identities of these zzso are not specified and are varied zzso The initial libraries were designed to zzso proteins containing zzso zzso separated by reverse zzso Each zzso was designed to be seven zzso long, with polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acids arranged with an alternating zzso zzso zzso The initial design specified the identical zzso pattern for all of the zzso no strand was explicitly designated to form the edges of the resulting zzso With all zzso preferring to occupy interior (as opposed to zzso locations, zzso zzso was favored, and the proteins assembled into zzso zzso To assess whether explicit design of zzso strands might tip the balance in favor of zzso zzso zzso we have now redesigned the first and/or last zzso of several sequences from the original zzso In the redesigned zzso the zzso pattern is changed from zzso zzso (K denotes zzso The presence of a zzso on the zzso face of a zzso should zzso zzso structures because such structures would bury an zzso zzso The zzso right zzso zzso zzso therefore, would be expected to favor zzso structures in which the zzso zzso sequences form edge strands with the charged zzso side chain accessible to zzso To test this hypothesis, we constructed several second generation sequences in which the central zzso zzso of either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso (or zzso is changed to zzso zzso of the redesigned proteins shows that they form zzso zzso zzso
