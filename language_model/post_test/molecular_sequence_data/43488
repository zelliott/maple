zzso acid zzso zzso has been defined as a major target zzso in zzso diabetes zzso zzso To identify the molecular zzso triggering a T cell response to zzso a panel of human zzso T zzso lines was generated from peripheral blood of three recent onset zzso zzso All lines derived from a patient expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized a single zzso localized between zzso acid positions zzso and 283 of zzso a stretch that is located in close proximity to the zzso region shared with zzso virus zzso zzso All lines with this specificity were restricted to the zzso zzso product of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso T cell response in a second patient zzso for zzso zzso demonstrated that the same zzso zzso zzso selected T cells specific for a different zzso The T cell response profile in a third patient showed that zzso zzso zzso could present at least three different zzso to zzso T zzso One of these zzso was presented by a DR zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell lines could not be isolated from zzso class zzso normal zzso Our data reveal that zzso the T cell response to zzso is quite zzso in recent onset zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso seems to be the principal restriction element used by T cells present at the onset of the zzso and zzso T cells responding to zzso containing identical sequences to zzso virus zzso protein were not zzso
