Human zzso zzso zzso abundantly zzso in the zzso carry long terminal repeats zzso that may potentially zzso to new zzso sites and zzso the neighboring cellular zzso However, normally zzso are either structurally defective or inactive due possibly to stringent negative control zzso To study the possible negative regulation of zzso we isolated the zzso of zzso and constructed zzso zzso for analysis of the promoter and zzso functions by using zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso Our results showed that in most zzso human cells the zzso zzso expression was negligible unless a sequence segment at the zzso zzso site was zzso In addition, we have found that the wild type zzso may inhibit whereas a zzso zzso zzso stimulate the zzso activity of zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso zzso while under negative control by its zzso zzso and by wild type zzso may become active upon zzso zzso
