A mechanism by which zzso binding to the zzso domain of a growth factor zzso causes zzso of its zzso zzso zzso domain is that binding promotes zzso zzso Recently we proposed a model in which zzso of the zzso zzso in one member of this family, rat zzso is zzso by the presence of three specific zzso This paper shows that a similar sequence motif is observed in 18 of the 20 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family of growth factor zzso The motif encompasses a five zzso segment in which position 0 zzso requires a small side chain zzso Ala, zzso zzso or zzso zzso an zzso side chain zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso only the smallest side chains zzso or zzso In addition other features of the zzso sequences are zzso It is concluded that the zzso of zzso zzso may be a general mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in this family of growth factor zzso
