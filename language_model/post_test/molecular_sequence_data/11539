zzso zzso in the zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso gene have been recently identified as causes of four zzso distinct zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso of the zzso syndromes is more complex than would be expected from their simple zzso inheritance zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been reported to cause both Pfeiffer and zzso syndrome zzso We now report the finding of a zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso affected with zzso syndrome zzso to zzso zzso that is identical to the zzso previously associated with zzso zzso We also report finding in a zzso zzso a zzso in the 3' end of zzso zzso (formerly referred to as zzso 5, zzso 7, or zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso which encodes the zzso terminal portion of the zzso III domain of the zzso zzso This zzso is common to both the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso unlike all previously reported zzso zzso which have been found only in the zzso zzso These findings reveal further unexpected complexity in the molecular zzso of these zzso zzso The data implies that zzso zzso in zzso itself (outside of zzso zzso or in other genes may determine specific aspects of the zzso of zzso zzso
