zzso structures play key roles in the replication of zzso zzso zzso alignment software, zzso zzso folding programs, and classical comparative zzso analysis were used to build models of six zzso elements in the coding region of the zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The importance of five of these elements was evaluated by zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the predicted zzso structures, designated zzso blocked zzso zzso implicating it as an essential zzso replication element zzso zzso is about 50 bases in length and is part of a larger predicted zzso structure zzso As confirmed by zzso structure zzso zzso consists of an zzso lower zzso a zzso upper zzso a zzso terminal loop, and an zzso internal zzso zzso analysis and structure probing were used to explore the importance of these zzso zzso sequences in the zzso were shown to be important for zzso zzso zzso and the upper zzso appears to serve as an essential scaffold that helps maintain the overall zzso zzso Unlike certain zzso zzso whose function is position independent, zzso function appears to be context zzso zzso the role of zzso and determining how this new zzso functions in the context of previously identified elements at the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso zzso should provide new insights into zzso zzso zzso
