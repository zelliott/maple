zzso peptides are a promising complement to common zzso development of resistance to which is a growing zzso Here we present a de zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration: zzso zzso zzso of the mode of action of this zzso revealed a strong interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso regulating the activity of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso binding and functional zzso of zzso were shown in zzso by a combination of zzso zzso and zzso methods, which were further genetically evidenced in zzso by analysis of zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was demonstrated using zzso secondary zzso mass zzso Moreover, zzso analysis revealed that zzso of numerous zzso involved in cell wall and zzso acid zzso transport mechanisms, zzso and zzso is zzso Interestingly, several zzso binding motif containing genes are induced by zzso In sum, the designed zzso zzso seems to have multiple modes of action, including zzso of a zzso and therefore might contribute to the development of new zzso compounds, giving bacterial zzso zzso a closer zzso
