Although mice from almost all zzso strains produce zzso zzso zzso in response to B cell zzso only zzso zzso zzso mice and mice from other strains that are genetically predisposed to zzso spontaneously produce zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso mice display marked B cell hyperactivity, zzso zzso production in these mice has been thought to result from spontaneous, zzso B cell zzso Although this may be true for zzso zzso zzso our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are not zzso Rather, zzso zzso zzso within an individual zzso mouse are zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are the products of zzso selective B cell stimulation and exhibit the same characteristics as secondary immune zzso to conventional zzso they are zzso they are zzso zzso and they are zzso zzso
