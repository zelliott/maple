An zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from water from an zzso zzso located in the zzso district of West zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains zzso as the zzso acid, zzso is the major zzso zzso : 1) and zzso : 1) are the major fatty acids and the DNA zzso content of the zzso is zzso zzso Based on these zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was identified as a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited maximum zzso zzso gene sequence similarity (95 zzso with zzso zzso however, strain zzso exhibited only 14 % similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Furthermore, strain zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso is more resistant to zzso and zzso is positive for zzso zzso zzso a number of carbon sources and exhibits quantitative differences in fatty acid composition and qualitative differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso is identified as a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
