Cellular zzso genes are rapidly and zzso activated when cells are zzso with many different growth zzso This review examines the function of a short zzso gene regulatory zzso the zzso Response zzso zzso that is sufficient for this transient zzso zzso The structures of zzso and zzso promoters are zzso followed by a summary of zzso regulatory zzso The roles of other zzso regulatory sequences in zzso and zzso cells are then zzso The properties of zzso binding proteins are zzso followed by a discussion of the effects of zzso on both zzso function and protein zzso Finally, possible models for zzso function are zzso
