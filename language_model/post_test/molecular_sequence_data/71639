The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein expressed exclusively in retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso gene have recently been identified in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso retinal zzso Here we report the characterization of a zzso canine zzso zzso The longest open reading frame predicts a zzso protein with a calculated molecular mass of about 61 zzso prior to protein zzso zzso comparison shows that zzso is highly zzso throughout zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso deletion zzso in putative zzso 5 of the canine zzso gene in affected animals of a highly zzso kinship of Swedish zzso dogs, in which an zzso zzso zzso and progressive retinal zzso zzso The deletion results in a zzso and leads to a premature stop zzso after inclusion of 52 canine zzso zzso acids from zzso 153 zzso More than two-thirds of the zzso zzso chain will be missing, and the zzso protein is most likely zzso zzso zzso Clinical features of the canine disease are quite similar to those described in zzso Therefore this form of canine retinal zzso provides an attractive animal model of the corresponding human disorder with immediate significance for various therapeutic approaches, including zzso zzso
