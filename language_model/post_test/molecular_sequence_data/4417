zzso designed from sequences of the gene zzso the zzso factor Tu zzso zzso of several zzso zzso amplified most of the zzso gene from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso About zzso of the zzso gene from two zzso zzso strains and a tomato zzso zzso was zzso The zzso sequence similarity between these related zzso was between zzso and zzso whereas the zzso with other zzso was zzso The similarity of the deduced zzso acid sequence was significantly higher, ranging from zzso to zzso among the zzso and zzso to zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso From the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso two pairs of zzso were zzso one amplified the zzso of most zzso groups that were established, the other was specific for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the various groups that were amplified could be distinguished by zzso analysis using zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso group could be divided into five zzso zzso zzso These results showed that the zzso gene has the potential to be used to differentiate and zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene is present as a single zzso
