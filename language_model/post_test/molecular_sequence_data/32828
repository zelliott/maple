Since molecular structure of zzso is not available in foreseeable future, it is best to construct a working model for zzso zzso A geometric problem, assembly of 700 zzso 20 zzso with 48 zzso is zzso by a frame work in which all the proteins participate in primary zzso followed by secondary, zzso and zzso binding with neighboring proteins without additional zzso Thus, zzso zzso contains zzso secondary structure zzso zzso and appearance of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso The proteins are wrapped by zzso zzso folding for zzso zzso of zzso gene can produce zzso zzso with frequency of 1 zzso zzso and 53 zzso zzso beaded zzso By zzso driven zzso there occurs removal of 16 separate zzso zzso joining 17 separate beaded zzso structures and zzso zzso on each zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 has zzso zzso and very compact folding pattern with frequency of 1 zzso per 12 zzso in short zzso length zzso zzso zzso of zzso 12 contains SS zzso zzso element of zzso In zzso 10, 15 and 17 where both regular and alternative zzso sites exist, SS zzso A1 binding zzso is observed at the regular zzso zzso End products are mature zzso zzso 4 species of zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso There may also be some other regulatory zzso containing zzso elements as zzso
