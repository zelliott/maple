We constructed a three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso domain of three major types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of the recent zzso structure determination of the zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the three models reveals that the zzso pocket is much more zzso than the overall zzso zzso exist, however, in the side chains of several zzso In particular, a zzso zzso present in zzso but not in zzso is proposed to contribute to the high affinity for zzso in receptors containing the zzso zzso The semiautomatic zzso of zzso in the zzso pocket of zzso led to positions consistent with labeling and zzso zzso zzso the zzso ammonium head group of nicotine makes a zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso ring is close to both the zzso pair zzso and the complementary component of the binding zzso The intrinsic affinities zzso from zzso give a rank order zzso zzso nicotine zzso zzso in agreement with experimental zzso Finally, our models offer a structural basis for zzso by external zzso
