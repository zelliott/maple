zzso zzso amplification zzso of DNA is a novel technique for the amplification of DNA under zzso zzso For the first time, we applied this method to develop a simple and quantitative monitoring method for environmental zzso targeting zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed first by measuring zzso derived from an zzso dye using a real-time zzso zzso and then by measuring the zzso of the reaction solution using a real-time zzso As a result, it was possible to zzso the initial zzso DNA concentration from an environment with a sensitivity down to zzso DNA copies of target DNA and a dynamic range of 7-9 orders in zzso zzso DNA from zzso bacteria zzso zzso that does not zzso zzso gene did not affect the quantitative capability of zzso Over results suggested that the real-time zzso is effective for monitoring zzso and their gene expression in zzso
