A zzso zzso zzso from human zzso cancer cells zzso was induced by zzso increase in the zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso to zzso and zzso but not to zzso C and zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso II gene expression using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and investigated possible differences in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells do not express the zzso zzso but the expression levels of zzso are markedly higher than in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was markedly decreased in the zzso cells in comparison with the parent zzso This reduced drug zzso was associated with an enhanced drug zzso but was reversed when cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso A at the concentration of 5 zzso caused zzso enhancement of zzso in the zzso zzso On the other hand, there was no difference in zzso II activity between the parent and resistant zzso The resistance of the zzso cells is therefore associated with an enhanced drug zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso as distinct from zzso and is modulated by zzso zzso
