In conclusion, using zzso zzso sequences and the recognition site probe methodology, we have cloned the zzso zzso zzso and determined an additional 141 zzso of zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso entry name zzso The gene product represents an zzso zzso factor that recognizes DNA zzso and zzso zzso this is perhaps the reason that this zzso was isolated with zzso zzso We have mapped the zzso gene to mouse zzso 2, between regions zzso with human zzso zzso and zzso
