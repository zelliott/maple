In zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso of the protein zzso results in necrosis of muscle zzso associated with zzso in the zzso and surrounding zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to be a major component of the zzso zzso involved in maintaining the integrity of the zzso plasma zzso and is known to associate with a group of zzso zzso one of which exhibits high affinity binding to the zzso zzso component zzso However, a direct or indirect zzso association of zzso in muscle cells with the zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso To address this question we have examined zzso zzso and zzso patterns in cultured mouse and human zzso in comparison with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed virtually complete zzso of zzso on the inside surface of the muscle cell zzso with plaques and zzso zzso of zzso accumulating on the zzso zzso This pattern of zzso and zzso distribution was distinct from that of other cell surface molecules expressed in zzso such as the neural cell zzso zzso zzso and the beta 1 zzso zzso and zzso of zzso from zzso zzso extracts resulted in zzso of zzso B1 chain confirming an association between these two zzso The results thus provide the first direct cellular evidence of a zzso linkage between zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso While the zzso distribution of zzso was apparently normal in zzso muscle cells, elevated levels of soluble zzso were present in extracts of zzso compared with normal mouse skeletal zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
