Metal zzso facilitate the folding of the hairpin zzso but do not participate directly in zzso The metal complex zzso zzso supports folding and activity of the zzso and also mediates specific zzso zzso several of which retain zzso zzso These zzso imply that the active core structure organized by zzso is different from that organized by zzso and that revealed in the crystal structure zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso in particular, adopt different zzso in zzso zzso is zzso out of loop A and stacked on zzso zzso whereas the zzso at position zzso is stacked on zzso a zzso crucial for zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso zzso and a zzso U zzso correlate with the zzso zzso zzso that decreased zzso rates in zzso up to zzso showed only subtle decreases or even increases in observed rates when zzso in zzso Here, we propose a model of the zzso zzso core generated by zzso that is consistent with these zzso
