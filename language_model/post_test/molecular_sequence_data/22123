In plant zzso pumps belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain is responsible for pump zzso zzso of zzso zzso to this region results in pump zzso but the structural basis for zzso zzso is still not zzso All zzso in a putative zzso domain zzso to zzso were zzso and the resulting zzso proteins were studied with respect to zzso binding and the zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso the binding site for zzso is overlapping with the zzso region and zzso the zzso region comprises significantly fewer zzso than the zzso zzso In a zzso wheel projection of the zzso domain, zzso involved in zzso cluster on one side of the zzso which is proposed to interact with an zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso influencing zzso zzso are situated on the other face of the zzso likely to face the zzso whereas zzso controlling zzso binding positively are scattered zzso We propose that early zzso recognition is zzso by the zzso face and that zzso subsequently competes with the zzso zzso in binding to the other face of the zzso
