Numerous studies have been published that attempted to correlate zzso zzso with freezing and drought zzso Studies investigating the effect of zzso on zzso indicated that a direct interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso This new area of research began to move zzso and its association with stress beyond mere correlation by confirming that zzso has the capacity to stabilize zzso during drying by inserting at least part of the zzso into the zzso zzso region of the zzso This helps prevent leakage when water is removed from the system either during freezing or zzso When plants were transformed with the ability to zzso zzso a zzso increase in drought and/or freezing tolerance was zzso These experiments indicate that besides an indirect effect of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso has a direct protective effect that can be demonstrated by both model systems and genetic zzso
