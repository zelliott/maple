In the process of zzso zzso the exchange of zzso zzso against zzso zzso across the inner zzso membrane is zzso by a specific carrier zzso Two different zzso for this carrier have been demonstrated on the basis of interactions with specific zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso The two zzso referred to as zzso and BA zzso are zzso provided that zzso or zzso are zzso The functional zzso carrier is probably organized as a zzso In the presence of zzso or BA the zzso is split into two zzso combined with either of the two zzso The zzso acid sequence of the beef heart carrier zzso zzso zzso contains three repeats of about 100 zzso zzso Experimental results obtained through different approaches, including zzso zzso and limited zzso can be interpreted on the basis of a model with five or six zzso alpha zzso per carrier zzso Two mobile regions involved in the binding of zzso and accessible to zzso zzso have been zzso Each of them may be zzso as consisting of two pairs of short zzso alpha zzso which can be juxtaposed to form zzso channels zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso is currently being used to detect strategic zzso acids in zzso zzso
