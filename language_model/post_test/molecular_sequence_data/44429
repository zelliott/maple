The primary structure of the zzso zzso occurring abundantly in the zzso of barley zzso zzso was zzso By means of computer analysis, considerable zzso was found between this zzso and the zzso zzso zzso studied zzso A unique distinction of the zzso zzso is its symmetrical structure caused by the presence of two mutually zzso parts, each of which is zzso to a long region of zzso including a zzso zzso terminal zzso and the adjacent leader zzso No sequences zzso to the coding zzso of zzso were revealed in the zzso However, potentially functional signals were zzso zzso boxes and zzso sites (PBS) exhibiting statistically significant zzso to the corresponding regulatory signals of known zzso Thus, we have revealed and characterized a repeated element of the zzso zzso zzso that is a markedly modified zzso of the zzso family of zzso of this zzso
