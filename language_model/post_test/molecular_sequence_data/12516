The zzso zzso function zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is tightly zzso zzso we address possible mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with melanoma zzso expressing zzso zzso or with soluble zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that although both zzso zzso can bind zzso zzso binds zzso more efficiently than zzso Using zzso fusion proteins we show that the zzso spliced zzso in zzso zzso specifically reduce the zzso function of zzso while replacement of zzso by an zzso zzso domain restores binding to a level comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso bound zzso very zzso when zzso zzso were replaced with a zzso zzso domain, which is heavily modified by zzso zzso zzso of zzso or incubation of zzso zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso inhibitor restored zzso binding to zzso and to cell surface zzso levels, zzso We conclude that differential zzso provides a regulatory mechanism for zzso zzso function and that this effect is due in part to zzso zzso zzso which are added to the zzso rich regions zzso by the zzso spliced zzso zzso Alternative zzso resulting in changes in protein zzso provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of zzso zzso
