zzso zzso zzso ending with zzso zzso were readily zzso in large scale and good yields from commercially available zzso bearing zzso zzso functionality on their surface and zzso zzso The first four generations of this novel class of zzso zzso having up to 32 zzso units were evaluated as zzso for the zzso from zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The binding properties of these zzso together with reference zzso were determined using zzso zzso as a coating zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso were demonstrated to be potent zzso with zzso values 400 times better than those of zzso zzso zzso taken as a zzso Their zzso character was shown to be sufficient for their direct use as coating zzso in zzso plate zzso Moreover, their ability to bind and form zzso zzso complexes was also demonstrated by zzso double zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the ability of these zzso to selectively zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso from a crude zzso mixture was also demonstrated using zzso gel zzso zzso These zzso zzso were shown to constitute novel zzso materials of high affinity for the easy isolation of zzso zzso
