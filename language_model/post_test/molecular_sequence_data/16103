One of the easiest and most sensitive methods of detecting zzso in the zzso gene leading to zzso is by the use of zzso zzso The current method involves zzso of zzso zzso of zzso DNA followed by gel zzso and zzso onto zzso The membrane is then zzso with a zzso zzso probe containing the specific point zzso of zzso Finally, the membrane is subjected to X-ray film for zzso zzso We wish to report a method for detecting these zzso which involves 1 zzso of zzso DNA or zzso The method involves the use of a gene amplification zzso A series of zzso are zzso which span the zzso zzso In each primer set, one primer is complementary to the zzso and the other primer is complementary to the zzso zzso The suspected zzso point is located between these two zzso With the use of this primer set, the zzso gene region is amplified by zzso zzso and DNA zzso The amplification cycle is repeated 25 to 30 zzso The amplification is conducted using the zzso zzso of DNA zzso I or zzso zzso in the presence of all four zzso zzso The resulting amplified DNA is applied to a nylon membrane with the aid of a zzso apparatus and directly zzso with normal and zzso zzso zzso The entire process requires one to two zzso More than 300 zzso zzso have been identified in our zzso over 20 different zzso have been zzso
