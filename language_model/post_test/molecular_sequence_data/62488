Sensitive zzso are required to detect bovine zzso in donor cattle used for the in zzso preparation of Australian tick fever zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using 3' minor groove zzso DNA zzso zzso were developed and compared to conventional zzso zzso for the sensitive detection of bovine zzso virus zzso and bovine zzso virus zzso Seven beef and dairy zzso were screened to evaluate these zzso Comparative sensitivities of zzso tests were determined by testing zzso zzso of plasmids with zzso containing corresponding zzso zzso Published zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso sequences did not adequately amplify Australian zzso zzso Pol sequences from Australian strains of zzso and zzso were used to design zzso zzso zzso which improved sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, over conventional zzso zzso This is the first report of Australian sequences of zzso and zzso and the first zzso zzso zzso zzso described to detect these zzso These methods could be applied to future studies requiring sensitive detection of these two bovine zzso
