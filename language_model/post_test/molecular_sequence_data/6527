The silver zzso gene of zzso zzso is required for zzso and severe zzso zzso result in death prior to zzso Adult flies zzso or zzso for weaker zzso display several visible zzso including zzso structures that are pale and silvery in color due to reduced zzso We have identified and cloned the DNA zzso the zzso gene and determined the sequence of several partially overlapping zzso derived from zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso by these zzso indicates that the silver proteins are members of the family of zzso zzso that includes the human zzso zzso M, and zzso One class of zzso zzso is alternatively spliced to zzso at least two zzso each of which is composed of two zzso zzso
