These studies were undertaken to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of saturated solutions of zzso used to treat infectious and inflammatory zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso to cultured human peripheral blood zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso final zzso concentration and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was seen when 40 zzso salt was added zzso zzso and was equal to zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso However, there was no induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso or tumor necrosis factor to account for the synthesis of zzso the effect of zzso was not due to zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso and increased zzso levels of zzso zzso similar to those induced by zzso zzso zzso gene expression was elevated for 96 zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells incubated with zzso zzso In human zzso zzso cells, zzso stimulation with zzso zzso or zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso signal zzso includes the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso that is observed following zzso zzso Using specific blockade of this zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso synthesis was observed, similar to that in cells zzso with zzso Thus, these studies suggest that zzso and zzso shock zzso the same zzso protein zzso for signal zzso and zzso zzso
