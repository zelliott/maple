zzso zzso factors play diverse roles in plant growth, zzso processes and stress zzso A full-length zzso sequence of a zzso zzso namely zzso was isolated from wheat zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript level was significantly zzso by zzso with a zzso pathogen zzso zzso and by drought zzso zzso encodes the zzso protein zzso consisting of 323 zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso two putative nuclear zzso sites and two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new member of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso expression in onion zzso cells of zzso fused with zzso proved that zzso zzso of zzso occurred in the zzso The zzso gene was transferred into tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso After screening through zzso and zzso zzso transgenic tobacco lines expressing zzso were identified and evaluated for pathogen resistance, and drought and salt zzso Compared to zzso tobacco host plants, zzso expressing plants displayed significantly enhanced resistance to zzso zzso and exhibited improved zzso to drought and salt zzso In these transgenic lines, the activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased relative to zzso tobacco zzso The results suggested that the wheat zzso zzso factor plays an important role in modulating responses to zzso and zzso zzso
