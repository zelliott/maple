zzso is known to influence zzso patterns within zzso where zzso in the zzso modification of zzso zzso have been proposed as an implicating zzso In light of recent studies zzso changing PG profiles in the transition of zzso to zzso zzso this study investigates the influence of zzso on the major PG populations zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sections from rat zzso were cultured for 14 days in the presence 0, 1 and 6 zzso sodium zzso and the PG extracted from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso PG species and corresponding zzso were identified by their zzso to zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso chains were zzso with respect to their nature, chain length and zzso zzso zzso of PG extracted from pulp and zzso were reduced, particularly for zzso zzso did not influence levels of zzso or zzso within zzso or zzso although the processing of these zzso within pulp and zzso was affected, particularly at higher zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were reduced within pulp and zzso although the effect was less pronounced for zzso zzso reduced zzso of zzso chains within pulp and zzso zzso with a notable reduction in zzso zzso In all three zzso zzso chain length was zzso Considering the various roles for PG in the zzso complex, either directly or indirectly in the zzso process, changes in the zzso structure and processing of the different PG species within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides a further molecular explanation for the altered zzso patterns witnessed during zzso
