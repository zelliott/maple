We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso which is likely to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of this zzso zzso with zzso from other organisms shows a high degree of zzso in regions previously shown to be important for zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso contains four obvious insertions with respect to all other known zzso suggesting that the zzso protein represents a distinct zzso
