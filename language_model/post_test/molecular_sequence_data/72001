We isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso fruit zzso a zzso zzso zzso from mature elderberry zzso Cloning of the corresponding gene demonstrated that zzso is zzso as a zzso precursor consisting of an zzso zzso domain corresponding to the mature elderberry protein and an unrelated zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicated that the zzso domain of this precursor has high sequence similarity with the zzso domain of class I zzso zzso zzso whereas the C zzso is most closely related to that of class V zzso On the basis of these sequence zzso the gene zzso zzso can be considered a hybrid between a zzso and a class V zzso zzso
