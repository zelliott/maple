In this work, we present the construction of a zzso library in zzso coli using the zzso zzso and environmental DNA directly isolated from Antarctic zzso and screened for zzso zzso zzso the screening on zzso supplemented with olive oil and zzso B revealed one unusual pink fluorescent clone zzso out of 85 zzso zzso This clone zzso a zzso zzso which has an insert of zzso zzso that has been completely zzso Further analysis of the insert showed eight zzso Three zzso among these exhibited similarities to zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence designated as zzso zzso a protein with zzso identity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This protein was responsible for the observed pink zzso of the zzso clone in the presence of zzso zzso We found that colonies of zzso zzso coli zzso strain showed pink zzso under zzso zzso on the zzso zzso supplemented with zzso B after zzso at 25, 30 and 37 degrees zzso The same effect was achieved using other zzso coli strains such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results presented here will provide the basis for further studies on the use of the discovered gene as a new reporter gene for molecular biology zzso
