zzso B is a clan zzso family zzso zzso zzso found in gram positive bacteria, plants and zzso Evidence suggests it is a zzso factor and thus therapeutic target in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso but little is known about its function in zzso In this study zzso major zzso zzso zzso were zzso These grew normally as zzso had a small zzso in their ability to undergo differentiation to zzso zzso were significantly less able to zzso and survive within zzso in zzso but were virulent to zzso These data suggest that zzso major zzso itself is not an important zzso factor, indicating functional differences between zzso and zzso in their interaction with the zzso zzso The possibility that an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso major might compensate for the loss of zzso in zzso was investigated via by mapping its sequence onto the zzso structure of zzso major zzso This suggested that the zzso involved in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are identical to zzso and hence the zzso specificity would be zzso zzso there may be zzso between the two zzso
