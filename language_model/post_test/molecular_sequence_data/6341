zzso zzso both prevents and reverses the zzso of compound II, an inactive form of zzso that is generated from the normal active intermediate form zzso I) when zzso is exposed to a steady flow of hydrogen zzso The mechanism for the zzso reaction is unknown although zzso could act either as a zzso or a zzso zzso Recently, a reaction scheme has been proposed in which the formation of compound II from compound I generates a neighboring radical species within the zzso zzso would then donate two zzso one to compound II for reduction of the iron and the other to the protein free zzso In this paper, we report calculations to find the dominant electron zzso pathways between zzso and the zzso iron in the zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Two major zzso pathways are found which fuse together on zzso It is suggested that the sequence zzso of the loop that divides the beta zzso is the key element for shielding a radical zzso zzso
