We compared the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in mouse zzso after infection with virulent zzso and zzso zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso zzso 

zzso mouse serum samples were collected 9 days after infection, and the level of total zzso zzso and zzso against the zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso peptides of the zzso zzso protein were zzso The zzso zzso modification site, the zzso structure, the zzso region and the secondary structure of the zzso sequence of virulent and zzso strains were analyzed using zzso 

The virulent zzso mice produced a higher level of zzso but a lower zzso against the zzso zzso while the zzso zzso mice produced a higher level of zzso than the virulent zzso The difference in the secondary structure of zzso protein between the virulent and zzso strain was largely confined to zzso acid positions zzso showing zzso and zzso anchor zzso 

The difference in the zzso of zzso against the zzso zzso and synthetic peptides between virulent and zzso strains points to the importance of the primary and secondary structure assumed by zzso in the zzso of zzso cells and, zzso in the induction of zzso and its zzso
