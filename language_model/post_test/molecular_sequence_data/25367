zzso of vitamin zzso proteins are zzso with a zzso that is believed to target these proteins for zzso by the vitamin zzso zzso In this study synthetic zzso were used to investigate zzso of the zzso and factor X precursors in rat liver zzso The extent of zzso processing by the zzso was also zzso zzso raised against the human zzso and factor X zzso only recognized precursors with the respective zzso zzso The data demonstrate structural differences in the zzso region of the zzso and the factor X zzso zzso which raises questions about the hypothesis of a common zzso binding site on the zzso for all precursors of vitamin zzso zzso The hypothesis of separate binding sites is supported by data which demonstrate differences in binding of the zzso and factor X precursors to membrane fragments from rough and smooth zzso zzso of the zzso precursors in zzso was investigated with zzso specific zzso raised against a portion of the zzso zzso zzso region extending from zzso 15 to zzso The synthetic zzso used as zzso contains three of the ten potential zzso sites in zzso It is shown that these zzso do not recognize mature zzso but recognize the zzso zzso It is also demonstrated that the zzso is zzso The zzso were used to assess zzso of the zzso precursor in membrane fragments from zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso does not involve zzso zzso 16, 19 and 20 of the zzso zzso
