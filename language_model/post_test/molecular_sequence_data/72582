The gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso has recently been cloned and shown to zzso a zzso protein with zzso to zzso zzso We report here an zzso restriction zzso length zzso of the zzso gene that is common in the German population with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50% in healthy individuals as well as in 152 randomly selected breast cancer zzso We present a simple and rapid zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for this zzso that should be useful to trace the inheritance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and breast cancer families and to study loss of zzso in primary zzso
