zzso virus complement control protein zzso is zzso by zzso virus, with its zzso zzso by other zzso zzso including zzso zzso Since zzso are the primary zzso hosts of zzso virus zzso and since zzso encodes a highly zzso functional zzso of zzso termed here the inflammation zzso protein zzso the effects of injection of zzso into the zzso of mice was determined in order to study the precise in zzso effects of zzso zzso examination of the site of injection with a zzso virus lacking zzso zzso showed greater tissue damage, with more zzso and zzso than sites injected with the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the measurement of the specific swelling response carried out for several weeks revealed significantly greater swelling in mice injected with zzso Thus, zzso zzso the zzso inflammatory response in zzso Furthermore, the diminished destruction of host tissue observed in the presence of zzso indicates zzso in which the virus ensures the preservation of surrounding host zzso possibly to support the growth of its zzso
