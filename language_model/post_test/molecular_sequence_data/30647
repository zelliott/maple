The promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso gene contains two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that direct zzso initiation to two sites designated zzso and zzso On the basis of differences between their zzso sequences and their responsiveness to upstream promoter zzso it has previously been proposed that zzso and zzso promote zzso by different molecular zzso To begin a study of zzso zzso in zzso we used zzso zzso nuclear extracts together with various DNA templates and zzso zzso proteins that have been characterized in zzso We demonstrated accurate zzso initiation in zzso at the sites used in zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso on various zzso hybrid zzso In all cases, zzso stimulation was dependent on the presence of an zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso In addition, analysis of promoters containing a variety of zzso derivatives indicated that the level of zzso in zzso was directly related to the level achieved in zzso The results demonstrated that the in zzso system accurately reproduced all known aspects of in zzso zzso zzso that depend on the zzso zzso However, in striking contrast to zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso yielded approximately 20 times more of the zzso transcript than the zzso zzso This result was not due to inability of the zzso initiation site to be efficiently zzso in zzso but rather it reflects the lack of zzso function in zzso The results support the idea that zzso and zzso mediate zzso from the zzso promoter by distinct zzso
