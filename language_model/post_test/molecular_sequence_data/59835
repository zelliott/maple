Plants generally accumulate free zzso under zzso stress zzso Upon removal of the zzso stress, the zzso levels return to zzso In order to understand the mechanisms involved in regulating the levels of zzso we cloned and characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains a major open reading frame zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has high zzso with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and contains a putative zzso targeting zzso When expressed in zzso the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and exhibited zzso zzso zzso We also determined the free zzso contents and the delta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels under different zzso stress and recovery zzso The results demonstrated that the removal of free zzso during the recovery from zzso or zzso stress involves an induction of the zzso gene while the activity of zzso zzso The zzso regulation of zzso and zzso genes appears to be a key mechanism in the control of the levels of zzso during and after zzso zzso The zzso gene was also significantly induced by zzso applied zzso The induction of zzso by zzso however, was inhibited by salt zzso
