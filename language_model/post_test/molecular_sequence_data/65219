We investigated 21 affected individuals in two unrelated zzso families of Indian origin and identified point zzso zzso in the zzso motif zzso of the zzso gene in all the affected members leading to zzso change in this basic zzso The zzso motif of zzso however, showed previously zzso two zzso zzso one with three novel variations zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and second with only zzso variation zzso zzso Interestingly, the two distinct zzso of: localized severe hair zzso with beaded appearance confined to the scalp of all the affected members of Family 1 and of generalized zzso hair zzso of moderate severity in Family 2, zzso in the two families, respectively, zzso with the two separate zzso for the functionally critical zzso region of zzso gene in the background of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso gene was not observed in the background of the zzso zzso with three zzso in zzso gene in zzso condition in all the affected members of Family 1, affected with a localized but severe form of the zzso However, the same zzso zzso existed in the zzso gene in the background of the zzso zzso with three zzso in the zzso gene in zzso condition, consistently in all the affected members of Family 2, where all its affected members showed the segregation of a milder form of the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso in the zzso and the variations in the zzso genes were not observed together in randomly selected 150 unaffected controls outside the two affected zzso This is also the first report of zzso zzso of zzso gene in zzso cases of Indian origin and the first report of zzso in the zzso gene in literature to our zzso
