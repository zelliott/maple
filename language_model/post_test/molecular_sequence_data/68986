zzso of cell proliferation is a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso in growth control pathways must translate into changes in the zzso regulatory machinery, but the mechanism by which this occurs is largely zzso Compared with normal human zzso cells transformed with a variety of viral zzso show striking changes in the zzso composition of the zzso zzso zzso In normal cells, zzso exist predominantly in multiple zzso complexes, each containing a zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso and the zzso zzso However, in many transformed cells, zzso cell nuclear zzso and zzso are lost from these zzso zzso Here we have investigated the significance of this phenomenon by molecular cloning of zzso and in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso the activity of each member of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso may be a universal inhibitor of zzso zzso
