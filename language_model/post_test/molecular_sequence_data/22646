There is increasing evidence that protein function can be modified by zzso of zzso zzso a reaction zzso by proteins with zzso activity, or that occurs by interaction with zzso a highly zzso zzso formed by the reaction of zzso oxide with zzso Although there are numerous reports describing loss of function after treatment of proteins with zzso we recently demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso 1 is activated rather than zzso by zzso and suggested that this could be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso rather than to other effects of zzso In this report, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 were characterized by mass zzso and their functional significance zzso Of the seven zzso zzso present in the zzso only those at positions 92 and 153 were zzso after treatment with zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were created using zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso zzso of these cells with zzso resulted in an approximately zzso increase in zzso activity in cells expressing the wild type zzso zzso zzso 1 or the zzso zzso whereas the zzso activity of zzso and double site zzso was zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 by zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso 92 and represents one of the few examples in which a gain in function has been associated with zzso of a specific zzso zzso
