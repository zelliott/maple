zzso zzso are a group of zzso expressed nuclear zzso They are suggested to play an important role in nuclear envelope organization and cell cycle control, as has been shown for zzso zzso 2 alpha and zzso which are the rat zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso The recent isolation and characterization of seven mouse zzso zzso transcripts named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso suggest that more than the three previously reported zzso zzso zzso and gamma forms, may exist in zzso Here we report on the demonstration of putative human zzso and zzso by zzso of human cell lines using a newly prepared zzso zzso against the common zzso region of zzso Furthermore, we prepared the first truly zzso zzso zzso zzso using a part of the human analog of the zzso domain of mouse zzso zzso for zzso We showed that human zzso is highly expressed in all zzso cells tested, while hardly any zzso with other proteins could be zzso In contrast to the high expression of human zzso in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso we found very low expression of human zzso in zzso nerve zzso These data led us to the assumption that expression of zzso may correlate with the occurrence of cancer, and therefore may serve as a new tumor marker, or even as a new target for cancer zzso
