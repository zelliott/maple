Marine predatory cone snails zzso zzso with over 500 species represent what is arguably the largest single zzso of marine animals alive zzso All zzso are zzso and zzso a complex mixture of zzso peptides to capture their zzso and for other biological zzso Each component of zzso peptides selectively targets a specific zzso of zzso channels, neurotransmitter receptors or zzso zzso to their diversity, more than 50,000 distinct active peptides are theoretically estimated in zzso zzso These diversified toxins are generally zzso into several zzso and/or families based on their characteristic arrangements of zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso Some mechanisms underlying the remarkable diversity of zzso peptides have been zzso the distinctive gene structure, gene zzso and/or zzso selection, zzso zzso and sophisticated expression pattern and zzso modification of these zzso Due to their highly pharmacological potency and target zzso zzso peptides have attracted extensive attention with their zzso to be developed as new research tools in zzso field and as novel medications in clinic for pain, zzso and other zzso zzso Several zzso lessons for our drug development could be also zzso from these zzso zzso zzso peptides comprise a rich resource for zzso and most of them await to be zzso
