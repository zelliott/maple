zzso binding zzso techniques are rapidly evolving into powerful tools for modern drug zzso Many of these approaches bridge chemistry and biology, which are inseparable concepts in nature but are often treated as separate worlds in drug discovery and science in zzso This review shows with several examples how focusing on the binding zzso has a clear advantage when it comes to establishing zzso pharmacological zzso By organizing and comparing sequence and structural data it is possible to zzso zzso from similar targets to increase the speed of zzso and, zzso to produce zzso for previously intractable zzso zzso motifs correlated with zzso can be applied in the design of zzso focused libraries that are both efficient and cost-effective and should provide increased zzso over diversity zzso Furthermore, in the zzso phase, the binding motif approach offers the possibility to identify quickly the most likely zzso candidates to be chosen for selectivity zzso as well as potentially characterizing those pockets which may best be exploited for improved zzso
