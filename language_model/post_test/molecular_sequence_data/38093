zzso virus zzso associated with zzso bats zzso are responsible for most recent human rabies cases in the United States, which are not associated with a history of zzso We compared their zzso and zzso with those of dog rabies virus zzso zzso the classic cause of rabies in humans, to determine whether differences in these strains might have ramifications for therapeutic intervention, particularly zzso 

Eleven zzso bat and 8 dog rabies virus zzso were characterized by sequencing the zzso zzso by assessing their ability to replicate in zzso versus zzso cultures at optimal and zzso temperatures, by assessing their zzso in mice, and by determining the resistance of these viruses to therapeutic zzso with commercial zzso 

zzso zzso were less genetically diverse, less zzso cell specific, more temperature sensitive, but as zzso on average, as zzso zzso zzso protection was equivalent for zzso and zzso strains of similar zzso 

zzso strains have unique characteristics that may explain their exceptional association with human rabies but have little bearing on their zzso in zzso The zzso of a particular virus, rather than its zzso makeup, determines the outcome of zzso
