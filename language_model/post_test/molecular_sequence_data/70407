The zzso zzso alpha zzso sequence of potato virus X zzso consists of two zzso the alpha sequence (41 zzso with no zzso and the beta sequence zzso zzso upstream from zzso The alpha zzso has been shown to enhance strongly the expression of adjacent genes in zzso zzso This phenomenon has been zzso to be due to the zzso zzso of the zzso 30 zzso and/or to the presence within the alpha region of the zzso zzso complementary to the zzso zzso structure of zzso zzso Different derivatives of alpha zzso have been constructed for use in determining the contribution of separate elements of the alpha beta sequence to zzso zzso It was found that deletion of the alpha sequence large zzso which was supposed to be unfolded did not reduce the delta alpha zzso enhancement zzso Moreover, zzso enhancement was greater for this zzso zzso of the beta sequence resulted in a considerable increase in activity of the zzso showing that the beta region was zzso for zzso zzso or zzso of zzso led to zzso of the alpha zzso as a zzso zzso Thus, we identified the zzso zzso as the primary motif responsible for the translation enhancing ability of alpha zzso
