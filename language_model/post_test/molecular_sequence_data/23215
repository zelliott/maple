Although the zzso zzso protein B zzso is an essential component of lung zzso which is itself essential for life, the molecular basis for its activity is not zzso zzso zzso functions can be partially zzso by zzso of the zzso including the zzso We have used zzso to determine the structure of a zzso zzso of human zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso determination was performed both in the fluorinated alcohol zzso zzso and in sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso In both zzso zzso zzso take on an zzso zzso structure, in agreement with predictions made by comparison to zzso zzso family zzso In zzso the five zzso zzso of the zzso are largely zzso while in zzso zzso these zzso take on a zzso compact zzso zzso in zzso zzso side chain positioning between the two zzso were also found, with better agreement between the structures for the zzso face than the zzso zzso A zzso probe was used to investigate the position of the zzso within the zzso zzso and indicated that the zzso is located at the water interface with the zzso face of the zzso oriented inward, the zzso face of the zzso oriented outward, and the zzso zzso even farther from the zzso center than those on the zzso face of the zzso zzso of basic zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso are known to have an impact on function, and these studies demonstrate structural ramifications of such interactions via the differences observed between the zzso structures determined in zzso and zzso
