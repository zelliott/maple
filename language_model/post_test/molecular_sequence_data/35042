The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso has been reported to be involved in innate zzso development and muscle zzso To explore the function of zzso in shrimp, partial zzso sequence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso as zzso was characterized and the expression of zzso in zzso of the shrimp after being infected with zzso zzso and in muscle of the shrimp at different zzso stages was detected by quantitative zzso in this zzso The results showed that the open reading frame of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso a protein of 365 zzso zzso The protein of zzso which showed close zzso relationship to zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso motif and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was detected in all tested zzso especially in the zzso and zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso was different from that of the control at the 24th hour after the injection of zzso zzso and in the muscle significantly increased at stage C but decreased at other stages during zzso illustrating that zzso could be involved in pathogen infection and the zzso cycle of zzso In conclusion, we identified zzso and studied its role in pathogen infection and zzso which might facilitate our understanding of the function of zzso in innate immunity and growth during zzso of zzso
