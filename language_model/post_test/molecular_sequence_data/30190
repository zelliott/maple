A rainbow trout zzso zzso based on zzso zzso was used to compare the effects of pure zzso salmon zzso zzso and several synthetic zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso exhibited a cycle, with an zzso variation of zzso to zzso zzso and a zzso of 8 to 21 zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid peptides of both zzso and salmon zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso at the high point of the calcium zzso cycle (up to zzso although the effective doses of the peptides on a zzso basis were 20 to 200 times that of the intact zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso did not have an zzso effect on calcium zzso Instead, it significantly enhanced zzso zzso in trout zzso (up to zzso at the low point of the calcium zzso zzso
