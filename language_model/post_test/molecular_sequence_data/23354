In the present paper, we describe cloning and expression of two outer membrane zzso zzso (from zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso zzso lacking signal zzso zzso using the zzso expression zzso and zzso coli host strain zzso The 38 zzso zzso expressed as zzso inclusion bodies, were zzso zzso in 8 M zzso and then subjected to zzso zzso As seen on zzso the 38 zzso band completely migrated to approximately 110 zzso when the zzso zzso proteins were zzso in a buffer system containing zzso zzso zzso zzso together with a subsequent heating to 95 degrees C for 5 zzso CD zzso revealed that the 110 zzso proteins contained a zzso zzso structure, which corresponded completely to the structure of the zzso proteins isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass analysis by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the expressed proteins were zzso and zzso The zzso zzso considerably exhibited the zzso effects on the zzso of small zzso through the zzso zzso A linear relation between relative zzso rates and zzso of neutral zzso and charged antibiotics suggested strongly that the in zzso zzso zzso functioned fully as a diffusion zzso
