zzso of transfer zzso zzso is performed by distinct mechanisms in different zzso and represents the most zzso route of zzso synthesis found in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso is generated by direct zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso is formed by an indirect zzso involving charging by a zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso by a specific zzso zzso Previous studies showed that fusion of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso enables the bacterial zzso to substitute for its zzso zzso in zzso We report zzso that the same fusion zzso upon being imported into zzso zzso the indirect zzso for zzso synthesis as well, despite significant differences in the identity zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Fusion of zzso to the bacterial zzso significantly enhanced its zzso activity towards zzso zzso zzso in zzso Our study provides a mechanism by which zzso rescue of distinct pathways of zzso synthesis can be zzso by a single zzso
