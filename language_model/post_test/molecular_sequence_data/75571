zzso of zzso A chain zzso to a cell surface binding zzso or other zzso can result in a potent zzso zzso We expressed the primary sequence for zzso in zzso coli to facilitate production and to obtain protein free of naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso in the level of expression and in the characteristics of the expressed protein were noted when several different zzso systems were zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed directly under control of the zzso zzso major zzso promoter zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso It was also expressed fused to zzso coli alkaline zzso zzso both in the same reading frame for zzso and zzso frame for expression in a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter system, which is zzso was achieved at 37 degrees C as well as at 42 degrees zzso The protein expressed at these different temperatures had zzso different zzso Whereas zzso expressed at 37 degrees C was soluble and fully active, that produced at 42 degrees C was zzso zzso and reduced in zzso zzso zzso could be converted to the zzso form by incubation at 42 degrees C in zzso but not in zzso zzso this difference in properties does not simply reflect an inherent zzso instability of the zzso zzso present in zzso including the possible association with other zzso are apparently required for this effect on zzso
