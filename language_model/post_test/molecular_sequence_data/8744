A zzso zzso zzso from human zzso was zzso to apparent zzso using a synthetic zzso zzso as affinity zzso The zzso zzso migrated as a single band with an approximate molecular weight of 52,000 by reducing sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Based on a partial zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso the zzso was cloned and zzso from a zzso library of a human cancer cell zzso The zzso sequence has a zzso acid coding region indicating a protein of zzso zzso with a type II domain zzso The deduced protein sequence showed significant similarity to a recently cloned bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lehman, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso chain reaction construct was expressed in insect cells using a zzso zzso Northern analysis of eight human zzso differed clearly from that of the bovine zzso zzso chain reaction cloning and sequencing of the human version of the bovine zzso are zzso and zzso similarity at the zzso acid level was zzso The data suggest that the zzso human zzso is a novel member of a family of zzso zzso and a nomenclature zzso and zzso is introduced to distinguish the zzso
