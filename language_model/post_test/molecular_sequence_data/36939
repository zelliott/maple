We have designed two software systems allowing the study of proteins through a comparison to those stored in data zzso The first one, zzso locates in a systematic manner all identities shared by a given protein and the proteins in a data zzso The second, zzso enables the selection of specific segments in a given zzso by comparing them with those gathered in a data zzso These sites were termed zzso since they mostly zzso to functional sites zzso zzso of the well-known proteins which were studied with the aid of this program zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso allowed us to reveal zzso between zzso and the zzso which have remained zzso until zzso These zzso proved to be critical sites zzso to zzso The putative involvement of these sites in the zzso processes as induced by zzso are worth considering since the results of our experiments are consistent with this zzso
