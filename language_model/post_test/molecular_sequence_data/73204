The events of zzso fusion in zzso are dissected here by combining genetic analysis with light and electron zzso We describe a new and essential intermediate step in the process, the formation of a zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso These pairs of zzso from different cells align with each other across zzso plasma zzso This zzso complex resolves into dense membrane plaques between zzso zzso these cells then establish zzso continuity by fusion of small areas of plasma membrane followed by zzso of zzso zzso Different steps in this process are specifically blocked by zzso in four genes required for zzso zzso One of these zzso blown zzso encodes a novel zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso that is essential for progression beyond the zzso complex zzso
