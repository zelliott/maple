A follow-up study of a large Utah family with significant linkage to zzso zzso led us to identify a new zzso seizure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 21 affected members, we uncovered a potential zzso in a highly zzso zzso acid, zzso in the large zzso loop between zzso zzso I and II that was absent from zzso ethnically matched population control zzso To establish a functional role for this zzso in seizure zzso we introduced the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso using targeted zzso zzso Compared to zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit significantly reduced thresholds to zzso induced zzso and zzso seizures, and increased zzso kindling acquisition zzso Together, these data strongly support the zzso zzso zzso as zzso in this zzso To confirm the role of zzso in zzso we analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated zzso patients and identified additional highly zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso After one of these children with zzso later developed zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso of zzso we zzso the zzso zzso a gene known to be associated with zzso syndrome, and identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of 109 zzso syndrome patients yielded nine zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso all in highly zzso zzso zzso Six of these zzso syndrome patients with zzso zzso zzso also zzso either zzso or zzso site zzso zzso and three had no zzso zzso This study provides evidence for a role of zzso in human zzso both as a cause of zzso and as a partner with zzso zzso
