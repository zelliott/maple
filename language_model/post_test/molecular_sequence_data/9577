To assess the feasibility of high-resolution melting zzso analysis for screening patients with zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso 

Based on previous studies on zzso gene in Chinese patients with zzso four hotspot zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso analysis was validated using 50 negative controls and 20 patients with zzso whose zzso were confirmed previously by direct zzso With the established zzso zzso suspected patients were zzso zzso with abnormal melting zzso were further validated by DNA zzso 

zzso analysis can accurately determine the zzso of all negative controls and zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the technique reached zzso zzso The melting zzso of samples with the same zzso were highly zzso In zzso suspected patients, seven zzso patients were detected by zzso zzso zzso have included one case of zzso zzso one case of zzso zzso 3 cases of zzso zzso one case of zzso zzso and one case of zzso All zzso were subsequently confirmed by DNA zzso 

zzso analysis is a convenient, zzso and rapid technique for the screening of zzso zzso
