The availability of the complete zzso sequence for zzso zzso zzso has permitted a comprehensive characterization of the zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso We have employed targeted gene zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis using liquid zzso zzso and zzso motif discovery tools to define the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this integrated approach, we identified nine probable zzso zzso 24 zzso and 15 individual open reading frames zzso either with unknown functions or zzso products zzso as transport or binding zzso that are predicted to be direct targets of zzso zzso This study suggested, for the first time, possible roles for four zzso and eight zzso with unknown functions in iron metabolism or iron zzso zzso zzso analysis clearly identified a number of zzso binding zzso and receptors related to iron zzso that were zzso in response to a fur deletion and verified the expression of nine genes originally zzso as zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso data revealed strong correlation for genes shown to be undergoing large changes at the transcript zzso A number of genes zzso components of the electron transport system were also zzso expressed in a fur deletion zzso The gene zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant decreases in both zzso and protein abundance in the fur zzso and possessed a strong candidate zzso site in its upstream region, thus suggesting that zzso may be a direct target of zzso zzso
