zzso is the zzso zzso from zzso coli involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and X-ray zzso reveal that zzso forms a zzso structure as a zzso of two intimate zzso zzso analysis of the zzso reveals that zzso is positively zzso displaying a zzso zzso dependence curve with an zzso of 1 zzso zzso and a Hill zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to an zzso site was observed in the crystal structure zzso with a reorganization of the zzso structure, relative to the zzso zzso The zzso group of the bound zzso makes salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to zzso while the zzso nitrogen interacts with zzso zzso of zzso to Ala increases the zzso value to zzso zzso presumably by reducing the affinity of the site for zzso although the zzso retains zzso zzso of zzso to Ala results in an active zzso with no zzso zzso of the signal from the zzso site to the active site appears to involve subtle interactions at the zzso interface and relocation of zzso into the vicinity of the active site to position the probable zzso water zzso These data define the structural basis for the cooperative regulation of the zzso zzso that is required for proper functioning within the zzso
