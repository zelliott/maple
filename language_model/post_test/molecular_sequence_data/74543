The current model for zzso gene regulation in zzso zzso involves several zzso factors, the most important of which appears to be the anthrax toxin zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is a positive regulator of the toxin genes zzso zzso and zzso and of a number of other zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso possesses a predicted zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso but the mechanism for positive regulation of zzso target genes is not zzso zzso similarities in the promoter regions of zzso genes are not apparent, and zzso zzso binds DNA with a high affinity in a zzso zzso We hypothesized that the toxin genes possess common structural features or zzso elements that are required for positive zzso We employed deletion analyses to determine the minimal sequences required for zzso toxin gene zzso In zzso zzso and in zzso experiments using zzso DNA corresponding to the toxin gene promoter regions indicated significant zzso associated with these zzso These findings suggest that the structural zzso of the DNA plays an important role in the control of anthrax toxin gene zzso
