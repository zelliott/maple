Two genetically zzso zzso versions of native zzso zzso C zzso zzso were created from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the role of the zzso sites in force zzso The zzso zzso contains a single zzso acid zzso in site IV which results in the zzso of site IV zzso zzso the zzso zzso lacks the last II zzso acids of the zzso and hence most of site zzso Both zzso zzso which retain an active site II, bind to native zzso zzso zzso and restore approximately zzso of the zzso capacity, about half that seen with zzso native zzso or zzso This observation implies that the zzso interaction with zzso I zzso is at a location on zzso other than the zzso zzso sites of zzso Replacement with zzso increases the sensitivity of the zzso bundle to changes in zzso zzso zzso the zzso strength from zzso to zzso M increased force by zzso a value much greater that the zzso increase seen in control zzso or zzso zzso with zzso These findings zzso zzso in determining this zzso zzso although this cannot be simply due to the zzso in the numbers of zzso zzso bound by the zzso complex since both zzso and zzso bind only 1 zzso zzso zzso
