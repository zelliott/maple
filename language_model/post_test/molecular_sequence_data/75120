zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso site in the zzso regulatory light chain from smooth muscle, zzso zzso and containing a variety of zzso acid zzso at position 19, were tested as zzso for the smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso containing either zzso or zzso were not zzso The corresponding zzso containing zzso was poorly zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of 3 X zzso zzso compared to a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso for the parent zzso All three zzso acid analog peptides acted as relatively potent zzso of zzso light chain zzso with Ki values in the range zzso zzso comparable to 7 zzso for the parent zzso Thus the failure of the zzso acid analog peptides to act as effective zzso was not the result of poor binding to the zzso In contrast, the same zzso made in the zzso zzso for the zzso protein zzso resulted in poor zzso It is likely that the zzso group of the substituting zzso acids in the zzso light chain zzso zzso is not presented in the correct orientation in the active site for transfer of the zzso zzso
