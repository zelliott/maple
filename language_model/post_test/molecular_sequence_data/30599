An until now zzso consistent zzso structure, tentatively named zzso zzso zzso was detected on molecules of human zzso zzso zzso 2 and natural zzso by testing with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso obtained after zzso of zzso mice with human zzso zzso was capable of binding and zzso both zzso 2 and natural zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso B6 was completely inhibited by a synthetic zzso which corresponded to the zzso acid sequence of zzso 2 in positions zzso Although a corresponding sequence of zzso acids in the zzso zzso was localized to the region zzso and shows only a zzso zzso with the assumed zzso 2 binding site, zzso at position 132 in zzso 2 and at position zzso in zzso seems to be crucial for establishment of the common zzso Its existence was supported by experiments using zzso zzso zzso to zzso 2 showed zzso with zzso and vice versa, zzso to zzso zzso with zzso zzso The ability for zzso by both zzso zzso was abolished in the presence of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso could be detected on the zzso 1 zzso These findings are the first evidence of a zzso between human zzso of alpha and beta types at the zzso zzso They indicate that the zzso distinction between zzso of alpha and beta types is not zzso
