The zzso zzso I gene of zzso zzso the zzso zzso encodes alternative transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These transcripts are zzso expressed throughout zzso zzso zzso clones representing these zzso corresponding zzso regions and zzso chain zzso primer extensions of the zzso ends of the zzso were zzso Both zzso contain five zzso and derive from primary transcripts that extend over approximately 8 and 4 zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their zzso zzso are unique and spliced onto common 3' zzso The zzso each contain a single long open reading frame, which can be translated into a zzso of 273 zzso acids for the zzso zzso and 308 zzso acids for the zzso zzso The unique zzso zzso distinct zzso zzso to each predicted zzso zzso comparisons reveal that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the multiple transcripts are highly similar to zzso zzso from humans, zzso and bacteria, with one significant zzso The zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso cannot be aligned with the N zzso of any other zzso zzso These zzso are predicted to zzso distinct physical characteristics to the alternate zzso and it is hypothesized that they aid in regulating the expression of the zzso in diverse cellular zzso
