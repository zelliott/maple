zzso II zzso zzso the first of two zzso reactions that convert sunlight into chemical zzso Native zzso is a zzso consisting of core and zzso zzso zzso Although the structure of zzso has been resolved by zzso zzso the mechanism underlying its assembly is poorly zzso Here, we report that an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso belongs to the zzso binding protein zzso zzso that functions as zzso zzso zzso in protein zzso zzso has a unique pair of zzso at the C zzso and was found to be reduced by zzso zzso zzso reduced by zzso by means of zzso zzso The zzso zzso which contains only two of the five zzso acids required for zzso showed a low level of zzso activity that was unaffected on reduction by zzso zzso disruption of the zzso gene resulted in reduced plant growth, consistent with the observed lower rate of zzso activity determined by zzso zzso zzso and oxygen evolution zzso isolated zzso Analysis of isolated zzso zzso with blue native gels and zzso showed that zzso of the zzso zzso was compromised in zzso plants, whereas the levels of zzso and zzso building blocks were elevated compared with zzso The results provide evidence that zzso zzso specifically in the zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by means of a mechanism that has yet to be zzso
