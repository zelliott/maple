A variety of molecules in human blood have been implicated in the zzso of zzso However, it remained elusive which circulating natural compounds are most effective in controlling viral replication in zzso To identify natural zzso zzso we screened a comprehensive zzso library generated from human zzso The most potent fraction contained a zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso region of zzso the most abundant circulating zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso a wide variety of zzso strains including those resistant to current zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated that zzso blocks zzso entry by interacting with the zzso fusion zzso and showed that a few zzso acid changes increase its zzso potency by two orders of zzso Thus, as a highly specific natural inhibitor of the zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso may lead to the development of another class of zzso zzso
