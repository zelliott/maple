zzso zzso the most abundant proteins in the zzso body, are involved in a plethora of biological zzso Plasma protein von zzso factor zzso mediates zzso of blood zzso to zzso collagen types I, II, and III, which is essential for normal zzso High affinity zzso sequences have been identified in the zzso collagen types II and III, however, it is unclear how zzso recognizes the zzso collagen type I, the superstructure of which is zzso Here we present the crystal structure of zzso domain A3 bound to a collagen type zzso zzso zzso Our structure reveals that zzso interacts with all three collagen chains and binds through zzso selection to a sequence that is one zzso longer than was previously appreciated from zzso and zzso binding zzso The zzso site zzso those of zzso (also known as zzso and zzso domain zzso 2, but is more extended and shifted toward the collagen zzso zzso The observed zzso mode of zzso provides direct structural constraints on collagen I chain zzso A zzso site can be generated from the sequences zzso present in the two zzso zzso and zzso in the unique zzso chain, provided that zzso is in the middle or trailing zzso Combining these data with previous structural data on zzso binding to collagen yields strong support for the trailing position of the zzso chain, shedding light on the fundamental and long-standing question of the collagen I chain zzso
