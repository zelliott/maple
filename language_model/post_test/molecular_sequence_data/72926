Slow zzso occurs in zzso zzso channels when the membrane is zzso for several seconds, whereas fast zzso takes place rapidly within a few zzso Unlike fast zzso the molecular entity that zzso the slow zzso of zzso channels has not been as well zzso Some regions of zzso channels, such as zzso and zzso have been reported to affect slow zzso A zzso in segment zzso of zzso zzso channels, zzso shifts the zzso dependence of zzso and fast zzso toward the zzso zzso The zzso zzso current at zzso zzso is diminished by zzso during repetitive stimulation at 5 zzso resulting in a profound zzso zzso This zzso zzso is due to the enhancement of slow zzso which develops faster than that of zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso s versus zzso zzso zzso s at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso fast zzso and yet greatly zzso slow zzso in both zzso and zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso s and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso zzso These findings together demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso channels is also critical for slow zzso We propose that this slow form of zzso channel zzso is analogous to the zzso zzso in Shaker zzso zzso
