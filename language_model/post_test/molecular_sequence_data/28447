The zzso of many species express genes zzso to the zzso zzso In the zzso two transcripts distinct from the zzso hormones have been previously zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso I zzso Here we provide evidence for a zzso of zzso transcripts quite different from zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which include zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II and III zzso and zzso are about zzso similar in zzso sequence to one another and zzso but only zzso similar to zzso and about zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences follow a similar zzso they are about zzso similar to one another, but only about zzso similar to zzso as well as the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso levels corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso in the fetal zzso show distinct zzso The role of these predicted hormones during pregnancy remains to be zzso
