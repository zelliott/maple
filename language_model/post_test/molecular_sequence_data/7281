zzso an zzso active zzso of zzso zzso reduced the zzso of cultured zzso mouse melanoma cells probably by affecting protein zzso zzso membrane zzso samples were prepared from the melanoma cells cultured with or without zzso and amounts and structures of zzso sugar chains were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso released by zzso from these samples and reduced with zzso revealed that the zzso cells contain zzso times as much zzso as the control cells, and the relative amounts of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso sugar chains are almost the same between two zzso Western zzso analysis, however, showed that binding of zzso which binds to zzso with the zzso beta zzso beta zzso structure, is significantly reduced in 90 K, 96 K, 140 K, 155 K and 180 K zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the 140 K zzso could be a zzso zzso It was also shown that zzso treatment enhances the zzso of the cells to zzso These results indicate that zzso affects zzso of membrane zzso and alters the cell surface properties of zzso zzso
