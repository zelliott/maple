We isolated a full length zzso clone for bovine zzso from a bovine zzso zzso cell zzso library and compared the structural properties of this zzso protein to the published human and zzso zzso The bovine zzso zzso clone spans a zzso sequence stretch of zzso zzso The open reading frame contains 330 zzso acids with a 20 zzso acid long putative signal zzso The mature protein contains 6 potential zzso zzso sites and a high zzso content zzso zzso zzso revealed three zzso internal structural zzso The zzso repeat containing the zzso binding site showed zzso identity to the human and zzso zzso domain, compared to zzso identity between human and mouse zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from 9 zzso species suggests that the zzso gene is zzso in man, zzso and zzso
