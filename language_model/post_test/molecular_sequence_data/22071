zzso between plant cell walls and plasma zzso are essential for cells to function properly, but the molecules that mediate the structural continuity between wall and membrane are zzso Some of these zzso which are zzso upon tissue zzso in zzso zzso zzso are disrupted by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a characteristic cell zzso motif in zzso In zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein from the plant pathogen zzso zzso that can disrupt cell zzso membrane zzso through its zzso zzso To identify zzso sequences that specifically bind the zzso motif of the zzso protein and potentially play a role in zzso recognition, we screened a zzso zzso library displayed in a zzso zzso and selected two peptides acting as zzso of the plasma membrane zzso activity of zzso Moreover, the two peptides also disrupted cell zzso membrane zzso zzso comparison of the zzso peptides with the zzso zzso revealed 12 proteins containing zzso acid sequences in their zzso zzso common with the two zzso zzso Eight belong to the zzso zzso family, four of which have a zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of one of these, zzso recognized the zzso motif both in peptides and zzso These results imply that zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso interactions with zzso proteins as potential zzso and play a structural and signaling role at the plant cell zzso
