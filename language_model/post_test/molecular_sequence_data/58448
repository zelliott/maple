Computer zzso and zzso zzso were employed to investigate the structural basis for the zzso of steroid zzso and to determine whether point zzso of zzso and zzso can result in changes in the ratio of zzso Single replacement of zzso zzso for zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belonging to the putative zzso gave rise to slightly increased 11 zzso zzso Replacement of 3 zzso acids of zzso by the corresponding zzso in zzso was sufficient to increase cortisol formation from about zzso to zzso of the zzso wild type zzso The zzso zzso activities of the zzso were decreased to varying degrees indicating that point zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and 335 could potentially cause zzso Replacement of zzso of zzso by zzso the corresponding zzso found in zzso led to production of zzso by this zzso zzso This observation suggests that zzso zzso could also be due to point zzso located in the zzso zzso
