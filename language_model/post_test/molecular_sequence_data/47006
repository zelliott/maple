The zzso polarity of the zzso zzso is established through interactions between zzso expressed bone zzso proteins and their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso While the opposing interactions between Short zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso in zzso and zzso there has been up to now no functional evidence of an implication of zzso in the early patterning of organisms other than zzso We have studied the contribution of zzso to the embryonic development of the zzso While zzso zzso genes have been characterized in several zzso species, we report that the zzso zzso harbors three zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso zzso and zzso can antagonize zzso zzso While all three factors have similar biological activities, their embryonic expression is zzso The combined expression of the three genes zzso the different aspects of the expression of the zzso zzso genes of other zzso This suggests that the three zzso zzso genes and the single zzso genes of other zzso have evolved from a common zzso and that subsequent differential loss of zzso elements in the promoters of the different zzso genes accounts for their more restricted zzso zzso Finally we show that zzso is expressed in the fish organizer and able to zzso the zzso suggesting its implication in the zzso patterning of the zzso
