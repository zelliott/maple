The functional properties of rat zzso alpha 1 zzso receptors were investigated using zzso and zzso recording from human embryonic kidney cells zzso with rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gave zzso estimates between 30 and 120 zzso and a Hill slope of approximately zzso Single channel recordings were obtained by zzso application of zzso zzso 1, or 10 zzso to zzso zzso Single channel zzso were mostly zzso zzso but smaller zzso of approximately 40 zzso were also seen zzso of the zzso with a relative frequency that did not depend on zzso zzso The time zzso of the apparent open time zzso did not vary with zzso zzso but short events were more frequent at low zzso zzso There was also evidence of a previously missed short-lived open state that was more common at lower zzso zzso The time zzso for the different components of the burst length zzso were found to have similar values at different zzso Nevertheless, the mean burst length increased with increasing zzso This was because the relative area of each zzso component was concentration dependent and short bursts were favored at lower zzso zzso zzso of adjacent open and shut times were found to be strongly zzso zzso Additionally, long bursts were made up of longer than average openings separated by short gaps, whereas short bursts usually consisted of single isolated short zzso The most plausible explanation for these findings is that long bursts are generated when a higher proportion of the five potential zzso binding sites on the zzso is occupied by zzso On the basis of the concentration dependence and the zzso structure we provide a preliminary kinetic scheme for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in which any number of zzso molecules from one to five can open the channel, although not with equal zzso
