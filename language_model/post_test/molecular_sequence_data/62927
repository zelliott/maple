zzso gene delivery is limited by inefficient transfer of DNA from the zzso to the zzso Nuclear zzso sequence zzso peptides have been widely used to exploit zzso transport mechanisms and promote nuclear zzso of zzso However, the exact conditions to successfully zzso the properties of zzso peptides are still zzso In the present study a panel of zzso peptides that bind different transport receptors were compared for their ability to enhance zzso gene zzso Several factors such as method of incorporating the zzso zzso type of zzso zzso DNA zzso and proper characterization of zzso zzso zzso were identified as important considerations in utilizing zzso peptides to enhance gene zzso In particular, it was shown that a zzso derived from human T cell zzso virus type 1 zzso was able to effectively zzso DNA into discrete particles and mediate levels of zzso expression up to zzso greater than zzso zzso This is the first study to demonstrate efficient zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso Promising results were also achieved with a zzso increase in gene expression using a zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso linkage of an extended zzso zzso via a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Altogether, the results from this study should help to define the requirements for successful zzso zzso
