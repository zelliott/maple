zzso receptors are zzso zzso channels found in a variety of zzso and cell zzso Seven different zzso zzso have been zzso cloned and are known to form zzso and in some cases zzso channel zzso However, the molecular zzso leading to the assembly of zzso into zzso receptors are zzso To address this question we zzso a zzso zzso in which zzso deletion zzso and zzso zzso were examined for their ability to zzso with full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were expressed individually and together with zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso up to the first zzso domain zzso acid zzso and beyond (to zzso acid zzso did not prevent zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso missing the portion of the protein downstream of the second zzso domain could also still zzso However, a zzso terminating 25 zzso acids before the second zzso domain could not assemble with other zzso or itself, implicating the missing region of the protein in zzso This finding was supported and extended by data utilizing a zzso strategy that indicated zzso is a critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso
