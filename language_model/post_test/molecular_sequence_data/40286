The type II zzso system zzso is a zzso complex spanning the inner and outer zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso folded zzso including zzso zzso such as zzso toxin and zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli, zzso The major outer membrane zzso protein is the zzso zzso zzso reconstruction of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso resolution reveals a zzso structure reminiscent of a barrel, with a large channel at its center that contains a closed zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain forms a zzso with a zzso zzso and it binds to a zzso zzso and to the zzso tip of the zzso zzso By combining our results with structures of the zzso toxin and zzso zzso tip, we provide a structural basis for a possible zzso mechanism of the zzso
