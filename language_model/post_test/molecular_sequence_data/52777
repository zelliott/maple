Many pathogen recognition zzso such as plant zzso undergo rapid zzso evolution, providing evidence that these genes play a critical role in zzso zzso Surprisingly, whether rapid zzso evolution also occurs in genes zzso other kinds of plant defense proteins is zzso Unlike recognition zzso plant zzso attack pathogens directly, zzso disease resistance by degrading zzso a component of zzso cell zzso Here, we show that zzso substitution rates in plant class I zzso often exceed synonymous rates in the plant zzso zzso zzso and in other zzso indicating a succession of zzso driven zzso acid zzso We identify individual zzso that are likely subject to positive selection by using zzso substitution models and determine the location of these zzso on the three-dimensional structure of class I zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and plant class III zzso structural and functional relatives of class I zzso the zzso replacements of class I zzso occur disproportionately in the active site zzso This highly unusual pattern of replacements suggests that zzso directly defend against zzso activity through zzso zzso or other forms of chemical resistance and identifies target zzso for manipulating zzso zzso These data also provide empirical evidence that plant defense proteins not involved in pathogen recognition also evolve in a manner consistent with rapid zzso zzso
