An zzso zzso structure is one of the basic structural units in zzso zzso zzso at the zzso positions in the zzso structure play important roles in structures and functions of natural zzso We reported here a zzso that formed a triple stranded zzso zzso showing the zzso structural zzso The zzso was designed to have two His zzso at the zzso positions of the center of the zzso zzso The zzso folded into a triple stranded zzso at neutral zzso while it unfolded at zzso zzso This construct is useful to create a protein that the structure or function is controlled by zzso
