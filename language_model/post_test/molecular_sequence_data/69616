The zzso gene is a complex zzso zzso Multiple transcripts are zzso as a result of alternate promoter usage and the zzso of unique zzso untranslated regions to common coding zzso In order to characterize the mechanisms of zzso gene regulation we performed comparative studies to define essential features of zzso expression in human, rat and zzso zzso promoter regions of the human, mouse and rat zzso genes were fused to the zzso reporter gene and expression was measured in various cell lines that have an zzso active or inactive zzso gene expression pattern, zzso The transient promoter activity of the human, mouse and rat zzso zzso was further compared with the zzso activity of the zzso gene in various zzso and cell lines of human, mouse and rat zzso The results indicate that in transient expression zzso employing zzso systems zzso mouse promoter in human zzso most zzso promoter zzso are active, albeit at low zzso zzso promoter activity is only observed, however, in zzso systems zzso human promoter zzso tested in human zzso This suggests that each promoter, despite the strong sequence conservation of the zzso human, rat and mouse zzso is adapted to the levels of the zzso factors present in its natural zzso Finally, zzso gene expression is not only regulated at the level of zzso but also depends on zzso zzso We show that human, rat and also mouse zzso zzso are subjected to specific zzso zzso suggesting that specific zzso of zzso zzso must be of general zzso zzso
