zzso zzso type 3 zzso is a zzso disorder caused by a zzso repeat expansion in the coding region of a gene zzso zzso a protein of yet unknown zzso Based on a comprehensive zzso analysis, we propose a structural model and zzso functions for zzso Our zzso strategy comprises the compilation of multiple sequence and structure alignments of carefully selected proteins related to zzso These alignments are consistent with additional information on sequence zzso secondary structure, and domain zzso The application of complementary methods revealed the zzso of zzso to zzso and VHS domain proteins involved in membrane trafficking and regulatory zzso zzso We modeled the structure of zzso using the zzso zzso as a template and assessed the reliability of the model by comparison with known sequence and structural zzso We could further zzso potential functions of zzso in agreement with known experimental zzso Our database searches also identified an as yet zzso family of zzso which we named zzso because of their pronounced zzso to the zzso domain of zzso
