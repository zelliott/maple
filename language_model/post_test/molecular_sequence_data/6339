This study was undertaken to characterize the potential zzso affinity of an zzso sequence within the 70 zzso zzso family of proteins zzso that shares zzso with a zzso sequence present in the zzso of zzso zzso defined by the synthetic zzso zzso zzso To first define the zzso binding sequence within zzso solid phase binding zzso were performed using zzso short (7 zzso zzso synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso sequence within zzso Only the sequence zzso bound zzso zzso and the zzso zzso blocked zzso binding to intact zzso by zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A computer-generated zzso search revealed that two members of the 70 zzso zzso family, zzso and zzso contain the sequences zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding using affinity zzso indicated that while native zzso binds zzso native zzso does zzso Treatment of the zzso fraction with heat or zzso led to enhanced zzso binding to zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso also significantly inhibited zzso binding to zzso that had been zzso by zzso affinity zzso Finally, Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso by zzso affinity zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso could recognize zzso These data demonstrate that zzso or zzso represent a a common zzso binding motif in zzso zzso and zzso and are consistent with a proposed role for zzso or similar zzso structures in the function of the 70 zzso zzso zzso
