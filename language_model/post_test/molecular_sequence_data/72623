We describe a novel diverse family of metal zzso zzso zzso proteins (the zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso with members occurring in both zzso and zzso Thirteen zzso protein members of the zzso family have been identified, several of which have been shown to transport zzso cadmium and/or zzso All members of the zzso family possess six putative zzso zzso with strongest conservation in the four zzso zzso and on the basis of the zzso we present a unified structural zzso Members of the family are shown to exhibit an unusual degree of size variation, sequence zzso and differences in cell zzso and zzso The zzso tree for the zzso family reveals that zzso and zzso proteins cluster zzso It allows functional predictions for some zzso members of this zzso A signature sequence specific for the zzso family is zzso
