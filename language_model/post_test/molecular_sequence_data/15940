We have identified the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso gene zzso by zzso transformation and by DNA zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso with the zzso from 3 other zzso revealed regions of zzso some of which zzso to the previously identified zzso binding sites, while others have as yet, no assigned zzso In particular, the strict conservation of an zzso within the proposed zzso binding site suggests a role in zzso binding for this zzso zzso of 5 zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso revealed significant similarity which was strongest in those regions important to zzso activity of the zzso zzso and, therefore we propose that the zzso zzso may be derived from a cellular zzso zzso The implications for the evolution of zzso activities within a zzso of zzso metabolism are zzso
