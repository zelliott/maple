zzso zzso zzso are important zzso in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso gene families, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso however, their functional characterization in zzso largely remains to be zzso In this study, we cloned the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso contains zzso consensus motifs and a zzso zzso site at the N zzso The zzso zzso was activated by zzso and exhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed the zzso and processing of zzso in a transformed zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso cells was zzso not only by zzso zzso zzso but also under salt stress zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso cells possess a zzso that zzso in the zzso of P under zzso zzso
