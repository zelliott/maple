The membrane surrounding the central zzso of plant cells contains an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso are abundant and ubiquitous in plants but the zzso is unusual in its exclusive use of zzso zzso zzso as an energy zzso The lack of sequence identity between the zzso zzso and any other characterized zzso pump implies a different evolutionary origin for this zzso The existence of the zzso zzso in conjunction with increasing recognition of zzso as a key zzso in plant systems, zzso reconsideration of zzso as the primary energy source for membrane transport in plant zzso
