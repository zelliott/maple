zzso zzso markers were developed for zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the population genetic structure and genetic diversity of natural populations of zzso zzso and other zzso species in zzso 

zzso zzso technology was used to generate zzso sequence reads from zzso zzso DNA, which together contained zzso perfect simple sequence repeats zzso zzso pairs were designed for 30 zzso of which 15 were used to zzso 30 zzso zzso plants from two geographical areas in zzso All markers were zzso with two to nine zzso in the overall zzso zzso amplification was tested in 10 additional zzso zzso Seven zzso showed consistent amplification in six or more zzso 

The 15 zzso markers developed for zzso zzso are promising candidates for population genetic analyses within zzso zzso and other species of zzso
