The entire mouse collagen X gene zzso has been zzso The gene is composed of three zzso and two zzso spanning zzso zzso of the DNA zzso zzso 2 and 3 together zzso zzso of zzso untranslated zzso a zzso open reading frame and an zzso 3' zzso zzso In the zzso zzso region of the zzso two consensus zzso sequences were zzso Identification of the first zzso by zzso zzso and the determination of the zzso end of zzso zzso transcripts by zzso analyses show that the more 3' zzso box is probably predominantly used and that there are at least three zzso start sites in the zzso 1 sequence 3' to this, resulting in zzso untranslated regions of 78, 77 and 55 zzso By means of rapid amplification of zzso ends by zzso chain reaction, an additional zzso species was detected which overlapped the other zzso zzso including the 3' zzso box zzso giving a zzso untranslated sequence of approximately 235 zzso This latter transcript starts approximately 20 zzso 3' to the more zzso zzso zzso The data suggest alternative use of promoters and zzso starts for the zzso zzso zzso of the combined zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso 2 and 3 with chicken, bovine and human collagen X zzso showed a high degree of similarity indicating conservation of this gene throughout zzso Mouse zzso zzso was shown to be approximately zzso zzso and the zzso zzso as detected by zzso was approximately 45 zzso The zzso and protein sizes correlate with that predicted by the open reading zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso indicate that the mouse collagen X gene is first expressed at zzso days post zzso temporally preceding the onset of zzso zzso In agreement with the generally accepted association of zzso collagen with zzso zzso in zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso zzso are restricted to the zzso regions of growth zzso
