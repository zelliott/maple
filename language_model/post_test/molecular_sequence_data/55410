zzso is a specific type of zzso involving both plants and their zzso associated zzso In the present study zzso zzso and zzso associated degrading strains were evaluated for zzso zzso zzso pot experiments were conducted in greenhouse with zzso zzso grown in soil amended with zzso at the zzso of 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 zzso for 60 zzso The half life of zzso varied from zzso to zzso days in planted zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso correlated with abundance of degrading zzso in zzso The isolated species of zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated for their degrading potential in mineral zzso A novel isolated strain of potential zzso zzso zzso named as zzso zzso showed better survival and degradation at high concentration of zzso zzso of zzso by strain zzso zzso 100, 50 and zzso degradation within the time period of 48 h zzso 72 and 120 h at zzso and 150 zzso zzso further the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso was amplified using zzso amplification strategy and zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso is effective zzso technique to remove zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso itself, in addition to the zzso bacterial zzso seemed to play an important role in reducing zzso level in zzso High zzso tolerance and zzso degradation capability of zzso zzso makes this plant suitable for decontamination and zzso of contaminated zzso The ability to survive at higher concentration of zzso and enhanced degrading potential due to presence of zzso gene make zzso zzso zzso zzso an ideal candidate for its application in zzso zzso
