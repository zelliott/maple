zzso regulator zzso is a zzso regulator involved in establishing zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene lead to the development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is mainly localized in the cell nucleus where it is associated with nuclear zzso The zzso part of zzso has been previously shown to mediate nuclear zzso of the zzso However, the functional nuclear zzso signal zzso and nuclear import mechanisms of zzso have not been zzso We show that, although the zzso sequence of zzso contains a potential zzso zzso consisting of zzso acids zzso and zzso only the latter part constitutes a functional zzso Furthermore, we show by in zzso binding zzso that zzso interacts with multiple members of the nuclear transport zzso zzso alpha family, mainly zzso zzso and zzso and that these interactions depend on the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, we found that zzso binds to the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso and zzso proteins consisting of the zzso zzso repeats zzso Our findings strongly suggest that the nuclear import of zzso is zzso by the classical zzso zzso zzso through binding to several zzso alpha family zzso
