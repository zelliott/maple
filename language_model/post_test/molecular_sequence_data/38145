The yellow locus in zzso is involved in both zzso development and zzso However, the function of the zzso protein is zzso Here we have zzso the sequence and expression pattern of a new zzso zzso designated zzso zzso a zzso protein that is 57% identical to zzso High levels of zzso zzso are present in the zzso zzso but the gene is also expressed in the zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family distributed among zzso 2, 3, and zzso The Yellow proteins are related to the Royal zzso proteins and have no relatives in other zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso protein is zzso by the zzso of a radiation tolerant zzso zzso zzso
