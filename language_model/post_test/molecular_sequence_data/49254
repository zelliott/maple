The zzso zzso dominant cataract zzso created in zzso experiments have proven to be a powerful resource for zzso the biological processes involved in zzso We report a zzso which in the zzso state exhibits mild zzso cataract named zzso zzso in zzso symbol zzso By molecular zzso followed by a candidate gene approach, the zzso was shown to be zzso with a knockout of the zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso for zzso and for zzso zzso zzso are similar but a new effect, zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso surviving beyond 4 weeks, which may contribute to early zzso zzso identified the zzso as a zzso change, leading to the zzso substitution zzso zzso in the basic region of the zzso zzso Since mice zzso for zzso of zzso show no zzso this suggests that the zzso zzso zzso protein has a dominant zzso We have demonstrated that this zzso results in a selective zzso in DNA binding affinities to target zzso containing variations in the core zzso and zzso zzso This implies that zzso zzso is important for core element binding and suggests that the zzso protein may exert a differential downstream effect amongst its binding zzso The zzso seen in zzso zzso and human zzso zzso are similar to one another, zzso that zzso may be a model of human zzso cortical zzso Furthermore, when bred onto a different genetic background zzso zzso also show anterior segment zzso The zzso zzso therefore provides a valuable model system for the study of zzso and its interacting factors, in normal and abnormal lens and anterior segment zzso
