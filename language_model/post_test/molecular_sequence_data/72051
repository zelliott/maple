Human zzso zzso zzso class II molecules are zzso cell surface zzso that are crucial for the cellular interaction in immune zzso The expression of class II molecules is regulated in a zzso and zzso manner, and is mainly restricted to the zzso presenting zzso However, some tumor cells also express class II zzso and in some zzso tumor cells, class II expression is zzso by zzso zzso However, their expression varies, even though the tumor cells originate from the same zzso zzso some tumor cells show strong zzso others show weak or no zzso To determine whether this differential expression of class II molecules on tumor cells is zzso zzso zzso analysis and Northern zzso were performed using a panel of melanoma cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso to analyze the cell surface expression and zzso zzso rate of zzso before and after treatment with zzso zzso analysis showed that before zzso treatment, zzso and zzso cells barely expressed zzso On the contrary, almost all of the zzso cells zzso zzso and a relatively high rate zzso zzso of zzso cells expressed zzso After zzso treatment, zzso expression was induced in zzso cells and zzso cells which displayed elevated levels of zzso expression in a zzso zzso However, zzso cells never responded to zzso Northern analysis showed that treatment with zzso led to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso and zzso whereas in zzso zzso did not augment the zzso rate of the zzso zzso To further clarify this differential zzso sequencing analysis of zzso product of the zzso zzso promoter region was done, since the zzso rate of the class II gene is controlled by the zzso zzso promoter zzso Six independent clones from zzso products of the zzso zzso promoter region and 16 clones from zzso products of the zzso zzso promoter region were isolated from the above cell lines and zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of all 6 clones of zzso promoter showed that the sequences are extremely similar in both regulatory sequences and their intervening zzso Sixteen clones of zzso promoter showed sequence variations such as substitution and zzso and these 16 clones could be further grouped into 6 zzso with sequence zzso These data established that the melanoma cell lines studied here showed a differential zzso to zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso that this zzso is zzso zzso and that the difference in promoter activity by sequence variation might contribute to such a differential zzso regulation at the promoter zzso
