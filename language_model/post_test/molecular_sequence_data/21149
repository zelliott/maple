zzso are a family of zzso proteins that show zzso diversity by a combination of multiple genes and alternative zzso zzso Of the 4 different zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso as well as cardiac zzso in zzso In this study, we amplified and zzso the upstream regulatory region of the zzso gene from both normal and zzso zzso zzso To identify the zzso that are essential for the expression of the zzso we created various deletion zzso of the zzso promoter DNA, inserted the deleted segments into zzso zzso and performed zzso zzso using zzso as the reporter zzso zzso of sequences of the promoter region of the zzso gene from normal and zzso zzso revealed no zzso in the promoter sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso box elements that are generally involved in controlling the expression of several other zzso gene promoters were not found in the upstream regulatory region of the zzso zzso In deletion experiments, loss of activity of the reporter gene was noted upon deletion which was then restored upon further deletion suggesting the presence of both positive and negative zzso in the upstream regulatory region of the zzso zzso We believe that this is the first zzso promoter that has ever been cloned and studied with clear evidence that it functions in zzso cell zzso Although zzso zzso zzso elements are absent from the promoter region of zzso zzso our results suggest the presence of positive and negative zzso in the promoter region, which in conjunction with positive and negative zzso may be involved in regulating the expression of zzso gene in a zzso zzso
