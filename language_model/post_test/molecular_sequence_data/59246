The structural zzso of zzso zzso specificity of zzso I zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso from zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso zzso zzso generally favor zzso zzso acids at zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso a zzso zzso at zzso which leads to zzso of zzso On the basis of zzso acid sequence alignments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are zzso only in zzso zzso with the ability to activate zzso and are located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso were constructed, zzso in zzso coli cells and zzso for comparative studies using natural and synthetic zzso zzso of zzso to zzso or zzso and deletion of zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso caused drastic decreases in the activities towards zzso containing a basic zzso acid zzso at zzso In contrast, zzso with a zzso zzso at zzso were effectively zzso by each zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso on the active site zzso play important roles in the recognition of a basic zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso
