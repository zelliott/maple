A number of zzso zzso termed zzso zzso occur in the saliva of the zzso insect zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso for zzso zzso zzso bind the zzso b zzso in the zzso of their zzso fold, which is further anchored through a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso coordination site then binds zzso oxide zzso for delivery into a zzso zzso during blood zzso where, upon NO release, the zzso zzso site acts as a zzso trap to delay the victim's immune zzso Previously, four zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso have been extensively zzso Recently, another zzso zzso was discovered in a zzso library derived from the same zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be unique in its ability to bind to zzso charged cell zzso However, the yield of functional zzso zzso was rather low when the established protocol for zzso was zzso Here, we report on a novel expression and zzso method for zzso that yields sufficient amounts of pure protein for extensive characterization zzso zzso This method may prove useful for the zzso of other proteins with a zzso zzso
