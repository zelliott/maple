The full length coding sequence of the cattle zzso factor zzso was isolated and zzso The cloned bovine zzso was expressed in zzso cells, and it induced the zzso zzso reporter gene zzso Using gel zzso techniques, we demonstrated that the cloned bovine zzso bound to the consensus zzso zzso The comparison of the bovine zzso with its human and mouse zzso at zzso acid level showed high zzso in both the zzso domain, known as zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso domain zzso The zzso analysis at DNA level provided a new insight in the evolution of the zzso family, and it could resolve the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso was zzso in zzso the zzso sequences deviated from each other, and showed faster molecular evolution than zzso zzso which may indirectly result in the modification of zzso immune zzso
