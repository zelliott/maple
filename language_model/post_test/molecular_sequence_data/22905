The zzso zzso zzso protein is a major zzso in severe acute respiratory zzso It binds to the viral zzso zzso and forms the zzso zzso The zzso N protein has also been suggested to be involved in other important functions in the viral life zzso Here we show that the N protein consists of two zzso structural zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso surrounded by flexible zzso The zzso domain exists exclusively as a zzso in zzso The flexible zzso are zzso zzso and represent potential interaction sites with other protein and zzso zzso zzso reveal that other coronavirus N proteins could share the same modular zzso This study provides information on the domain structure partition of zzso N protein and insights into the differing roles of structured and zzso regions in coronavirus zzso zzso
