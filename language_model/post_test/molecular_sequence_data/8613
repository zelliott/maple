The expression of genes coding for inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso from 15 normal zzso 11 cervical zzso zzso and 13 cervical cancer zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids were reverse transcribed and amplified in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA was then captured onto zzso zzso plate and zzso measured in a zzso reaction using zzso zzso zzso to horse zzso zzso There is no change of zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso gene expression in either cervical zzso zzso or cervical cancer zzso But the zzso of zzso gene is significantly reduced in both cervical zzso zzso and cervical cancer tissue as compared to normal zzso This study demonstrated that reverse zzso and quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso to zzso zzso plate zzso is a sensitive and useful method to zzso multiple zzso gene zzso Our results also suggest that cervical zzso cells are capable to express zzso and that zzso may play a role in the zzso of cervical cancer since its reduced expression may influence inflammation and immunity of the cervical zzso
