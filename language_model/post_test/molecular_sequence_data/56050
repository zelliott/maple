The zzso zzso zzso is resistant to high zzso (1 zzso of the zzso zzso Using in zzso translation studies it was confirmed that this extreme resistance is a property of zzso The resistance zzso from zzso zzso was cloned into zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso demonstrated that resistance was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was shown to contain only one copy of the gene that encodes this protein and the gene was located to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was found to contain multiple copies of the gene for the corresponding zzso protein zzso which mapped to two of the three zzso zzso XIV and zzso Since the zzso gene of zzso zzso causes essentially complete protection against zzso by the drug, it is likely to be particularly useful as a selective marker in zzso gene transfer zzso
