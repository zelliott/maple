zzso display technology was used to identify zzso zzso with unique specificity for a zzso model zzso zzso that zzso the human multiple sclerosis associated zzso class II zzso zzso in complex with a zzso basic protein zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso Several zzso zzso were identified and all of them zzso specifically zzso One zzso zzso was selected and linked to beaded zzso and demonstrated excellent performance as a zzso affinity zzso zzso This zzso zzso was efficient in the zzso of zzso zzso fragments and had no affinity for other zzso Using this zzso zzso zzso zzso could be zzso from cell culture zzso thereby separating zzso zzso from bovine zzso normally present in the enriched growth media used for such zzso zzso of the fine specificity of the zzso zzso demonstrated that it zzso a unique zzso within the heavy chain zzso region of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso which had retained the specificity and affinity of the original zzso but had slightly different zzso acid composition in the zzso region, were not zzso by the zzso zzso
