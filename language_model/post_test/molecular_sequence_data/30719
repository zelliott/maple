The zzso zzso is but one member of a large family of zzso zzso which includes another zzso zzso and several longer peptides terminating in one or the other of these zzso zzso These peptides have been isolated from both zzso and zzso but so far not one has been isolated from an zzso Since the zzso worms are believed to share a common zzso with zzso and zzso they should contain zzso zzso We found two zzso zzso in zzso zzso but zzso and fast atom zzso mass zzso revealed that they represent only one native zzso zzso (The other peak is its zzso zzso zzso Each zzso contained only 100 to 600 zzso of zzso which is at least zzso times less than the levels in zzso Our identification of a zzso and only a zzso in this zzso suggests that the zzso are the more ancient members of the family, and were probably present in the common ancestors of the zzso zzso and zzso
