In this work, we present the construction of a zzso library in zzso coli using zzso zzso and environmental DNA directly isolated from Antarctic zzso and screened for zzso zzso zzso on zzso supplemented with olive oil and zzso B revealed one clone with zzso activity zzso out of 1000 zzso coli zzso This clone zzso a zzso zzso which has an insert of zzso zzso that was completely zzso from both zzso Further analysis of the insert showed three open reading frames zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso ) of 469 zzso acids with zzso identity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparison and zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso was closely related to family I zzso zzso Furthermore, we present a three-dimensional model of zzso zzso which was generated based on the two known structures of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we report the results of comparisons between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and point out similarities and differences in the zzso site and in other parts of the analyzed zzso
