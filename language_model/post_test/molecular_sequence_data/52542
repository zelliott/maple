A full-length zzso zzso a zzso zzso named zzso was identified and cloned for the first time from the human zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso containing an open reading frame of zzso base pairs revealed that the zzso consists of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso containing the well zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli cells efficiently released zzso from zzso zzso fusion but not from other zzso protein zzso including zzso suggesting its role in the generation of matured zzso specifically from its zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso contained much higher amounts of zzso zzso than colon and peripheral blood zzso whereas other zzso such as heart and zzso had little or zzso In addition, zzso zzso using green fluorescent zzso fusion showed that zzso is exclusively localized to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in the regulation of zzso cellular processes particularly related to zzso
