In the present work, we intend to determine the capacity of human zzso to recognize zzso of the zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso by a previous zzso zzso infection were zzso Some zzso proteins zzso including zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso of zzso respectively), were recognized in proliferation zzso by zzso from 28 zzso individuals and not by zzso from control, zzso zzso zzso peptides covering zzso zones of particular interest were tested and appeared to induce zzso responses of zzso from zzso donors, allowing identification of putative T cell zzso
