A zzso zzso of a zzso protein zzso zzso protein has been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains two repeat sequences at zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence is zzso zzso to human zzso and is named zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso the consensus motifs of zzso are within the two zzso zzso zzso However, divergent motifs between the zzso and CDs are much shorter than the corresponding sequences of other zzso To study the structure and function of this zzso we performed zzso experiment in zzso coli and in zzso zzso zzso to investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso on the human zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso could zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso examination showed that both zzso zzso and a truncated form of zzso with a zzso deletion at the zzso could zzso zzso and a truncated form of zzso that contains the zzso zzso However, these two forms of zzso could not zzso a truncated form zzso that lacks the zzso zzso A truncated form of zzso that lacks either of CDs does not have any zzso zzso These results indicated that, like other zzso the zzso site in zzso is located within the zzso domain of the zzso protein and that its zzso activity is closely associated with the two zzso This study on the structure and function of zzso demonstrates that it is a new member of the zzso zzso
