Small zzso calcium activated zzso channels zzso are crucial in the regulation of cell firing frequency in the nervous system and other zzso In the present work, a novel SK channel blocker, designated zzso was zzso from the scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso 22 zzso acid zzso was determined by zzso zzso Using this sequence information, the full-length zzso and zzso gene of zzso were cloned and zzso By these zzso zzso was found to be a zzso composed of 31 zzso acid zzso with three zzso zzso It shared little sequence zzso with other known scorpion zzso but showed close relationship with SK channel zzso in the zzso zzso According to the previous zzso zzso was classified as zzso We examined the effects of zzso on different zzso channels of rat adrenal zzso cells zzso and locust zzso zzso median zzso zzso zzso selectively inhibited zzso SK currents in zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and Hill zzso of zzso And it had no effect on zzso zzso zzso and BK currents in zzso zzso indicating that zzso was a selective SK zzso
