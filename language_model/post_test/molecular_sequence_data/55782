P zzso are highly ordered composite structures consisting of thin zzso tips joined zzso to rigid zzso zzso The production of these zzso structures requires a zzso zzso zzso and an outer membrane protein zzso that is the zzso member of a newly recognized class of proteins that we have named zzso zzso Two in zzso zzso showed that the zzso complexes that zzso forms with the three most zzso tip zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso bound to zzso The relative affinity of each complex for zzso was found to correlate with the final position of the zzso type in the tip zzso In contrast, the complexes zzso forms with the major component of the zzso rod, zzso or the zzso rod initiating zzso zzso did not recognize zzso The in zzso data argue that differential targeting of zzso complexes to zzso may be part of a mechanism to ensure the correctly ordered assembly of adhesive composite zzso
