The product of the zzso invasion gene of zzso zzso has been expressed as a zzso fusion zzso It is a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif protein family with strong sequence similarity to plant zzso zzso zzso It zzso zzso and zzso zzso with four or more zzso groups, always producing an zzso as one zzso zzso zzso zzso is the preferred zzso with a zzso of 10 zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso It is inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso of zzso in zzso yielded zzso as the only zzso zzso In terms of zzso reaction mechanism and properties, zzso is very similar to zzso zzso zzso and unlike previously described bacterial zzso zzso zzso are present in the zzso of other invasive zzso They may function to reduce zzso zzso levels during invasion and so enhance pathogen zzso
