zzso of T cell zzso beta and gamma chain zzso beta and T zzso genes were analyzed by Southern zzso method in samples from 30 patients with adult T cell leukemia zzso and 17 patients with zzso T cell zzso The DNA zzso used were the constant and joining region of T beta gene and the joining region of T gamma zzso zzso bands of T beta gene on one or both zzso zzso were detected in all zzso T cells, even those of smoldering ATL, in which only a small percentage of peripheral blood T cells were detected as zzso T gamma gene was rearranged in the cells of all but one patient, the exception being one ATL zzso In order to test whether any given variable region zzso of T beta gene was expressed in ATL cells, two functionally rearranged V beta sequences of ATL were compared with a V beta sequence from T cells acute zzso leukemia zzso No significant zzso were noted among the three deduced gene product zzso acid zzso confirming that T beta molecules of ATL cells contained no specific structures in zzso The observed zzso of T beta and T gamma gene zzso in ATL cells further supported these zzso
