zzso zzso and molecular characterization of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of 229 zzso zzso zzso which were obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease during the period zzso was determined using 14 zzso zzso Of the 229 zzso 114 zzso were resistant to at least one agent and resistance rates ranged from zzso to zzso Resistance rates for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso regions of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso All zzso zzso strains possessed at least one zzso acid substitution in each of the zzso and zzso fragments zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso require at least one zzso acid substitution in both zzso and zzso in order to attain significant levels of resistance to zzso All zzso zzso belonged to zzso 6, and their zzso by zzso analysis was zzso This result indicates that zzso zzso zzso strains have zzso zzso
