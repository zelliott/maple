Human zzso zzso are required for the pharmacological activity of several clinically important zzso and zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 are described as zzso zzso in the literature, whereas human zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 are believed to be located in the zzso We expressed the four human zzso zzso as fusion proteins with the green fluorescent protein to study their zzso locations in zzso Our data showed that the human zzso zzso is located in the cell nucleus and the human zzso zzso is located in the zzso The fusion proteins between green fluorescent protein and zzso zzso 1 and 2 were both predominantly located in the zzso zzso zzso of a putative nuclear targeting zzso identified in the primary structure of zzso zzso completely abolished nuclear import of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso cell line with the zzso nuclear or the zzso zzso zzso both restored sensitivity toward zzso zzso zzso This paper reports that a zzso zzso is located in the cell nucleus and we discuss the implications for zzso synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso
