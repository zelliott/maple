The family of zzso receptors consists of at least eight distinct zzso divided into four classes based on their pharmacological and functional zzso Here we report the cloning and expression in Swiss zzso cells of the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both genes zzso functional receptors for zzso that differ considerably in zzso structure, primary zzso acid zzso pharmacology and signal zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed a single high affinity site for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a pharmacological profile specific for the zzso zzso In these zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso exhibited high affinity binding for the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso specific pharmacological zzso In these cells zzso activated zzso C in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed a zzso organization quite different from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso While these receptors are zzso by one single zzso the zzso zzso is zzso by three zzso separated by two zzso The latter finding adds and additional molecular criterion for zzso zzso
