A new member of the zzso family of zzso factors, called zzso has been isolated from a zzso library prepared from zzso virus zzso human B zzso zzso is a 125 zzso acid nuclear protein possessing a basic zzso zzso domain that is most similar to the basic zzso zzso of zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso isolated from a variety of human zzso and established cell lines indicates that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso with the strongest zzso detected in lung and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein cannot be detected using the zzso two hybrid system or using in zzso binding zzso with zzso and zzso binding zzso fusion proteins produced in zzso zzso However, a zzso two hybrid library screen has identified the human zzso zzso as a specific binding partner for zzso zzso zzso efficiently with in zzso translated zzso zzso and zzso but only zzso associates with zzso In addition, zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrate that a zzso protein complex can interact with DNA containing a consensus binding site for zzso suggesting that zzso functions as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex in human zzso
