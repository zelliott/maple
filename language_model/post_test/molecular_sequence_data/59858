To explore further the origin of spontaneous zzso recovered with the Big Blue transgenic mouse zzso zzso the spectrum of ex zzso zzso from pinpoint zzso plaques was determined and compared with the spectrum of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso gene and zzso operator region from 62 pinpoint blue plaques was zzso The observed zzso spectrum of pinpoint zzso differed significantly from that seen in circular zzso zzso zzso zzso Only four percent of the zzso were transitions at zzso sites whereas this type of zzso was the most common zzso in circular zzso zzso were seen more frequently in pinpoint zzso relative to circular zzso Four base pair zzso events at the zzso coli hotspot tandem repeats were seen in 10 of 62 zzso pinpoint zzso and minor hotspots of zzso were observed at zzso 141 and zzso The zzso spectrum of pinpoint zzso provides further evidence that most circular zzso originate in zzso
