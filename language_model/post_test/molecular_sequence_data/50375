An zzso mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso requires zzso for growth zzso We have shown previously that zzso acts on zzso cells to induce zzso of a zzso growth factor zzso growth factor, which in turn stimulates growth of the cells in an zzso zzso In this study, the zzso growth factor zzso was zzso from a zzso medium of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso cloning of zzso by use of its partial zzso acid sequence data revealed that zzso is a distinctive zzso growth zzso An zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with a putative signal zzso which shares zzso zzso with known members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was markedly induced by 10 zzso testosterone in Northern zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells clearly showed remarkable zzso effects of zzso on growth of zzso cells in the absence of zzso Thus, it is clear that the zzso growth of zzso cells is zzso in an zzso manner by zzso which is zzso by the tumor cells themselves in response to hormonal zzso
