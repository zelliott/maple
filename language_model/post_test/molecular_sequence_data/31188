zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cells have an zzso zzso activity that is zzso in zzso cells differentiated to zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter has been used to further define this activity and we show that in zzso the zzso of this promoter in zzso zzso and zzso cell extracts reflects the regulation in zzso In zzso cell extracts several zzso protein factors bind to zzso promoter zzso A zzso domain containing a zzso binds proteins present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso between zzso and zzso define a zzso of binding activities, termed zzso all of which are down regulated as zzso stem cells zzso zzso a low zzso regulated binding activity requires DNA sequences that overlap those required by zzso The zzso and the zzso binding site compete for zzso in zzso indicating that in zzso cell extracts the respective proteins function as positively acting, binding site dependent zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the previously defined zzso cell factor zzso induced during zzso infection, indicates that although both factors zzso the same region of the promoter there are clear differences between zzso These data indicate that multiple factors are necessary for efficient zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso cell extracts and suggest that zzso is responsible, at least in part, for the zzso regulation of the cellular zzso zzso
