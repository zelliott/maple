Alternative zzso is thought to be a major source of functional diversity in animal zzso We analyzed the evolutionary conservation of proteins zzso by alternatively spliced genes and predicted the ancestral state for 73 cases of alternative zzso zzso insertions and 48 zzso The zzso acid sequences of most of the zzso in proteins produced by alternative zzso are as zzso as the surrounding zzso Thus, alternative zzso often creates novel zzso by the zzso of new, functional protein sequences that probably originated from zzso sequences of zzso
