Using zzso cloning and sequencing techniques, a zzso complementary DNA zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified in the zzso zzso of blue zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence shows significant sequence identity to several zzso in zzso zzso family zzso The zzso gene has been isolated and zzso from zzso tissue of blue zzso and contains five zzso The zzso has been expressed zzso in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso was produced in a zzso zzso with an expression level of 900 zzso The expression level is strongly affected by the induction zzso A zzso zzso zzso composed of a combination of immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso and zzso exchange zzso is required to give a pure zzso However, due to zzso zzso structural varieties regarding molecular mass and zzso point were zzso The specific activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was close to that of the zzso zzso Also pH and temperature zzso were the same as for the native zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is regarded as a suitable host strain for the production of blue zzso zzso This is the first time a zzso zzso has been characterized at the DNA zzso
