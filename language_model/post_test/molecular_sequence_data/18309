We studied the association of a zzso zzso zzso beta restriction zzso length zzso zzso and a new zzso zzso with zzso zzso I) diabetes zzso This study is part of our effort to find new zzso disease genes involved in this chronic zzso zzso zzso Distribution of a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 2 zzso was not different in diabetics and zzso A new zzso zzso which gave a zzso zzso zzso III restriction zzso zzso zzso was found with a frequency of zzso in a population of 78 zzso patients, compared to zzso in 68 control subjects zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In 11 multiplex families zzso a high prevalence of the zzso zzso was also observed, but zzso with the disease was not zzso Our data suggest that a zzso beta 2 zzso is not associated with the disease, whereas a particular zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased in Type I diabetics although formal proof of linkage is zzso zzso typing zzso that the zzso specificity and the zzso zzso zzso are primary risk markers in zzso zzso I) diabetes zzso
