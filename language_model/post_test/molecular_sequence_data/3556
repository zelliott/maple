zzso is the major zzso zzso hormone of several zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso activity is essential for the synthesis of zzso zzso Cloning and expression studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can function as zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the isolated zzso had 276 zzso acid zzso and shared approximately zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequence data search showed that the zzso zzso clone belongs to the zzso zzso zzso The clear zzso prepared from zzso coli harboring the zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso Its identification was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso product revealed that it possessed both zzso zzso and steroid zzso activities, and zzso the zzso immediate precursor of zzso hormone, was one of the preferred zzso Furthermore, Northern zzso analysis zzso that the transcripts are present both in fully grown, immature zzso zzso and at higher levels in mature zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is involved in the production of zzso hormone, and they provide evidence for a novel zzso role of this zzso in the final maturation of zzso Based on its functional properties, the zzso can be referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso
