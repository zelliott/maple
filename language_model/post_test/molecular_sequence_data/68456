zzso a regulatory element of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso defined by an zzso of zzso into the zzso of strain zzso affects the expression of several zzso at the zzso zzso zzso reduction in transcript levels for zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso while zzso levels for zzso zzso and protein A zzso were zzso Because the zzso gene resides within the zzso transcript of the zzso regulator, zzso the reduction in zzso message in the zzso strain of zzso is indicative of additional regulatory events in zzso gene zzso Northern zzso analysis of total cellular zzso zzso with zzso specific for zzso and zzso (the two major transcripts of the zzso zzso showed that both transcripts were reduced 16- to zzso at 3 h zzso exponential zzso and 8- to zzso at 12 h zzso zzso These data confirm our original findings zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hart, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1993) that two regulatory zzso zzso and zzso are interactive at the zzso zzso
