zzso zzso metabolism is controlled and zzso by hundreds of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso to the zzso compartment or bacteria, there is little evidence for zzso zzso that play a role as zzso of zzso We zzso zzso zzso to identify short zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and found 50 abundant small zzso zzso represented by zzso in some cases, thousands of sequencing reads, whereas reads are in general absent from the surrounding sequence zzso Other than zzso representing the most highly abundant zzso zzso and zzso most zzso are located in zzso regions and many are found a short distance upstream of start zzso By transcript end mapping we show that the zzso and 3' zzso of zzso zzso coincide with the ends of zzso zzso of zzso identified in zzso are zzso between different zzso species and in several cases, we identified putative zzso in rice deep sequencing zzso Recently, it was suggested that small zzso zzso fragments could result from the protective action of zzso repeat zzso proteins against zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding zzso Our data support this scenario on a zzso level and suggest that a large number of zzso are in fact remnants of zzso protein zzso
