The expressed sequence tag zzso zzso of zzso zzso provides a wealth of information towards gene zzso The complete zzso and zzso sequence of zzso zzso locus shows that it contains five copies of the zzso zzso zzso motif present in a number of molecules with adhesive zzso A zzso region implicated with the adhesive characteristic of another group of proteins including several zzso is also present in this zzso The protein zzso by this sequence zzso is strongly zzso by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically reacted with a single protein of identical molecular mass as zzso and exclusively labeled the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso encodes for zzso a previously zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso The extensive sequence similarity across multiple protein zzso provides evidence that the protein zzso by this locus is the zzso to the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso
