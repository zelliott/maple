The zzso gene has been implicated in zzso colon cancer and is one of several zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso DNA mismatch repair zzso To determine the effect of zzso zzso on zzso integrity in zzso hybrid transgenic mice were constructed that carry targeted disruptions at the zzso zzso along with a zzso integrated zzso reporter zzso In the absence of any zzso treatment, mice zzso for zzso showed a zzso zzso in zzso frequency in all zzso examined compared with both zzso and zzso litter zzso The zzso pattern in the zzso was notable for frequent zzso deletions and insertions within zzso repeat zzso consistent with an essential role for zzso in the repair of replication zzso zzso Further, the results demonstrate that high rates of zzso in multiple zzso are compatible with normal development and life and are not necessarily associated with accelerated zzso Also, the finding of genetic instability in all zzso tested contrasts with the limited tissue distribution of zzso in the animals, raising important questions regarding the role of zzso in zzso
