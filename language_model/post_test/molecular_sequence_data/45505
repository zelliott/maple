zzso (AP) sites are a threat to cellular viability and zzso integrity, since they impede zzso and DNA zzso In zzso cells, DNA zzso zzso beta plays an important role in the repair of zzso zzso However, it is known that many organisms, including zzso zzso do not have a pol beta zzso and it is unclear how they repair zzso zzso Here, we screened for DNA zzso that interact with the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso repair protein 1), and found that zzso pol zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to zzso in a protein affinity zzso zzso directly zzso with zzso in zzso and in zzso but not with zzso These findings suggest that the DNA zzso partner for zzso is zzso zzso and that this interaction occurs through zzso Interestingly, zzso bound to the zzso region of zzso which has no known protein zzso suggesting that this binding is a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso could stimulate the zzso zzso activity of zzso but not the zzso activity, and form a zzso zzso could not incorporate zzso at the zzso zzso sites but did show strand displacement activity for zzso DNA, which was not influenced by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso treatments increased zzso levels of zzso and zzso On the basis of the direct interaction between zzso and zzso we suggest that zzso zzso may be involved in the repair zzso of zzso sites in zzso
