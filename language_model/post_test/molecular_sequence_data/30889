The tumor promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of human zzso cells and zzso differentiation into zzso zzso zzso We have isolated zzso clones induced by zzso in the presence of zzso and report the characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso termed zzso from human zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript is rapidly induced when zzso cells are treated with zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso While zzso is due, at least in part, to the stabilization of the zzso transcript, nuclear zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso Although the zzso transcript is very abundant in zzso cells, transcripts related to human zzso are also detected at lower levels in vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso zzso and cells of zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso contains seven zzso zzso with significant structural similarities to zzso receptors zzso Although the identity of the zzso for zzso is presently unknown, the structure of zzso zzso strongly implies that the zzso translation product is an zzso zzso cell zzso Since zzso are involved in diverse biological processes such as signal zzso cell zzso and zzso the characterization of human zzso as a highly zzso and abundant zzso cell zzso suggest that it may be involved in the processes that regulate the differentiation of zzso zzso
