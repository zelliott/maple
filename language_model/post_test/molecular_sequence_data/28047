We isolated a zzso strain of zzso zzso coli by zzso zzso which produces an zzso altered B zzso of zzso zzso This zzso B zzso was detected as a zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso even without prior heating, suggesting a problem in zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso B zzso could not form zzso with the native A zzso and the affinity to zzso zzso was zzso lower than that of the native B zzso The zzso acid sequence analysis of this zzso B zzso revealed only one zzso acid substitution compared with the native B zzso at the 64th position from the N zzso zzso instead of zzso These data suggest that the zzso at position 64 from the N zzso is important for the native B zzso to form an zzso structure and express its zzso
