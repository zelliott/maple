zzso a zzso zzso of influenza B virus, belongs to one of seven zzso zzso When the zzso infected zzso cells at the zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso infectious virus was produced at very low levels compared with the yield at the zzso temperature (32 degrees zzso and zzso and zzso activities were zzso However, viral protein synthesis and transport of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the cell surface were not zzso The zzso was found as a zzso within cells even at 32 degrees C, in contrast to zzso virus zzso existing mostly as an zzso but the zzso had zzso zzso like the zzso zzso Its zzso activity was more zzso than that of zzso zzso Despite the low yield, large zzso of progeny virus particles were found to accumulate on the cell surface at the zzso temperature, and these zzso were broken by treatment with bacterial zzso with the zzso appearance of zzso activity, suggesting that zzso prevents the zzso of progeny virus by removal of zzso acid from zzso and cell zzso allowing its release from the zzso Further treatment with zzso resulted in the recovery of zzso When bacterial zzso was added to the culture early in infection, many zzso infectious virus was zzso We also suggest that the removal of zzso acid from zzso by zzso is essential for the subsequent zzso of zzso by cellular zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso segment 6 revealed that zzso zzso five zzso acid changes in the zzso zzso but not in zzso
