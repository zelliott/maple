The zzso of growth factor zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso of many zzso proteins which are thought to play crucial roles in growth factor signaling zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso of a zzso protein is rapidly induced in cells treated with zzso growth zzso To clarify the structure and possible function of the zzso protein zzso zzso for zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso this protein from zzso mouse melanoma cells by zzso zzso zzso and determined its partial zzso acid zzso On the basis of the zzso acid zzso we zzso cloned the zzso for mouse zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso revealed that zzso is a novel zzso protein with a putative zinc finger domain that is structurally zzso in several other zzso This protein also contained a zzso region and a zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was detected in all adult mouse zzso tested and also in zzso To analyze the zzso zzso product, we prepared a zzso zzso against zzso expressed zzso Using this zzso we showed by zzso zzso that zzso is localized to the zzso we also showed that that zzso zzso of zzso is induced in cells treated with zzso growth factor or zzso growth zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a unique and important role in the signaling zzso of growth zzso
