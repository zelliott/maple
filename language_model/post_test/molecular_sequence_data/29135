zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso a multiple sclerosis zzso model, is a central nervous system zzso zzso disease characterized by early peripheral T cell responses to virus zzso which spreads to zzso zzso during chronic zzso We show that zzso T cells isolated from the spinal cords of chronically infected zzso mice zzso and zzso zzso zzso upon in zzso challenge with both zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso tolerance induced by intravenous administration of zzso a fusion of the zzso proteins zzso basic protein zzso and zzso to zzso mice with ongoing zzso attenuated disease progression and resulted in significantly less zzso and decreased inflammatory cell zzso in the zzso Paradoxically, zzso zzso T cell zzso and zzso responses were enhanced in the zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso T cell responses contribute to chronic disease progression in this zzso model of zzso and suggest caution in the use of zzso tolerance for treatment of ongoing zzso zzso
