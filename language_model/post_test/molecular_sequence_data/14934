Type VI zzso system zzso is a highly zzso bacterial protein zzso system and is precisely regulated in zzso zzso In zzso zzso an important fish zzso two complete zzso gene clusters zzso and zzso were zzso In this study, expression of a zzso zzso protein zzso which is one of the hallmarks of zzso was found to be strictly regulated in this zzso We showed that the expression of zzso was growth zzso and the production of zzso reached a maximum in the exponential zzso The expression of zzso was positively and zzso regulated by zzso sensing regulators zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we observed that zzso expression required the alternative zzso factor zzso and the zzso protein zzso which is zzso in zzso gene zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso could positively regulate the expression of other zzso zzso Taken together, we demonstrated that the expression of zzso in zzso zzso was under the regulation of zzso sensing and alternative zzso zzso
