The functions of two previously identified zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso First, a conditional zzso zzso was constructed in which the expression of zzso is under the control of a zzso promoter, the zzso promoter, of zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, the zzso grew slowly and produced highly zzso zzso supporting the idea that zzso is involved in normal zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in zzso was also zzso Next, double zzso of zzso and zzso were constructed, in which zzso was placed under the control of the zzso promoter and zzso was replaced with the zzso gene of zzso zzso These double zzso grew more slowly than the zzso single zzso under zzso zzso The zzso of the double zzso appeared to be more zzso than those of the zzso single zzso It was also found that zzso was functionally implicated in zzso when the expression of zzso was zzso These results indicate the importance of the zzso function in the absence of zzso zzso The roles of zzso and zzso in zzso growth and in zzso were supported by the analysis of the spatial expression patterns of zzso and zzso using zzso of zzso coli as a reporter zzso
