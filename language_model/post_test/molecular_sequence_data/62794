The crystal structures of the group II zzso consisting of the alpha zzso with zzso acid zzso of zzso and/or zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso These zzso have been shown to be active in zzso zzso but inactive in protein zzso The structures were shown to be zzso zzso in an extremely closed form, which was consistent with the crystal structure of native zzso from zzso zzso Comparisons of the present structures with the atomic structures of the zzso complex revealed that the zzso in zzso activity with the zzso zzso acid substitution is caused by the zzso hindrance of the local zzso change in an equatorial zzso We concluded that this zzso zzso with zzso substitution is deprived of the smooth zzso change in the zzso zzso We obtained a new form of crystal with a distinct space group at a lower concentration of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The crystal structure obtained at the lower concentration of zzso zzso tilts outward, and has much looser zzso contacts compared with those in the presence of a higher concentration of zzso zzso Such zzso rotation has never been characterized in group II zzso The crystal structure obtained at the lower concentration of zzso zzso tilts outward, and has much looser zzso contacts compared with those in the presence of a higher concentration of zzso zzso
