zzso DNA technology has been employed to produce a zzso capable of forming pH responsive zzso zzso The design of this zzso is based upon an idealized conceptual model in which zzso zzso and zzso forces are responsible for the association of zzso zzso zzso Reduction in solution pH is responsible for reducing zzso zzso between similarly charged zzso promoting the zzso collapse of zzso zzso A zzso synthetic element zzso has been zzso and inserted into an appropriate expression zzso A clone containing a single copy of the zzso gene zzso zzso was isolated and the corresponding gene product zzso zzso The physical properties of zzso were examined in solution by gel zzso zzso CD, and zzso probe zzso It was determined that zzso zzso in solution with the degree of zzso dependent on pH and zzso zzso An initial objective of this work was to examine domain organization in higher molecular weight species containing ten or more repetitive zzso However, attempts to express multiple repeats of zzso from zzso were zzso
