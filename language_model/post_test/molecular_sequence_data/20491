dead end zzso was identified in zzso as a gene zzso an zzso protein essential for primordial germ cell zzso development and zzso in zzso The adult zzso zzso expression has been restricted to the zzso in zzso or to the zzso in zzso Its protein product is nuclear in chicken germ cells but both zzso and nuclear in mouse cell zzso Here we report the cloning and expression pattern of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison, gene structure, linkage analysis and expression demonstrate that zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso A systematic comparison of zzso proteins from five zzso and zzso representatives led to the identification of five previously unidentified zzso regions besides the zzso recognition zzso The zzso zzso is zzso supplied and zzso zzso with zzso Its adult expression occurs in both sexes and is restricted to germ zzso In the zzso zzso is abundant in zzso and zzso cells but absent in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso persists throughout zzso Furthermore, we developed a dual color fluorescent in zzso zzso procedure allowing for precise comparisons of expression and distribution patterns between two genes in zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso this procedure zzso zzso and zzso in zzso germ cells and zzso Surprisingly, by cell zzso and zzso zzso injection we show that zzso is zzso in cell cultures, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and identifies embryonic and adult germ cells of both zzso
