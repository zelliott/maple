The crystal structure of the zzso of an zzso alcohol zzso from zzso zzso zzso was solved and refined to zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a zzso with 251 zzso acid zzso per zzso and uses zzso as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso into the active zzso The zzso of the zzso can be explained on the basis of the resulting hypothetical zzso zzso In contrast to most other zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso depends strongly on the binding of zzso zzso removal by zzso zzso the zzso zzso In the crystal structure, the zzso site is well zzso The zzso has a perfect zzso coordination sphere and occupies a special position concerning zzso and molecular point zzso meaning that each zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso The zzso zzso is no direct zzso zzso However, it is structurally coupled to the putative zzso hinge of the zzso loop and, via an extended hydrogen bonding network, to some zzso forming the zzso binding zzso zzso the presented structure of zzso provides plausible explanations for the metal dependence of the zzso
