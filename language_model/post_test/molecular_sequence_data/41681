zzso play an important role in zzso transformation and cycling in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduction were demonstrated in the growth media of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso at zzso zzso in the media was oxidized after 48 h zzso zzso was largely inhibited by zzso indicating that bacteria played a dominant zzso To identify zzso zzso bacteria, zzso zzso were used to amplify zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso using DNA extracted from the zzso One zzso zzso sequence zzso tentatively identified as zzso zzso was zzso exhibiting zzso and zzso identity in terms of gene and deduced protein sequence to those from zzso zzso zzso In addition, four bacterial strains with different zzso tolerance were isolated and identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using carbon zzso fatty acid profiles, and/or sequencing zzso zzso zzso These zzso exhibited dual capacity for both zzso reduction and zzso zzso under ambient zzso zzso bacteria with strong zzso zzso ability may have potential to improve zzso of zzso water using zzso zzso and/or other zzso zzso
