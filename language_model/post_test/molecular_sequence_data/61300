zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso functionally zzso to bacterial zzso Here, we report its zzso structure and fine zzso zzso The human zzso gene corresponding to the zzso 1 zzso consists of seven zzso spanning zzso zzso while an alternative additional zzso zzso for zzso 2, is located approximately 9 zzso zzso zzso sequence was not found in the zzso region, common in so-called zzso zzso The last 55 bases of the 3' untranslated region in zzso 7 were unexpectedly zzso among species, presumably because the 3' end of the zzso zzso which is transcribed zzso on the opposite zzso is overlapped at the 3' zzso By radiation hybrid panel zzso zzso was localized between zzso and zzso at zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
