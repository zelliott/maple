Evidence for the in zzso defensive function of zzso zzso zzso zzso comes from observations of enhanced zzso resistance after zzso zzso expression or the manipulation of signal zzso that activate numerous defense responses, including zzso zzso no studies have altered the expression of an zzso zzso gene to examine defensive zzso We isolated two genes with zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso from the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso in zzso zzso function zzso against the native zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we expressed 175 zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso in an zzso orientation in a zzso zzso to reduce zzso expression and expressed the full-length zzso zzso in a sense orientation under control of a zzso promoter to restore zzso activity in a natural zzso from Arizona unable to produce zzso zzso and zzso zzso production in two zzso lines were diminished by zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, and sense expression restored zzso of the activity found in the zzso zzso after zzso attack in the zzso A zzso zzso larvae fed on zzso with low or no zzso activity grew faster, had higher zzso and produced heavier zzso than those that fed on zzso with high zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher preference for zzso with low or no zzso activity than for zzso with high zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso are an effective defense against these native zzso
