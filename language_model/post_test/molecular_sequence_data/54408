zzso labeling of zzso molecules is a valuable tool for studying their structure and zzso Here, we describe a new zzso zzso labeling method, which zzso a zzso chemical reaction to attach a label at a specific internal zzso in an zzso zzso The method is zzso and based on the formation of a zzso zzso where a donor strand is chemically coupled to an zzso strand at a specific position via an activated chemical zzso A zzso bond in the zzso is subsequently zzso under mild conditions leaving a zzso group attached to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso target zzso can then be chemically labeled with an optional group, here demonstrated by zzso of a zzso zzso The method is rapid and allows site specific labeling of both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso with a broad range of functional zzso
