zzso zzso zzso is a special zzso of the zzso minority in zzso The present study was undertaken to detect the association of zzso single zzso zzso zzso in the scavenger zzso class B type 1 zzso gene and several environmental factors with serum zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Han zzso 

A total of zzso subjects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso subjects of Han Chinese were randomly selected from our zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso length zzso combined with gel zzso and then confirmed by direct zzso 

The levels of total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower but zzso was higher in zzso zzso zzso than in Han zzso The zzso of C and T zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in Han zzso zzso The zzso of zzso CT and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in Han zzso zzso The subjects with zzso zzso in both ethnic groups had lower zzso and zzso levels than the subjects with zzso or CT zzso zzso for zzso zzso analyses showed that the subjects with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso had lower zzso and zzso levels in males than the subjects with zzso or CT zzso zzso for zzso and the T zzso carriers had higher zzso zzso and zzso levels in females than the T zzso zzso zzso for zzso The participants with zzso zzso in Han also had a lower tendency of zzso and zzso levels in males than the participants with zzso or CT zzso but the difference did not reach statistically significant zzso and zzso zzso The association of serum zzso and zzso levels and zzso was confirmed by the multiple linear zzso analysis in both ethnic zzso zzso zzso parameters were also correlated with several environmental zzso 

The differences in serum zzso levels between the two ethnic groups might partially attribute to the differences in the zzso zzso zzso and several environmental zzso
