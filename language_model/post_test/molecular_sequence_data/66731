Class zzso zzso zzso zzso are found both in the zzso and in the nucleus where they repress genes involved in several major zzso zzso In response to specific signals, the repressive activity of class zzso zzso is neutralized through their zzso on multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso Here, we demonstrate that class zzso zzso are subjected to zzso nuclear export that relies on their zzso zzso We identify zzso and zzso two members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, as regulators of this zzso We further show that zzso and zzso zzso class zzso zzso on one of their multiple zzso binding sites and alter their zzso zzso and repressive zzso Using zzso as a zzso we extend these findings by demonstrating that zzso zzso of the most zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the zzso of the nearby zzso site, zzso We propose that this zzso zzso zzso by a variety of zzso allows for sophisticated regulation of class zzso zzso zzso
