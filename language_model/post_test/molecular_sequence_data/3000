zzso proteins form a growing zzso of proteins related by zzso motifs to the zzso zzso protein zzso By analyzing a human lung cancer cell line zzso zzso library, we have identified and characterized a new member of the human zzso family that we named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It encodes a zzso present in several normal human zzso of zzso origin, with the highest level of expression in zzso The full-length zzso is zzso zzso in zzso with a coding region predicting a protein of 104 zzso acids that is zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the human zzso and its mouse zzso zzso as zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso site, and several potential protein zzso zzso zzso We have mapped this gene to human zzso zzso within a region where at least 15 other zzso genes are tightly zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing the entire zzso was cloned and zzso The gene is split into four zzso and three zzso spanning a total of zzso zzso of zzso zzso We examined the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso protein in two human lung zzso cell lines and one immortalized monkey cell zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso suggesting an association with the plasma membrane and in the zzso zzso We also provide evidence for zzso expression of zzso in tumors, demonstrating its zzso in zzso breast, and zzso tumors and zzso in zzso zzso and colon tumors, a pattern suggesting distinct regulation with potentially important functions in zzso zzso
