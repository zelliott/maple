zzso charged zzso peptides with zzso activity are produced by animals and humans as components of their innate immunity against bacterial infections and also by many bacteria to inhibit competing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which tolerate high zzso of several zzso zzso were zzso to identify genes responsible for this zzso Several zzso with increased sensitivity were zzso which exhibited an altered structure of zzso zzso major components of the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso acids lacked zzso as a result of which the cells carried an increased negative surface zzso The zzso cells bound fewer zzso but more positively charged zzso They were sensitive to human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II, and to the zzso peptides zzso and zzso The zzso genes shared sequence similarity with the zzso genes involved in the transfer of zzso into zzso acids from other zzso zzso zzso strains bearing additional copies of the zzso zzso produced zzso acids with higher amounts of zzso zzso bound zzso proteins less effectively and were less sensitive to zzso zzso We propose a role of the zzso zzso acids which occur in many zzso bacteria in the protection against human and animal defense zzso
