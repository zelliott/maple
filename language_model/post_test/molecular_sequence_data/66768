The neutral zzso zzso are considered major candidates for zzso the zzso production of zzso and zzso activity has been identified, zzso and cloned from bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso Although the level of identity between these zzso is low, a number of key zzso thought to be involved in metal binding and zzso are zzso This has led to the suggestion of a common zzso zzso and thus, these zzso are considered to form an extended family of zzso Despite considerable research into zzso activity in cell culture and various zzso the zzso until recently, of molecular identification of specific zzso zzso had precluded specific insights into the regulation, zzso and pathological roles of these zzso In this review, we zzso for the first time, current knowledge of the zzso family, focusing on cloned members from bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso We also briefly consider the major future directions for zzso research which promises highly significant and specific insight into zzso zzso
