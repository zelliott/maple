We investigated the abundance and distribution of zzso resistance genes zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso production wastewater zzso treatment zzso Of zzso zzso genes and five mobile zzso nine zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two mobile elements zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were successfully zzso by real-time zzso The relative abundance of zzso genes in the zzso and activated sludge zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso treatment system were up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso orders of magnitude higher than those in sewage and zzso production wastewater treatment systems zzso zzso zzso showing that the discharge of abundant zzso genes from the zzso treatment system is worthy of zzso The three most abundant genes in the zzso treatment system, zzso zzso and zzso exhibited significant positive correlations with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be involved in their zzso This is the first study showing that some measures may be required to control the discharge of zzso resistance genes from treated zzso and activated zzso
