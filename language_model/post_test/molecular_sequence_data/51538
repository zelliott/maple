zzso zzso zzso enhances tumor promotion and zzso conversion in mouse zzso DNA damage may contribute to these zzso zzso zzso with zzso to produce the zzso zzso which in turn causes strand breaks in zzso zzso In this study we investigated whether zzso with or without zzso caused zzso DNA damage in the zzso gene of the zzso reporter zzso zzso replicating in human zzso zzso Exposure of zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso however, addition of zzso zzso zzso did not augment zzso zzso zzso Exposure to zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso was also associated with a zzso increase in zzso frequency, up to zzso zzso above the spontaneous zzso zzso Supplemental zzso was not required for zzso however, it both raised the zzso zzso frequency observed and lowered the threshold concentration of zzso necessary to discern zzso above the spontaneous zzso Neither the zzso radical zzso zzso or zzso the spin trap zzso nor reduced zzso altered zzso zzso however, zzso was suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso of 32 individual zzso zzso characterized by sequencing contained point zzso zzso point zzso occurred at zzso base zzso There were five large deletions and four small zzso Three additional zzso zzso contained four point zzso all occurring at zzso base zzso Two zzso zzso clusters at zzso sites were zzso These data suggest that zzso may interact with zzso bound to zzso base pairs in DNA to produce zzso zzso DNA zzso
