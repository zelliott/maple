zzso were zzso within 29 geographically diverse strains of zzso zzso mainly from human zzso cases and four strains representing zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA fragment, amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was used to probe zzso Southern blots for restriction site variation at zzso zzso Internal zzso zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso amplification product were also used to characterize zzso Copy number and zzso in and around the zzso genes were zzso and strains were grouped into 10 zzso on the basis of zzso restriction site zzso zzso zzso had a zzso gene copy number of two and the majority zzso of strains in the species had common internal zzso gene sequences as indicated by zzso zzso restriction zzso A greater degree of diversity was detected around the zzso zzso in zzso III and zzso II zzso Southern zzso The results showed that analysis of zzso genes provided a novel and fundamental approach to grouping strains and offered a basis for defining a zzso zzso evolutionary line within zzso zzso
