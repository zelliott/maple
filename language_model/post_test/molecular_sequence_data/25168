zzso zzso zzso is known to play an essential role in zzso production of B cells and proliferation and differentiation of zzso Here, we have isolated zzso clones zzso a zzso zzso zzso by expression screening of a library prepared from a zzso zzso dependent early B cell zzso A zzso library was expressed in zzso cells and screened by panning with the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence analysis demonstrates that the zzso is a zzso of 415 zzso acids (Mr zzso including an zzso zzso region (17 zzso zzso a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso a single zzso segment zzso zzso zzso and a zzso tail (54 zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso expressed a 60 zzso protein that bound zzso with a single class of affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso for zzso zzso zzso showed the expression of zzso binding sites with both low zzso zzso 6 zzso and high affinity zzso zzso 30 zzso and acquired responsiveness to zzso for zzso although parental zzso cells did not show any zzso zzso zzso In addition, several zzso clones zzso soluble forms of the zzso zzso were zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that two species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in cell lines that display binding sites for zzso zzso zzso search for the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso reveals that the zzso zzso contains a common motif of a zzso zzso family that is recently zzso
