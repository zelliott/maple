zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso enrichment cultures derived from production waters of a zzso petroleum zzso was investigated in this zzso zzso higher amounts of methane were generated from the enrichment cultures incubated at zzso for zzso with a mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso accounted for about zzso of the total amount of methane zzso zzso was occasionally detected together with methane in the gas phase of the zzso Chemical analysis of the liquid cultures resulted only in low zzso of zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the enrichment revealed the presence of several bacterial zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso division zzso and others without close cultured representatives, and zzso predominantly related to zzso members in the order zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA retrieved from the zzso enrichment cultures also suggested the presence of new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest the presence of poorly characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso enrichment zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso under zzso condition is likely to proceed via zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso linked with zzso zzso
