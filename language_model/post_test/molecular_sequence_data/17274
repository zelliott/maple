zzso zzso zzso methods that rely on dilution to extinction in zzso media were used to obtain bacterial zzso from zzso Lake, zzso zzso zzso sequence determination and zzso reconstruction were used to determine the potential ecological significance of isolated bacteria, both in zzso Lake and zzso Fifty-five zzso Lake zzso yielded 16 different zzso zzso gene zzso Thirty of 55 zzso zzso Lake zzso had zzso zzso gene sequences with zzso or greater similarity to sequences recovered previously from zzso Lake zzso zzso gene clone zzso Furthermore, 36 of 55 zzso zzso Lake zzso were found to be members of widely distributed freshwater zzso These results confirm that zzso is a significant improvement over traditional isolation techniques that tend to enrich for zzso that do not predominate in their environment and rarely correlate with zzso zzso gene clone library zzso Although all zzso were obtained under dark, zzso growth conditions, 2 of the 16 different groups showed evidence of zzso capability as assessed by the presence of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be a significant process in this zzso freshwater zzso
