An zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso under zzso growth, with the highest level of production in a medium containing zzso as a zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso protein was approximately 94 zzso It appeared to exist as a zzso structure with a native molecular mass of about 180 zzso The optimal pH ranged from zzso to zzso with zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The optimal temperature for short-term zzso zzso was 35 degrees C, while zzso analysis revealed that the zzso was zzso at temperatures of 28 degrees C and zzso Using zzso as a zzso the zzso was estimated to have a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of 525 zzso product zzso zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso this zzso resisted zzso zzso by zzso retaining zzso of its activity at 100 zzso zzso The activity of the zzso was highest against zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also served as zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and inhibited by ethanol, zzso and zzso The zzso acid zzso obtained by zzso degradation analysis, suggests that this zzso is related to the zzso zzso zzso
