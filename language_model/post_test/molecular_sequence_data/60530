We report on the properties of a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying a linear zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso variable zzso zzso of the zzso which is defined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated in the zzso V2 and zzso zzso as these zzso were properly zzso retained zzso to zzso zzso zzso and exhibited patterns similar to the parental zzso zzso However, zzso of this zzso in the zzso loop was associated with drastically reduced protein zzso Relative to parental zzso zzso the zzso V2 and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significantly increased binding to zzso zzso in zzso To evaluate zzso mice and guinea pigs were zzso with zzso expression zzso for the zzso zzso For both mice and guinea zzso all four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In mice the zzso and zzso zzso zzso but neither the V2 or zzso zzso zzso nor the parental zzso zzso significant zzso against the zzso zzso whereas in guinea zzso V2 zzso zzso was most effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While original V2 zzso zzso zzso failed to elicit zzso zzso responses in mice, studies with 14 additional V2 zzso zzso revealed several zzso sites at which the zzso was able to induce zzso zzso zzso This indicates that the precise position at which the zzso zzso takes place dictates the ability of the zzso to induce the zzso zzso zzso When tested for virus zzso activity, the guinea pig zzso that contain high zzso of zzso zzso zzso failed to enhance the virus zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso of zzso zzso plays a critical role in inducing zzso zzso zzso The results from this study may have potential implications with respect to modification of the zzso zzso zzso for the purpose of improving zzso zzso zzso
