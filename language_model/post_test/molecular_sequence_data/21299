zzso labeled human zzso virus zzso zzso combined with the use of advanced zzso zzso techniques, allow the direct zzso of dynamic events and individual steps in the viral life zzso zzso proteins zzso with fluorescent proteins zzso have been successfully used for zzso imaging analyses of zzso zzso However, zzso display limitations with respect to their zzso properties, and their maturation zzso Furthermore, several independent zzso zzso have to be cloned and characterized in order to obtain spectral variations suitable for zzso imaging zzso In contrast, the so-called zzso represents a genetically zzso zzso tag which mediates specific zzso zzso to fluorescent zzso molecules in a zzso zzso Fusion of the zzso to the protein of interest allows specific labeling of the fusion protein with a variety of synthetic zzso thereby offering enhanced flexibility for zzso imaging zzso we describe the construction and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso which carries the zzso as an additional domain within the viral structural zzso zzso Introduction of the tag close to the zzso of the zzso domain of zzso did not interfere with particle zzso release or zzso virus zzso The modified zzso were infectious and could be zzso in tissue culture, albeit with reduced replication zzso zzso of the zzso domain within zzso allowed specific zzso of the viral zzso in the context of virus producing cells using a zzso zzso dye as well as the zzso of individual zzso and viral budding sites by zzso optical reconstruction zzso Thus, zzso represents a versatile tool which expands the possibilities for the analysis of zzso interactions using live cell imaging and zzso zzso zzso
