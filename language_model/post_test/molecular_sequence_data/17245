zzso II zzso zzso elicits zzso II type 1 zzso zzso increases in zzso firing within the zzso and zzso that are ultimately responsible for zzso actions such as increased blood pressure and fluid zzso Although there is a growing literature on the zzso mechanisms that mediate the actions of zzso II via zzso in zzso little is known about the mechanisms that diminish or zzso the zzso zzso action of zzso zzso In the present study, we identified zzso migration zzso factor zzso as an zzso inhibitor of the actions of zzso II in zzso The evidence is as zzso First, zzso II, acting via zzso increases the zzso levels of zzso in zzso cultured from rat zzso and zzso Second, zzso of zzso zzso by zzso II prevents further zzso actions of this zzso Third, zzso application of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso action in zzso Finally, zzso application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which harbors the zzso zzso property of the zzso zzso mimics the zzso actions of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, this study is the first to demonstrate the existence of an zzso negative regulator of zzso zzso actions in zzso and indicates that zzso may act as a zzso brake for the zzso effects of zzso II in rat zzso
