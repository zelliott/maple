A model for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was predicted, based on the zzso crystal structure, as part of four intact zzso molecules bound to two adjacent operator zzso The structure of region zzso in zzso was found to be nearly identical to the independently determined crystal structure of the zzso fragment, zzso released later by the zzso Later, two more zzso models of the zzso zzso zzso bound to two adjacent operator sites were constructed by us; in one of these, zzso the zzso and zzso coordinates and hence zzso and zzso interactions are almost the same as in zzso but the structure of the zzso region is partly based on the zzso region of the zzso zzso in zzso in the other, zzso the zzso zzso for region zzso has been zzso from the crystal structure deposited in zzso the operator DNA and zzso coordinates of which are same as those in zzso and zzso but the zzso region is partly based on the zzso zzso structures zzso and zzso zzso interactions at the same operator site are stabilized by exposed zzso side chains in zzso while cooperative interactions are mostly confined to zzso and some adjacent zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso data, existence of a twofold axis relating two zzso within a zzso and zzso of DNA distortion between adjacent operator sites allow us to roughly position the zzso with respect to the zzso for both zzso and zzso The study zzso these models with functional, zzso zzso and zzso data on the zzso in the zzso The zzso mode observed in the crystal structure of zzso may not exist in the intact zzso bound to the operator since it is shown to contradict several published zzso data on the intact zzso
