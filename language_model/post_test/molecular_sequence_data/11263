We have cloned and zzso the zzso corresponding to the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (a and b) of zzso zzso Using these two zzso we have prepared a construct zzso the zzso domain of b and the zzso domain of a in order to produce a zzso zzso which should assemble to give an zzso containing zzso active zzso Both the native and the zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli where they were zzso and zzso active as they were able to rescue a zzso deletion zzso The expressed zzso were of the correct size and the zzso behaved similarly to their native zzso on zzso zzso We have found slight differences in the kinetic properties of the zzso zzso and in the zzso of their activities by several putative cellular zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso a and b zzso followed by zzso showed that the zzso are able to zzso perhaps randomly, to form zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso occur in the plant as revealed by studies on the zzso zzso of zzso roots, stems and zzso
