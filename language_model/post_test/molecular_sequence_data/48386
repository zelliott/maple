zzso dynamics simulations were carried out to study the structure stability of model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso in zzso solution at room zzso The initial zzso models were built by using the parallel zzso zzso zzso structure and then allowed to relax in the zzso Our simulation results indicated that the stable zzso zzso was a random zzso while the zzso structures became more zzso with the increase of the zzso zzso Linear zzso and two-dimensional infrared zzso of the zzso zzso were calculated and analyzed in detail, which revealed the differential secondary structural features characteristic of zzso zzso A quantitative relation was established to make connection between the calculated zzso and experimental ensemble zzso
