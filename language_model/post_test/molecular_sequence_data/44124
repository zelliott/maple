zzso zzso zzso zzso are defective in transport of soluble zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene that encodes a zzso protein of 515 zzso zzso A zzso zzso motif in the zzso half of the zzso shows striking similarity to sequences found in many other zzso zzso Several of these proteins are thought to function in the zzso zzso zzso that change highly zzso zzso zzso in this motif lead to a loss of zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso function is required for the transport of the zzso of the soluble zzso zzso Y, zzso A, and zzso B to the zzso zzso membrane zzso alkaline zzso is transported to the zzso by a parallel zzso zzso that does not require zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulate a zzso zzso population, suggesting that zzso functions in a zzso consumption step in zzso transport of soluble zzso to the zzso Whereas zzso zzso demonstrate no defects in zzso zzso at the plasma zzso the zzso demonstrate defects in transport of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso is found both as a soluble zzso protein and associated with particulate zzso We conclude that zzso functions as a novel regulator of zzso zzso and/or fusion at the zzso
