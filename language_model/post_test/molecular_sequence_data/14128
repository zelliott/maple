The zzso are a family of zzso cell zzso molecules that are regulated both zzso and temporally during zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso cells in both the zzso and zzso zzso during zzso The consequences of zzso the expression of zzso at this stage of development are poorly zzso We report here our studies on the effects of zzso zzso on zzso in the rat whole zzso culture zzso Four zzso single strand zzso zzso zzso complementary to various regions of the mouse zzso zzso zzso were dissolved in saline and injected into the zzso cavities of zzso zzso rat zzso a sense zzso to zzso an zzso random sequence zzso zzso and PBS were used as zzso zzso were cultured for up to 45 zzso zzso zzso and the relative zzso of zzso protein were zzso All six zzso zzso and control zzso induced zzso when amounts ranging from 25 to 50 zzso of zzso were injected per zzso The zzso induced by all the zzso included zzso zzso an enlarged zzso twisted spinal cord, swelling of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso a sequence starting at the tenth base downstream from the translation initiation zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso with a high zzso of zzso neural tube zzso The effects of zzso on the relative abundance of zzso and neural zzso proteins were examined by Western zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the relative abundance of zzso and zzso proteins was not altered up to 24 h after zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso were decreased at 45 h zzso In contrast, the relative abundance of the zzso protein in the zzso zzso was reduced at 1-2 h after injection of AS zzso and returned to control levels by 4 zzso zzso did not induce any change in the relative abundance of zzso or zzso Thus, there was a zzso and temporary zzso of zzso expression in the zzso zzso of zzso exposed to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso appears to lead to the induction of neural tube defects in the zzso The exposure of whole zzso in culture to zzso zzso provides a model system in which the roles of zzso important molecules and their spatial and zzso contributions to zzso can be zzso
