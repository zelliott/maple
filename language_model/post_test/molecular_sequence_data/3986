We have explored the linkage of zzso and zzso zzso binding in the folding of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso by examining the zzso folding and the zzso zzso of the folded state as a function of zzso under equilibrium folding conditions using zzso radical zzso These studies allowed a zzso examination of eight discrete protection sites within zzso that are involved in several zzso structure zzso zzso zzso compete with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso in experiments conducted in 10 versus 200 zzso zzso at a constant 10 zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso reported by zzso revealed that larger than average changes in zzso values were localized to specific sites within the zzso zzso The competitive effects of zzso zzso were less when zzso rather than zzso was the zzso zzso zzso This result indicates the importance of the specific zzso binding sites that are associated with zzso structures to zzso folding and zzso These zzso zzso data provide quantitative and zzso zzso of the zzso stability for zzso that are interpreted with respect to zzso zzso
