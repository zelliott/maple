zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso race 6 zzso is unable to cause bacterial blight disease on rice lines containing the rice resistance gene zzso but is virulent on zzso rice lines, indicating that zzso carries zzso zzso zzso required for recognition by zzso Here we show that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso which reside in a zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso function together to produce activated forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains carrying disruptions in either zzso zzso or zzso are unable to produce zzso and zzso and are virulent on zzso rice zzso zzso and zzso are similar to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso host specificity zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso coli zzso synthesis proteins zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso produced by zzso and zzso are used for both zzso synthesis and zzso of other zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso of zzso coli zzso that is required for zzso zzso blocked zzso or zzso zzso synthesis but did not affect zzso activity, suggesting that zzso activity is related to zzso rather than zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso and zzso production plays a critical role in determining zzso of a zzso and reveal a zzso between symbiotic and zzso zzso
