zzso zzso zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso zzso channels are activated by the direct binding of zzso zzso The zzso zzso regions exhibit high sequence similarity in all zzso and zzso zzso This region contains the zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso region, which connects the zzso to the zzso Recently, the structure of the zzso zzso region was solved and shown to contain zzso interactions between zzso zzso To explore the role of these zzso interactions in intact channels, we studied two salt bridges in the zzso zzso an zzso interaction between zzso of neighboring zzso and an zzso interaction between the zzso and its zzso We show that breaking these salt bridges in both zzso and zzso channels through zzso causes an increase in the zzso of channel zzso The zzso behavior of both zzso and zzso channels is rescued by switching the position of the positive and negative zzso thus restoring the salt zzso These results suggest that the salt bridges seen in the zzso zzso crystal structure are also present in the intact zzso zzso Furthermore, the similar effects of the zzso on zzso and zzso channels suggest that these salt bridge interactions are also present in the intact zzso zzso As zzso the interactions leads to channels with more favorable opening zzso the salt bridges appear to stabilize a closed zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso crystal structure contains the zzso regions in the resting zzso even though the zzso is zzso bound, and channel opening involves a zzso of the zzso and, thus, disruption of the salt zzso zzso that one portion of the zzso zzso the zzso can be in the activated zzso while the other portion, the zzso is not activated has lead us to suggest a novel modular gating scheme for zzso and zzso zzso
