The zzso zzso channels are candidates for the zzso zzso entry zzso activated in response to depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that these proteins contain eight zzso regions zzso that could potentially form zzso zzso zzso Based on limited sequence similarities to other zzso channels, it has been proposed that only six of the eight zzso actually span the membrane and that the last two zzso segments zzso 6 and 8) border the zzso pore of which zzso 7 forms a zzso Here we study the zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso to test this zzso We have employed a zzso zzso approach combined with insertions of zzso sites into full-length zzso In our zzso zzso portions of the zzso sequence containing one or more zzso were fused between the enhanced green fluorescent protein and a zzso zzso zzso These zzso were zzso expressed in the human embryonic cell line zzso zzso of the tag was used to monitor its location relative to the zzso of the zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso 1, 4, and 6 cross the membrane from zzso to the zzso zzso that zzso 2, 5, and 8 have the opposite orientation, and that zzso 3 is left out of the membrane on the zzso zzso Our results also show that the sequence downstream of zzso 8 plays an important role in zzso its zzso end on the zzso side of the zzso This effect appears to prevent zzso 7 from spanning the zzso and to result in its forming a zzso structure of the type previously envisioned for the zzso zzso We speculate that a similar mechanism may be responsible for the formation of other zzso channel zzso
