zzso zzso a zzso marine zzso is an important pathogen causing food-borne zzso or zzso Recent zzso sequencing of the zzso strain (a zzso zzso clinical isolate of zzso zzso revealed that the strain has two sets of gene clusters that zzso the type III zzso system zzso zzso The first zzso zzso is located on the large zzso and the second, zzso is on the small zzso Previously, we reported that zzso is involved in the zzso of the zzso strain against zzso zzso Here, we analyzed proteins zzso via the zzso apparatus zzso by zzso by using two-dimensional gel zzso and identified the proteins zzso by genes zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the roles of those zzso zzso we constructed and analyzed a series of deletion zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso cell sorting with zzso zzso zzso V demonstrated that the zzso cell death was by zzso The zzso to zzso cells was related to one of the newly identified zzso proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso fusion protein studies proved that the newly identified zzso proteins were zzso into zzso zzso Thus, these appear to be the zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso
