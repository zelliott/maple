zzso zzso by zzso zzso is zzso by three transport systems, the general zzso acid transport system zzso zzso by zzso and two zzso systems zzso and zzso which also transport zzso and zzso A new zzso defective in both zzso transport activities was isolated by employing a zzso zzso strain and selecting for zzso zzso which also showed greatly reduced ability to zzso zzso as sole nitrogen source and very low levels of zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing a DNA zzso which zzso the zzso transport zzso was isolated by selecting for zzso that grew normally on minimal medium containing zzso as nitrogen source and subsequently zzso zzso zzso Transformation of one such zzso zzso restored sensitivity to zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso encodes a large protein that lacks characteristics of a zzso or zzso zzso lacks zzso zzso necessary for membrane zzso Instead, zzso is a very basic protein zzso of zzso that contains a putative zzso signal sequence for targeting to the nucleus, suggesting that it might be a zzso zzso A database search revealed that zzso encodes a zzso that is identical to zzso except for an zzso zzso The original identification of zzso was based on the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso that suppresses the zzso growth zzso of an zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso has been previously shown to be localized in the zzso When a zzso zzso was crossed with a zzso deletion zzso no zzso was observed, indicating that the two zzso are functionally zzso
