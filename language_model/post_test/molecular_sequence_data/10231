DNA zzso delta zzso zzso plays an essential role in DNA zzso repair, and zzso We have zzso pol delta from zzso zzso more than zzso and demonstrated that the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso pol delta is completely dependent on zzso cell nuclear zzso and replication factor zzso zzso analysis of the zzso fraction indicated that the pol delta complex consists of five zzso that migrate with apparent molecular masses of zzso 55, 54, 42, and 22 zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that the zzso 55, and 54 zzso proteins are the large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The identity of the other two zzso zzso and zzso was determined following zzso zzso and sequence analysis of the resulting zzso The zzso sequences derived from the zzso zzso indicated that this zzso is identical to zzso previously identified as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso sequences derived from the zzso zzso were identical to a previously zzso zzso located on zzso zzso zzso zzso
