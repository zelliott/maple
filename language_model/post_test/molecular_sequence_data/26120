The zzso of a zzso zzso element zzso zzso is zzso in trans by the zzso element zzso or its derivatives in zzso zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso restores the activity of the zzso zzso gene that is otherwise shut off by the presence of zzso delta in its leader zzso A transient expression zzso zzso zzso is used to detect the zzso activity at the zzso to detect the zzso activity at the zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso is a measure of the zzso zzso With zzso delta alone a zzso background of zzso activity is zzso which is zzso enhanced by the presence, in zzso of either the zzso zzso or the coding region zzso transcribed from the 2' promoter of zzso zzso zzso A strong enhancement is observed when a truncated zzso coding region, also under the control of the 2' promoter, is supplied in zzso The truncated version has zzso at zzso 103 in frame with zzso and is preceded by 7 zzso zzso The zzso is quick and well suited for detection of zzso zzso above the value obtained with the zzso zzso The presence of empty donor sites following zzso can be demonstrated by zzso amplification and direct sequencing of the appropriate DNA zzso
