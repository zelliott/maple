zzso is an zzso protein known to regulate a variety of cellular processes by interacting with small zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso is an important opportunistic pathogen affecting primarily hospitalized and zzso zzso We constructed an zzso deletion zzso zzso of zzso zzso and compared the behaviors of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells in a variety of zzso This revealed that zzso zzso zzso plays a role in zzso formation and cell zzso as well as zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is crucial for zzso to zzso zzso cells and is required for the replication of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequencing analysis zzso of zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains showed that zzso regulates the expression of genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in different zzso zzso Moreover, we analyzed the expression of several zzso identified by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells grown in different conditions on Northern zzso The zzso of two zzso was strongly reduced in the absence of zzso Furthermore, based on our zzso analysis we provide a zzso map of zzso start sites in zzso zzso
