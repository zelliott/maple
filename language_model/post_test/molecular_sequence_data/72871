To study the interaction of T cell zzso with its zzso a complex of a major zzso complex zzso and a zzso we derived zzso zzso T zzso clones from mice zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso in place of zzso This zzso and zzso were essential parts of the zzso recognized by these zzso Most of the clones expressed zzso zzso beta chains along with specific complementary determining region zzso zzso regions but diverse alpha chain zzso Surprisingly, all T cell receptors were zzso zzso labeled on the alpha zzso For a representative T cell zzso the zzso labeled site was located in the zzso zzso Computer modeling suggested the presence of a zzso pocket, which is formed by parts of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and adjacent zzso zzso and structured to be able to avidly bind the zzso zzso side zzso We previously found that a T cell zzso specific for a zzso zzso zzso containing this zzso side chain in position 259 similarly used a zzso pocket located between the zzso zzso zzso We propose that this zzso domain in these locations allow T cell receptors to avidly and specifically bind zzso containing zzso side zzso
