An zzso zzso zzso zzso from cultures of a zzso zzso species zzso zzso belongs to the zzso K family of the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso but under mild heat treatment (30 zzso at 40 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of the zzso to give a zzso with a molecular mass of about 36 zzso that apparently shares most of the zzso characteristics and the stability of the zzso zzso In this study, selected zzso properties of the zzso zzso were compared with those of the related zzso zzso K and zzso I, as representative zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiency zzso for the zzso activity of the zzso zzso against zzso was significantly higher than that of its zzso and zzso counterparts, especially when compared with zzso zzso The stability of the zzso zzso both towards heat and zzso was found to be significantly lower than of either zzso K or zzso zzso One or more zzso bonds in the zzso zzso are important for the integrity of the active zzso structure, as zzso zzso either by reduction with zzso or by zzso led to a loss in its zzso Under the same conditions, zzso I was also partially zzso by zzso but the activity of zzso K was zzso The zzso of either zzso K or zzso I were not zzso towards zzso except under zzso conditions, while all zzso of the zzso zzso reacted in absence of a zzso The zzso of the zzso of the proteins as a function of zzso concentration followed the order: zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso zzso zzso The same order of zzso was also observed for the zzso of the zzso by zzso as a function of zzso The order of zzso observed in these reactions most likely reflects the accessibility of the zzso zzso or zzso side chains present in the three related zzso and hence a difference in the zzso of their protein zzso
