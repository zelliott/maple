We have isolated the human zzso zzso of a mouse helper zzso zzso zzso called zzso from an activated human zzso zzso zzso The human zzso encodes a zzso mainly zzso protein with a relative molecular mass of approximately zzso We show that the human and mouse proteins cause extensive zzso changes to human zzso with an associated zzso of major zzso complex class II zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso E zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, they stimulate proliferation of human B cells that have been activated by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso presented by a mouse zzso cell line zzso with zzso Furthermore, the human protein induced considerable levels of zzso and zzso but no zzso production, in cultures in which highly zzso human surface zzso or total B cells were zzso with an activated zzso zzso zzso Based on these findings, we propose that this zzso protein be designated zzso zzso
