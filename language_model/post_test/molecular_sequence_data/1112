A comparative study of the zzso cultural, zzso and zzso properties of the zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the known zzso zzso producer zzso coli zzso showed that these strains belong to the species zzso zzso The strains produced zzso with molecular masses lower than 10 zzso zzso zzso was zzso by a zzso of nutrients in the zzso zzso zzso were found to be resistant to zzso but were zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This indicated that zzso are peptides or contain peptides in their zzso The study of cross immunity to zzso and the sequence of their genetic zzso showed that the zzso of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso are of B type, whereas the zzso of strain zzso zzso presumably belongs to another type, since it suppresses the growth of the producers of zzso and zzso zzso The new zzso producers possess zzso activity against natural zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso against a wide range of zzso zzso zzso and against the collection zzso zzso
