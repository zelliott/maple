zzso zzso consist of distinct zzso and zzso zzso zzso The presence of a zzso improves the binding and activity of zzso on zzso zzso but has no influence on their activities on soluble zzso zzso and zzso studies of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso I have revealed a wedge shaped structure with a flat cellulose binding surface containing three essential zzso zzso The face of the wedge is strictly zzso in all zzso zzso while many differences occur on the other face of the zzso Here we have studied the importance of these differences on the function of the zzso zzso zzso by replacing its zzso by a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Our data shows that, apart from slightly improved affinity of the hybrid zzso the domain exchange does not significantly influence the function of zzso
