Although stretches of zzso and zzso are sometimes sites for zzso zzso attachment, specific sequence and structural zzso for zzso attachment remain ill zzso The zzso envelope protein of zzso contains a zzso stretch of zzso acids at positions 128 to zzso Here we show that zzso protein from zzso seed zzso which binds to zzso and zzso core 1 zzso zzso zzso inhibited the replication of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso population resulted in virus with specific zzso within zzso acids 128 to zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso region had zzso equivalent to, or within 1 log unit of, that of zzso and were resistant to the zzso effects of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of core 1 and core 2 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso Unlike that of zzso the replication of zzso strain zzso was resistant to zzso by zzso zzso zzso from four zzso and zzso strains bound zzso strongly in an zzso zzso zzso while nine different zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not bind zzso The ability or inability to bind zzso thus correlated with the presence of the zzso stretch in the zzso and zzso zzso and the absence of such stretches in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with sequence predictions, two zzso zzso bound zzso while one did zzso These data demonstrate the presence of zzso and zzso core 1 zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso and zzso and the lack of these modifications on zzso and zzso zzso
