The aim of the investigation was to use in zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso resistance in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to identify the genes involved to enable investigation of potential mechanisms for the generation of zzso zzso 

The genes affected by the zzso zzso were identified by zzso rescue and zzso zzso levels of the relevant genes were determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso was isolated and the zzso zzso site was identified in an zzso region between the zzso and zzso genes of the gene cluster involved in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso resistance was observed during growth in defined medium containing either zzso or zzso The zzso zzso showed improved growth in the presence of zzso as compared with the zzso zzso There was increased zzso of all genes of the zzso gene cluster in the presence of zzso and zzso likely due to the zzso providing an additional promoter for the zzso zzso zzso the positive zzso regulator of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso was recreated by zzso the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains displayed a zzso of higher zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso activity in comparison with the parent strain during growth in zzso 

These data indicate that zzso of the zzso gene generates zzso resistance in zzso zzso
