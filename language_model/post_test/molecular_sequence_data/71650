In a previous study, we reported the expression of A3 zzso zzso zzso in rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and demonstrated that its levels affect the zzso concentration of zzso In the current study, we isolated the mouse A3 zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized its structure, and defined its promoter activity in zzso The mouse zzso gene zzso available to us has 3 zzso of coding zzso composed of two zzso separated by a single zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The promoter region lacks zzso and zzso boxes, but contains an zzso consensus zzso In accordance with Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso transient zzso experiments showed that the promoter activity of this zzso was significant in zzso and zzso and high in mast zzso The characterization of the mouse A3 zzso zzso gene and insight into its promoter region will allow further studies to determine the zzso importance of its zzso regulation in different zzso
