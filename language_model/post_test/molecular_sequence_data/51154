In zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two or more highly zzso genes that differ in their abilities to transport zzso One zzso class zzso I) is consistently associated with the zzso resistance zzso while the other zzso zzso is zzso This study was designed to zzso the zzso genes in fish and determine how they are related to the two functional classes already defined in zzso Southern zzso analysis using a zzso single zzso from the 3' terminal region of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a probe indicated that there were two zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso two sets of clones were isolated from a winter zzso zzso library that zzso to the 3' ends of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was done on two key zzso the 3' zzso binding site and the 3' terminal zzso both of which were found to be zzso with their zzso zzso Despite high levels of sequence identity in the predicted coding regions of the gene fragments it has not been possible to use these sequences to relate the zzso to particular zzso classes of zzso zzso perhaps because of gene conversion between zzso zzso zzso These cloned sequences are the first set of zzso genes reported in lower zzso and will be useful for zzso the expression of zzso genes in fish and understanding the role of zzso in fish zzso
