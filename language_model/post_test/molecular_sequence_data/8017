Blood zzso factors V and VIII are zzso proteins that have the domain organization zzso Upon zzso zzso the zzso of both molecules are zzso Previous studies on factor VIII showed that the zzso was not required for zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, deletion of the factor V zzso zzso zzso to zzso yielded a zzso with zzso reduced zzso activity that was not zzso by zzso However, this factor V zzso deletion zzso was activated by factor zzso although the zzso was zzso that of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso of factor V occurs initially after zzso zzso and subsequently after zzso zzso and zzso The requirement for zzso zzso within the zzso at zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso of zzso to zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso zzso and appearance of zzso zzso activity was delayed and was consistent with delayed zzso of the light chain at zzso zzso In contrast, the rate of factor zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was not zzso This finding suggests that zzso zzso at zzso zzso subsequent zzso zzso at zzso Further zzso was used to study the requirement for sequences within the factor V zzso for zzso zzso at zzso zzso Whereas the factor V deletion zzso removing zzso zzso to zzso was not zzso by zzso a smaller zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso to zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso to zzso was effectively zzso by zzso These results show that zzso zzso to zzso which contain an zzso zzso zzso region, were required for zzso zzso of the light zzso Introduction of an zzso zzso zzso region from factor VIII zzso 337 to zzso into the factor V zzso to zzso deletion also restored zzso zzso of the light zzso In contrast, similar replacement with the zzso region from the factor VIII light chain zzso zzso to zzso was significantly less effective in promoting zzso zzso of the light zzso This finding suggests that the different zzso regions in factors V and VIII are not functionally equivalent in their interaction with zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
