The zzso zzso has two zzso distinct structures during zzso Early zzso generates a simple, zzso zzso in the zzso whereas after zzso hormone zzso metamorphosis a newly remodeled adult zzso is formed similar to that of higher zzso This change requires a drastic transformation of the zzso layer We have isolated a zzso 3- zzso gene that may contribute to this zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this gene shows a high degree of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 3- zzso which have little or no expression in zzso other than the zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed and regulated by zzso in the zzso with little expression and/or regulation by zzso in most other zzso Its zzso is restricted to the differentiated zzso cells both in zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, its expression is low in zzso zzso but zzso when metamorphosis is initiated by zzso zzso As the zzso zzso zzso programmed cell death zzso the zzso level drops to a zzso zzso the gene is zzso at the tip region of the newly formed adult zzso folds and a zzso polarity of expression is established by the end of zzso This zzso regulation profile is also reproduced when zzso zzso are treated with zzso to induce precocious zzso zzso These results suggest a possible role of the zzso 4 3- zzso during metamorphosis and demonstrate that the adult zzso cell differentiation pattern is established in the direction of zzso of the zzso fold, concurrent with the zzso zzso zzso
