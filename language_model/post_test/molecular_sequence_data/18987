Morning glories are an emerging model system, and resolving zzso relationships is critical for understanding their zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the largest morning glory zzso zzso is not zzso and nine other zzso are derived from within zzso zzso systematic research is focused on the zzso tribe zzso zzso zzso zzso We used whole zzso to zzso relationships across zzso 

Whole zzso were zzso for 29 morning glory species, representing major zzso zzso were estimated using alignments of 82 zzso genes and whole zzso zzso times were estimated using three fossil zzso zzso Finally, evolution of root architecture, flower color, and zzso zzso presence was zzso 

zzso estimated from both data sets had nearly identical zzso zzso results are generally consistent with prior zzso zzso zzso relationships with weak support in previous studies were recovered here with strong zzso zzso dating analysis suggests a late zzso divergence time for the zzso The two zzso within the tribe, zzso and zzso diversified at similar zzso zzso most recent common zzso of the zzso had blue flowers, an association with zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso results provide confidence in relationships among zzso zzso zzso time zzso results provide a zzso context for diversification of morning zzso zzso character reconstructions support previous findings that morning glory zzso is zzso zzso Taken together, our study provides strong resolution of the morning glory zzso which is broadly zzso to the evolution and ecology of these fascinating zzso
