zzso and timely folding is critical to the function of all zzso The importance of this is illustrated in the zzso of the zzso zzso space zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the small Tim proteins is regulated by dedicated systems or zzso beginning with synthesis in the zzso and ending with assembly of individually folded proteins into functional complexes in the zzso zzso The process is mostly centered on regulating the zzso states of the zzso zzso zzso zzso folding is crucial for protein function in the zzso but oxidized zzso zzso proteins cannot be imported into zzso How the zzso small Tim precursor proteins are maintained in a reduced, zzso form in the zzso is not well zzso Recent studies suggest that zinc and the zzso zzso system play a role in the zzso of these zzso In the zzso the zzso import and assembly zzso zzso zzso both import into the IMS and zzso folding of the small Tim zzso Finally, assembly of the small Tim complexes is a zzso process driven by zzso and zzso zzso however, the zzso function of the complex might require zzso of these interactions to accommodate the zzso Here, we review how folding of the small Tim proteins is regulated during their zzso from maintenance of the unfolded precursors in the zzso to their import, zzso zzso complex assembly and function in the zzso
