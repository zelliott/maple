zzso zzso zzso one of the major families of zzso regulators in zzso have two types of zzso motifs zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso Although zzso are crucial for activity of zzso zzso their mode of action was zzso By solving the structure of the human zzso zzso bound to zzso we discovered a very unusual and zzso zzso mode that is centered on one zzso and does not involve the zzso surface, which typically mediates zzso binding by zzso zzso this mode of binding is zzso in all zzso zzso Furthermore, the isolated zzso is sufficient to regulate zzso of about half of the zzso target genes tested, and the bound zzso is a pivotal element for this zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso proteins with a zzso frequently regulate zzso by competing with, rather than recruiting, zzso zzso using solely this unusual zzso
