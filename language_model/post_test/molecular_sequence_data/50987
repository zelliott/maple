zzso T zzso zzso expression directed to zzso zzso cells resulted in the generation of three transgenic mouse lines that displayed zzso a neurological zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso of symptoms and zzso pathology, characterized by specific zzso cell zzso appeared to be directly dependent upon zzso copy zzso The zzso line zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso exhibited embryonic zzso expression that caused selective death of immature zzso cells and a subsequent block in zzso development and zzso at 2 zzso The zzso effect of the disruption of zzso cells in zzso mice suggests that a normal complement of these cells is required for early development of the zzso cortex, especially zzso cell proliferation and migration from external to internal zzso zzso expression in a second line, zzso (10 zzso was zzso during the second zzso zzso Death of mature zzso cells in the zzso line resulted in onset of zzso at 9 zzso zzso in a third line, zzso (2 zzso was detected after 15 zzso The distinct zzso zzso of the zzso lines correlate with specific zzso zzso cell zzso as opposed to zzso
