zzso is a regulatory zzso like zzso that can alter the activity, location or structure of a zzso zzso signals are likely to be recognized by zzso proteins that transmit the regulatory information zzso by zzso To identify zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso that lacks the primary site of zzso chain formation as bait in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso a protein required in the zzso zzso pathway, zzso specifically with zzso The region required for zzso binding mapped to the zzso zzso domain, a sequence previously identified by database searches as similar to parts of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso bind directly to zzso and we have defined crucial interaction surfaces on both binding zzso The zzso zzso domain is required to promote zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso motif is an zzso zzso zzso domain that mediates zzso zzso
