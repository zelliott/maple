Current zzso methods for detecting zzso in dairy cows have limitations with their specificity and sensitivity, particularly at an early stage of zzso There is therefore a need to explore new approaches for detecting early and zzso zzso This study examined the expression of a group of zzso zzso the zzso in milk samples from naturally occurring as well as zzso induced zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso proteins are only observed in infected quarters and demonstrate a high correlation with zzso cell count zzso during the onset of zzso In most of the infections zzso zzso was detected prior to the observation of clinical symptoms and at SCC counts as low as zzso zzso zzso In naturally occurring zzso the correlation between zzso and infection status is not as strong, with zzso of zzso milk samples containing no zzso zzso This may reflect the varying levels of zzso concentration and activity at different stages or zzso of zzso Our results indicate that milk zzso levels increase following zzso infection and zzso zzso may assist in the detection of zzso zzso or determining the stage of zzso
