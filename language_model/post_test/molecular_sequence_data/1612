The zzso gene has been identified by using a genetic zzso approach as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso zzso respiratory system in zzso zzso The negative effect was due to a previously unidentified small zzso zzso zzso of zzso origin that we called zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to an zzso decrease of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is positively zzso in the presence of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso involving the zzso sensor and the zzso response zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso acts downstream of zzso and needs the presence of zzso In zzso experiments showed that it is neither a zzso zzso nor a zzso zzso inhibitor and that it binds to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso did not impede zzso DNA zzso and we propose that it may prevent zzso zzso recruitment to the zzso zzso This study thus reveals a previously zzso class of response regulator zzso
