The zzso gene of zzso zzso has been cloned and the complete zzso sequence zzso It codes for a protein of zzso zzso zzso which functions as a zzso through which proteins cross the inner zzso It can substitute for the zzso coli zzso protein and can suppress the zzso traits associated with zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene has about 71 and zzso similarity at the zzso and zzso levels respectively with the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly to the zzso coli zzso is flanked by the genes zzso the zzso large zzso proteins zzso and zzso When expressed from the zzso promoter, zzso zzso zzso partially zzso zzso coli zzso zzso even in absence of zzso while the zzso coli zzso gene zzso only when zzso is zzso zzso of multiple zzso sequences and a putative downstream zzso box imply that the zzso zzso zzso gene might have high zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso unable to zzso zzso through the inner membrane has been zzso The zzso deficient zzso of the zzso can be reversed by introducing the cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso
