The rate of zzso zzso across tight zzso such as in zzso kidney zzso and colon is to a large extent controlled at the level of the zzso zzso channel zzso In zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso stimulates the zzso of this channel by a zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a clear zzso of zzso function by zzso could not be reproduced with cloned channel zzso in the zzso zzso expression system, suggesting the hypothesis that an additional factor is zzso In contrast, we show here that zzso zzso can activate zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso upon replacement of the rat zzso by a new zzso cloned from guinea-pig colon zzso This zzso is zzso identical with its rat zzso originating from zzso rat zzso The zzso fingerprints of the hybrid zzso formed by this guinea-pig zzso together with rat zzso and zzso are indistinguishable from those of rat zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso into the zzso had no effect on the zzso activity of rat zzso but inhibited the activity of zzso hybrid zzso and greatly decreased its stimulation by zzso This suggests that, unlike for rat zzso zzso zzso activity is required for zzso function of zzso zzso and that zzso mediates its zzso zzso This regulatory zzso is not common to all zzso containing an zzso cloned from an zzso tissue since zzso which was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso A6 zzso is, when expressed in zzso resistant to zzso similar to rat zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso sensitivity of zzso can depend on the nature of the zzso zzso and raises the possibility that zzso can stimulate zzso by different zzso
