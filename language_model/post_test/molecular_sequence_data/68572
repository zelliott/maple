The present study describes a method for amplifying DNA in zzso zzso by using short, synthetic zzso of random sequence as zzso in the zzso chain zzso zzso DNA from each of 20 human zzso of zzso zzso was successfully amplified in a zzso zzso with a single synthetic primer zzso and zzso produced 14 different DNA amplification profiles zzso zzso zzso zzso from the same subject revealed the same zzso The arbitrarily primed zzso chain reaction appears to be useful in characterizing human zzso of zzso zzso for studies of epidemiology and bacterial zzso
