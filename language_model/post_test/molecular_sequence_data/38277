zzso of the zzso B zzso zzso in the liver is regulated by hormones such as insulin and zzso To characterize the elements that are responsive to these hormones in the upstream region of zzso plasmids carrying various length of the upstream region of this gene were constructed and zzso to primary cultured rat zzso The promoter activities were gradually increased by progressive deletion of the zzso region, and high activities were observed for zzso carrying the sequence between zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso in the upstream region of zzso zzso The zzso activities of the zzso containing the sequences between zzso and zzso zzso were enhanced by insulin, and zzso suppressed the zzso activities of those containing the sequence between zzso and zzso zzso Two sequence elements similar to the zzso element zzso one from zzso to zzso zzso and another from zzso to zzso zzso were found in the upstream sequence of the zzso The latter element is not functional because its deletion did not affect either the zzso efficiency or zzso zzso However, the deletion of the former element diminished both zzso A gel zzso zzso showed that the nuclear factor binds to the former element, which was competitive with authentic zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso element in the promoter region is prerequisite for both fundamental zzso efficiency of the gene and suppression by zzso in zzso
