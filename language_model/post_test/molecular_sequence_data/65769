Although zzso zzso zzso responds well to zzso therapy, zzso during maintenance zzso therapy or after the withdrawal of zzso treatment is not zzso To date, the factors related to zzso of zzso have not been fully zzso 

To determine the clinical and genetic zzso relating to the zzso of zzso we evaluated clinical factors, zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequences in 40 patients with zzso 

At a median follow-up period of 40 months zzso zzso zzso zzso developed in 13 of 40 patients with zzso zzso in whom complete zzso was achieved with oral zzso zzso Among zzso clinical characteristics in the initial diagnosis of zzso we could not find any clinical predictor for zzso of zzso however, in zzso acid sequence analysis for zzso of zzso the substitution of zzso acid to zzso acid at zzso 57 of zzso showed a significant association with zzso of zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group, zzso P zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso There was a significant difference in the timing of zzso of zzso according to density of the zzso acid zzso at zzso 57 zzso acid zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso mean zzso zzso 33 zzso 11 zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso acid to zzso acid at zzso 57 appears to represent a key genetic factor for zzso of zzso zzso number, zzso
