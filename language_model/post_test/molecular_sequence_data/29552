We have cloned a zzso zzso a novel protein referred to as zzso from mouse C2 skeletal muscle zzso This protein contained six zzso zzso acid stretches corresponding to zzso zzso two zzso zzso and a sequence zzso to the fusion peptides of certain fusion zzso zzso also contained a novel modular zzso designated as HELP domain, which was highly zzso among zzso from zzso to higher plants and zzso All these HELP zzso zzso including mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso possessed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in brain and zzso and induced during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells but zzso during zzso differentiation of C2 zzso The zzso was accumulated in zzso and zzso of brain and central areas of zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments located zzso and zzso to a network structure throughout the zzso zzso with the fluorescent dye zzso identified this structure as the zzso zzso These results suggest that at least some, if not all, of the HELP zzso proteins are zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins with functions zzso among zzso
