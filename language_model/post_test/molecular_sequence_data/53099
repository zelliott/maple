A novel zzso zzso zzso 6 was zzso from culture zzso of zzso tuberculosis by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein focused at zzso of zzso during zzso zzso zzso weight of the zzso protein by zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso 6 could be aligned to the deduced zzso acid sequence from zzso zzso and was found to be a novel protein with 112 zzso zzso Single zzso sequence showed that the zzso protein was essentially free from zzso and the zzso acid analysis of the zzso was in good agreement with the DNA sequence deduced zzso acid zzso zzso zzso 6 was studied for its ability to induce zzso responses of peripheral blood zzso from five categories of human zzso These were: zzso active pulmonary tuberculosis zzso patients after 2-3 months of zzso vaccinated professional zzso zzso healthy zzso zzso 6 zzso high zzso responses in healthy contacts and patients recovering from the zzso This protein also induced the release of a significantly high amount of zzso in cell culture zzso of healthy contacts as compared to other categories of zzso This protein was further evaluated and compared with zzso and total zzso for its zzso inducing ability in guinea pigs zzso with zzso or zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso 6 zzso a powerful immune response in zzso and in zzso animal model, hence seems to be an zzso important zzso
