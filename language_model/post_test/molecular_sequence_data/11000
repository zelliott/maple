zzso zzso induced by zzso radiation and zzso drugs are thought to arise by incorrect joining of DNA zzso zzso To dissect such zzso events at a molecular level, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene of Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso the zzso were zzso and the original zzso parental sequences involved in each zzso were recovered from zzso zzso Of seven zzso zzso six were zzso exchanges between zzso and unrelated zzso zzso with a mechanism involving joining of exchanged zzso break ends, there was, in most cases, no zzso between the two parental zzso no overlap in sequences retained at the two newly formed zzso and little or no loss of parental sequences (usually zzso zzso at the zzso The zzso were strongly correlated zzso zzso zzso with expected sites of zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso indicated that, in six of the zzso the zzso was accompanied by a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso because upstream and downstream zzso sequences were detected on separate zzso The results suggest that repair of free zzso zzso breaks in zzso cells is zzso by a conservative, zzso zzso zzso that does not involve zzso intermediate and that zzso of exchanged ends by this zzso can directly result in zzso zzso
