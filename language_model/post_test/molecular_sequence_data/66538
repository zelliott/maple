zzso zzso which causes zzso in humans, is composed of genetically divergent viruses classified into 5 zzso In this study, zzso zzso sequences of the 3' zzso of the zzso of 15 zzso strains detected in Japan were zzso The 15 zzso strains could be classified into four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in two of these, zzso and zzso 10 zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequences of the central variable region of the zzso protein showed less than zzso identity when strains belonging to different zzso were zzso It was therefore supposed that zzso variety exists between different zzso These results will be useful for further genetic and zzso analyses of zzso
