zzso receptors in the zzso and zzso zzso of the pancreatic duct can act by a feedback mechanism to coordinate transport activity in the two zzso during zzso zzso The goal of the present work was to identify and zzso the functional zzso receptors zzso in the rat pancreatic zzso The lack of selective zzso and/or zzso for any of the cloned zzso dictated the use of molecular and functional approaches to the characterization of zzso zzso For the molecular studies, zzso was prepared from zzso pancreatic zzso ducts and was shown to be free of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso for zzso and zzso cells, zzso A new procedure is described to obtain an enriched preparation of single duct cells suitable for zzso zzso zzso of zzso was achieved by testing the effect of various zzso zzso on zzso zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested the expression of six zzso of zzso in the pancreatic zzso three zzso and three zzso zzso of zzso current by various zzso and zzso of the receptors activated by these zzso to G proteins confirmed the expression of multiple zzso in duct zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso ducts suggested the expression of zzso zzso probably zzso and as yet unidentified zzso possibly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was found in the zzso zzso The unprecedented expression of such a variety of zzso in one cell type, many capable of zzso zzso channels, suggests that these receptors may have an important role in pancreatic duct cell zzso
