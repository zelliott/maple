zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso plays important roles in the zzso signal zzso In the present study, we isolated and analyzed the zzso sequence and tissue distribution of zzso zzso in Southern zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso contains zzso zzso with an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso distribution analysis of zzso revealed that it was expressed in all zzso zzso with no sexual zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso analysis and multiple zzso acids sequence alignment indicated the close relationship and high similarity of zzso with zzso from zzso zzso In addition, partial sequences of zzso from 7 other zzso species were also zzso zzso of zzso zzso with those from other zzso revealed that an extra zzso tail of about zzso exists in all the zzso from zzso zzso investigated, but not in other zzso The extra sequence was resulted from a zzso zzso before the stop zzso of other zzso zzso and it was identical in zzso from zzso species of the same zzso but different among zzso from species of different zzso We report here for the first time that the zzso from zzso species are longer in zzso than those from other zzso and it might be useful in reconstruction of the zzso relationship among zzso zzso The significance of the extra zzso tail for zzso function remains zzso
