We have previously described the first cloning and partial characterization of zzso zzso from zzso Aedes aegypti zzso zzso mosquitoes zzso an alkaline zzso environment in the zzso of their anterior zzso and we have also demonstrated a critical link between zzso of the gut and zzso zzso In this report we further examine the nature of the previously described zzso zzso and test the hypothesis that its pattern of expression is consistent with a role in gut zzso zzso we take advantage of the recently published zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to assess the complexity of the zzso zzso gene family in these zzso We report here that the previously described zzso zzso from Aedes aegypti is similar to zzso CA IV in that it is a zzso peripheral membrane zzso In zzso zzso analyses identify multiple locations of zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso An zzso prepared against a zzso sequence specific to the Aedes aegypti zzso zzso zzso labels plasma zzso of a number of cell types including zzso cells and zzso A previously zzso subset of gut muscles is specifically identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses using the zzso automatic analysis pipeline show that there are at least 14 zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso including a zzso to the zzso gene product described zzso zzso as in zzso which similarly possess numerous zzso zzso zzso insects require a large family of these genes to handle the complex zzso pathways influenced by zzso zzso and their zzso
