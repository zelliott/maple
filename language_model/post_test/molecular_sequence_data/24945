zzso zzso is a member of a small group of bacteria that display zzso on the cell surface, zzso attached to the sugar groups of zzso acid and zzso zzso The putative zzso for this zzso decoration is, in its first two zzso functionally similar to the zzso zzso used for zzso zzso in zzso We show that the zzso gene encodes a functional zzso zzso zzso The zzso has been expressed and zzso to zzso zzso conditions were zzso particularly with respect to zzso with time, zzso zzso and ammonium zzso zzso The pure zzso has zzso values of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is specific for zzso or zzso as the zzso zzso zzso is strongly inhibited by zzso The zzso values for zzso and native zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is also inhibited by all other tested zzso zzso including zzso at high zzso The cloning and expression of this zzso sets the stage for design of zzso as possible zzso zzso
