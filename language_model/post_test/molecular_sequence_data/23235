The present experiments were designed to study the importance of the zzso of zzso for both function and integrity of assembly with zzso 

For this purpose, stop zzso were created, by zzso chain reaction zzso at different positions in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and the zzso of zzso or with the zzso of the gastric zzso were zzso Human embryonic kidney zzso cells were used as expression systems for functional studies using zzso zzso and zzso assembly using specific zzso 

The results demonstrate that the entire zzso of zzso is required for optimal protection of the zzso complex from degradation and for functionality as evidenced by zzso zzso The results also demonstrate that there was flexibility in the sequence of the zzso The last two zzso zzso of zzso could be zzso to zzso and the zzso of zzso could be replaced by the zzso of zzso while preserving transport zzso 

The entire zzso of zzso is required for stable assembly with zzso and zzso
