A simple and convenient zzso method that zzso the zzso zzso genes has been developed for the purpose of detecting and zzso four species causing malaria in zzso The advantage of the zzso is that the zzso zzso product is zzso following zzso with specific zzso which are immobilized on plate zzso zzso plate zzso This method has been previously evaluated in a field study and was found to be sensitive and specific for the detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the current study, the zzso plate zzso zzso method was evaluated by using blood specimens from malaria zzso All of 36 cases of zzso malaria, 26 of 27 cases of zzso malaria, all of 11 cases of zzso malaria, and 2 cases of zzso malaria were diagnosed species specifically by the zzso zzso There were four zzso zzso cases that seemed to zzso to the zzso stage of zzso In contrast, 30 cases for which the diagnosis of malaria has been excluded on the basis of zzso and clinical courses showed negative zzso zzso By comparing zzso zzso and zzso results following zzso treatment of some patients, it was revealed that the zzso results largely paralleled the zzso zzso and that zzso could detect as few as 10 zzso per zzso of zzso We conclude that this zzso method is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of all four zzso species and can serve as a useful supplement to zzso for the clinical management of zzso
