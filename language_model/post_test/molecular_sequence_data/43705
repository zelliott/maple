The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso green zzso Chlorella zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso contains no large zzso repeat and has one copy of zzso gene cluster consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It contains 31 zzso zzso of which the zzso gene has not been found in land plant zzso zzso analyzed so zzso zzso protein genes and eight zzso zzso with those found in land plant zzso have also been zzso The most striking is the existence of two adjacent genes zzso to bacterial genes involved in cell division, zzso and zzso which are arranged in the same order in zzso zzso This finding suggests that the mechanism of zzso division is similar to bacterial zzso Other than zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso which have not been reported from land plant zzso zzso are present in this zzso However, many of the new zzso genes recently found in red and brown algae have not been found in zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso species possesses two long zzso related to zzso and zzso that are exclusively found in land zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso is closer to land plants than to red and brown zzso
