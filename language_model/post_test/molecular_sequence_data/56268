The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso factor Max zzso with DNA has been determined by X-ray zzso at zzso A zzso Max binds as a zzso to its recognition sequence zzso by direct contacts between the zzso basic region and the major zzso This zzso zzso a new protein fold, is a zzso zzso zzso zzso with each zzso containing two zzso segments separated by a zzso The two zzso segments are composed of the basic region plus zzso 1 and zzso 2 plus the zzso zzso zzso As in zzso the zzso repeat forms a parallel coiled zzso
