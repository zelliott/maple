To compare the zzso zzso of the insulin and zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso have been expressed in zzso coli as fusion zzso The zzso proteins have zzso activity, demonstrating that the zzso domain of IGF-1 zzso like that of insulin zzso is active independent of its zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the two zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso A series of peptides has been prepared that reproduces the major zzso sites of insulin zzso zzso a common zzso for the two zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and IGF-1 receptors show distinct preferences for these zzso whereas insulin zzso prefers peptides based on zzso or zzso of insulin zzso zzso the IGF-1 zzso zzso recognizes the zzso zzso The latter site, when zzso is a binding site for the zzso zzso adapter protein zzso The ability of the two zzso zzso zzso to be zzso and activated by zzso has also been zzso The zzso activity of IGF-1 zzso is zzso approximately zzso by treatment with zzso zzso while insulin zzso shows very little effect of zzso zzso under these zzso This observation is relevant to recent findings of IGF-1 zzso zzso in zzso cells, and may represent one method by which zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso the data suggest that the zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso possess inherently different zzso zzso and signaling zzso
