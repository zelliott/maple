zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso metal zzso In zzso zzso and zzso play a key role in iron nutrition of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso iron zzso In the present paper we describe the molecular and zzso characterization of zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in the dry seed zzso and to a lesser extent in aerial zzso Its promoter activity is found zzso distributed in zzso and zzso as well as in the vascular tissue region of leaf and zzso We show that the zzso transcript coexists with a partially spliced zzso in all shoot cell types zzso When expressed in zzso zzso but not its zzso zzso increased sensitivity to cadmium without affecting cadmium content in the zzso Likewise, zzso transgenic plants zzso zzso were hypersensitive to cadmium, although plant cadmium content remained zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso named zzso was more tolerant to cadmium zzso a zzso that was reverted by expressing zzso in the zzso zzso We used an zzso (where zzso is zzso fusion, shown to be functional in zzso to demonstrate through zzso analysis of membrane zzso and zzso zzso that, in zzso cells, zzso is targeted to a zzso zzso compartment distinct from the zzso or zzso We therefore propose that zzso functions as an zzso metal zzso whose presence, when zzso is likely to affect zzso of cadmium within the zzso
