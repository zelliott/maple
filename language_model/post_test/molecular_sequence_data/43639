The zzso response in the young infant is limited in several zzso in particular, responses generally are of low affinity and restricted to zzso This raises the question whether the affinity maturation process, consisting of zzso zzso of zzso genes coupled with selection of zzso zzso is operative in the zzso zzso zzso genes were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso blood and from peripheral blood of zzso zzso analysis detected zzso in only zzso zzso blood samples, while zzso were seen from about 10 days of age zzso Cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso zzso genes showed that zzso sequences contained relatively few zzso (one to three zzso per zzso compared with published values of about 10 in adult zzso zzso zzso was not evident in the majority of zzso zzso Thus zzso can occur in the human zzso but is minimal and generally not accompanied by zzso The age at which affinity maturation develops effectively is yet to be zzso
