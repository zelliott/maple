zzso transport between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso requires a zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso Whether a functional zzso operates in export from the zzso in zzso cells is unknown, nor is it clear if transport in other branches of the zzso zzso requires zzso of a gene zzso In this study, we used a zzso approach to examine the complexity of zzso sequences expressed in zzso cells that possess multiple zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences from zzso zzso cells with zzso corresponding to two zzso zzso binding zzso of zzso yielded several clones with sequences zzso to zzso and/or the closely related zzso factor zzso zzso Of these, only two showed closer zzso to zzso zzso zzso than members of the zzso family and are designated as zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that zzso is expressed in most zzso including liver, heart, brain, skeletal muscle and zzso In contrast, zzso is zzso expressed in skeletal muscle and zzso The full-length zzso of zzso isolated from a mouse zzso zzso zzso library encodes a protein of 198 zzso zzso and is zzso identical to zzso from zzso zzso Thus in contrast to the large zzso family of zzso zzso zzso transport in zzso cells appears to be zzso by a relatively small number of zzso zzso
