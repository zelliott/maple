zzso are a large group of proteins implicated in migration, zzso and differentiation of zzso They are zzso in zzso but less is known in lower zzso about their zzso expressions and zzso From an evolutionary point of view, comparative analyses may provide some fundamental insights into these zzso In zzso zzso and zzso are crucial for zzso zzso zzso we identified and cloned the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and analyzed their expression in zzso and adult fish by in zzso zzso We found that zzso was expressed in the zzso region, zzso and blood vessels in zzso In adult fish, zzso transcripts were located in the zzso spinal cord, and blood zzso In contrast, expression of zzso was only detected in the zzso zzso in zzso In adult fish, transcripts of zzso were maintained in the zzso and they were also found in the brain and zzso Furthermore, we performed an zzso zzso experiment to evaluate the biological function of zzso zzso showed that the recruitment of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso is essential for colonization of zzso in the zzso in early zzso Together, our results demonstrate the basic profiles of two zzso zzso in zzso The zzso expression patterns may pave the way for further genetic dissection in this model zzso
