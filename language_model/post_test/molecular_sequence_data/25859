zzso regions of zzso repeat units consistent with an zzso coiled zzso zzso are located adjacent to zzso potentially zzso regions in the zzso acid sequences of zzso fusion and zzso envelope zzso Similar arrangements of zzso peptides and zzso repeat units exist in coronavirus zzso proteins and influenza virus zzso This suggests that there may be similarities in the structures of these proteins and in the functions of the zzso zzso regions during virus zzso
