zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Several unique structural features within zzso zzso were investigated for their roles in regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the second zzso domain or the zzso domain or deletion of the entire zzso zzso increased activity in zzso measured as increasing zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso alternate zzso product was identified and zzso This alternate zzso product and a zzso inactive zzso inhibited zzso zzso in zzso indicating that the zzso zzso suppresses activity of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso 508 in the zzso loop to zzso abolished activity whereas replacement with 2 zzso acid zzso resulted in a fully active zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the basic insert in the zzso loop inhibited activity in zzso but not in zzso These results indicate zzso is an essential regulatory feature of zzso zzso and indicate that zzso 508 and the adjacent basic insert sequences of the zzso loop are required for this zzso A combination of structural features are thus involved in receiving upstream signals that regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
