The emergence and spread of zzso zzso zzso malaria zzso has been a disaster for world zzso Resistance is zzso by zzso in the zzso Resistance zzso zzso an integral membrane protein localized to the zzso internal zzso zzso These zzso result in a marked reduction in the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso However, the mechanism by which this occurs is zzso We expressed both zzso and resistant forms of zzso at the surface of zzso zzso zzso The resistant form of zzso transported zzso whereas the zzso protein did zzso zzso transport via the zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso Thus, zzso resistance is due to direct transport of the drug via zzso zzso
