Our attempts to zzso a potent inhibitor of rat zzso have resulted in the discovery of zzso 44 zzso A, a potent inhibitor of plasma zzso from all zzso species tested so far zzso (in zzso dog, zzso zzso zzso guinea zzso zzso zzso zzso cat, zzso and zzso zzso This compound is also a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso (in zzso human, zzso and zzso zzso It is less potent against other zzso zzso zzso (in zzso zzso zzso zzso and bovine zzso D, zzso zzso 44 zzso A exhibited a competitive mode of zzso against human zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso infusion of zzso 44 zzso A in zzso zzso rats zzso zzso blood pressure zzso was lowered by about 25 zzso zzso Plasma zzso activity, zzso I and zzso II were almost completely zzso The converting zzso inhibitor zzso (1 zzso zzso also lowered zzso by about 25 zzso zzso No further fall in zzso occurred when zzso 44 zzso A zzso zzso was infused after zzso with zzso (1 zzso zzso and zzso 44 zzso A did not lower zzso when infused in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso response induced by zzso 44 zzso A in zzso rats is specifically due to the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso 44 zzso may therefore be useful for comparing the effects of zzso zzso in different species and for studying the role of zzso in various models of cardiovascular disease in zzso zzso
