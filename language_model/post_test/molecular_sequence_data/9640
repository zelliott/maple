Nuclear hormone receptors are zzso zzso factors that zzso gene expression in response to small, zzso hormones, such as zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso hormone and zzso acid receptors typically repress zzso in the absence of hormone and activate it in the presence of zzso zzso repression is zzso in part, through the ability of these receptors to physically associate with ancillary zzso called zzso We wished to understand the mechanism by which zzso are recruited to zzso nuclear hormone receptors and are released on the binding of zzso We report here that an zzso domain located at the zzso hormone zzso C zzso appears to undergo a zzso zzso change required for release of zzso and that zzso acid zzso that abrogate this zzso change can impair or prevent zzso zzso In contrast, zzso X receptors appear neither to undergo an equivalent zzso zzso in their C zzso nor to release zzso in response to zzso hormone, consistent with the distinct zzso regulatory properties displayed by this class of zzso
