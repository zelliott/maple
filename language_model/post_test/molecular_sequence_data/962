The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso zzso contains open reading frames zzso that zzso for several genes that are zzso to proteins found in all known zzso These are the zzso gene zzso and the four structural zzso zzso zzso spike zzso membrane zzso and envelope zzso and these proteins are expected to be essential for the replication of the zzso In addition, this zzso also contains nine other potential zzso varying in length from 39 to zzso zzso zzso The largest among these is the first zzso of the second longest zzso zzso and this protein zzso zzso in the present zzso consists of zzso zzso acids and contains three putative zzso zzso Using zzso specific for the C zzso of zzso we show zzso to be expressed in zzso zzso E6 cells and, in addition to the full-length zzso two other processed forms were also zzso By indirect zzso zzso was localized to the zzso region, as well as to the plasma zzso in both zzso and infected zzso Using an N zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and its expression on the cell surface were zzso zzso of a zzso domain of zzso which contains zzso and zzso zzso abolished its transport to the cell zzso In addition, zzso expressed on the cell surface can zzso zzso from the culture medium into the zzso zzso experiments also showed that zzso could interact specifically with the M, zzso and S structural zzso as well as with zzso another protein that is unique to zzso
