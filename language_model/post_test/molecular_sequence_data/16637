zzso belongs to the group of proteins containing a zzso domain that are target peptides zzso for the zzso We previously identified a novel zzso with zzso to human zzso and in this study we cloned and characterized the coding region of this novel zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso a Class I zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso expression of this new zzso designated zzso zzso was shown in the zzso and nucleus of zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso we identified three major zzso zzso which vary in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed exclusive zzso expression in pooled zzso and further zzso indicated sole expression in zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso Gene expression was increased in zzso zzso but negligible in activated zzso zzso In zzso samples expression was absent in zzso zzso low in most zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but very high in zzso zzso zzso As the zzso family is critical in zzso development and function, zzso may play an important role in zzso
