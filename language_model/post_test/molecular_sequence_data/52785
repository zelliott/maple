The construction of zzso clones zzso zzso zzso molecules of biological interest, like coronavirus zzso which are among the largest mature zzso molecules known to biology, has been hampered by the instability of those zzso in zzso zzso we show that the application of two strategies, cloning of the zzso into a bacterial artificial zzso and nuclear expression of zzso that are typically produced within the zzso is useful for the engineering of large zzso zzso A zzso zzso an infectious coronavirus zzso zzso has been cloned as a bacterial artificial zzso The rescued coronavirus zzso all of the genetic markers introduced throughout the sequence and showed a standard zzso pattern and the zzso characteristics expected for the synthetic zzso The zzso was transcribed within the nucleus, and the zzso zzso to the zzso Interestingly, the recovered virus had essentially the same sequence as the original one, and no zzso was zzso The zzso was derived from an attenuated isolate that replicates exclusively in the respiratory tract of zzso During the engineering of the infectious zzso the spike gene of the virus was replaced by the spike gene of an enteric zzso The synthetic virus zzso abundantly in the enteric tract and was fully zzso demonstrating that the zzso and zzso of the recovered coronavirus can be zzso This demonstration opens up the possibility of employing this infectious zzso as a zzso for vaccine development in human, zzso zzso and zzso species susceptible to group 1 zzso
