zzso zzso zzso peptides are zzso These are derivatives of zzso fiber zzso forming peptides that are zzso with small molecules (in our case, zzso or a zzso zzso The zzso peptides are zzso into fibers and used as bait to recruit folded and functional proteins to the fiber zzso This was demonstrated using two molecular recognition models: zzso a zzso interaction zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso This concept offers an approach to mimicking in natural zzso systems, such as collagen or zzso that communicate specifically with their environments via incorporated or decorated active zzso and protein zzso
