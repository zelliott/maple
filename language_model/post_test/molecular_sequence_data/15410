Previous studies indicate that the zzso protein and its zzso play similar roles in nuclear zzso of all zzso However, there is no report on the zzso gene product of zzso In this study, we expressed and presented the basic properties of the zzso zzso zzso 

The entire zzso of the zzso was cloned into zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso coli zzso competent cells were transformed with the construct followed by the induction of protein expression by the addition of zzso Band corresponding to the predicted sizes (55 zzso was produced on the zzso Over expressed zzso fusion protein was zzso by zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso gene product has been identified by using a rabbit zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso A protein of approximate 35 zzso that reacted with the zzso was detected in zzso of zzso cellular zzso suggesting that the 35 zzso protein was the primary translation product of the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso gene was transcribed most abundantly during the late phase of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the protein was widespread speckled structures in the zzso of infected zzso Western zzso of zzso zzso preparations showed that zzso was a component of zzso zzso but was absent from mature zzso zzso Finally, an zzso zzso was established to study the distribution of the zzso zzso in zzso of artificially zzso infected zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso was primarily located in the cells of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In this work, we present the basic properties of the zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso shares many similarities with its zzso or zzso zzso zzso and suggest that functional zzso is possible between members of the zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso experiments with ducks infected with zzso zzso of zzso will also be of importance in order to assess the possible role of the zzso protein in viral zzso These properties of the zzso protein provide a prerequisite for further functional analysis of this zzso
