We report the isolation of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso from highly zzso zzso stem cell zzso One such zzso encodes a novel zzso designated fetal liver zzso 1 zzso which consists of one zzso domain followed by a zzso terminal domain of 160 zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso analysis showed that expression of zzso zzso is restricted to zzso in zzso and zzso mouse zzso and to kidney and zzso zzso in adult zzso Furthermore, zzso chain zzso analysis shows that zzso is expressed in zzso stem cells as well as in more mature zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso a zzso protein that is localized in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed the effects of zzso either zzso zzso or a functionally inactive zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso cell line, cells zzso expressing functional zzso differentiated normally to zzso after induction with zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso zzso expressing an inactive zzso zzso protein were treated with zzso the characteristic cell spreading and zzso zzso that accompany zzso differentiation did not zzso We show that, in these cells, the induction of the differentiation marker zzso zzso is not zzso However, both zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso a late zzso marker, are zzso These results suggest that the expression of an inactive form of zzso affects late signaling events of zzso zzso zzso
