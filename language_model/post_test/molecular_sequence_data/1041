Although the zzso zzso protein complex I zzso of zzso I zzso is intimately associated with the zzso core complex and forms the zzso zzso the zzso is normally zzso in zzso zzso In this paper, we compared the zzso compositions of the zzso zzso and the zzso by zzso analysis and two-dimensional gel zzso combined with mass zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso were zzso by zzso density zzso zzso and zzso column zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of the green zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained all of the nine zzso zzso zzso that are detected in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso retained only six zzso zzso whereas zzso and two minor zzso zzso and zzso were lost during the zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso retains an zzso structure with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso We therefore concluded that zzso zzso and zzso are not required for the stable zzso structure of the zzso and that the association of these zzso in the zzso is stabilized by the presence of the zzso core zzso Finally, we discuss the possible zzso and function of zzso zzso in the zzso
