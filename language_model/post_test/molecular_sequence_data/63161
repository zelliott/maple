zzso have been described in zzso as zzso or immune zzso We report here the characterization of two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from the fat body and zzso tract of immune zzso zzso zzso a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso profiles indicate that the zzso and spatial expression patterns of these two peptides are very zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the zzso after zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso or after injection of bacteria into the zzso zzso is expressed primarily in the fat body after bacterial zzso zzso alignments indicate that zzso zzso best with molecules from other zzso whose major expression is found in the zzso tract whereas zzso zzso best with zzso and tick molecules whose expression is found principally in zzso and fat body and whose role has been described as zzso These data suggest a differential zzso role of two closely related zzso one for immunity in the zzso and the other for zzso in the zzso
