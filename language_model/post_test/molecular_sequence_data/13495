A simple and sensitive procedure with which to detect residual zzso nibbling activities zzso restriction zzso preparations is zzso The procedure uses the zzso zzso which zzso zzso resistance and zzso zzso sensitivity zzso by the zzso zzso zzso gene onto zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso strains such as zzso When zzso cells transformed by zzso were selected on zzso medium containing zzso plus zzso the efficiency of transformation zzso was substantially lower than that on zzso containing zzso zzso However, when zzso DNA was zzso by restriction zzso that cut once per zzso within zzso and zzso the zzso efficiency increased depending on the degree of contamination of zzso nibbling activities in the zzso zzso due to deletion zzso at the zzso zzso zzso efficiency was converted to zzso nibbling zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso effective nibbling activities were detected in 17 of 34 commercial samples of restriction zzso zzso The method is simple and more sensitive than the procedures used by the commercial suppliers and it is zzso to the quality control testing of more than 100 restriction zzso
