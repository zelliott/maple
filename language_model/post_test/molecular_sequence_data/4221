The zzso constitute a family of zzso intrinsic membrane proteins that function as highly selective water channels and are highly expressed in zzso where rapid water movement across the cell membrane is zzso zzso mechanism of water transport through the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle is still not zzso This study was designed to identify zzso zzso and their expression regulation in zzso cells, a mouse zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso cells express zzso zzso expression was increased by induction of zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso solutions induced an increase in zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso inhibitor failed to inhibit zzso induction of zzso expression in zzso zzso These data indicate that skeletal muscle cells express zzso protein and its expression is regulated by differentiation and zzso zzso
