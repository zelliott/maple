The zzso sequence for zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso rapid amplification of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and all of the expected structural features of a zzso zzso A zzso gene tree was constructed and rates of evolution calculated for zzso zzso zzso and several zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis provided strong support for zzso as a sister group with zzso zzso and weak support for zzso and zzso as an independent grouping from the zzso zzso The rates of molecular evolution for zzso zzso were comparable to the slow rate seen in the majority of zzso zzso that have been zzso
