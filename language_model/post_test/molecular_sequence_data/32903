zzso is one of the most strongly induced genes upon viral infection, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and only one copy has been found in zzso so zzso Here two fish zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso have been cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso carp zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso carp zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso by suppression zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequences of two zzso carp zzso zzso a zzso protein and a zzso zzso both of which show zzso identity overall and possess the characteristic structures of zzso zzso proteins including two tandem zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells treated with different stimuli including active virus, zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso the expression of both zzso and zzso was zzso but displayed different zzso Poly zzso and zzso were also able to induce an increase in zzso for both zzso In zzso cells responsive to active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Poly zzso and zzso zzso was zzso more significantly than zzso These results suggest that there are two zzso zzso in zzso zzso both of which might play distinct roles in innate immunity against viral and bacterial zzso
