zzso necrosis factor zzso factor 6 zzso a key signaling zzso zzso common to the zzso zzso and zzso family, is important not only for a diverse array of zzso processes functions of the zzso zzso but also is involved in zzso immunity and innate zzso In this report, the first zzso zzso (named as zzso gene is identified and characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is of zzso consisting of a zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso signal sequence zzso and a zzso zzso tail, and an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of 655 zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso comprises characteristic motifs of the zzso zzso including a zzso finger of zzso two zzso fingers of zzso a zzso region, and a zzso (the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso acid sequence identity between zzso and other zzso is zzso zzso analyses of zzso sequence with zzso sequences from other organisms indicate that zzso is a true zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in various zzso is measured by zzso zzso The zzso transcripts are zzso expressed in zzso of zzso muscle, zzso heart, zzso and zzso but the highest expression is observed in the zzso The zzso expressions of zzso zzso in the mixed primary cultured zzso are recorded after treatment with 20 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression level of zzso zzso is zzso from zzso to zzso after the treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and then recovers to the original zzso While the expression of zzso is obviously decreased after treatment with 20 zzso zzso zzso and reach the lowest point zzso about zzso times to zzso at zzso The result suggests that zzso can be greatly regulated by zzso and it may be involved in signal zzso and immune response of zzso
