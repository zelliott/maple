We describe the generation of a complete set of zzso 21st zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pairs including the first report of a 21st zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that amber, zzso and zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso coli zzso zzso suppress zzso zzso and zzso termination zzso respectively, in a reporter zzso in zzso zzso zzso of each zzso zzso is dependent upon the expression of zzso zzso zzso indicating that none of the zzso zzso are zzso by any of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a wide range of activities in suppression zzso of up to 36, 156 and zzso zzso have been generated by introducing further zzso into the zzso zzso zzso The most active zzso zzso have been used in combination to zzso suppress two or three termination zzso in an zzso We discuss the potential use of these 21st zzso zzso pairs for the zzso incorporation of two or, zzso even three different zzso zzso acids into proteins and for the regulated suppression of amber, zzso and zzso termination zzso in zzso zzso
