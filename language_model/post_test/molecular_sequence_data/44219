After integration into the bacterial zzso an zzso gene may be zzso expressed without continued selection for the zzso zzso However, zzso integration events occur zzso requiring the zzso integration of a drug resistance marker in order to identify colonies of zzso zzso The generation of a drug-resistant zzso strain can both reduce the in zzso zzso of the strain and zzso the use of zzso zzso which use the same drug resistance zzso We have constructed a zzso zzso which allows zzso of zzso genes onto the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene completely replaces the zzso gene and the zzso strain lacks any zzso drug resistance zzso The zzso described zzso are general and zzso even to those bacteria for which zzso plasmids are not zzso Using zzso we integrated the zzso gene into the zzso zzso zzso via a precise exchange of zzso and zzso The zzso strain was used to demonstrate that the expression of genes integrated at the zzso locus is zzso twofold by inclusion of zzso in the growth zzso In addition, we used zzso to construct an zzso zzso strain with a precise deletion of its zzso zzso This strain, zzso grows normally in rich medium but does not grow in medium lacking zzso zzso cells allow the zzso gene to be used as a zzso marker for growth on medium lacking zzso In zzso cells, the zzso gene is also useful as a zzso marker on complete medium containing zzso acid and zzso Two zzso zzso designed to exploit the new delta zzso strain, have been constructed and their possible applications to problems in zzso are zzso
