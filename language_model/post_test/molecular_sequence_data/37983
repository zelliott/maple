zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso is dramatically enhanced by a zzso site within zzso III domain 9 zzso zzso by the crystal structure of the zzso domain, we selected zzso acids in zzso that project in the same direction as the zzso presumably toward the zzso and zzso them to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the nearby zzso have been shown previously to be important for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our more extensive set of zzso showed that zzso is the key zzso in the synergistic effect, but other zzso contribute zzso zzso decreased zzso slightly by itself, but the double zzso zzso was significantly less adhesive than zzso zzso Single zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso had negligible effects on cell zzso but combining these zzso either with zzso or each other gave a more dramatic reduction of cell zzso The triple zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso We conclude that, in addition to the R of the zzso zzso other zzso on the same face of zzso are required for the full synergistic zzso The zzso zzso site is a much more extensive surface than the small linear zzso zzso
