The genetic regulatory networks controlling major zzso processes seem to be zzso in zzso regardless of an independent or a common origin of the zzso This has been explained by the employment of a genetic zzso that was repeatedly used during zzso evolution to build the various forms and body zzso However, it is not clear how genetic networks were incorporated into the formation of novel structures and how zzso genes can regulate the disparate zzso zzso Here we address this question by zzso the role of zzso zzso which is part of the zzso zzso in neural stem cell evolution in zzso Within zzso neural stem cells have evolved in the last common zzso of insects and crustaceans zzso We zzso here for the first time the role of zzso zzso in a zzso the zzso zzso zzso and show that it is required in neural stem cells for regulating the time of neural precursor production and for zzso cell fate decisions in the zzso zzso The function of zzso zzso has zzso in the zzso zzso of insects and crustaceans accompanied by changes in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso controlled mechanisms of zzso regulation have evolved that are surprisingly similar to zzso and thus present a remarkable case of parallel zzso These new data on a representative of crustaceans complete the zzso data set on zzso zzso in the nervous system and allow for reconstructing how the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from pre-existing structures to the development of the evolving neural stem cells in the zzso zzso
