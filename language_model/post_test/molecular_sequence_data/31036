An zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed for the Lewis zzso associated zzso zzso zzso plates coated with the bovine serum zzso zzso of a synthetic zzso zzso are incubated with a zzso preparation in the presence of zzso zzso The resulting immobilized zzso active zzso zzso is then detected and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso formation detected in this manner is linear with time, zzso to zzso activity, and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
