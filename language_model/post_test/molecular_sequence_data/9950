zzso zzso zzso a soil isolate from a zzso site in The Netherlands, is able to degrade a broad range of aromatic zzso A novel gene cluster which appears to zzso a zzso for the degradation of zzso acids such as zzso zzso has been cloned from the zzso of this zzso zzso analysis of a zzso region identified five open reading frames zzso Analysis of zzso showed that the genes were expressed during growth on zzso and zzso zzso but not during growth on zzso or zzso The first ORF, zzso which appears to be separately zzso had considerable zzso acid identity with a number of zzso zzso analysis indicates that the next four zzso zzso which are tightly zzso constitute a single zzso These genes appear to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso a membrane transport protein zzso and a member of the zzso family of regulatory proteins zzso The activities of zzso and zzso have been confirmed by zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso The zzso specificity of zzso expressed from the cloned gene matches that of the zzso zzso expressed from zzso zzso grown on both zzso and zzso and is considerably more active against acid than against neutral zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the gene products have a recognizable zzso with a broad range of zzso and proteins involved in zzso and appear most similar to the zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso which also encodes the degradation of zzso
