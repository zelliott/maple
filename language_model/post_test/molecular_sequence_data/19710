Using mass zzso we have detected both assembly zzso and the final product, the zzso viral zzso during zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Assembly is only efficient when both types of zzso coat protein zzso seen in the final zzso are present in zzso zzso experiments confirm that zzso of these zzso is zzso regulated by zzso binding of a short zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirm that all zzso observed are competent for further coat protein addition, zzso they are all on the zzso to zzso formation, and that the unit of zzso growth is a coat protein zzso The major intermediate species are dominated by zzso derived from formation of the particle zzso zzso zzso that there is a defined zzso toward the zzso zzso These results provide the first experimental evidence for a detailed zzso explanation of the regulation of zzso zzso zzso They suggest a direct role for the zzso zzso in assembly in zzso which is consistent with the structure of the zzso zzso within zzso zzso
