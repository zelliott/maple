zzso of human zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso acid zzso inhibitor zzso zzso that zzso to zzso A resolution were obtained by soaking an zzso crystal in a solution of zzso The crystal structure was determined using the difference zzso method and refined to an R factor of zzso at zzso A zzso This structure is the highest resolution structure of the zzso zzso that is currently zzso With the exception of the region near zzso the structures of the zzso and zzso molecules in the zzso complex are similar to those reported for the zzso zzso zzso As previously determined for the zzso complex, the zzso carbon atom of zzso forms a zzso bond with O gamma of zzso of zzso to yield a zzso analog of the zzso zzso zzso of the specificity pocket of the zzso complexes of zzso and zzso reveals differences in hydrogen bonding and shows for the first time that the zzso site of zzso is larger than that of zzso and as a result zzso may be able to accommodate a zzso zzso group than zzso
