zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso and zzso to generate zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso specificity of zzso and zzso will zzso help in the development of novel zzso zzso that are potential zzso against zzso cancer, and infectious disease and zzso facilitate zzso to provide novel zzso units for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are zzso zzso The core zzso zzso zzso and zzso are 360 zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso crystal structures of zzso zzso were determined to zzso zzso The zzso assembly forms a zzso zzso The zzso highly zzso zzso pocket was identified for the first zzso zzso and zzso bind perpendicular to each other in the active site, where two zzso holes were zzso zzso of zzso is proposed to be the active site zzso zzso zzso at a single zzso of zzso and zzso allowed zzso of the zzso specificity of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso interaction is crucial for zzso zzso stability, and zzso zzso these features are also highly zzso among zzso zzso Our findings enable zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity to provide novel zzso units for the zzso zzso of zzso
