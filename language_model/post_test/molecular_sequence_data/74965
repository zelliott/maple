We have cloned and zzso the full-length zzso for the human zzso zzso zzso zzso from four overlapping zzso The zzso sequence contains zzso zzso which zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence includes a putative signal sequence of 40 zzso zzso an zzso domain consisting of 15 zzso repeat sequences of zzso zzso zzso a zzso region of 23 zzso zzso and a zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso The predicted molecular size is greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of the human zzso are highly zzso with the sequence recently reported for the partial zzso for the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso The zzso sequence for the full-length zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso which are reported here, are zzso similar zzso identical at the zzso level and zzso identical at the zzso acid zzso to those recently reported for the human zzso growth factor II zzso from zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fried, zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso Roth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso These findings support the suggestion that the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso is a zzso binding protein which is identical with the zzso growth factor II zzso A zzso construct containing the full coding sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the expression zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso cells produced a zzso protein which zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso with authentic human zzso bound to an affinity column and was specifically zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso of zzso and targeted the zzso zzso to zzso
