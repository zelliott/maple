zzso patterns of zzso genes can be similar between zzso related species, suggesting that zzso programs can be zzso between zzso Here, we show that the promoter of zzso a gene which is involved in zzso lateral root development, also drives the expression of the reporter zzso gene in lateral roots of zzso zzso suggesting that similar regulatory elements are involved in lateral root zzso in these zzso Interestingly, the zzso promoter was able to drive zzso expression in root zzso and zzso zzso structures that are absent in zzso We found two zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso and we speculate that these putative zzso zzso may play a role during lateral root and zzso development in this zzso
