The process of salvaging zzso released from zzso zzso during plant cell growth and development, is not well zzso and many molecular components remain to be zzso Here we identify and functionally characterize a unique zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare it with zzso The zzso gene appeared to be expressed in all zzso implicating that zzso salvage is a common zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso conversion of zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso zzso This sugar zzso is then converted to zzso by a zzso zzso as determined by a real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso is a distinct member of the zzso zzso family that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although these zzso have zzso motifs for sugar zzso zzso zzso and zzso they do have subtle zzso For example, zzso has an additional domain near the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we established that zzso in zzso reduces zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso alters sugar specificity and allows zzso of zzso acid, the zzso of zzso Unlike many plant genes that undergo duplication, zzso occurs as a single copy gene in vascular zzso We suggest that zzso generates zzso from the salvaged zzso that is released during zzso cell wall zzso or from storage zzso The zzso itself is then available for use in the formation of zzso required for zzso zzso
