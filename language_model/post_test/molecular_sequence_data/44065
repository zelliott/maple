The short filaments extending from the zzso face of nuclear pore complexes are thought to contain zzso sites for nuclear import zzso One component of these filaments is the large zzso zzso zzso zzso studies carried out under zzso conditions, and using a variety of zzso reveal a novel zzso zzso zzso that is tightly associated with zzso zzso with such an association, zzso is found to be exposed on the zzso face of the nuclear pore zzso zzso sequence analyses indicate that zzso contains neither the zzso nor the zzso repeats that are a characteristic of a number of other nuclear pore complex zzso Secondary structure predictions, however, suggest that zzso contains a zzso zzso domain, a conclusion supported by the observation of significant sequence similarity between this region of the zzso and various members of the zzso zzso zzso and expression studies indicate that the putative zzso domain is required for association with the zzso face of the nuclear pore complex, whereas it is the zzso region of zzso that contains the site of interaction with zzso These findings suggest a model in which zzso may function in the attachment of zzso to the central framework of the nuclear pore zzso In this way, zzso could play a central role in the organization of the interface between the pore complex and the zzso
