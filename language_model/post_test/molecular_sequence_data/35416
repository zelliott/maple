zzso disease zzso is the most common of the zzso storage disorders and is caused by defects in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso of its zzso zzso zzso is considered the main cause of zzso We found here that the expression of human zzso zzso gene zzso that is associated with zzso in zzso patients causes zzso defects in zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso zzso stress was elevated in zzso eye carrying zzso zzso by using of the zzso stress markers zzso and zzso We also found that zzso a potential pharmacological zzso for zzso zzso can alleviate the zzso zzso through reducing zzso zzso We demonstrate a novel mechanism of zzso defects zzso by zzso stress through expression of zzso of human zzso gene in the eye of zzso
