The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize a new zzso bacteria from agricultural soil and to investigate its zzso ability and zzso of zzso A bacterial strain zzso isolated from agriculture soil could completely degrade and zzso zzso as the sole zzso zzso and energy sources for growth in zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence and zzso analysis suggested that the strain zzso was belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could completely degrade zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso within 96 h were identified by zzso liquid zzso zzso and electron spray zzso zzso zzso zzso When exposed to the higher zzso the strain zzso showed zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso within 7 days of zzso It could also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of strain zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso soil resulted in higher degradation rate than in zzso zzso These results highlight the potential of this zzso to be used in the cleanup of contaminated zzso waste in the zzso
