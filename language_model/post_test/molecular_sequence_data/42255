With a view to understanding the structural requirement for zzso zzso we have examined the free and zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso a zzso for a protein zzso zzso using circular zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and molecular modeling zzso CD spectrum of the free zzso in water showed a random zzso structure, while the spectrum in zzso was indicative of a folded structure containing a type III zzso zzso angle data derived from zzso zzso constants, as well as two-dimensional zzso and zzso spectral zzso showed that the zzso adopts a zzso close to the zzso zzso binding by the zzso as monitored by CD spectral changes, was quite weak in zzso However, substantial CD spectral changes were observed in the zzso on addition of zzso in zzso suggestive of major zzso zzso due to zzso zzso Analysis of the binding zzso at 25 degrees C obtained from CD data in zzso indicated a zzso zzso zzso complex to be the dominant species with a zzso of about 30 zzso A zzso complex was also present and became significant at zzso ratios above zzso By comparison, the zzso formed a predominantly zzso complex with zzso with a zzso of about 40 zzso zzso data showed that a mixture of zzso and trans zzso zzso from rotation around the zzso zzso in the free zzso changes over to the zzso form on coordination of the zzso zzso groups to the zzso zzso zzso data of the zzso complex revealed several interactions involving the zzso of two zzso molecules in the zzso zzso modeling and energy zzso with and without the input of zzso distance constraints showed the sandwich complex to be an energetically very zzso zzso Besides its relevance in terms of the possible involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso interaction, the zzso characterization of zzso and its zzso complex should help understand the zzso zzso for zzso by linear zzso
