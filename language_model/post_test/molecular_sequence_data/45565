zzso have versatile electron transfer pathways and many of the proteins involved are functional in both respiratory and zzso electron zzso Examples of such proteins include the zzso b zzso f complex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study we have cloned and zzso two gene clusters from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene clusters are most similar to two related gene clusters found in the freshwater zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not have a zzso gene cluster which encodes a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene clusters were transcribed zzso although the levels of transcripts for the zzso gene cluster were lower than those of the zzso gene zzso The zzso and zzso coding sequences were interrupted by zzso zzso and full zzso were isolated and characterized for both single and double zzso Growth rates, zzso and zzso zzso oxygen consumption and oxygen evolution were examined in the wild type and zzso zzso zzso between the wild type and zzso strains observed in 77 K zzso zzso and in zzso modulated zzso zzso studies suggest that the zzso zzso play a role in zzso and high light tolerance in zzso zzso zzso zzso
