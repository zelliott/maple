To screen and identify serum zzso for zzso in children using zzso laser zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso laser zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso was used to identify zzso in 100 children with zzso and 30 gender and zzso normal healthy zzso There were 30 cases of zzso patients and 70 cases of zzso zzso zzso expressed serum proteins were zzso The target proteins were then zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso The zzso mass fingerprints zzso of each protein were obtained after scanning with zzso zzso The proteins were identified using zzso and the biological functions and zzso of these proteins were analyzed with zzso zzso Two differential proteins zzso zzso zzso were zzso According to zzso the molecular masses of this two proteins indicated that they were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Expressions of the two proteins were lower in the zzso group compared with the zzso and control group zzso In contrast, the expression of this two proteins were higher in the early stage than in the advanced stage of zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be used as potential zzso to predict the degree of zzso therapeutic zzso and prognosis of zzso in zzso
