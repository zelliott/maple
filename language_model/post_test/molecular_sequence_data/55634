Human zzso virus type 1 zzso subjects show a high zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may function as a zzso that affects zzso zzso and may play a major role in the progression of zzso To test this hypothesis, we generated two zzso human zzso lines that zzso express the zzso gene of zzso These zzso cell lines were zzso zzso with plasmids that carry either the wild type or deletion zzso of the zzso long terminal repeat zzso fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a consistently higher zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells than in control cells, which suggested that zzso proteins could activate the zzso promoter, possibly by inducing nuclear factors binding to zzso zzso zzso To test this possibility, we used zzso plasmids carrying deletions of the zzso B zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which nuclear proteins from zzso cells were challenged with zzso encompassing the zzso B or zzso region of the zzso zzso We found that both the zzso B and the zzso sites of the zzso zzso are necessary for zzso zzso and that increased expression resulted from the induction of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, experiments with the zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso plasmids indicated that zzso zzso proteins could participate in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and that zzso proteins can zzso with the viral zzso zzso zzso experiments with plasmids expressing the zzso zzso and zzso genes did not cause a significant zzso zzso zzso Thus, it appears that among the zzso zzso genes tested, zzso was the only zzso gene active on the zzso zzso The zzso function of zzso was also observed in the zzso zzso cell line, which suggests that zzso and zzso infection of non-B cells may result in zzso promoter zzso zzso a specific gene product of zzso zzso can zzso zzso and possibly contribute to the clinical progression of zzso
