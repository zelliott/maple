Growth differentiation zzso zzso is a growth factor zzso by zzso in growing zzso zzso To investigate the zzso function of zzso in zzso we first cloned zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso and then injected its gene fragments into the zzso in zzso zzso zzso has open reading frame zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with its human, zzso zzso rat and mouse counterparts zzso Regarding the deduced zzso sequence of the mature zzso the corresponding zzso reach zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in early zzso the zzso of 2-month-old zzso zzso were injected with zzso gene zzso The injection of zzso zzso gene fragments resulted in an increase in the number of primary, secondary and zzso zzso zzso with a decrease in the number of primordial zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso can promote early zzso in the zzso zzso and that a technique for direct zzso injection of zzso gene fragments may contribute to a novel therapy for prevention and treatment of zzso associated with zzso zzso
