The yellow fever zzso Aedes aegypti is an important human health zzso which zzso yellow fever and dengue zzso zzso plays a crucial role in its attraction to hosts and although the molecular basis of this is not well understood it is likely that zzso proteins zzso are involved in the first step of molecular zzso Based on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have defined sequence motifs based on zzso zzso zzso and developed an zzso which has allowed us to identify 66 genes zzso putative zzso from the zzso sequence and expressed sequence tags zzso of zzso zzso We have also identified 11 new zzso genes for zzso zzso We have examined all of the corresponding zzso sequences for the properties of zzso The predicted molecular weights fall within the expected range but the predicted zzso points are spread over a wider range than found zzso Comparative analyses of the 66 zzso sequences of zzso aegypti with other zzso species reveal some zzso genes as well as zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso aegypti zzso suggests that a rapid expansion of zzso has occurred, probably by gene zzso The analyses of zzso regions for zzso indicate a very high zzso between zzso aegypti and zzso zzso
