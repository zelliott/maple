The high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins zzso which are tightly bound to zzso zzso in winter flounder, are made up of imperfect reiterations of simple zzso sequences that contain zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern blots zzso with zzso to the coding and zzso regions of zzso zzso showed that zzso sequences form a complex zzso zzso Previously, one gene zzso was used to establish an evolutionary link between zzso zzso and the zzso Further examination of this complex, zzso family has now revealed that the majority of the zzso genes are linked as zzso zzso direct tandem repeats that each contain a zzso zzso coding region and a zzso zzso zzso region zzso These findings, combined with the cloning of the zzso established that the zzso repeated genes lack zzso and code for the abundant 3 zzso zzso zzso that produce the prominent 110 zzso zzso Southern zzso of zzso from other zzso zzso species showed that zzso zzso families were present in closely related species, though with substantial differences in restriction patterns and band zzso but were not detected in more zzso related zzso These observations are consistent with recent and rapid zzso of the zzso gene zzso
