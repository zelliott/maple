We describe zzso the identification of zzso by cloning the full-length coding sequence with zzso zzso chain reaction zzso This new zzso was found in two Han Chinese individuals in the course of cloning major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso zzso It was identical to zzso except for a zzso substitution in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso change represents a synonymous zzso as both triplets code for an zzso The zzso of this zzso was 48 zzso shorter than zzso due to zzso out zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that the product of this new zzso had the identical zzso domain and zzso region but had a shorter zzso zzso
