We have cloned and characterized a zzso of the previously isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This second zzso called zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that shares zzso sequence identity with zzso Like zzso it has an zzso extension of unknown zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso and zzso with zzso at zzso IV as well as with an unknown zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene did not reveal any zzso zzso effects, whereas zzso resulted in a slight, but zzso increase of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Analysis of gene zzso by a zzso gene fused to the zzso promoters revealed decreased zzso activity of the zzso promoter in cells grown on zzso as opposed to zzso carbon sources, and no induction in cells exposed to high zzso or heat zzso Similar analysis of zzso demonstrated an zzso higher zzso level of zzso compared to zzso Furthermore, such analysis revealed that the zzso promoter was induced by increased zzso essentially independent of the type of stress zzso used, the level of zzso zzso being increased about zzso in cells growing at zzso M zzso
