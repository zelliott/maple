One of the main problems of zzso cloning of human disease genes is isolation and identification of coding DNA segments in large zzso zzso Traditional methods of isolation of zzso fragments usually do not allow detection of transcribed sequences including zzso ends of zzso In this study, a method of rapid isolation of zzso islands associated with zzso regulatory segments of the majority of zzso genes is zzso This method, which is termed the zzso method, is based on the use of a zzso zzso primer and a zzso or zzso primer in zzso amplification of human zzso DNA fragments cloned in zzso clones or zzso The method was applied to cloning zzso sequences mapped in the region in which the gene for the zzso familial form of Alzheimer's disease type III is located zzso The majority of cloned zzso products contained zzso zzso zzso of clone zzso in zzso region zzso was performed by zzso zzso In total, nine zzso zzso sequences that are potential zzso regions of different genes were detected and mapped by the zzso
