The origins of zzso group I zzso within nuclear zzso zzso zzso are zzso This is partly because they have never been reported in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are hypothesized to be ancestral to derived zzso zzso and zzso Here we report group I zzso from the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure analyses predicted that both zzso belong to the zzso zzso and that they are zzso related to each other, which is also suggested by different zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso inserted in the zzso zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso which strongly suggests zzso horizontal zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso has a low zzso affinity to other zzso zzso zzso inserted into site zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso It is noteworthy that this zzso contains a putative zzso containing a zzso box motif in the zzso zzso a hallmark for zzso zzso zzso Overall, molecular zzso analyses do not support the placement of these two zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This result leads to the suggestion that zzso zzso zzso might have invaded or been transferred zzso after the divergence of the four major zzso zzso
