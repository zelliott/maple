zzso iron transport in zzso zzso is dependent upon the zzso zzso zzso energy zzso protein for zzso To assess the functional significance of the various regions of this zzso and to identify functionally important zzso the zzso gene was subjected to zzso zzso and the influence on iron acquisition was zzso The novel zzso extension of zzso which is absent in all other examples of zzso was required for zzso activity in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso it to the N zzso of the zzso (in zzso zzso zzso coli zzso protein zzso rendered zzso zzso active in zzso zzso and did not compromise the activity of this protein in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso presumed membrane anchor sequence of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, however, a zzso His zzso within the membrane anchor zzso shown to be required for zzso function in zzso coli, was shown here to be essential for zzso activity in zzso coli but not in zzso zzso Several zzso within the zzso end of zzso within a region exhibiting the greatest similarity to other zzso zzso compromised a zzso contribution to iron acquisition in both zzso zzso and zzso coli, including zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso also impacted zzso on zzso function in zzso coli but not in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was suppressed by a second zzso at zzso of zzso but only in zzso zzso Several zzso zzso were constructed, and assessment of their activities revealed that zzso at the N or C zzso of zzso compromised its activity in zzso zzso although zzso possessing an zzso coli C zzso were active in zzso zzso
