The DNA binding properties of a series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso are zzso These zzso contain one to four zzso units, zzso Data from the zzso displacement zzso showed that these compounds bind in the minor groove of DNA, with the relative order of binding zzso of 6 zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso 4 zzso The reduced binding zzso of these compounds for zzso relative to zzso while they still interact strongly with zzso provided evidence of zzso sequence zzso The preferences for zzso sequences by these compounds were established from a combination of circular zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the CD studies, these compounds produced significantly larger zzso zzso bands with zzso than zzso at comparable zzso zzso zzso studies of the binding of 5 to zzso provided further evidence of the recognition of zzso sequences by these compounds, and suggested that the zzso was located on the zzso sequence in the minor groove with the zzso oriented over the T zzso zzso zzso studies on a zzso zzso zzso of zzso provided zzso evidence for the zzso sequence selectivity for some of these zzso zzso 4 and 7 produced poor zzso on the zzso however, zzso 5 and 6 gave strong zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
