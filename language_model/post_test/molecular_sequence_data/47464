zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comprise a ubiquitous system that uses the reducing power of zzso to act as a general zzso zzso system as well as a potent zzso zzso Human and rat zzso contain a complete zzso system different from the one present in the zzso The zzso system is involved in the zzso stress protection through a zzso zzso zzso We report here the zzso cloning and zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The mouse zzso zzso encodes for a putative protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of 57 zzso that displays high zzso with the human and rat zzso The zzso of the protein displays typical features of a zzso targeting sequence with absence of zzso zzso and abundance of basic zzso Mouse zzso also contains a stop zzso in frame at the zzso of the zzso necessary for the incorporation of zzso that is required for zzso zzso The typical zzso structure zzso zzso that drives the incorporation of zzso is identified in the zzso Northern analysis of the mouse zzso zzso shows a similar pattern of expression with the human zzso with higher expression in liver, heart and zzso Finally, we have assigned the mouse zzso gene to zzso 16 mapping at zzso zzso from the zzso and linked to the zzso zzso zzso
