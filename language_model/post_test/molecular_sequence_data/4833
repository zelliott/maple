As a step in the evolutionary studies of zzso E zzso and for the purpose of developing new zzso that will facilitate a more detailed analysis of zzso inflammatory reactions in a large animal model, we here present the cloning of the zzso chain of zzso in the domestic pig zzso zzso A partial zzso clone for the zzso chain of pig zzso was isolated by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification using zzso zzso directed against zzso regions in the second zzso and the fourth zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso derived from zzso isolated from the zzso and zzso zzso of a pig actively zzso with a protein extract from the zzso zzso zzso was used as zzso zzso of a zzso zzso library with the partial zzso clone as probe resulted in isolation of a clone that contained the entire coding zzso The zzso sequence was determined and was found to conform with the previously identified zzso zzso zzso The highest degree of similarity was found to sheep zzso A DNA construct zzso a zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the pig zzso zzso chain was obtained by zzso zzso The construct was zzso into the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso of High Five insect cells with zzso zzso resulted in expression and zzso of a soluble 6 zzso zzso protein zzso
