zzso from young patients exhibiting clinical features of zzso syndromes showed decreased zzso of the small zzso zzso zzso in culture were metabolically labeled, and zzso zzso into the medium were analyzed zzso after zzso with zzso raised against zzso and zzso zzso showed regularly a reduction to zzso of the normal amount of mature zzso and its core protein after zzso ABC zzso zzso The size of the zzso chains was increased, but there was no obvious anomaly in the zzso zzso of the mature zzso In addition, the patients' zzso zzso an increased amount of zzso compared to control cells from healthy zzso Northern zzso analysis clearly demonstrated a reduction by zzso in zzso zzso but zzso zzso was zzso increased, indicating that these zzso occur at the zzso level of protein zzso zzso of zzso in zzso from one of the patients was zzso up to zzso by treatment with zzso zzso No response to zzso beta and transforming growth zzso was observed in the cells from another zzso In zzso zzso of cultured cells with an zzso zzso probe showed that zzso levels were reduced throughout the cell zzso Surprisingly, subsequent examination of cells from one of the patients, now in zzso revealed a return to normal levels of zzso expression compared to zzso zzso These studies suggest that, as in zzso syndrome where the primary zzso concerns the zzso zzso reduced zzso expression contributes to the formation of an abnormal zzso and the zzso of these zzso They also indicate that this zzso is likely to represent a secondary phenomenon which leads to a fault in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
