zzso differences among zzso B virus zzso zzso have been zzso However, the interaction between different zzso zzso remains zzso zzso we chose zzso zzso B zzso and C zzso zzso intravenous drug users to study this zzso zzso zzso was determined in 40 zzso zzso and zzso zzso intravenous drug users by using zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso was as zzso zzso zzso B alone in 29 zzso zzso zzso C alone in 4 zzso and mixed zzso zzso B and zzso zzso C in 7 zzso The interaction between zzso zzso B and zzso zzso C within the same individual was further studied in the seven intravenous drug users with zzso zzso B and zzso zzso C zzso By direct sequencing of the zzso region, only zzso zzso B was zzso When zzso clones of the zzso region were zzso from each intravenous drug user and zzso most of the clones were zzso zzso zzso Novel zzso between zzso zzso B and zzso zzso C occurred in four clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso from two intravenous drug users zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were estimated at zzso zzso for zzso at zzso zzso for zzso and at zzso zzso for zzso and zzso by zzso zzso The zzso sites of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be within the zzso zzso The results in this study suggest that zzso is the dominant strain in zzso zzso B and C zzso intravenous drug users in Taiwan, and zzso between different zzso zzso are not zzso The impact of zzso on the evolution of zzso and their clinical significance remains to be zzso
