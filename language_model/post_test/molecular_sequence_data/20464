The zzso distribution of zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso leaf litter was investigated on zzso zzso zzso zzso northern zzso Fallen leaves were collected at five sites of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1500 m above sea zzso along a zzso on the northern slope of zzso zzso A total of 35 species were isolated from zzso leaf litter of which 12 occurred frequently and were regarded as dominant zzso Species zzso diversity, and zzso of zzso zzso were lower at Site 1500 than at the other zzso zzso in species composition were relatively high among Sites zzso zzso and zzso but similarities between these sites and sites at the higher zzso zzso Sites 1200 and zzso were relatively zzso zzso of species composition was relatively low between Sites 1200 and zzso zzso analysis showed that the 12 major zzso species were classified into four groups according to their pattern of zzso distribution that peaked at Sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the diversity and species composition of zzso zzso are sensitive to environmental changes along the zzso zzso on zzso zzso and this is especially so at the zzso higher than approximately 1200 zzso This implies that future environmental changes will have impacts on mountainous zzso through the changes in diversity and functional aspects of zzso zzso
