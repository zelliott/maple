The zzso activity of zzso zzso gene was studied with an in zzso zzso system using nuclear extracts prepared from bovine adrenal zzso zzso plasmids were constructed with the promoter region of the bovine zzso zzso gene and a zzso cassette as a reporter zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region revealed two neighboring sites, zzso and zzso which are necessary for efficient zzso of the zzso These sites are highly zzso among zzso zzso and human zzso Though the zzso site, zzso showed high zzso to the consensus sequence of the zzso element, zzso with one base zzso the zzso site showed no similarity to any regulatory element reported so zzso zzso shift zzso using synthetic zzso containing zzso and/or zzso indicated that three factors bound to these regions in adrenal zzso nuclear zzso two factors to zzso and one factor to zzso zzso I footprint analysis also showed the binding of factors to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso containing zzso and/or zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso promoter expressed a stronger zzso activity in the nuclear extract of adrenal zzso than in that of zzso On the other hand, the promoter of alpha zzso zzso which is expressed only in liver, showed an opposite tissue specificity of zzso zzso of adrenal zzso nuclear extract to liver nuclear extract activated specifically the zzso zzso promoter in proportion to the quantity of adrenal zzso nuclear extract zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
