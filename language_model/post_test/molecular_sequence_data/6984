Unlike most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso as an inactive precursor or zzso Instead, the zzso zzso form of zzso possesses very significant zzso zzso Recent investigations of the molecular basis of the unusually high zzso activity of zzso zzso have focused attention upon zzso a zzso that is zzso among zzso zzso The critical role of this zzso in securing the active zzso of mature zzso zzso has been discussed zzso zzso work, however, has indicated that this zzso zzso can also form interactions that dramatically influence the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso While zzso forms interactions that suppress the activity of the zzso zzso it may, by contrast, directly promote the zzso active zzso of zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso promotes the activity of both zzso and zzso zzso and therefore plays opposing roles in zzso zzso and zzso and also to examine whether this zzso zzso plays an essential role in the stimulation of zzso by zzso we used zzso zzso to construct the following zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the absence of zzso the activity of zzso carrying a zzso at position zzso was reduced by factors of zzso compared to wild type zzso Similar reductions of activity were observed for both zzso and zzso zzso suggesting an important role for zzso in both forms of the zzso The zzso zzso however, displayed a dramatically enhanced response to zzso zzso While the activity of wild type zzso was zzso by zzso zzso by a factor of zzso the corresponding stimulation factor for the zzso zzso varied from zzso
