The difficulty of zzso primary zzso and zzso cell lines has meant that relatively few studies on regulation of gene expression have been performed in these zzso This study has zzso an zzso procedure for the zzso cell line zzso zzso but shows that introduction of DNA into the zzso of primary zzso by zzso is toxic to the zzso It is proposed that this cell death may have a zzso role in zzso against certain viral infections which result in zzso of zzso zzso zzso 264 cells were efficiently zzso by zzso but zzso bone zzso derived zzso zzso showed large scale cell death over a period of 12 zzso zzso without DNA was not toxic and zzso treatment of samples before zzso prevented cell zzso The toxicity of DNA was zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA all caused cell zzso This sensitivity to DNA seems to be distinct from the zzso state induced by zzso zzso and may be part of an zzso viral zzso zzso
