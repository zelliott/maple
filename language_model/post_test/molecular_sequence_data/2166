Two zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso zzso The zzso gene is located upstream from the zzso structural gene cluster zzso and is preceded by a sequence that is potentially part of a zzso zzso The product of zzso appears to be required for expression of zzso since cells of the zzso deletion strain zzso were unable to zzso this zzso when zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was identified after determination of the zzso sequence of DNA zzso the zzso zzso in zzso strain zzso Two open reading frames zzso and zzso were found located upstream from the zzso zzso and a zzso ORF, preceded by a possible zzso promoter, was found downstream from this zzso It is not known whether zzso is expressed only under zzso zzso However, potential zzso promoters were found immediately upstream from zzso zzso the 3' end of zzso and immediately downstream from zzso The region spanning zzso and zzso contained an A + zzso sequence that was also found immediately upstream from the potential zzso promoter of zzso The product of zzso appears to be required for the synthesis of zzso since cells of strain zzso zzso only zzso and zzso but not zzso when grown in the presence of zzso The product of zzso which is required for synthesis of zzso is not required for synthesis of either zzso or zzso However, growth data indicate that zzso is required for a factor (or zzso necessary for zzso zzso growth under zzso and zzso zzso
