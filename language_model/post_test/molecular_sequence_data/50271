The serum level of the fourth component of complement zzso in mice bearing zzso zzso is only zzso of that of zzso zzso zzso bearing mice, but not zzso bearing mice, have an zzso of the B2 sequence into zzso 13 of the C4 zzso and zzso C4 zzso in liver apparently generated by abnormal zzso zzso caused by the zzso of the B2 zzso To test the possible zzso relationship between the B2 zzso and low C4 production in zzso mice directly, we constructed the zzso C4 gene without the B2 zzso and the zzso zzso C4 gene with the B2 zzso by exchanging a part of zzso 13 between these two zzso zzso of the intact zzso C4 gene or the zzso zzso gene without the B2 zzso into zzso cells resulted in the production of only normal C4 zzso at the normal zzso On the other hand, the intact zzso C4 gene or the zzso zzso C4 gene with the B2 zzso directed production of both zzso and a decreased amount of normal C4 zzso These results demonstrated that the zzso of B2 sequence into zzso 13 of the C4 gene is the only zzso of low C4 production by zzso mice through zzso zzso zzso
