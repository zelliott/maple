Physical analysis of zzso I, the small zzso zzso which regulates the replication of zzso zzso zzso showed that it is a highly structured zzso containing an zzso paired stem closed by a zzso hairpin zzso zzso studies revealed that a zzso sequence in the hairpin loop is critical to the interaction between zzso I and its complementary target in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso interior loop in the upper stem was found to play an important role in zzso effective binding between zzso I and zzso zzso From these zzso a model describing the molecular mechanism of binding between zzso I and zzso II is zzso
