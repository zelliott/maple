zzso zzso and cell lineage relationships were examined in a large panel of zzso derived from a single mouse 21 days after a primary zzso with zzso Among 21 zzso zzso zzso 18 distinct cell lineages were zzso Ten of the zzso used the zzso gene which is the most frequently zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso Analysis of DNA sequence of the entire zzso region of these zzso revealed extensive zzso zzso The selection for certain zzso changes and the level of zzso observed is comparable to that observed in an early secondary zzso zzso An unexpected observation was that one-third of the zzso produced zzso zzso Two zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene contained extensive zzso in the zzso zzso These results indicate that once the zzso zzso process is zzso it zzso rapidly and continues for at least two weeks during the development of the zzso A highly zzso repertoire of memory B cells is formed by three weeks zzso that can be rapidly zzso to generate the secondary immune zzso
