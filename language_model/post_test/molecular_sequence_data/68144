The interactions of fatty acids with zzso and bovine zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso In the case of bovine zzso the apparent binding zzso for most of the saturated and zzso fatty acids were in the range of zzso M at neutral zzso zzso zzso displays only one high affinity binding site for zzso with an apparent zzso constant of 1 zzso zzso zzso The strength of the binding was decreasing in the following way: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids are not bound at zzso The affinity of zzso for zzso decreased as the pH of the incubation medium was lowered and zzso complex was not observed at zzso lower than zzso Surprisingly, chemically modified bovine zzso and zzso zzso did not bind fatty acids in the applied zzso
