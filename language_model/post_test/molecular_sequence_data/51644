A zzso zzso A chain gene was characterized as a 14 zzso zzso zzso sequence which encodes an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids in 15 zzso Overall, this A chain is similar to its zzso counterparts, especially in its zzso and zzso zzso zzso but the sequence that forms the zzso A short arm is quite different and zzso zzso messages appear in newly formed zzso and are later prominently expressed in zzso which also zzso basement membrane collagen zzso The composition of zzso basement zzso changes with zzso A novel method of zzso fused zzso zzso showed that zzso increases of zzso zzso were primarily associated with periods of zzso and preceded those of collagen IV, a protein strongly expressed during zzso The ratio of zzso zzso varied little during zzso with less zzso for A than B zzso zzso of zzso with zzso confirmed and extended the information provided by in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of this A chain, which occur in interacting regions of zzso zzso zzso and sex steroid binding zzso may be involved in protein zzso
