Construction of hybrid immunity genes between zzso U zzso and Y zzso immunity genes and zzso zzso of zzso were used to identify zzso zzso of the zzso Y immunity protein zzso involved in recognition of zzso zzso These zzso zzso were localized close to the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and T4 zzso zzso in zzso which converted zzso sequence to zzso sequence in positions 104, zzso zzso 112 and zzso resulted in an immunity gene that also zzso zzso immunity to zzso zzso a high degree of immunity to zzso zzso
