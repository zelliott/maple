zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from the zzso of two species of zzso the desert tortoise zzso zzso zzso and the Burmese python Python zzso zzso from the primitive zzso fish, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and from two zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of zzso zzso is identical to the proposed ancestral sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and python zzso differ by six and seven zzso respectively, from the ancestral sequence consistent with the traditional view that the zzso represent an earlier divergence from the primitive zzso stock than the zzso The current views of zzso zzso favor the hypothesis that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso arose from a common ancestral stock but their divergence is of a relatively ancient zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows only two zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso This result was unexpected as zzso zzso differs from zzso zzso deduced from the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by 10 zzso However, a zzso of an extract of zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso that differed in primary structure from zzso zzso by only one zzso acid zzso zzso This result suggests that the structure of zzso has been strongly zzso during the evolution of zzso and that at least two genes zzso zzso peptides are expressed in zzso zzso
