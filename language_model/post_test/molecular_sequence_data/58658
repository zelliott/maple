The synthesis of zzso is marred by several problems that contribute to the formation of defective zzso This in turn seriously limits the usefulness of such zzso in DNA zzso molecular zzso DNA structural analysis and in zzso zzso In particular, zzso reactions during the cyclical steps of synthesis lead to strand zzso during zzso of the completed molecules from the zzso Here we present a remedy to this problem: a novel zzso linkage that connects zzso to the support zzso reaction conditions that allow the removal of the zzso parts of any zzso zzso This ensures that all molecules that preserve the zzso protecting group when zzso from the support will have both correct zzso and zzso We demonstrate the application of the support for synthesis of padlock probe zzso
