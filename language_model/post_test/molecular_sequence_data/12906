zzso zzso found in zzso often result in the creation of hybrid genes zzso zzso zzso This case study describes a patient with zzso small round cell tumor zzso of the abdomen, an aggressive zzso characterized by zzso of zzso 11 and zzso Southern zzso showed that the Ewing zzso gene zzso gene was rearranged in the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of tumor cell zzso revealed that zzso 1 to 7 of the zzso gene were joined to zzso 8 to 10 of the zzso zzso zzso gene resulting in the production of a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso DNA and zzso binding proteins involved in zzso tumor and Ewing zzso zzso zzso The fusion of these two genes in zzso results in the production of a zzso zzso protein composed of the zinc finger DNA binding zzso of zzso linked to potential zzso regulatory zzso of zzso DNA sequencing revealed the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso 11 and zzso The zzso zzso on zzso 22 occurred in zzso zzso 7 just 2 zzso 3' of zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso were developed that could detect the fused genes in the zzso tumor using either zzso or zzso zzso The potential diagnostic use of these zzso is zzso
