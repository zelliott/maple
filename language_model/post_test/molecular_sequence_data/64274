zzso are zzso peptides isolated from bacterial sources that exhibit activity toward zzso organisms and are usually several orders of magnitude more potent than traditional antibiotics such as zzso They contain a number of unique structural features including zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso Introduced following zzso translation of the parent zzso these zzso render conventional methods of zzso analysis zzso We report zzso a new method using zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso gas, to reduce zzso side chains and zzso zzso zzso bridges found in zzso Using this approach, it is possible to identify and distinguish the original locations of zzso side chains and zzso bridges by traditional zzso sequencing zzso zzso followed by mass zzso The strategy was initially verified using zzso A, a structurally well characterized zzso and subsequently extended to the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso The primary structures of both zzso zzso peptides were then fully assigned by use of zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso zzso A1 has a specific zzso bridging pattern which resembles the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Also obtained by zzso were solution zzso of both zzso zzso zzso indicating that A1 may adopt a zzso similar to that of zzso and that the zzso zzso adopts zzso zzso These results are the first of their kind for a synergistic zzso pair zzso four such pairs have been reported to zzso
