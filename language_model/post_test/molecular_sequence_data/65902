zzso interference zzso has recently become a promising strategy for therapeutic of several viral diseases including those in the black tiger shrimp zzso zzso However, the protein components that play role in zzso in zzso zzso have not yet been zzso Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a zzso zzso zzso a principal constituent of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited the two signature zzso zzso and zzso zzso level of zzso expression could be suppressed by zzso zzso zzso that targeted zzso coding sequence in shrimp primary culture of zzso zzso The zzso depleted cells showed impaired zzso as the expression of an zzso gene was rescued from the zzso zzso in these zzso Our results imply that zzso is required for effective zzso in zzso zzso and thus identify the first protein constituent of zzso machinery in zzso zzso
