zzso zzso have been assigned for both the zzso and the zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso essential for bacterial zzso zzso zzso studies were performed using zzso zzso zzso samples of zzso In the case of zzso zzso one or more backbone atoms have been assigned for 334 zzso zzso The assigned backbone atoms include 309 zzso and zzso atoms zzso 315 zzso atoms zzso 331 zzso atoms zzso and 297 zzso atoms zzso For zzso zzso one or more backbone atoms have been assigned for 313 zzso zzso these include 283 zzso and zzso atoms zzso zzso zzso atoms zzso 310 zzso atoms zzso and zzso zzso atoms zzso The strategies used for obtaining resonance assignments are described in zzso Information on the secondary structure in solution for both the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso has been derived both from zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso values and from zzso zzso These data are compared to X-ray zzso structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso significant zzso changes in zzso both within the known zzso and zzso binding pockets and within regions known to undergo zzso changes upon zzso zzso The zzso data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso the same binding pocket and, zzso that the binding of zzso zzso structural changes in zzso Finally, many of the zzso within the zzso binding pocket were difficult to assign due to dynamic processes which weaken and/or broaden the respective zzso Overall, our results are consistent with zzso having a flexible active zzso
