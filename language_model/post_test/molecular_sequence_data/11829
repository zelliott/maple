zzso zzso are arrested at zzso replication zzso primarily, perhaps exclusively, by polar arrest of zzso DNA unwinding by the zzso zzso The mechanism of this arrest is of considerable zzso This paper presents experimental evidence in support of four major points pertaining to termination of DNA zzso First, the replication zzso proteins of both zzso coli and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso the proteins specifically impede the activities of zzso that are involved in zzso DNA replication but not of those involved in zzso DNA transfer and rolling circle zzso Second, the zzso protein zzso of zzso coli blocks not only zzso zzso but also authentic DNA zzso Third, the replication zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso is a polar zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso DNA unwinding was zzso by the passage of an zzso transcript through the replication zzso zzso zzso These results are significant because of their relevance to the zzso aspects of replication zzso
