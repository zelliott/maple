A number of nuclear zzso have been identified in a variety of zzso diseases including progressive external zzso zzso zzso syndrome and other zzso and zzso zzso zzso More than 50 zzso have been identified in zzso which encodes the human zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To rapidly characterize the effects of these zzso we have developed a versatile system that enables the consequences of zzso zzso introduced in zzso into the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso to be evaluated in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Overall, distinct zzso for expression of each of the zzso zzso were observed, including zzso cells with decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso elevated levels of zzso and nuclear DNA damage and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain caused the most severe zzso accompanied by loss of zzso and cell zzso whereas the zzso in the zzso domain showed mild dominance with loss of zzso Interestingly, the zzso region zzso caused elevated zzso and nuclear DNA zzso The cellular processes contributing to these observations in the zzso zzso cells are potentially relevant to understanding the zzso observed in human zzso disease zzso
