In addition to having a zzso zzso the zzso zzso also contains a zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigate the expression of zzso in zzso fins and the function of zzso in zzso zzso We find that zzso is present in the same population of dividing cells as zzso Unlike zzso dye zzso zzso suggest that zzso only zzso forms functional gap junction zzso However, zzso reveals that zzso can zzso with zzso in gap junction zzso and that the resulting plaques contain functional gap junction zzso Together, these data suggest the possibility that zzso may functionally interact with zzso to regulate cell proliferation in zzso
