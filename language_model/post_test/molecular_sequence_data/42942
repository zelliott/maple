The type I DNA modification zzso zzso binds sequence specifically to DNA and protects a zzso zzso containing its zzso recognition sequence from zzso by zzso zzso Using modified synthetic zzso duplexes we have investigated the zzso properties of the zzso and have established that a specific zzso on each strand of DNA is the site of zzso We show that the rate of zzso of each zzso is increased at least 100 fold by prior zzso at the other zzso However, this is accompanied by a significant decrease in the affinity of the zzso for these zzso according to competitive gel zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of an zzso in the recognition site which is not a target for the zzso results in only a small decrease in both DNA binding affinity and rate of zzso by the zzso
