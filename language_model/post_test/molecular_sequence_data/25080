The cold shock proteins zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso differ significantly in their zzso stability, although the two proteins differ by only 12 out of 67 zzso acid zzso The three-dimensional structure of these small and compact zzso proteins without zzso bonds, zzso zzso or tightly bound zzso is very zzso Previous work has shown that zzso displays a twofold increase in the free energy of stabilization relative to its zzso zzso and indicated that zzso interactions are, in part, responsible for this zzso It was further described that the stability difference is almost exclusively due to zzso charged zzso at sequence positions 3 and 66 of zzso and zzso whereas all other zzso acid changes between both proteins have no net effect on zzso To investigate how two surface zzso determine the stability of zzso zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso acid, corresponding to the zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined at zzso A and zzso A resolution, and refined to R values of zzso % and zzso zzso zzso Both structures closely resemble zzso in their global fold and show different hydrogen bonding and zzso patterns when two independent molecules in the zzso unit of the crystal are zzso To extend the study to zzso zzso that help determine the surface charge around zzso and zzso the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Their structures were determined at resolutions of zzso A, zzso A and zzso A and refined to R values of zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso A systematic comparison of the crystal structures of all forms of the zzso zzso cold shock protein shows varying patterns of hydrogen bonds and zzso interactions around zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso of the protein by zzso appears to correlate with the extent of an zzso surface patch near the zzso zzso zzso
