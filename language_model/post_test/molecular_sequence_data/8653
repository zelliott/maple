At low zzso strength, the zzso restriction zzso zzso at similar rates both zzso and linear DNA with two zzso sites and linear DNA with one zzso zzso For the zzso with two sites, the majority of the DNA was converted directly to products cut at both zzso the zzso appears to bind to two sites before catalyzing its zzso looping out the intervening zzso At high zzso strength, linear DNA with one zzso site was not cut at all, linear DNA with two sites was zzso slowly while zzso DNA with two sites was zzso zzso though only half of the DNA with two sites was cut at both zzso the DNA that had been cut at one site was not zzso again at the remaining zzso The zzso cut product must therefore have been generated by a reaction incorporating both zzso All DNA zzso reactions by zzso thus involve the zzso zzso bound to two copies of its recognition zzso but weakened zzso interactions at high zzso strength can cause this complex to zzso before zzso both zzso zzso interactions between distant DNA sites are generally thought to be enhanced by zzso and to be more stable than zzso zzso The preference of zzso at high zzso strength for zzso with two sites over zzso with one site and, in the former case, for zzso over linear DNA, zzso this zzso At low zzso strength, the similar rates with the different zzso may be due to zzso product zzso
