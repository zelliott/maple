zzso peptides corresponding to sequences contained within zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso bind the competitive zzso zzso zzso with relative high zzso Since the synthetic zzso fragments of the zzso and zzso each contain a small number of aromatic zzso intrinsic zzso studies were used to investigate their zzso We examined a number of zzso zzso fragments of increasing length zzso zzso zzso Changes in the zzso max and quantum yield with increasing zzso chain length suggest an increase in the zzso of the zzso zzso When selective zzso and zzso were used to reveal the zzso zzso of the zzso a significant red shift in zzso was observed and was found to be due to an zzso zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso zzso fragments resulted in a large increase in zzso In addition, at zzso the zzso max of zzso zzso was shifted to shorter zzso zzso zzso enhancement, which was zzso with either zzso or zzso was used to determine the zzso zzso for the zzso At pH zzso the apparent zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso for an zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso No binding or enhanced zzso was observed with an irrelevant synthetic zzso of comparable zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
