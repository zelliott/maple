The family zzso is the largest freshwater fish group in the world, including over 200 zzso and zzso zzso The zzso relationships of major zzso within this family are simply poorly zzso largely because of the overwhelming diversity of the zzso however, several investigators have advanced different hypotheses of relationships that zzso and zzso the use of zzso characters as advocated through zzso zzso As expected, most previous investigations used zzso zzso Recently, zzso DNA zzso sequences and combined zzso and zzso investigations have been used to explore and advance our understanding of species relationships and test zzso zzso zzso of these studies include limited zzso sampling and a strict reliance upon zzso inherited zzso zzso The present study is the first endeavor to recover the zzso relationships of the 12 previously recognized zzso zzso within the zzso using newly zzso nuclear DNA zzso for over 50 species representing members of the different previously hypothesized zzso and family groupings within the zzso and from other zzso families as zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships are constructed using maximum zzso and zzso analyses of zzso sites, of which zzso sites were variable and 790 were zzso zzso Using other appropriate zzso zzso of the families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso the zzso is resolved as a zzso zzso Within the family the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso representing many of the tropical zzso represent zzso members of the zzso All other species can be classified into zzso supported and resolved zzso zzso depending upon analysis, that are consistent with or zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso includes zzso traditionally aligned with the zzso zzso zzso previous zzso zzso studies by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso includes six other zzso that are mainly divided into three separate zzso The relationships among zzso and zzso are discussed as well as the possible origins of major zzso
