The structures of zzso from highly zzso zzso cancer cells and normal zzso zzso cells of 16 patients have been analyzed in fine detail zzso Y, zzso K, zzso zzso zzso Y, zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso zzso Comprehensive zzso Study of 16 zzso Cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso causes in zzso cancer zzso J zzso zzso zzso Further structural analyses demonstrated that colon cancer cells from two patients accumulated unusual zzso which were not observed in either zzso cancer cells or normal zzso zzso cells from the other zzso Mass zzso analyses revealed that the unusual structures include zzso zzso The structures of the zzso of the cancer cells from these two cases were analyzed by methods which include zzso release of zzso zzso fluorescent labeling with zzso and identification using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso together with zzso and the use of newly zzso zzso zzso as zzso The colon cancer cells from one of the patients demonstrate a variety of zzso as major components which are zzso at the zzso position of zzso zzso and at zzso positions of terminal zzso with or without zzso or zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso or zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso hybrid zzso The colon cancer cells from the other patient have two kinds of zzso zzso a zzso zzso structure and a zzso zzso structure, as minor zzso Taking into consideration the clinical features of the two patients, the biological significance of zzso zzso on cancer cells is zzso
