zzso is a commonly used zzso drug that zzso zzso a protein responsible for zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso is depleted from cellular zzso and replaced by toxic zzso zzso which causes increased membrane fluidity and drug zzso zzso and zzso cultures of zzso zzso responded similarly to zzso at zzso zzso showing reduced biomass formation, severely reduced zzso levels, and almost complete zzso of zzso zzso There was no evidence of cell zzso Mass zzso analysis of the zzso showed that its composition was strongly affected and included 17 zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso of zzso query walls relative to a reference standard mixture of zzso zzso and zzso walls in combination with zzso analysis revealed considerable zzso changes in the wall zzso as zzso They were, however, similar for both zzso and zzso zzso Two major trends zzso zzso decreased incorporation of zzso wall proteins zzso zzso and zzso consistent with zzso of zzso growth, and zzso increased incorporation of putative wall zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso As exposure to the zzso drug zzso red led to a similar response, these observations suggested that zzso affects the zzso In keeping with this, the resistance of zzso cells to zzso compounds zzso We propose that zzso affects the integrity of both the cellular zzso and the zzso wall and discuss its potential consequences for zzso zzso We also present candidate proteins from the zzso for clinical marker zzso
