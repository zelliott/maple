The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in zzso group I zzso in addition to zzso zzso Here, we compared the zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with that in zzso zzso zzso zzso by constructing three-dimensional models based on chemical modification and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding sites in the model structures revealed an extended three-dimensional overlap between the zzso and the group I zzso zzso zzso Our results provide insight into how an zzso factor can evolve from a cellular zzso zzso Further, the structural similarities between group I zzso and zzso are consistent with an evolutionary relationship and suggest a general mechanism for the evolution of complex zzso zzso
