The zzso zzso complex of mosquitoes contains some of the most important zzso of malaria in Southeast zzso To distinguish five species of the complex that occur in zzso a method using the zzso chain reaction zzso was zzso The method zzso zzso amplification to detect fixed differences between the species in the DNA sequence of the zzso DNA internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso were designed to amplify fragments of diagnostic length from the DNA of the different zzso The method was tested on 179 mosquitoes of the zzso zzso complex from many parts of Thailand and shown to be zzso Every zzso was zzso identified as species A, B, C, D or F zzso zzso zzso zzso species B, C, D or zzso zzso zzso by the zzso method, with confirmation of zzso identifications from zzso zzso zzso For the other three specimens zzso from zzso 5 zzso there was disagreement between the zzso and zzso methods of species identification (probably due to errors in the zzso zzso zzso can be combined in a single zzso reaction providing a zzso sensitive and straightforward method of species zzso Only small quantities of DNA are required, leaving most of the zzso to be used for other zzso
