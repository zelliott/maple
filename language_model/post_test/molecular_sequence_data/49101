zzso trap cloning was used to identify a zzso zzso zzso protein termed zzso zzso is the major zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus in human T zzso lacking zzso the first of three zzso zzso found in zzso but retaining zzso zzso a zzso domain and zzso coiled zzso zzso has zzso zzso acid identity to zzso a structurally related protein binding to the same highly zzso segment of the zzso tail and known to be involved in T cell zzso zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso does not zzso with zzso and binds zzso zzso if at zzso Moreover, zzso proteins are readily zzso by zzso zzso consistent with the presence of a zzso sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind to zzso segments within zzso themselves as evidenced by zzso accessibility analysis and protein interaction studies including zzso zzso This form of zzso regulation is not manifest by zzso zzso and zzso activities are zzso while the functions of zzso and zzso are also zzso Thus, zzso zzso signaling and cell zzso are regulated in a highly complex zzso
