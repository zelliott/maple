zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agents of Human African zzso zzso zzso in Africa, have evolved alternative mechanisms of resisting the activity of zzso zzso factors zzso components of innate immunity in human serum that protect against infection by other African zzso In zzso zzso activity is suppressed by the zzso zzso associated zzso zzso The mechanism in zzso is less well understood but has been hypothesized to involve altered activity and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to facilitate zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso species complex that is susceptible to human zzso By evaluating the genetic zzso of zzso in a comprehensive geographical and zzso context, we show that a single substitution that replaces zzso with zzso at position 210 is zzso in the most widespread form of zzso zzso group 1) and not found in related zzso which are either human serum susceptible zzso or known to resist zzso via an alternative mechanism zzso and zzso group zzso We zzso that this single substitution contributes to reduced zzso of zzso and thus may play a key role in zzso serum resistance to zzso group zzso In contrast, similarity in zzso sequence among zzso of zzso group 2 and zzso provides further evidence that human serum resistance in zzso group 2 is likely independent of zzso zzso
