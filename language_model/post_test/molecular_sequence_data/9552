zzso populations are becoming increasingly difficult to control in cropping zzso Two zzso zzso zzso populations were identified during a random crop survey after zzso were zzso The study aimed to determine the zzso resistance profile of these zzso zzso zzso to a range of zzso used for their zzso 

Based on zzso studies, one zzso zzso population was very highly resistant to zzso and zzso (both zzso zzso and also displayed low-level resistance to zzso (an zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of the ALS zzso was identified with in zzso activity zzso Gene sequence analysis revealed a zzso substitution at zzso acid position 197 of zzso which is likely to be the molecular basis for resistance in this zzso zzso screening also revealed a different zzso zzso population with resistance to the zzso zzso zzso 

This study established the first cases of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance in a zzso species in Western zzso
