The zzso and gene expression induced by zzso drugs with different mechanisms of action was tested in clones from a human zzso cancer cell line expressing no zzso zzso zzso or wild type zzso zzso 

We used clones from zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso zzso which expresses zzso zzso at 37 degrees C and a wild zzso zzso at 32 degrees zzso zzso and expression of zzso genes zzso and zzso were tested after 24 hours of treatment with different zzso 

All of the drugs were equally active in the different systems, independently of the presence of zzso with the exception of zzso which was less zzso in cells expressing a zzso An increase in the zzso of zzso and zzso genes was found in cells expressing zzso and treated with the zzso zzso and zzso expression was also found in cells not expressing zzso but treated with the drugs, suggesting that these genes can also be activated by DNA damage through a zzso independent of zzso A highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes a very small number of DNA zzso does not increase the expression of these zzso zzso D1 gene expression was not changed after treatment with the drugs tested in cells both expressing and not expressing zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso expression does not play a role in increasing the zzso of cells not undergoing zzso after DNA damage, but that, at least in the case of zzso it can enhance the repair systems and reduce the zzso
