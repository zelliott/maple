The effects of zzso zzso and zzso on rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression have been examined by zzso analysis and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso followed by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of kidney zzso zzso revealed that zzso treatment produced a zzso increase in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, with zzso and zzso zzso levels zzso increased at 24 and 18 zzso respectively, after zzso These data were confirmed via zzso analysis using a zzso level of zzso template and by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso This approach served as the foundation for examining the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels after treatment with zzso zzso zzso for 3 consecutive zzso revealed that zzso zzso levels were zzso elevated approximately zzso after zzso treatment for 2 consecutive days, whereas zzso zzso levels were zzso elevated approximately zzso at 24 zzso after zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso which served as an internal control, remained constant after zzso or zzso zzso These results show that expression of zzso and zzso zzso is enhanced in zzso tissue after exposure to zzso or zzso and that zzso expression of zzso seems to be greater than that of zzso in zzso zzso
