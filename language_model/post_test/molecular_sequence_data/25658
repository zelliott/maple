The preparation and zzso characterization of duplex zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso Three duplex zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared by zzso zzso synthesis utilizing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso building blocks zzso et zzso zzso Taylor & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 202 zzso zzso zzso were obtained in zzso zzso at 10 degrees C, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained in zzso zzso at 10 degrees zzso zzso zzso assignments for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were made on the basis of standard sequential zzso assignment strategies and verified in part by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the chemical shift data suggests that the zzso structure is zzso more to the zzso of the zzso zzso and more to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso parameters for the zzso in equilibrium zzso equilibrium were obtained by zzso all or none, analysis of the melting behavior of the zzso Analysis of the temperature dependence of the zzso zzso zzso signal gave delta H zzso 44 zzso 4 zzso and delta S zzso 132 zzso 13 zzso for the zzso zzso Analysis of the concentration and temperature dependence of zzso zzso gave delta H zzso 64 zzso 6 zzso and delta S zzso 178 zzso 18 zzso for the parent duplex and delta H zzso 66 zzso 7 zzso and delta S zzso 189 zzso 19 zzso for zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso of the zzso unit to give the zzso product causes little zzso of the DNA whereas zzso to give the zzso product causes much greater zzso possibly in the form of a zzso or dislocation at the zzso of the zzso
