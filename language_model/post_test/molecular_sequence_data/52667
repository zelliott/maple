zzso a zzso protein that comprises 10 tandem zzso repeat zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso protein and acts as a zzso zzso In this report we identify point zzso in the zzso of zzso that disrupt zzso zzso Furthermore, we construct a zzso model of the zzso domain of zzso which is responsible for zzso zzso based on the known structure of protein zzso zzso According to this model all selected zzso reduce the ability of zzso to interact with zzso by affecting the structural integrity of zzso and/or the correct spatial arrangement of zzso relative to zzso and zzso
