The zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factor that is implicated in regulating the expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells and in lens during embryonic development, but exhibits a zzso pattern of expression in the zzso To understand regulation of zzso expression and to investigate its possible involvement in zzso we have determined the complete sequence of the human zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso repeat zzso to zzso within the zzso zzso and refined its location by linkage zzso Since a locus for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked to markers at zzso and since zzso in zzso can lead to zzso we zzso zzso zzso products of the zzso gene and of the zzso response element from a panel of patients representing independent families with inherited retinal zzso The analysis did not reveal any zzso zzso in this group of zzso These investigations provide the basis for zzso the DNA sequence elements that regulate zzso expression in distinct zzso cell types and should assist in the analysis of zzso as a candidate gene for inherited zzso affecting visual zzso
