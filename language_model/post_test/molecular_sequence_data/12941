We have investigated the protein zzso responsible for the correct zzso targeting of plant seed zzso We have attempted to study this targeting in zzso using zzso zzso in transgenic zzso Different zzso were prepared lacking gene sequences zzso one of three structural zzso of natural zzso Each was fused in frame to the zzso coli zzso A gene zzso zzso zzso These zzso were introduced into zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso activity was measured in washed oil bodies and in the soluble protein fraction of the transgenic zzso It was found that complete zzso zzso zzso undergo correct zzso targeting in transgenic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso the last 48 zzso acids had no effect on overall zzso zzso In contrast, loss of the first 47 zzso acids (N zzso or zzso acids 48 to 113 (which make up a zzso zzso resulted in impaired targeting of the fusion protein to the oil bodies and greatly reduced zzso of the fusion zzso Northern zzso revealed that this reduction is not due to differences in zzso zzso zzso from these zzso indicated that both the zzso and central zzso domain are important for targeting to the oil body and show that there is a direct correlation between the inability to target to the oil body and protein zzso
