zzso human zzso A expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells was zzso to zzso by a zzso procedure using part of zzso A zzso as affinity zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso identified the mature form of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso A with zzso F and H resulted in a decrease in its molecular mass from 39 zzso to approximately 37 zzso confirming that zzso A is zzso The kinetic properties were analyzed by using two zzso synthetic zzso zzso yellow zzso and zzso yellow zzso The zzso values obtained were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso study using a zzso zzso zzso library confirmed the preference of zzso A for zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso zzso positions, zzso and zzso appeared less restricted in distribution of zzso zzso A pH optimum between zzso and zzso at room temperature was zzso The zzso zzso was fully active for more than 10 h at pH zzso and zzso while a zzso of 4 h was determined at pH zzso and 37 degrees zzso
