We have cloned and characterized the zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein contains seven blocks of zzso including the zzso that are zzso in the zzso proteins of other insects, zzso with (usually zzso sequences unique to each zzso There is no similarity between zzso zzso of 3' untranslated sequence in zzso and zzso We examined zzso protein expression in zzso using an zzso raised against a zzso fusion protein and zzso its expression in zzso using several different zzso Early patterns of expression in the two insects are quite different, reflecting differing modes of early zzso However, by the zzso stage, expression patterns are quite similar, with relatively uniform zzso expression throughout the zzso and abdominal segments which later zzso to the zzso zzso is observed in muscle zzso the peripheral nervous system, and the central nervous system zzso In the zzso expression is initially limited to a few zzso but eventually becomes zzso Both insects show strong expression in certain zzso identified zzso and similar zzso zzso of zzso
