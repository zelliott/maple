The isolation and sequencing of a zzso clone for the entire sequence of pig zzso zzso protein zzso are zzso zzso the size of zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso The zzso region of 146 zzso is extremely rich in zzso zzso whereas the zzso region of 380 zzso is rich in AT zzso The open reading frame encodes 209 zzso zzso which contain a unique continuous run of 23 zzso zzso acids at the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is zzso zzso to that of zzso protein from the same source which we reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso In addition, the zzso index profiles of both proteins are very similar, supporting that they have similar structural zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso reveals that a zzso zzso codes for zzso zzso Southern analysis suggests that the zzso coding gene is homogeneous within the pig zzso zzso
