The zzso role of the inwardly zzso zzso channel, zzso is poorly zzso as is the molecular identity of many zzso zzso zzso In this study we have used zzso zzso to reveal abundant expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, where zzso is also zzso Moreover, we also show that zzso zzso channel activity is extremely sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso and that this novel property is zzso predominantly by the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso channels are likely to exist in zzso and zzso an important and novel functional role for the zzso zzso
