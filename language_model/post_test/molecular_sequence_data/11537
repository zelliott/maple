We have identified and mapped 61 novel and previously described zzso 17 and X zzso using a human zzso zzso zzso These genes were isolated using a gene identification and mapping strategy based on zzso probing of arrayed zzso specific zzso and zzso zzso This strategy scans zzso zzso for nuclear genes and zzso the expressed sequence by a zzso to zzso filter zzso Inherent to this approach is the advantage of identifying the corresponding zzso zzso clone of a particular zzso The zzso and zzso zzso can be used for zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso based mapping to resolve map positions of zzso belonging to gene families and those associated with multiple zzso The downstream utility of zzso generated by the zzso probing methods is demonstrated in our zzso
