A protein showing strong zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso juice of zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of this protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of the protein was determined and zzso was cloned based on the zzso acid zzso A zzso search of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso showed zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso so the protein was designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso gene expression showed that this gene is expressed in the zzso but not in other zzso In addition, zzso gene was shown to not be expressed in the zzso and wandering zzso indicating that the gene is zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso an insect zzso zzso can be a potential zzso factor against zzso at the initial site of viral zzso
