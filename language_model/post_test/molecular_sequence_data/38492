A zzso clone from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence encodes a zzso zzso acid protein with a putative signal zzso of 23 zzso acids resulting in a mature protein with a predicted mass of zzso Da and a zzso of zzso This protein has internal sequence similarity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating a zzso zzso The four zzso exhibit high identity to zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso The gene is single copy in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso strain and was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso Several zzso were zzso The sequence zzso the mature protein was amplified by zzso cloned into the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso generated against the zzso protein was used in zzso zzso and two bands of 38 and 42 zzso were detected in a whole zzso zzso The zzso protein showed zzso activity, one of the two potential zzso We discuss the possible roles that zzso zzso zzso may play in the survival of the zzso in the zzso
