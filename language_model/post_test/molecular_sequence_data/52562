We have cloned a new zzso zzso zzso channel zzso from embryonic chick skeletal muscle, which is tentatively named as chick zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso encodes a protein with 402 zzso zzso zzso study of the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso showed that 10 zzso zzso induced a fast inward current followed by rapid and long lasting zzso in medium containing zzso zzso zzso In medium with zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso response as zzso a slower inward current succeeded the initial fast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were potent zzso whereas zzso was a very weak zzso zzso currents were blocked by 100 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso chain reaction showed that zzso zzso transcripts were mainly expressed in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart of Day 10 chick zzso A moderate level of expression was also detected in gizzard and zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso transcripts were expressed mainly in zzso zzso and stomach in Day 3 zzso In Day 4 and Day 6 zzso the zzso zzso transcripts were highly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso role of this zzso in the establishment of the skeletal muscle zzso will be zzso
