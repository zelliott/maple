zzso coli grew in a minimal medium on zzso as the sole carbon and energy zzso zzso a lag phase of zzso days was zzso zzso adapted to zzso still required 1-2 days before growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso into zzso revealed by zzso that zzso was oxidized to zzso without zzso of the carbon skeleton and excluded pathways in which the zzso group was zzso converted to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells contained a specific zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso with zzso most probably to zzso The zzso was zzso and identified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso gel zzso the formation of a second zzso zzso with sequence similarities to zzso zzso was zzso The genes of both zzso were located in a putative zzso with high identities (at least zzso on the protein zzso with the very recently discovered zzso zzso from zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso coli zzso zzso to zzso via the zzso cycle known from zzso The zzso patterns of zzso and zzso are consistent with the further zzso of zzso to zzso zzso is predominantly generated via the zzso cycle rather than by zzso of zzso
