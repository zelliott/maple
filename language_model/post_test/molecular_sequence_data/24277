zzso was identified recently as a zzso zzso C zzso containing zzso zzso zzso Y, and zzso common to all zzso zzso as well as unique zzso and zzso zzso Novel regulation of this zzso zzso by the Ras zzso and zzso zzso of zzso G proteins was zzso zzso analyses of zzso revealed previously zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The known interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of other proteins led us to examine the capacity of zzso to activate zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso cells resulted in marked stimulation of zzso C zzso zzso and zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso or zzso also activated zzso to levels similar to those observed with zzso zzso of these zzso zzso in combination with the same zzso was less active, and zzso zzso were essentially zzso zzso zzso of zzso was blocked by zzso with either of two zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso of G protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso Similarly, zzso of Ras in the action of zzso is unlikely, because a zzso in the second zzso domain of zzso that blocks Ras zzso of zzso failed to alter the zzso activity of zzso Taken together, these results reveal the presence of additional functional zzso in zzso and add a new level of complexity in the regulation of this novel zzso by zzso G zzso
