zzso with Human zzso zzso zzso type I zzso have been associated with the development of the zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso have revealed that zzso can be classified into three major groups: the zzso Central African and zzso In the present study, we analyzed the tax, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences of zzso of zzso from ten zzso patients to investigate the zzso characterization of zzso in Chilean zzso zzso zzso in zzso from ten Chilean patients with zzso were amplified by zzso using zzso of tax, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products of the five genes were zzso and zzso sequence was determined by the zzso termination zzso DNA sequences were aligned with the zzso W zzso The results of this study showed that the tax, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene of the Chilean zzso strains had a zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso 95 to zzso zzso to zzso 94 to zzso and zzso to zzso respect to zzso zzso zzso According to molecular zzso with zzso zzso zzso the Chilean zzso strains were grouped with each other suggesting one cluster included in zzso zzso
