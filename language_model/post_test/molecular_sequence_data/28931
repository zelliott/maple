Here we describe the expression pattern of a previously unknown mouse gene zzso The isolated zzso codes for an zzso zzso factor of 237 zzso acids in zzso which is localized to the zzso zzso is a member of the winged zzso zzso factor gene family like its rat zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso The start zzso of zzso and the size of the predicted protein are identical to the human zzso The zzso protein is clearly smaller since it lacks the first 103 zzso zzso acids of rat zzso zzso 1 is expressed in central zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso from E11 on until zzso In these regions zzso expression zzso precisely with the zzso zzso zzso it initially zzso Interestingly, zzso was not found in zzso zzso expressing zzso
