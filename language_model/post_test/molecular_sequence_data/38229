zzso exchanges constitute a significant means by which zzso acquire novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso occupy a particular zzso the dairy factory environment, where their populations are subjected to constant zzso Little is known about the mechanisms of evolution that lead to the genetic diversity of zzso zzso In this study, we described two DNA exchanges involving the zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso species, and its zzso zzso zzso They occurred by zzso zzso with zzso sequences present in the host zzso Both zzso generated by these zzso events are insensitive to the zzso resistance mechanism zzso and one has a reduced burst size as well as a new origin of zzso We propose that this type of DNA exchange with zzso or remnants of zzso occurs frequently within the zzso species as supported by zzso comparisons between zzso zzso
