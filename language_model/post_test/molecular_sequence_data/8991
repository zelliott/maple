DNA packaging by zzso DNA zzso and zzso is driven by a powerful molecular machine assembled at the portal zzso of the empty zzso The zzso T4 packaging machine consists of three zzso zzso portal zzso zzso large zzso motor zzso and zzso or zzso small zzso zzso These components zzso interact and orchestrate a complex series of reactions to produce a zzso head containing one viral zzso per zzso Here, we analyzed the interactions between the portal and motor proteins using a direct binding zzso zzso and structural zzso Our results show that a portal binding site is located in the zzso zzso zzso II of zzso zzso at key zzso of this site lead to zzso or zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso that is part of this site interacts with the zzso A zzso zzso zzso competes with zzso for portal binding and blocks DNA zzso The zzso apparently provide specificity to capture the zzso zzso whereas the loop zzso communicate the portal interaction to the zzso zzso These observations lead to a hypothesis in which a unique zzso interaction in the zzso mismatched complex acts as a lever to position the zzso finger and trigger zzso zzso zzso connecting the critical parts of the zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso interactions might ensure tight zzso between zzso zzso and DNA zzso
