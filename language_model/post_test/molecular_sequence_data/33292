The human zzso zzso open reading frame zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is closely associated with the zzso and was recently shown to have zzso zzso activity zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gibson, zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we examined the zzso specificity of this zzso zzso and replication characteristics of an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso (1 to zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 2005), efficiently released zzso but not zzso modifications from a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso abolished this zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso showing more activity toward zzso zzso The zzso activity of the full-length zzso protein zzso from zzso cells also showed a better zzso of zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso virus in which the zzso zzso activity was destroyed zzso produced zzso less progeny virus and reduced amounts of viral proteins compared to zzso virus at a low zzso of zzso The zzso virus also produced zzso less overall zzso than the zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso contains both a zzso zzso zzso activity and an zzso activity that favors zzso zzso linkages and that these activities can influence virus replication in cultured zzso
