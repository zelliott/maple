zzso type C zzso zzso infection is initiated by virus envelope binding to a membrane zzso expressed on mouse zzso We have identified a zzso clone that may zzso for this zzso through a strategy combining gene transfer of mouse zzso zzso DNA into zzso human zzso cells, selection of zzso clones that have acquired zzso to infection by zzso zzso containing drug resistance zzso and identification of the putative zzso zzso clone through linkage to a mouse repetitive DNA zzso Human zzso cells that express the zzso acquire a zzso increase in zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso protein is extremely zzso 14 potential zzso zzso have been zzso A computer-based search of sequence data banks did not identify a protein with significant similarity to the putative zzso We conclude that a novel membrane protein determines zzso to zzso zzso infection by binding and/or fusion with the virus zzso
