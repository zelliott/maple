The zzso protein zzso contains a zzso surface that interacts specifically with zzso promoter elements and a convex surface that mediates zzso interactions with general and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that interactions between zzso proteins and zzso are important in stimulating zzso by the zzso zzso II zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso we implemented a genetic strategy in zzso zzso that involved the use of a zzso zzso with altered specificity for zzso zzso By genetically screening a set of zzso zzso libraries that were biased to the convex surface that mediates zzso zzso we identified zzso derivatives that are impaired in the response to three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but appear normal for zzso zzso II zzso A genetic zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso reflect specific functional properties of the zzso derivatives rather than an indirect effect on zzso Surprisingly, three of the four zzso zzso affect zzso that directly contact zzso Moreover, all four zzso are defective for zzso element zzso but they interact normally with an zzso zzso domain and zzso In addition, we show that a subset of zzso derivatives with zzso on the zzso surface of zzso are also compromised in their responses to zzso zzso in zzso These observations suggest that interactions at the zzso element interface can specifically affect the response to zzso zzso proteins in zzso
