A novel growth factor for bone zzso derived zzso zzso type mast cells has been isolated from the zzso medium of the zzso mouse zzso cell line zzso In proliferation zzso this growth factor zzso like zzso with zzso on established mast cell lines and was therefore termed zzso mast cell growth enhancing zzso zzso was characterized as a zzso with a Mr range between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was obtained by using a zzso zzso scheme including zzso exchange zzso zzso red affinity zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso as zzso was zzso blocked during automated zzso zzso fragments after zzso with zzso were used for partial zzso acid sequence zzso All zzso zzso zzso fragments showed complete sequence zzso to a recently zzso and cloned novel T cell growth factor zzso zzso the mouse zzso of human zzso
