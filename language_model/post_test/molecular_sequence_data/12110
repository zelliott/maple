A zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso has been zzso and produced in zzso zzso Complete sequential zzso and zzso resonance assignments for the zzso domain have been obtained by using zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of four strands each were identified from characteristic zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso The zzso zzso is found in a zzso turn connecting two zzso The secondary structure of the zzso domain very much resembles the secondary solution structure of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, despite the sequence identity of zzso A detailed comparison of the zzso parameters of both zzso zzso zzso chemical shifts, zzso rates, zzso and zzso alpha values suggests a high structural similarity in solution between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso calculations confirm that these zzso zzso have very similar overall zzso The observed specificity of the zzso acid zzso components of both complexes for these zzso zzso is discussed in this zzso
