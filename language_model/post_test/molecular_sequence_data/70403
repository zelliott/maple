zzso zzso and zzso external zzso of bovine zzso zzso major zzso zzso protein have been identified using zzso particles and synthetic zzso zzso to disrupted zzso recognized zzso and zzso particles in immune electron zzso zzso studies and inhibited zzso focus formation of zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso occur on the surface of zzso The zzso protein appeared to be zzso as the zzso reacted with three dominant zzso zzso B cell zzso zzso acids 111 to zzso 131 to 145 and 191 to zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas no common zzso and less frequent zzso binding to peptides were detected in zzso of the zzso protein of zzso Four discrete variable regions were identified in the sequences of zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso against synthetic peptides corresponding to three of the four variable regions zzso acids 42 to 56, 435 to 449 and zzso to zzso of zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso but not of zzso particles as examined by zzso and zzso to one zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso inhibited zzso focus formation of zzso zzso These data suggest that these regions are zzso zzso zzso zzso and that they occur on the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso remain to be identified on zzso the linear zzso identified in this study may be worthy of further study as constituents of experimental zzso zzso
