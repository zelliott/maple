zzso carrier membrane proteins zzso are ubiquitous components of recycling zzso that shuttle between the plasma zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso contain multiple zzso zzso repeats and four highly zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats often interact with zzso domain proteins that function in budding of transport zzso from the plasma membrane or the zzso zzso We now show that the zzso repeats of zzso bind to two zzso domain zzso zzso 1, which is involved in zzso budding at the plasma zzso and zzso which may mediate the budding of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso lacking the zzso zzso repeats zzso inhibited zzso zzso by zzso Our data suggest that one of the functions of zzso is to participate in zzso via a mechanism which may involve the recruitment of zzso coats to the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso
