We have extended previous comparisons of genetic organization between zzso zzso by sequencing a zzso zzso zzso from isolate zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso is located in the central region of the zzso zzso and contains three complete and two incomplete open reading frames zzso One of the complete zzso is a gene for zzso zzso zzso This zzso with one of the other two complete zzso and both the incomplete zzso are zzso to four zzso zzso from the central region of zzso virus zzso zzso They also match four zzso of zzso virus zzso DNA, three of which are zzso and the fourth, the zzso zzso zzso is located elsewhere on the zzso zzso The third complete zzso of the zzso DNA zzso is located between the zzso gene and the zzso zzso of the zzso immediately downstream of the zzso zzso zzso We show that a zzso to this third zzso is absent from zzso and zzso zzso but is present downstream of the zzso gene on zzso zzso virus zzso The sequence immediately upstream of the zzso zzso of a zzso late gene contains a motif which is required for zzso late gene zzso The motif required for zzso early gene zzso termination is present in eight positions in the zzso zzso and five of these positions are consistent with the motif having an equivalent function in zzso to that in zzso
