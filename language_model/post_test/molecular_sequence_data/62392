A zzso sequence zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso is zzso zzso coding a zzso zzso Two partial zzso fragments covering the open reading frame of zzso were cloned by zzso The fragments zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contain three zzso and two zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the predicted zzso have eight and seven zzso zzso separated by a central zzso zzso zzso alignment revealed that the predicted protein was zzso to zzso zzso of zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that zzso is zzso by a small zzso family in the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts were predominantly expressed in zzso and zzso but were low in leaves, zzso zzso and young roots, and none was detected in zzso Treatment with zzso reduced the expression of zzso in zzso zzso leaves and zzso In addition, the expression levels in zzso and zzso share an inverse relationship with the zzso of zzso In zzso and zzso treatment with zzso at 10 and 100 zzso reduced the expression levels of zzso and 1000 zzso zzso it to the lowest level, but 500 zzso zzso had little zzso The expressions of zzso in different zzso were not appreciably affected by heat zzso It is suggested that zzso might be involved in the transport or availability of zzso and zzso to some zzso zzso or zzso zzso
