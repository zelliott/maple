We have investigated the relationships between the zzso sorting mechanism using zzso zzso and the soluble zzso zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso machinery, which is involved in membrane zzso and zzso We first confirmed that zzso zzso inhibit the zzso zzso in zzso zzso canine kidney zzso zzso in addition, we report that a zzso zzso protein stimulates the zzso transport whereas a zzso zzso zzso this transport zzso Based on zzso zzso experiments and the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso have been implicated in zzso membrane zzso Here, we show in zzso zzso cells that zzso 3 and zzso zzso lower surface delivery of an zzso reporter zzso Moreover, using a similar approach, we show that zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso also called zzso a recently described zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, we show the presence of zzso 3 and zzso in isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso sorting has been zzso to be zzso by the zzso of zzso proteins into dynamic zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso 3 and zzso are zzso These data support a zzso mechanism for the sorting of not only zzso destined cargo but also of zzso having functions in zzso zzso and fusion zzso
