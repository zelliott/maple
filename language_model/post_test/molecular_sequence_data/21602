The stringent response zzso enables bacteria to adapt to zzso limitation through production of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso collectively known as zzso Two zzso are responsible for the zzso pools of zzso zzso acts as a zzso while zzso can function as either a zzso or a zzso We investigated how the zzso affects the ability of the biological control agent zzso zzso strain zzso to inhibit the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were generated and found to exhibit increased zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso that is essential for zzso zzso LP production and zzso activity were both elevated in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso in trans restored the zzso zzso to that of the zzso Next, we investigated whether an association exists between the zzso and known regulators of zzso including the zzso system and zzso A zzso zzso of strain zzso produced less zzso and exhibited a zzso decrease in zzso expression compared to the wild type, suggesting that zzso forms part of the zzso zzso We discovered that zzso zzso was reduced significantly in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso provided in trans restored zzso activity to zzso levels but did not zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression was decreased in the zzso indicating that the zzso is required for maximum expression of zzso
