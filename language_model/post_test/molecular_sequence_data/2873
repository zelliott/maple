The binding of zzso to a series of zzso operators containing zzso of the right operator of zzso zzso was zzso Sites zzso and/or zzso were zzso by either point or deletion zzso The free energy of binding zzso to zzso in the zzso operator, delta zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso determined for an zzso operator created by a single point zzso in zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, delta zzso for the binding of zzso to a cloned synthetic zzso operator containing only 24 zzso of zzso sequence is zzso zzso zzso zzso When sequence zzso to zzso is present, the binding affinity increases to zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the proximity of zzso to a zzso decreases delta zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the DNA sequence outside the 17 zzso zzso zzso contributes to the specific binding of zzso
