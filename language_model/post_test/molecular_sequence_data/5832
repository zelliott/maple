The zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso New Jersey zzso and Indiana zzso contains a highly zzso zzso domain which is required for binding to the zzso zzso template as well as to form a soluble complex with the zzso protein N in zzso We have shown that the deletion of 11 zzso acids from the C terminal end of the zzso protein zzso both the template binding and the complex forming activity with the N zzso Within this region, there are zzso basic zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso that are potential candidates for such zzso We have generated zzso P proteins by substitution of these basic zzso acid zzso with zzso and studied their role in both zzso and zzso We have found that the zzso zzso failed to bind to the zzso template, whereas the zzso zzso bound efficiently as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso as expected, was unable to support zzso synthesis in zzso in a zzso zzso reaction as well as zzso in zzso of a zzso using a reverse genetic zzso However, the zzso zzso supported low level of zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso suggesting that direct template binding of P protein through the zzso domain is necessary but not sufficient for optimal zzso Using a zzso system we have also shown that both zzso and zzso zzso interact zzso with the L zzso suggesting further that the two point zzso display differential zzso with respect to binding to the zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso zzso were shown to interact efficiently with the N protein in zzso indicating that these zzso form zzso complexes which are presumably required for zzso This contention is further supported by the demonstration that these zzso support efficient replication of a zzso zzso in zzso Since the zzso defective P zzso can support efficient zzso we propose that the zzso and the zzso are composed of two distinct complexes containing zzso and zzso zzso
