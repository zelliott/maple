zzso coli zzso zzso electrons from zzso zzso to zzso target zzso zzso is composed of an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso domain, connected by a central zzso zzso Each domain possesses two zzso zzso essential for electron zzso The transport proceeds via zzso exchange reactions from zzso zzso to the central zzso domain and via zzso to zzso which then reduces the zzso target zzso We determined four high-resolution structures of zzso oxidized zzso A zzso chemically reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemically reduced at pH increased from zzso to zzso The latter structure was refined at zzso A resolution, the highest achieved so far for a zzso zzso zzso The data reveal unprecedented structural details of zzso demonstrating that the domain is very rigid and zzso hardly any zzso change upon zzso reduction or interaction with zzso In full agreement with the zzso results, zzso zzso unfolding and zzso experiments indicate that oxidized and reduced zzso are equally zzso We confirmed the structural rigidity of zzso by molecular dynamics zzso A remarkable feature of zzso is the zzso of zzso for the active site zzso this value, determined using two different experimental methods, surprisingly was around zzso units higher than expected on the basis of the zzso zzso Additionally, taking advantage of the very high quality of the zzso structures, we carried out zzso calculations, which gave results in agreement with the experimental zzso In conclusion, our zzso analysis of zzso encompassing zzso zzso zzso chemistry and zzso zzso highlighted two so far zzso key aspects of this zzso its unusual zzso properties and extreme zzso Both are likely to be correlated to the role of zzso as a zzso linked electron shuttle between the membrane domain and the zzso zzso domain of zzso
