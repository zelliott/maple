Packaging of zzso DNA into zzso zzso is driven by one of the most powerful zzso zzso reported to zzso The zzso T4 motor is constituted by gene product 16 zzso (18 zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso large zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence alignments revealed that numerous zzso and viral large zzso zzso a common zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso motif consists of a highly zzso zzso zzso preceded by four zzso zzso zzso which are predicted to form a zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso that compromised zzso or integrity of the zzso resulted in a zzso zzso whereas certain changes in zzso resulted in zzso zzso No zzso including a highly conservative zzso are tolerated at the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso showed no zzso in zzso DNA packaging zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins exhibited defective zzso binding and very low or no zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is, however, zzso albeit at a greatly reduced zzso These data define the zzso zzso center in zzso and show for the first time that subtle defects in the zzso complex formation at this center lead to a profound loss of zzso DNA zzso
