The steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso discs to form adult zzso in zzso We have isolated a set of six zzso genes that apparently zzso disc zzso or zzso zzso zzso from one of these zzso zzso accumulate rapidly within 1-2 h in response to zzso zzso zzso transcripts reach maximum levels during the first stages of metamorphosis zzso zzso zzso and are primarily limited to zzso zzso zzso are also present during zzso zzso h and zzso zzso Two zzso transcripts zzso and zzso zzso result from differential zzso with the larger transcript zzso in zzso The conceptual zzso protein contains a signal zzso an zzso zzso and a potential zzso zzso We speculate that the protein provides a transient cue important for zzso disc zzso
