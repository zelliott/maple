zzso surfaces of several organ systems are important zzso for host defense against zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso peptides contribute to the defense of these zzso zzso are one family of zzso zzso but their known distribution in humans has been limited to four members found in cells of zzso zzso We sought to determine if the human zzso family was more zzso We found that the family of human zzso is diverse and is not restricted to expression in zzso Southern zzso and zzso clone analyses reveal that numerous zzso sequences are present in the human zzso A gene for a new human zzso family member was zzso This zzso designated human zzso is highly expressed in zzso cells of the small zzso This is the first example of an zzso zzso gene expressed in an zzso cell in zzso The data support the hypotheses that zzso zzso zzso the human small zzso with a previously zzso defensive capability which would augment other zzso zzso
