zzso protein synthesis in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with an zzso resulting in zzso zzso of all nascent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the subsequent removal of the zzso zzso group from the majority of bacterial zzso Until recently, zzso has been thought as an zzso unique to the bacterial zzso zzso of the zzso DNA databases identified several genes that zzso proteins of high sequence zzso to bacterial zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso active in zzso zzso zzso shares many of the properties of bacterial zzso and is inhibited by specific zzso zzso Western zzso analysis indicated expression of mature zzso in zzso zzso and zzso stages of zzso zzso These results provide strong evidence that a functional zzso is present in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
