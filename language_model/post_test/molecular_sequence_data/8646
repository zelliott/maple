zzso of pulmonary zzso cells is characteristic of zzso lung zzso During recovery from zzso pulmonary zzso cells zzso to zzso the vascular zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso growth factor that is zzso specifically for zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso increases during recovery from acute zzso lung zzso Adult rabbits were exposed to zzso oxygen for 64 h and allowed to recover in air for 0, 1, 3, and 5 zzso In zzso zzso showed increased zzso expression in zzso zzso cells beginning at 1 day zzso By 3 days recovery the message was in zzso zzso cells throughout the zzso Compared with zzso zzso cells, little or no expression was noted in large vessel zzso cells, airway cells, or smooth muscle zzso Combined in zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and other zzso cells found no zzso message in those cell zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso were enriched in zzso type II cell preparations from recovering zzso Double in zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed zzso in a population of type II cells, but with an inverse zzso cells with abundant zzso zzso did not have abundant zzso zzso Type II cells in zzso expressed zzso message, but only when the zzso message abundance was relatively zzso We conclude that zzso type II cells express increased zzso zzso during recovery from acute zzso These findings are consistent with a role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso repair after zzso zzso
