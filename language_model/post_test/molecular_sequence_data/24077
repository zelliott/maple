zzso of zzso T4 late genes requires zzso DNA zzso T4 late zzso which consist of a single zzso zzso zzso are recognized by a zzso containing zzso coli zzso zzso core and the zzso promoter specificity zzso zzso zzso of zzso at these promoters by zzso is inefficient, but is greatly activated by the zzso DNA zzso sliding zzso zzso and the zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and that this interaction is essential for zzso The zzso also mediates recognition of zzso promoter motifs by binding to zzso domain zzso The results suggest that zzso is an analogue of zzso domain 4 and that zzso and zzso together constitute two parts of the T4 late zzso We propose a model for the role of the zzso sliding clamp in zzso of T4 zzso zzso
