In most zzso the growth hormone zzso locus comprises a single gene expressed primarily in the anterior zzso zzso However, in higher primates multiple zzso of the zzso gene gave rise to a complex locus containing several zzso In man this locus comprises five zzso including zzso zzso in zzso and four genes expressed in the zzso but in other species the number and organization of these genes zzso The situation in zzso has been zzso with suggestions of up to seven zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso locus in zzso and have deduced the complete zzso The locus includes five genes apparently organized in a fashion similar to that in human, with two of these genes zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There are notable differences between the human and zzso zzso with regard to the expressed zzso gene regulation, and gene conversion zzso In particular, one human gene zzso has changed substantially since the zzso split, potentially becoming a zzso while the corresponding zzso gene zzso has been zzso giving a product almost identical to the adjacent zzso zzso appears to produce two zzso with potentially differing biological properties, whereas human produces a single zzso The pattern of gene conversion in human has been quite different from that in zzso The region around the zzso gene in zzso is remarkably zzso unlike the corresponding region in zzso The results shed new light on the complex evolution of the zzso locus in higher zzso
