Floral organ development is controlled by a group of regulatory factors containing the zzso zzso In this study, we have isolated and characterized a zzso clone from rice, zzso which encodes a zzso containing zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence shows over zzso identity to AG of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso tomato, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso box region is most zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the rice zzso gene was zzso expressed in zzso zzso especially in zzso and zzso In zzso zzso studies showed that the transcript was present primarily in zzso and zzso The function of the rice zzso was zzso by zzso expression of the gene under the control of the zzso zzso promoter in a zzso tobacco plant zzso zzso plants exhibited an altered zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were pale green and zzso zzso of the zzso were split into sections which in some plants became zzso structures attached to tubes that resembled zzso The zzso mimic the results of zzso expression of zzso AG gene or AG zzso These results indicate that the zzso gene is possibly an AG zzso and that the AG genes appear to be structurally and functionally zzso between zzso and zzso
