The human T cell leukemia virus II zzso is a type C zzso closely related to the human transforming zzso zzso In contrast to zzso the role of zzso in human disease is zzso However, zzso infection has been documented in several cases of a clinically benign zzso cell leukemia and has also been suggested as a zzso for zzso disease zzso We report that an zzso isolate zzso zzso derived from a zzso white male can induce cell fusion and significant zzso effects in tissue zzso This zzso isolate induced zzso formation with human T and B cell lines, several human zzso cell lines, and, interestingly, zzso and zzso cell zzso To zzso the role in the zzso envelope in this phenomenon, we have cloned the envelope zzso zzso and zzso of this zzso The envelope zzso expressed in the absence of the rest of the viral zzso were sufficient to drive zzso formation in zzso and preserved the cellular zzso for zzso formation observed with the native zzso zzso zzso acid zzso sequence analysis demonstrated zzso overall similarity with other zzso envelope zzso Interestingly, only cells infected by zzso but not parental zzso cells, form zzso with zzso zzso cells as well as with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso directed at the zzso zzso failed to inhibit the induction of giant cell formation, zzso that the zzso envelope protein was responsible for driving zzso formation in this zzso These observations may be important for the understanding of the processes involved in human zzso zzso formation and may suggest a mechanism zzso zzso could influence the disease process in individuals zzso infected with zzso and zzso
