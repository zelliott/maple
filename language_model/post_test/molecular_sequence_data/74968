zzso a membrane zzso that has the unique property of shuttling from zzso to zzso to plasma membrane and back, was zzso from chicken zzso Its zzso zzso acid sequence was determined, and an zzso zzso part of this sequence was used to clone the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence consists of zzso zzso of which the zzso 18 constitute a signal zzso The sequence includes 17 sites for zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso chain followed by a region lacking zzso zzso a single possible zzso segment, and a zzso domain of 11 zzso including three potential zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso are spaced in a regular pattern through the zzso zzso domain, while a zzso sequence rich in zzso zzso and zzso occurs at its zzso zzso of the zzso in mouse L cells resulted in targeting of zzso primarily to the mouse zzso
