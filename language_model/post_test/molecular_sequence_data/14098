In zzso zzso zzso of the nuclear gene zzso causes several zzso associated with impairment of zzso zzso In addition to deficiencies in zzso compartment integrity and respiratory growth, zzso zzso grow extremely slowly in the absence of zzso zzso We have identified two genetic zzso that, when zzso act as dominant zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso strains lacking zzso zzso These zzso only suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso strains lacking zzso DNA and had no effect on other zzso associated with zzso zzso One zzso of one linkage group had a collateral respiratory deficient zzso that allowed the isolation of the zzso zzso This suppressing zzso was in zzso a gene that encodes the gamma zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Recovery of two of the suppressing zzso zzso and subsequent sequence analysis placed the suppressing zzso at strictly zzso zzso near the C zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso locus resulted in an inability to zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso deletion strains lacking zzso DNA grew slowly on zzso media but were not as compromised for growth as zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso
