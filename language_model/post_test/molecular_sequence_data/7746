The genes for the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been mapped in mouse by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been mapped previously by in zzso zzso but their positions on the zzso linkage map had not been zzso The other two genes have not previously been mapped in zzso These zzso factors belong to a growing family of zzso regulators, some of which are known to form a complex network of interacting proteins that control cell proliferation and zzso As expected, based on mapping studies of other zzso zzso these zzso were well distributed among mouse zzso In addition, some of the zzso used in this study detected zzso independently segregating zzso suggesting the possible existence of additional family members or zzso zzso
