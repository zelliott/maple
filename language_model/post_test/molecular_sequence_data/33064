The influence of zzso therapy on zzso zzso remains zzso To verify if zzso zzso shift was affected by zzso the evolution of zzso DNA zzso zzso after 12 months of a new zzso regimen was compared between zzso and zzso zzso zzso blood samples were collected from 36 patients infected with zzso zzso (18 zzso and 18 zzso for virus isolation and zzso zzso zzso from plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso was repeated after 12 months from initiating zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso sequences into zzso or zzso for analysis purposes, zzso viruses were considered as zzso From the 10 zzso patients changing their zzso DNA zzso zzso during therapy, six shifted from zzso and four from zzso The lack of reaching zzso suppression was not associated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression and zzso increase were similar in both zzso No association was found between zzso shift and patient baseline characteristics including age, sex, zzso stage, zzso count, viral load, exposure and length of previous zzso zzso use in the new regimen, number of reverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated to emergence of zzso virus in zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso shifting patients zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients, P zzso zzso The occurrence of a zzso shift in both directions was independent of zzso use, irrespective of its zzso The zzso count zzso was the only baseline characteristic able to predict an zzso viral zzso
