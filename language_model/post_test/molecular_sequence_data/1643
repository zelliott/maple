The zzso zzso have been shown previously to be absent in zzso of zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso or zzso was not functional or not expressed in zzso zzso zzso From an zzso zzso zzso zzso we cloned two zzso with an identical open reading frame zzso a putative zzso the zzso responsible for a first zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The two zzso differed by their zzso region zzso and zzso zzso One transcript zzso had a normal structure with a spliced leader and was highly expressed in normal cells but absent in zzso zzso The other zzso which did not possess the spliced leader zzso was zzso expressed in normal cells but strongly expressed in zzso zzso As a functional test, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were transformed using the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso containing the candidate zzso coding sequence cloned from zzso zzso The transformed zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso within their zzso proving that the isolated zzso encodes on a zzso responsible for zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the absence of the normal transcript zzso and the expression of an abnormal species zzso devoid of a spliced leader could explain the absence of zzso zzso in these zzso Further studies using a zzso system will allow us to draw conclusions about the relationship between zzso expression and zzso resistance in zzso
