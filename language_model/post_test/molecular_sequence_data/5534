zzso and zzso are zzso zzso currently in clinical development, that inhibit zzso zzso zzso in several human zzso zzso We have identified a gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a target of these zzso A zzso portion of this zzso designated zzso has significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso partially functionally redundant zzso of zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in zzso to zzso we disrupted zzso on one zzso each of the spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso had been selected previously on zzso plates containing the zzso zzso The clones derived from this transformation were either resistant zzso or fully sensitive zzso to zzso by zzso in both liquid broth zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The site of zzso zzso in the zzso was mapped by Southern zzso analysis, using restriction site zzso in the zzso gene to distinguish between the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso For strains zzso and zzso the zzso zzso was disrupted in each zzso zzso for strain zzso zzso was disrupted in each zzso zzso We conclude that zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso are zzso for a dominant or zzso zzso resistance zzso at zzso zzso drug resistance zzso can occur in either zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a target of the zzso For zzso of strain zzso all the clones we analyzed were zzso zzso and only the zzso zzso either in disrupted or zzso form, was detected on zzso Southern zzso We believe gene conversion at the zzso locus may have produced two zzso zzso that each contain an zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso were analyzed for zzso to zzso treatment in a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were moderately resistant to treatment, while strains without a functional zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and derivatives of strain zzso with the disruption zzso integrated in the zzso zzso displayed strong in zzso zzso zzso Finally, we were unable to zzso both zzso at zzso by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is likely to be an essential protein in zzso zzso
