An inhibitor of activated factor zzso zzso in human zzso was recently identified as an zzso zzso precursor zzso We zzso an zzso inhibitor zzso from the zzso of activated human zzso and assessed its inhibitor activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso 90 zzso of zzso that zzso with zzso zzso was obtained from two hundred units of zzso suspension by employing a zzso column zzso zzso The molecular weight of the zzso zzso was zzso The Ki value of zzso to factor zzso was 526 zzso 120 zzso and the zzso was enhanced by the addition of zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was zzso which is identical to that for the zzso zzso to zzso zzso sequence of zzso and the zzso sequence of zzso zzso
