The zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that regulates the zzso of early viral zzso zzso of zzso regions of zzso in previous studies zzso zzso zzso zzso Choi, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992) resulted in the loss of zzso zzso suggesting that this region may contain an zzso zzso zzso To identify independently functional zzso zzso zzso we developed a zzso system in which potential regulatory zzso were fused with a modified zzso coli zzso zzso protein that contains a nuclear zzso signal zzso zzso zzso by the resulting zzso zzso was measured with a zzso zzso early promoter containing zzso zzso zzso binding sites zzso zzso zzso containing zzso peptides dramatically activated zzso of the zzso promoter only when zzso operator sequences were zzso In addition, zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso For a more detailed analysis of zzso regulatory zzso the zzso to zzso zzso portion of zzso was subdivided (on the basis of average zzso acid zzso into five smaller regions which were fused in various combinations to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were identified as independent zzso zzso zzso Some zzso zzso exhibited retarded migration in sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso As with zzso zzso this zzso gel mobility was associated with zzso zzso studies with the zzso zzso indicate that the zzso to zzso region of zzso is necessary for this zzso zzso
