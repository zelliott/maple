We found that the human zzso isolate zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso to zzso zzso zzso K and zzso zzso treatments showed that proteins play a key role in zzso zzso to zzso zzso By studying the cell zzso zzso we identified a surface zzso which we labeled zzso We zzso the protein zzso and found that it functioned as an zzso promoter on zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the gene coding for this protein and zzso experiments showed that zzso is a zzso zzso expressed as a precursor zzso A database search indicated that zzso appears to function biologically as an zzso protein in the ABC transport zzso We discovered a protein corresponding to zzso and its gene in eight other highly adherent zzso zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso affected the production of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first protein described to date to be directly involved in the zzso of zzso to zzso cells and to show zzso zzso
