The zzso of zzso zzso from zzso is a major component of the zzso membrane sector of the zzso It is zzso in nuclear zzso A family of overlapping complementary DNA clones zzso its precursor has been isolated from a bovine library by using in the first instance a mixture of 128 synthetic zzso designed on the basis of the known protein zzso and the sequence of the full-length zzso has been zzso The deduced protein sequence shows that the zzso of zzso zzso has a zzso of 43 zzso acids that is not present in the mature zzso Presumably it directs the protein into the zzso zzso and is removed during the import zzso The zzso protein sequence is also longer by one zzso acid at its zzso end than the protein isolated from zzso but this zzso zzso may have been removed zzso during release of the zzso particle from the inner zzso zzso With the exception of one uncertainty caused by an ambiguity at one position in the zzso zzso the mature protein sequence zzso in the zzso is exactly the same as the sequence determined previously by direct analysis of the protein isolated from bovine heart zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence differs in 158 zzso over a region of alignment of zzso zzso from a partial zzso for the zzso that has been isolated from a bovine zzso derived from liver zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso 152, zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
