zzso comprise a conglomerate of pathogens and zzso occurring in humans and zzso The zzso zzso alone contains more than 120 species at present, and new members are continuously being zzso zzso it seems promising to use a single highly parallel detection zzso rather than develop separate tests for each individual zzso In this study, we have designed a DNA zzso carrying 70 zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso gene and 86 zzso from the zzso gene target zzso Following a zzso amplification and zzso step, zzso on the array was shown to specifically identify 31 zzso zzso as well as 3 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso Members of the zzso zzso cluster can be recognized at zzso zzso This procedure enables parallel detection of zzso zzso occurring in humans, animals or cell culture, from zzso and multiple infections, in a single zzso The main advantages of the zzso zzso include ease of operation, zzso high information content, and zzso The new zzso zzso sensitivity is equivalent to that of real-time zzso and allows examination of field samples without the need for zzso When 60 field samples from zzso and birds previously analyzed by zzso gel zzso zzso were tested by the zzso zzso both tests identified the same agent in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso testing revealed an unexpectedly high proportion zzso of multiple mycoplasma infections, zzso substantially more than zzso zzso Two of the samples were found to contain four different zzso zzso This phenomenon deserves more attention, particularly its implications for epidemiology and zzso
