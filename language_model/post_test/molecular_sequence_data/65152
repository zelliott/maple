zzso family zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new branch of zzso family zzso Of these zzso zzso is specifically expressed in zzso We recently identified zzso as a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso branching in response to zzso in zzso zzso During the cloning of zzso we have found two mainly expressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso lacking 29 zzso and 61 zzso within the unique insert region at the center, respectively, and three minor zzso zzso zzso and zzso each with the identical zzso acid deletion from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in brain, whereas zzso is expressed zzso In a zzso zzso all zzso zzso bind to zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso induce less zzso branching when zzso with zzso in zzso cells, indicating that the insert region is important for the branching activity of zzso All zzso zzso bind to zzso in zzso and in zzso through the zzso domain at the zzso zzso and the zzso domain is essential for branching activity of zzso In zzso experiments, zzso reduces zzso interaction, whereas it has little effect on the interaction of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso we found that functionally different zzso zzso of zzso have different responses to zzso in association with zzso
