zzso zzso protein zzso protein zzso protein zzso is a protein of the zzso density zzso and binds to the zzso zzso domain of zzso protein zzso 90 and synaptic scaffolding zzso zzso recruits zzso and its interacting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso fraction in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso may link several zzso components to the zzso zzso structures in the zzso We have identified here a novel zzso zzso protein and named it zzso zzso has seven zzso repeats at the zzso zzso followed by one zzso zzso 3 domain and one zzso domain, and several zzso regions at the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso region of zzso via the middle region containing a zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso from rat crude zzso and zzso with zzso in primary cultured rat zzso zzso Because zzso is composed of various zzso zzso it may also interact with proteins other than zzso to organize the architecture of the zzso
