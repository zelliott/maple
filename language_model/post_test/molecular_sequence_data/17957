When the lower leaves of hybrid zzso trees are mechanically wounded, several novel zzso accumulate in the zzso upper leaves zzso zzso zzso zzso Gordon zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso in response to wounding in zzso trees, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, in zzso A partial zzso clone corresponding to a transcript from the zzso gene designated win 3 zzso has been cloned by differential zzso to zzso zzso from the leaves of wounded zzso Northern blots show a large zzso of win 3 transcripts in the zzso leaves of wounded zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA suggests that win 3 is a member of a zzso zzso The zzso sequences of several win 3 zzso clones have been determined, indicating that at least three win 3 gene family members are zzso A zzso clone of a win 3 gene family member has been isolated and a zzso zzso zzso III zzso containing the predicted zzso and zzso upstream regions has been zzso The putative win 3 gene product is similar to the major soluble proteins of sweet potato zzso zzso A and zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso share significant zzso acid sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso thus zzso three other zzso inhibitor families which are zzso responsive to zzso
