We had previously predicted successfully the minimal fusion peptides zzso of the human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso and the bovine leukemia virus zzso zzso using an original approach based on the zzso relationship of zzso zzso In this paper, we have used the same method to predict the shortest zzso capable of inducing optimal fusion in zzso of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso isolate and of other zzso and human zzso virus zzso zzso In each case, the zzso zzso was predicted as the minimal zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and leakage zzso confirmed that this zzso is the shortest zzso inducing optimal fusion in zzso being therefore the minimal zzso These results are another piece of evidence that the zzso properties of zzso are important for the fusion process and that our method can be used to predict the minimal zzso of other zzso
