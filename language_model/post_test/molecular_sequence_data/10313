We screened zzso clones zzso zzso an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Two positive clones were obtained and their zzso sequences indicated that they contain no zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that one clone zzso 3) zzso zzso 3 and another zzso 4) is a new member of the zzso gene zzso Gene expression of both zzso 3 and zzso 4 was shown to be induced by zzso and to occur zzso in the fat body and zzso Our results suggest that zzso as well as zzso forms a multiple gene family in zzso zzso
