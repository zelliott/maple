zzso an accessory gene of zzso zzso cell cycle zzso with zzso at zzso phase and increased zzso Since zzso of zzso checkpoint control provides a molecular basis of zzso instability, we studied the effects of zzso on genetic integrity using a stable zzso named zzso in which zzso expression is controlled by the zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso induced zzso expression with a giant zzso cell zzso Increased zzso zzso formation was also detected in these zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso removal induced numerous zzso zzso in the zzso cells with leaving zzso in zzso suggesting that the transient zzso expression could cause genetic zzso zzso with this zzso zzso cells, originally zzso cells, became zzso after repeated expression of zzso zzso using deletion zzso of zzso revealed that the domain inducing zzso formation as well as zzso was located in the zzso region of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso instability, implicating the possible role in the development of AIDS-related zzso
