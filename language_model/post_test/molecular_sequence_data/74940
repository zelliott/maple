zzso zzso 47 contains two surface zzso zzso termed the outer wall protein zzso and the middle wall protein zzso which form a zzso array in the cell zzso The zzso and zzso genes are contained in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and constitute an zzso under coordinate control of their zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso containing the entire zzso gene has been determined in this zzso Together with the DNA sequence of the promoter region for the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1987) and that of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the complete zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso has been zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso precursor of the zzso consisting of a total of zzso zzso acid zzso with a signal zzso of 23 zzso acid zzso at its zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring the zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso with almost the same molecular weight as the authentic zzso as judged by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso acid compositions deduced from the zzso and zzso genes were similar to the chemical zzso acid compositions of other zzso proteins in the predominance of zzso zzso acids compared with basic zzso acids and in the very low content of zzso zzso zzso The zzso nature of the zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso focusing on zzso zzso In addition, circular zzso zzso indicated that the zzso proteins in zzso zzso 47 were composed of approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso structures, with the remainder of the zzso backbone being zzso in zzso
