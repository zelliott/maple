zzso analysis of host specificity in the rice blast fungus zzso zzso identified a single zzso zzso (for zzso toward zzso zzso that exerts a major effect on the ability of this fungus to zzso weeping zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso was genetically zzso with the frequent appearance of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso was cloned based on its map zzso Large deletions detected in zzso zzso guided the gene cloning zzso zzso harboring the cloned zzso gene lost zzso toward weeping zzso but remained fully zzso toward other host zzso Thus, the zzso host species specificity gene has properties analogous to classical zzso zzso which function to prevent infection of certain zzso of a particular host zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein (16 zzso with a putative zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso segregating in the mapping population, zzso differed from zzso by a single base pair substitution that resulted in a loss of zzso The zzso locus is highly zzso among rice pathogens from diverse geographic zzso
