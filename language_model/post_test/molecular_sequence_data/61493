zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso drug used for the treatment of patients infected with zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is a structural analogue of zzso only little zzso to these two drugs is observed among clinical zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso that need to be activated by zzso zzso to exert their zzso zzso We have recently identified two zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in resistance to zzso zzso encodes a protein that belongs to the zzso zzso family zzso the zzso of zzso We show here that zzso which encodes a zzso belonging to the zzso family of zzso regulators, zzso regulates the expression of zzso By the zzso of the zzso promoter region upstream of the zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso in trans was found to cause a strong zzso of zzso zzso independently of the presence of zzso in the culture zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso interacts directly with the zzso promoter zzso This interaction was confirmed by DNA zzso analysis, which, in addition, identified the zzso zzso Unlike other zzso members, which typically bind 15 zzso operators, zzso zzso an unusually long 55 zzso region suggesting zzso of the zzso on its zzso Identification by zzso of the zzso zzso start site indicated that it is located within the zzso zzso Taken together, bacterial zzso experiments and gel zzso zzso suggested a zzso of zzso in the absence of its zzso In contrast, surface zzso resonance analyses showed that eight zzso molecules bind zzso to the 55 zzso operator, which represents a novel repression mechanism for a zzso zzso
