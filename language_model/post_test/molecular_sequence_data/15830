A DNA containing the coding sequence for the human zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso C has been obtained by zzso zzso of chemically zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso The 375 zzso synthetic gene carries signals for the translation initiation and termination and was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso fusion protein as well as a zzso protein under the control of the zzso coli alkaline zzso signal zzso The zzso hybrid protein was shown to have similar biological properties as the authentic protein isolated from human zzso
