In order to estimate how diverse the mating types in zzso zzso from different regions are, pairings between zzso derived from zzso and zzso were zzso Sixteen and 15 zzso were identified at zzso A and B from the 12 zzso In the zzso zzso zzso widely used for commercial production, four mating zzso A3, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Those zzso except A3, were found in 4 strains out of 12 zzso To improve breeding efficiency, especially in mating type determination, zzso and zzso were performed to screen for a mating type specific zzso The zzso marker zzso zzso was developed based on the zzso sequence typing B3 zzso The sequence analysis of zzso revealed that it contained a zzso domain, the zzso zzso and consensus sequences like the zzso box and zzso zzso It seems likely that the zzso marker region is a part of the zzso zzso zzso
