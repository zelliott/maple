zzso restriction zzso are important tools in zzso zzso We report here the crystal structure of zzso restriction zzso which is specific for the 8 zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Unlike zzso Type zzso zzso which are single domain zzso the zzso zzso is composed of two structural zzso The N domain contains a classical winged zzso zzso DNA binding zzso while the C domain shows a typical restriction zzso zzso The active site of zzso is located within the C domain and represents a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of sequence specificity are clustered on the recognition zzso of the zzso motif at the N zzso The modular architecture of zzso wherein one domain mediates DNA binding while the other domain is predicted to catalyze zzso zzso zzso from previously characterized restriction zzso interacting with zzso recognition zzso
