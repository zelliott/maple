zzso is a zzso zzso zzso specific to the zzso that is believed to play an important role in zzso zzso While the molecular characterization of the zzso protein has been zzso little is yet known of its functional role in zzso We therefore established a zzso zzso zzso zzso against a zzso zzso that included the most zzso portion of human zzso between the 135th and 149th zzso zzso Human zzso was found to be localized in the equatorial region of zzso zzso by zzso zzso using our zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding in the zzso zzso egg penetration test, but it did not inhibit zzso binding in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso of human zzso did not include zzso zzso the most promising candidates for zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso based on the findings of a human zzso cell binding zzso using zzso mouse zzso zzso cells and zzso cells lacking zzso zzso In conclusion, our present data suggest that human zzso expressed on the equatorial region of zzso zzso indeed mediates zzso binding in a zzso zzso manner, but not zzso zzso
