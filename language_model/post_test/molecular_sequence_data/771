Nuclear factor zzso has been reported to play multiple roles in transcription, zzso zzso zzso stability and zzso zzso From a structural point of view, zzso is a member of the zzso protein family whose structure includes two zzso zzso flanked by the zzso and zzso zzso Like many members of this family, the zzso region can interact with cellular factors and thus serve to zzso its zzso Previously, we have described that zzso binds to several members of the zzso zzso family through this zzso In this work, we set up a coupled zzso cellular system that allows us to obtain in zzso data to address the functional significance of zzso zzso complex zzso Using this method, we have finely mapped the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso protein to the region comprised between zzso acid zzso 321 and zzso Our results provide novel details of zzso interactions in zzso zzso In addition, we provide further insight on zzso functional properties, particularly the lack of effects, as seen with our zzso of the zzso zzso that fall within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
