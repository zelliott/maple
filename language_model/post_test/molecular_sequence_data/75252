zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step in the formation of zzso and zzso the conversion of zzso acid to zzso zzso G and zzso This zzso is the site of action of zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso complementary DNA zzso encompassing the entire coding region of zzso zzso zzso from sheep zzso zzso This zzso cloned from a zzso zzso 10 library prepared from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso zzso zzso The zzso clone was selected using zzso zzso modeled from zzso acid sequences of zzso peptides prepared from the zzso zzso The full-length zzso encodes a protein of 600 zzso zzso including a signal sequence of 24 zzso zzso Identification of the zzso as coding for zzso zzso zzso is based on comparison of zzso acid sequences of seven peptides zzso 103 zzso acids with the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso The molecular weight of the zzso zzso lacking the signal zzso is zzso The zzso is a zzso and there are three potential sites for zzso two of them in the zzso half of the zzso The zzso reported to be zzso by aspirin is at position zzso near the zzso zzso There is no significant similarity between the sequence of the zzso and that of any other protein in zzso acid or zzso sequence libraries, and a zzso binding zzso is not apparent from the zzso acid zzso The availability of a full-length zzso clone coding for zzso zzso zzso should facilitate studies of the regulation of expression of this zzso and the structural features important for zzso and for interaction with zzso zzso
