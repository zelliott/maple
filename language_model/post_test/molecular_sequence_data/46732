zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is highly zzso during zzso Two zzso are known that share a similar zzso zzso domain and another zzso domain zzso the zzso zzso Only limited data are available on the function of zzso and its zzso zzso is zzso zzso by many different zzso including zzso drugs and growth zzso and recent data suggest that zzso may play a zzso role in zzso In this paper we show that zzso forms zzso via its zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, we identified a zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso Furthermore, we report the presence of two more zzso family members with highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso have zzso zzso activity when fused to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso appears sensitive for promoter architecture, but not for the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso activity resides in the zzso regions of the protein and is enhanced by the zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso zzso factors that can zzso and zzso with other family members and that at least two zzso family members may be zzso of zzso
