The zzso reactions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso Four aspects were zzso sequence conservation in three zzso proteins for oxygen evolution, zzso zzso activity, charge zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patterns of delayed zzso on a second time scale and delayed zzso on the zzso time scale at zzso degrees zzso Even though there were significant differences between the zzso acid sequences of zzso proteins in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activities were zzso The delayed zzso zzso patterns and glow zzso of zzso were essentially identical between the two species, and the zzso delayed zzso spectral profiles and lifetimes were also very zzso These results indicate clearly that even though the zzso reactions are carried out in the zzso by components with altered zzso acid zzso the essential reaction processes for water zzso are highly zzso In contrast, we observed significant changes on the reduction side of zzso zzso Based on these data, we discuss the zzso activity of zzso zzso
