We have discovered a zzso of zzso related by their ability to catalyze the abstraction of the zzso of a zzso acid to form an zzso zzso Although each reaction zzso by these zzso is initiated by this common step, their overall reactions (including zzso zzso of water, zzso of zzso and zzso as well as the zzso consequences zzso vs zzso of the zzso reactions are zzso Analysis of sequence and structural similarities among these proteins suggests that all of their chemical reactions are zzso by a common active site architecture modified through evolution to allow the zzso zzso to partition to different products in their respective active sites via different overall zzso All of these zzso retain the ability to catalyze the zzso difficult step of zzso zzso These zzso zzso designated the zzso zzso include zzso as well as more metabolically specialized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso relationships within the zzso suggests that zzso zzso another member of the zzso does not catalyze the reaction proposed in the literature but zzso an zzso reaction zzso The established and deduced zzso relationships in the zzso allow the prediction that other apparent members of the family for which no zzso functions have yet been assigned will also perform chemistry involving abstraction of the zzso of zzso zzso
