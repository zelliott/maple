To identify the common snakes in zzso liquor of zzso using zzso zzso zzso to test the zzso 

The zzso zzso sequences of collected medicinal snakes were amplified and zzso The sequences combined with the data from zzso were analyzed for divergence and building a zzso tree with zzso zzso 

The genetic distance and NJ tree demonstrated that there were zzso variable sites in these species, and the average (A + zzso content of zzso was higher than the average zzso + zzso content of zzso The maximum zzso genetic distance was zzso and the minimum was zzso zzso In the NJ zzso species formed a zzso zzso with zzso supports of zzso 

DNA zzso identification method based on the zzso sequence is accurate and can be applied to identify the common medicinal zzso
