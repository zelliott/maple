The zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso of zzso zzso has an invasive zzso domain zzso zzso which zzso the zzso membrane of a variety of zzso cells and zzso them by zzso synthesis of zzso zzso Previous work led to identification of five zzso sites in the zzso domain at which zzso peptides are zzso without affecting its zzso zzso We have constructed a set of zzso toxins zzso at these zzso sites by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso at any of the five sites did not affect the capacity of the toxin to deliver its zzso domain into target zzso Moreover, the toxin with the inserted zzso was shown to sensitize target cells for zzso by zzso zzso zzso T zzso in zzso showing that the zzso zzso was processed for presentation of the zzso zzso virus zzso in association with the major zzso complex class I zzso This finding indicates that by virtue of delivery of foreign zzso into the zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso may be useful for induction of specific major zzso complex class zzso zzso immunity also in zzso
