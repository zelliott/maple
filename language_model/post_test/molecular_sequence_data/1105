One of the major environmental safety issues over transgenic crops containing zzso genes relates to the outcome of zzso events between viral zzso transcripts and zzso from indigenous virus zzso We addressed this issue by assessing the emergence of viable zzso zzso virus zzso zzso in transgenic zzso expressing the zzso coat protein zzso zzso Test plants consisted of zzso zzso grafted onto transgenic and zzso zzso that were exposed over 3 years to zzso zzso infection in two distinct vineyard zzso The zzso gene of challenging zzso zzso was amplified from zzso by zzso and characterized by zzso and zzso sequencing using strain zzso as reference since it provided the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterns from 347 challenging zzso zzso and sequence data from 85 zzso revealed no characteristics similar to strain zzso and no difference in the molecular zzso among zzso from 190 transgenic and 157 zzso plants, or from plants within zzso zzso or outside zzso zzso of the two zzso Interestingly, five zzso zzso were identified in three zzso plants located outside of the two field zzso This survey indicates that transgenic zzso did not assist the emergence of viable zzso zzso to zzso levels nor did they affect the molecular diversity of indigenous zzso populations during the trial zzso This is the first report on safety assessment of zzso with a transgenic crop expressing a zzso gene under field conditions of heavy disease pressure but low, if any, selection pressure against zzso zzso
