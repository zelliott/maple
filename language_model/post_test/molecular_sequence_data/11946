The zzso virus gene zzso encodes a highly zzso protein with zzso acid similarity to zzso zzso protein zzso In this report we have identified the zzso protein of strain Western Reserve zzso defined its membrane zzso and analyzed its role in virus production and zzso An zzso raised against an zzso zzso identified the zzso gene product as a zzso protein which is expressed at low levels during virus zzso A serum from a rabbit previously infected with WR virus recognized the zzso zzso thus confirming that the zzso gene is expressed in zzso Using a coupled in zzso system the zzso protein was shown to be a zzso and zzso form of a zzso zzso zzso The membrane zzso of the zzso protein was defined by its zzso and zzso sensitivity when associated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso variable domain was protected from zzso zzso and was therefore in the zzso of the zzso whereas the zzso was sensitive and therefore zzso zzso deletion and zzso viruses were constructed and were used to study the involvement of zzso in virus zzso release, and zzso zzso of the zzso gene caused a slight reduction in virus plaque size but did not affect the production of zzso mature virus or zzso enveloped virus particles in tissue culture cells nor the zzso of the virus in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein therefore possesses similar sequence and membrane zzso to the zzso zzso protein but is not required for virus particle production or zzso
