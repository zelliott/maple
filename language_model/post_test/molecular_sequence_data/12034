A rapid zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso method was developed in this study to detect zzso and loss of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso samples of normal breast tissue and of breast zzso zzso expression was also examined by zzso In 35 paired samples, zzso in zzso 4 of zzso was detected in 17 cases zzso per zzso and zzso of the zzso gene in breast cancer zzso was observed in 7 out of 15 zzso cases zzso per zzso The correlation of zzso of zzso with positive zzso zzso did not reach statistical significance, but all zzso zzso among zzso cases had zzso of zzso The results support the hypothesis that in most cases the zzso deletion of zzso may uncover the zzso zzso in the remaining zzso However, zzso of zzso was more frequent than positive zzso and was significantly associated with poor differentiation of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso deletion of zzso may also contribute to the development and progression of breast cancer by reducing the amount of normal zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso is a simple, fast, and effective method for detecting zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso which is especially useful for retrospective zzso
