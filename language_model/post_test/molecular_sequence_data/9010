The expressions of zzso and zzso genes are tightly controlled by numerous zzso zzso mainly at the zzso zzso Recent analyses have identified a large, zzso family of zzso repeat zzso zzso proteins that are exclusively involved in zzso metabolism of zzso genes via zzso zzso zzso A tandem array of zzso motifs within the protein is believed to facilitate the zzso interaction, although little is known of the zzso Here, we describe the zzso interacting framework of a zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we demonstrated that a zzso model could be relevant to the zzso motif zzso A series of proteins with two zzso motifs showed significant differences in their zzso binding zzso indicating functional differences among zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso identified five zzso acids organizing its zzso binding surface zzso 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and zzso zzso zzso and their complex zzso zzso zzso evolution of zzso by exponential zzso and zzso preference zzso determined the zzso with high affinity for zzso and suggested several characteristic zzso acids that may be involved in determining specificity and/or affinity of the zzso zzso
