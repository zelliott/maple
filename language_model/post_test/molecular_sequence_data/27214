The specificity of human zzso zzso zzso zzso is drastically altered to favor zzso zzso in the zzso zzso designed to mimic zzso interactions zzso by zzso This redesign serves as a model for improving our understanding of the structural zzso that contribute to the distinct zzso of alpha class zzso zzso we report the first crystal structures of zzso both in complex with zzso and in zzso form at zzso and zzso A zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso binding pocket that zzso zzso in zzso zzso includes a dynamic zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso to complete the active zzso Comparisons of the zzso structures with previously reported structures show a striking similarity with the zzso active site obtained within an essentially zzso scaffold and reveal the zzso zzso assumes a similar localized structure regardless of active site occupancy in a manner resembling that of zzso However, we cannot fully account for all the structural elements important in zzso within the zzso active zzso The contribution of zzso to the zzso network prevents complete zzso closure and demonstrates that the presence of zzso within the context of a zzso active site may ultimately hinder zzso a key zzso zzso from effectively contributing to the active zzso In total, these results illustrate the remaining structural differences presumably reflected in the previously reported zzso efficiencies of zzso and zzso and emphasize the zzso zzso as being necessary to completely accomplish the transformation to a highly specific zzso from the more zzso zzso zzso
