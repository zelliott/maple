zzso zzso I zzso is a class of protein zzso ubiquitous to all zzso zzso Recently, zzso clones zzso several bovine zzso zzso have been zzso that show high sequence identity to the zzso gene product of the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for normal cellular growth, nuclear zzso DNA repair, and zzso We have raised zzso zzso to a human zzso zzso zzso and have zzso a portion of this zzso The zzso acid sequence identifies the zzso as the zzso zzso which is zzso identical to the zzso protein zzso By use of zzso the zzso has been localized to zzso zzso structures and to the zzso in zzso zzso As cells progress into zzso zzso zzso increases and, in zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso This zzso suggests that zzso like zzso plays a role in the segregation of zzso during zzso and may be cell zzso both in humans and in zzso
