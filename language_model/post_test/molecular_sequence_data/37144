A zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein is basic zzso zzso contains three zzso and has an zzso zzso acid sequence closely related to those of the previously described zzso c zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso was identified from the zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 71 zzso acids zzso mass zzso zzso with zzso identity to the c zzso zzso of zzso zzso In order to determine the zzso role of zzso a knockout zzso was prepared with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction was significantly inhibited in both growing cultures and cell suspensions of the zzso When zzso was expressed in zzso the full capacity for zzso reduction with zzso was zzso The transfer of electrons from zzso to zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso and to zzso was also compromised in the zzso but zzso reduction of zzso was not zzso The rates of reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also the same in the wild type and zzso zzso when hydrogen was supplied as the electron zzso When taken together with previous studies on other electron transport proteins in zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso serves as an zzso electron carrier from zzso to terminal zzso zzso in the outer zzso and is also involved in the transfer of electrons from zzso to zzso and zzso
