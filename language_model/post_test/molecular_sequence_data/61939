zzso to zzso zzso are not well understood in terms of the zzso underlying such zzso or their relative frequency among different zzso at the zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was discovered 13 zzso upstream from the zzso of the tandem array of the zzso locus zzso The zzso coincidentally creates a restriction site zzso for the restriction zzso zzso that is tightly linked to the tandem array of zzso Forty zzso zzso zzso in the tandem array were characterized with zzso analysis with zzso 

Among 40 zzso zzso 34 zzso zzso were of paternal origin, 1 ( approximately zzso was of maternal origin, and 5 zzso zzso had an unclear lineage of zzso In 26 cases where the magnitude of the repeat change could be determined, 23 zzso involved changes of a single repeat unit, whereas 3 zzso involved changes of 2 or more zzso The number of additions to the tandem array was roughly equal to the number of deletions from the tandem zzso In 19 instances it was possible to identify the parental zzso that underwent the zzso zzso 13 and 14 were prone to zzso whereas zzso 11 was zzso Thus, there is an unequal sensitivity to zzso among zzso zzso 

The use of the linked zzso marker has revealed several features of zzso at the zzso zzso 1) Single repeat changes are the most commonly zzso 2) zzso are more likely in the paternal zzso 3) Not all zzso undergo zzso with equal zzso
