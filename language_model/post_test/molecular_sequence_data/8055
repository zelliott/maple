Two copies of the gene zzso zzso zzso 9 of the zzso zzso have been cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA and the corresponding zzso sequences of the coding regions were zzso Both zzso contain a 222 zzso long and well zzso zzso reading frame, coding for a 74 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso gene may have a unique zzso extension of 11 zzso acid zzso relative to other plant zzso zzso In comparison of zzso and zzso sequences four zzso editing events were found in both zzso zzso Northern experiments indicate different zzso patterns for the two zzso
