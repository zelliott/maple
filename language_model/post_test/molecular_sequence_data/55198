DNA zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that zzso link opposite strands of the DNA zzso and block DNA zzso zzso are repaired during and outside S phase, and zzso zzso repair zzso is critical to maintain zzso integrity and to allow zzso in zzso or slowly dividing zzso Here, we show that the Y family DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso egg zzso and that both its zzso activity and zzso zzso are required for this zzso We also demonstrate a requirement for zzso and its modification on zzso zzso Finally, we show that Pol zzso zzso in zzso repair in zzso cells, particularly in zzso Our results identify key components of the zzso zzso and begin to unravel its zzso
