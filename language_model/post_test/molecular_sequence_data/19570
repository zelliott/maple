zzso is a zzso with well-documented zzso functions whose zzso involves four zzso zzso Here, we report a detailed analysis of the expression and zzso control of zzso zzso which zzso for the first zzso of zzso zzso zzso maps at the extreme end of zzso a zzso region of high zzso zzso By zzso and 3' zzso we identified and mapped two alternative zzso zzso first zzso and seven alternative zzso zzso which are spread over a zzso region of about 250 zzso While the two alternative zzso zzso have different expression profiles, all the 3' alternative forms are zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of each zzso zzso might influence its own expression at zzso zzso In addition, we identified a highly zzso promoter region of zzso zzso analysis of this region showed the presence of a zzso island, whose zzso could control the level of zzso zzso Finally, by zzso in zzso zzso we found that zzso expression is present at zzso zzso in the mouse liver, lung and brain, and is then maintained in the zzso brain with a specific zzso zzso zzso our data highlight a tight zzso and zzso control of zzso zzso
