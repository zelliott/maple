In the present paper, a zzso method for species determination in zzso has been zzso zzso was extracted from zzso zzso and cashmere zzso and zzso by zzso providing zzso zzso that were analyzed by liquid zzso coupled with zzso mass zzso zzso in order to identify zzso zzso markers able to differentiate the zzso Several suitable zzso markers were identified and validated in different zzso of different origin and having undergone different technological treatments, showing zzso specificity and zzso zzso Most of the zzso markers were also identified by means of high-resolution mass zzso confirming the origin from zzso zzso zzso Some peptides were also used for the zzso of the different species in mixed zzso by zzso zzso experiments and blind tests confirmed their ability to act as very specific quantitative and qualitative zzso The method here developed is a valid complement to the standard benchmark methods for zzso identification and zzso and will be very useful for assessing the authenticity of textile zzso
