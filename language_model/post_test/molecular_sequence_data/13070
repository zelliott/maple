Previously we identified a protein of apparent zzso zzso 26,000 as the major zzso binding protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Jones, zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso and primary structure of the zzso zzso binding zzso The protein was zzso zzso from cardiac zzso and shown by zzso to be highly enriched in zzso membrane zzso It ran as a closely spaced zzso on zzso gel zzso and bound zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso predicted a protein of 210 zzso acids containing a single zzso zzso The protein has a short zzso region located in the zzso and the bulk of the zzso which is highly charged and zzso projects into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found with zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that all three proteins are members of a family of single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling localized the zzso protein to zzso zzso zzso in cardiac and skeletal zzso The same gene product was expressed in these two zzso The zzso binding activity of the zzso protein combined with its zzso with zzso and zzso receptors strongly suggests that the protein plays an important role in the organization and/or function of the zzso release zzso Because the zzso zzso binding protein is an integral component of the zzso zzso zzso membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscle, we have named it zzso
