We report an efficient approach for the chemical synthesis of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso synthesis in combination with an zzso version of native chemical zzso The corresponding linear zzso precursor was zzso and folded in a zzso reaction using reduced zzso The reaction was extremely efficiently yielding zzso folded zzso with minimal or no zzso at zzso This approach is fully compatible with the high zzso production of chemical libraries using this zzso zzso
