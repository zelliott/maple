A detailed investigation has been undertaken on the extent and nature of zzso fluctuations about the zzso linkage of the model zzso Man alpha zzso alpha zzso In particular, we sought to determine whether the three nuclear zzso effects and the two long-range zzso zzso spin zzso zzso measurable across the zzso linkage were consistent with a single zzso or multiple zzso about that zzso Within experimental error, we have found that these five parameters can be interpreted in terms of a single, rigid zzso zzso the data are also consistent with a model in which the zzso zzso angles exhibit significant but restricted fluctuations about the global minimum energy zzso Evidence from restrained molecular dynamics simulations both in zzso and with explicit inclusion of zzso water and from zzso relaxation zzso upon an zzso zzso in zzso association with protein suggests that the latter model is the most accurate representation of the zzso behavior of zzso in zzso
