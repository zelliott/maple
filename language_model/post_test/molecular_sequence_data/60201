We report the isolation and characterization of a zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso called zzso has a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and a high content of basic zzso zzso A zzso human gene was localized to zzso zzso The zzso protein is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso cells and in male germ zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using an zzso zzso serum shows zzso of zzso and a known zzso zzso zzso to the dense zzso component of the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso protein appears to be temporally restricted to the zzso stages of the zzso cell cycle and to the zzso phase of zzso We find that the zzso protein zzso to the zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, as the zzso signal disappears in zzso cells, the zzso protein instead becomes associated with the surface of the condensed zzso
