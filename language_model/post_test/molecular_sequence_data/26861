The zzso machinery functions in several important zzso cellular zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex and may regulate membrane deformation and zzso zzso as zzso zzso was proposed to be a regulator of zzso but its mechanism of action was zzso The crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso reveals an zzso zzso fold, implicating zzso as a divergent zzso family zzso zzso specifically binds to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso shows that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso motif 1) via a novel zzso structural zzso This arrangement indicates a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso association and may also suggest one form of zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso
