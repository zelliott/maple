Previously, we identified zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in spinal motor zzso with zzso zzso inserted in what zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso This was interesting because known additions and deletions to zzso zzso are usually less than 100 zzso in size and found in the zzso zzso Changes in the association domain of zzso could influence zzso zzso activity or zzso zzso We show that three variations of this insert are found in zzso zzso or zzso motor zzso of zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso acid sequencing to identify zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso We also show that addition of the zzso bases is associated with outgrowth of the zzso (the standard zzso zzso when zzso outgrowth zzso zzso zzso and zzso PAGE identified this larger zzso as part of the group of soluble proteins moving at the zzso rate of zzso transport zzso in zzso motor zzso zzso zzso This group is composed mainly of structural proteins zzso zzso used to assemble the zzso of zzso zzso
