zzso and zzso are two embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso factors that play critical roles in the maintenance of zzso cell zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso and zzso expression on the differentiation state of zzso cells, which is sustained by a strong positive feedback zzso zzso and zzso either independently or zzso were zzso in zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso genes and terminal differentiation was observed by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cultures zzso while zzso zzso did not significantly alter zzso terminal zzso The expression of zzso was reduced in all zzso zzso and we identified a major zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso inhibited the formation of zzso zzso with a reduction in the zzso levels of hallmark zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso induced the expression of their zzso counterparts along with the expression of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso functions as a zzso zzso whereas zzso functions as a zzso zzso during muscle terminal zzso zzso in zzso diabetic zzso severe combined zzso zzso mice, the zzso of zzso cells was zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso in cooperation with zzso strongly suppresses the zzso differentiation program and promotes zzso in zzso
