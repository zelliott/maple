A zzso of SEA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain proteins zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso motif to generate stable zzso zzso has been suggested to involve only the zzso zzso action of the zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso strain of the zzso zzso zzso We conducted a number of experiments and simulations on the SEA domain from the zzso zzso to test this zzso zzso zzso of polar zzso in the vicinity of the zzso site demonstrates that only the zzso at position zzso is required for efficient zzso zzso modeling shows that an zzso trans zzso is incompatible with the native zzso structure, resulting in disruption of secondary structure elements and distortion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso (to obtain zzso zzso appears to relieve strain, and zzso is 100 times slower in a zzso zzso zzso and not measurable in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but measurable zzso of this zzso zzso still proceeds in the presence of strain zzso The zzso SEA precursor populates zzso partially folded zzso and zzso zzso with adoption of proper zzso secondary structure and completed zzso zzso dynamics simulations of the precursor show that the zzso zzso and the preceding zzso zzso carbon can be in van der zzso contact at the same time as the zzso zzso bond becomes zzso These observations are all consistent with zzso accelerated by zzso zzso shift and zzso strain imposed upon protein folding in a reaction for which the zzso barrier is decreased by zzso zzso rather than by zzso zzso The zzso of this coupled folding and zzso mechanism is accounted for in an accompanying zzso
