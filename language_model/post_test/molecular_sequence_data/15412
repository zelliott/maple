The molecular characterization of zzso actors involved in insect zzso zzso has yet to be zzso We have investigated the presence of a zzso zzso Potential zzso channel in the peripheral zzso system of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso channel zzso was identified by analysis of a zzso zzso database and subsequently cloned by zzso zzso In adult zzso the zzso transcript was detected in zzso at the base of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was observed in antennae in both zzso and adult zzso This work is the first step in understanding the involvement of zzso in zzso pathways involved in the development and function of the insect zzso zzso
