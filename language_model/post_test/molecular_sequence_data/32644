An zzso secondary structure is saturated if no base pairs can be added without violating the definition of secondary zzso Here we describe a new algorithm, zzso which for a given zzso sequence zzso an integral temperature 0 zzso T zzso 100 in degrees zzso and for all zzso zzso zzso the zzso partition function zzso zzso zzso zzso where the sum is over all saturated secondary structures of a which have exactly k base pairs, R is the universal gas constant and zzso denotes the free energy with respect to the Turner nearest neighbor energy zzso By dynamic programming, we zzso zzso for all values of k in time zzso and space zzso zzso zzso the partition function zzso zzso zzso zzso where the sum is over all secondary structures of a which have k base zzso the latter zzso is performed simultaneously for all values of k in zzso time and zzso zzso Lastly, using the partition function zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso rigorously samples the collection of saturated secondary structures zzso secondary zzso having k base zzso for zzso this provides a zzso form of zzso sampling zzso and Lawrence, zzso Using zzso zzso we zzso the ensemble free energy for saturated secondary structures having k base pairs, zzso show zzso of the Turner model, zzso demonstrate a zzso phase transition, zzso illustrate the zzso advantage of zzso for precursor zzso zzso of zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2001), zzso illustrate the zzso shapes zzso et zzso 2004) of sampled secondary structures zzso saturated zzso having exactly k base zzso A web server for zzso is under construction at zzso
