The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso cloned and zzso Unlike zzso where it is zzso the zzso zzso gene maps to zzso zzso subdivision zzso by in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Of the six zzso present, four are positioned zzso to those of the zzso zzso one is similarly zzso and one is zzso A 1 zzso zzso zzso potentially encodes a zzso zzso acid protein of an estimated 45 zzso zzso acid comparisons between the deduced protein and previously known zzso zzso revealed zzso identity between zzso and zzso and zzso identity between zzso and zzso or zzso zzso Northern analysis detected a zzso regulated transcript about 2 zzso in zzso Since this gene is known to control adult eye color in other flies, its cloning from zzso zzso provides the basis for a dominant zzso marker for zzso zzso one whose zzso unlike that of white, is not cell zzso
