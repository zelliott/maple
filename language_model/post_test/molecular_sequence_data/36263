The present report identifies an important zzso region of the zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso for the two types of zzso seen in zzso zzso disease and zzso idiopathic zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain with no important functional zzso is contained within zzso zzso and involves zzso zzso in zzso There are zzso zzso the zzso domain on the zzso portion of the zzso which are the zzso and high affinity zzso binding sites: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the zzso portion of the external domain, centered on zzso zzso are zzso interactions linked to low affinity zzso binding important for signal zzso zzso 40 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are zzso in human and rat zzso are not present in zzso zzso and are each related to separate actions of zzso binding zzso signal zzso They can, therefore, account for organ specific zzso and the different disease expression zzso by zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that, in the zzso hormonal zzso insulin, zzso zzso suppression of class I genes might be one means of preserving zzso in the face of the hormone action to increase the expression of tissue specific genes such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso high class I expression in the zzso zzso if induced by zzso zzso or some as yet unknown agent, would contribute to the generation of zzso zzso Thus, it would result in increased zzso presentation to the immune system, particularly those zzso increased by zzso and its zzso signal such as zzso or zzso zzso or whose turnover is increased by zzso and its zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso In the case of the latter, zzso zzso known to be near a zzso sensitive site on the zzso zzso would now act as a potent zzso and induce the formation of zzso zzso It is further proposed that zzso and high doses of zzso are zzso effective agents in zzso zzso disease because they, in part, decrease zzso class I gene zzso Speculation is presented which suggests that elimination of negative regulation of zzso class I and the zzso zzso is an important factor in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
