zzso protein zzso the only zzso component of the zzso is involved in translation factor binding and in the zzso zzso zzso The gene for zzso from zzso zzso was cloned and the protein expressed at high levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was achieved under zzso conditions via heat treatment and two zzso zzso zzso zzso melting profiles were monitored at 222 zzso showing the melting temperature of the protein at pH zzso around 110 degrees C, compared to approximately 60 degrees C for the highly zzso zzso coli zzso The unfolding was zzso and zzso closely followed the path of the zzso zzso Dynamic light zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso experiments suggested that under zzso buffer conditions zzso zzso zzso exists as a zzso The protein was zzso under two conditions, yielding an zzso zzso and a cubic zzso space group with an estimated two and three to four zzso molecules per zzso unit, zzso The zzso contained the full-length zzso and zzso buffers were developed which improved the mosaic spreads and the resolution zzso For the structure solution zzso was zzso to zzso at two separate positions, the zzso forms expressed as zzso zzso and zzso
