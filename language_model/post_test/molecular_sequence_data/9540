This study introduces a novel DNA sampling method in zzso using skin zzso We assessed the zzso of skin zzso zzso for genetic studies by amplifying a set of 17 zzso markers in the zzso zzso zzso zzso including 14 new zzso zzso and a set of 11 zzso markers in zzso zzso from DNA collected with zzso zzso (the standard zzso zzso zzso skin zzso and zzso skin zzso We tested for quality and quantity of collected DNA with each method by comparing zzso migration zzso The consistency between zzso obtained from skin zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso performed better than zzso zzso in both species, possibly due to differences in skin zzso zzso swabbing proved to be a useful alternative to zzso swabbing for small or vulnerable zzso by drastically limiting zzso this method may improve the zzso between the scientific value of collected data, individual welfare and species zzso In addition, the 14 new zzso zzso for the zzso zzso will increase the power of genetic studies in this zzso In four populations from France zzso the number of zzso per locus varied from 2 to 16 and expected zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected in two markers and two pairs displayed zzso zzso No locus appeared to be zzso
