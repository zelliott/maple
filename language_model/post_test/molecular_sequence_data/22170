The interaction between zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso complex relies on the interplay of compatible sets of donor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso are essential for the formation of a defined zzso template, thereby directing the synthesis of a specific zzso zzso Without the selectivity provided by different sets of zzso zzso zzso should form random zzso templates, which would ultimately lead to zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to exploit this inherent zzso potential of zzso zzso Based on sequence alignments between zzso zzso the zzso between different zzso systems was predicted and zzso zzso Furthermore, key zzso important for maintaining (or zzso zzso interaction were zzso Point zzso of one of these key zzso within the zzso zzso domain of zzso was sufficient to shift its selectivity from the zzso donor zzso of zzso toward the zzso donor zzso domain of zzso Finally, an artificial zzso complex was constructed, constituted of zzso derived from three different zzso zzso By virtue of domain zzso the interactions between all zzso were established by the same set of zzso zzso Because of the zzso zzso this universal communication system was able to simultaneously form two zzso complexes that zzso the zzso synthesis of different zzso zzso
