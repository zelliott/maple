zzso of the genes of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to contain sequences zzso to those recognizable by the regulatory protein zzso in the promoters of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as regions partially zzso to the binding sites of another regulatory zzso zzso in the promoters of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The role of the zzso regulatory systems zzso and zzso in the regulation of expression of the genes of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso strains of zzso zzso and zzso coli was studied by using zzso zzso It was established that the expression of these genes in zzso zzso zzso cells is zzso controlled by the zzso zzso regulatory system, whereas the expression of these genes in zzso coli cells is not controlled by the regulatory proteins zzso or zzso Presumably, regulatory systems of the response to zzso zzso analogous to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso also function in other representatives of the zzso zzso
