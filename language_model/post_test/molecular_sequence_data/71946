For most zzso zzso formation requires the expression of both surface zzso zzso and zzso in the same cell, and evidence suggests that fusion involves a specific interaction between the zzso and F proteins zzso Hu et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The stalk region of the zzso disease virus zzso zzso protein has been implicated in both fusion promotion and virus specificity of that zzso The zzso F protein contains two zzso repeat motifs which have been shown by zzso zzso to be critical for fusion zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994; zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat motifs mediate zzso interactions by enabling the formation of coiled zzso Upon analysis of the stalk region of the zzso zzso zzso we identified two zzso zzso Secondary structure analysis of these repeats suggested the potential for these regions to form alpha zzso To investigate the importance of this sequence motif for fusion promotion, we zzso the zzso zzso zzso acids of each zzso repeat to zzso or zzso In addition, zzso zzso acids in other positions were also changed to zzso Every zzso protein retained levels of attachment activity that was greater than or equal to the zzso protein activity and bound to zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso Every zzso however, showed a dramatic decrease in fusion promotion zzso The zzso of these zzso proteins indicate that individual zzso acids within the zzso repeat region of the stalk domain of the zzso protein are important for the fusion promotion activity of the zzso These data are consistent with the idea that the zzso protein associates with the F protein via specific interactions between the zzso repeat regions of both zzso
