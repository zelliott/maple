zzso of the expression of the zzso zzso virus zzso type 2 large zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene was studied directly by zzso or by zzso zzso analysis with hybrid zzso promoter zzso In zzso cells, zzso with DNA zzso zzso zzso or zzso proteins or zzso zzso enhanced expression at least zzso In contrast, expression was minimally enhanced by DNA zzso zzso at low doses and slightly reduced at high zzso zzso zzso was minimal in primary zzso and cells from line zzso However, zzso enhanced expression zzso in all cell zzso zzso elements in the zzso promoter include a zzso element and other sequences associated with regulation of zzso gene expression and potential zzso consensus zzso and zzso zzso factor 1 binding zzso zzso that bind to the zzso promoter were identified in mock and zzso cell zzso zzso complex formation, presumably involving zzso was demonstrated by gel zzso analysis with zzso of zzso cell nuclear extracts and zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor 1 motif zzso was necessary for optimal zzso binding to the zzso promoter as evidenced by competition experiments with zzso overlapping the consensus zzso promoter zzso response zzso The data suggest that zzso can be regulated as an zzso zzso
