An zzso was developed against a zzso zzso of zzso which contains a part of the zzso site, and applied to zzso muscle zzso The zzso abolished active tension generation of the zzso but did not block their assumption of a rigor state nor their release from this state by zzso The primary zzso acid sequence of the zzso site on the zzso was found to be the region containing zzso zzso This sequence region is predicted to have interesting secondary structures, and is distinct from the proposed zzso zzso We discuss the possibility that the region is responsible for the zzso step in muscle zzso
