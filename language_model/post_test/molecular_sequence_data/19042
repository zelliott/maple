Sixteen bacterial strains were isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso plants originated from the North zzso State Natural Reserve zzso zzso zzso analysis of these strains was performed using partial zzso zzso gene and internally transcribed zzso zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso belong to three families of root zzso zzso Twelve of them were related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso but four strains can be most probably identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso was zzso with ITS zzso but displayed more zzso for zzso zzso which formed a single group at the level of 30 % zzso We expect that the zzso obtained can belong to new zzso at zzso species or subspecies zzso The results of zzso amplification of the zzso genes zzso and zzso showed their presence in all zzso zzso and one zzso zzso The zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso zzso were closely related to those of the species zzso zzso zzso zzso but formed separate clusters and did not zzso with any reference zzso The presence of the zzso zzso which is necessary for zzso of Afghan peas zzso zzso zzso originated from the Middle East, allows the speculation that these zzso pea zzso may be the closest existing relatives of zzso zzso Thus, the studies of genetic diversity and symbiotic genes of zzso zzso zzso provide the primary information about their zzso and contribute to the conservation of this zzso zzso zzso
