zzso of zzso DNA zzso single zzso zzso zzso and zzso is crucial for disease diagnosis, which requires accurate and sensitive detection methods and zzso due to zzso zzso We report here the characterization of zzso for zzso zzso with ragged red fibers syndrome using chemically zzso zzso zzso and a mass zzso zzso solid phase capture zzso single base extension zzso zzso The method effectively eliminates zzso zzso and primer zzso and the presence of zzso zzso between the base and zzso allows efficient zzso and release of the DNA products from solid phase for zzso zzso This approach is capable of high zzso and the use of different length zzso for each of the zzso and each of the zzso permits better discrimination of the four bases by zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were accurately determined on different zzso zzso The specificity of the method for zzso detection was validated by using zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of the approach permitted detection of less than zzso zzso zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso approach based on chemically zzso zzso zzso and zzso enables zzso accurate, and sensitive zzso of zzso and has broad applications for genetic zzso
