zzso of the common bean zzso zzso and the zzso bean zzso zzso contain a family of plant zzso proteins that includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso These zzso proteins differ by the absence of short zzso at the surface of the protein and by the presence of a zzso processing site zzso that allows alpha zzso to be zzso zzso and zzso We now report the derived zzso acid sequence of two zzso zzso zzso proteins that are not zzso zzso although they have the typical processing zzso One protein is from the common zzso and the other from the zzso zzso On a zzso these proteins are grouped with alpha zzso rather than with the zzso or zzso alpha zzso differs from zzso primarily by the deletion of a zzso segment from the middle of the zzso zzso When alpha zzso is expressed in zzso it is zzso processed to form an active zzso However, zzso sequences are not zzso We suggest that the zzso proteins may be an intermediate in the evolution of an active alpha zzso
