The zzso strain zzso isolated from an zzso environment, is able to efficiently zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with a zzso reporter zzso yielded two knockout derivatives deficient in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the DNA zzso the zzso insertions in the two zzso identified two adjacent open reading zzso named zzso and zzso as well as a putative promoter upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicated that these genes are organized in an zzso zzso The proteins zzso by zzso and zzso share 64 and zzso identity with the small zzso zzso and the large zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso Ellis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Kuhn, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso almost all zzso acids involved in zzso interactions in both zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the corresponding sequences of strain zzso An additional zzso zzso zzso signal zzso sequence was detected at the N zzso of the protein zzso by zzso strongly suggesting that the zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso to its known zzso zzso
