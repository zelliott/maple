In zzso fish, sex differences in several behavioral and zzso traits have been assumed to reflect underlying sex differences in the central expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso expression patterns of these molecules have not been fully characterized in the zzso zzso In the present study, we therefore systematically evaluated sex differences in their expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The most prominent sex difference was observed in zzso expression in the nucleus zzso zzso zzso and the zzso part of the nucleus zzso zzso zzso in the zzso where the expression was completely zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso was also evident in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso area zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso area zzso and zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso In contrast, the overall expression levels of it and zzso were higher in the female brain than in the male zzso Equally importantly, no conspicuous sex differences were observed in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso despite several previous reports of their zzso expression in the brains of other zzso zzso Taken together, these data have uncovered previously unidentified sex differences in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso brain, which may possibly be relevant to sexual zzso in some behavioral and/or zzso traits, and have simultaneously highlighted potential species differences in the roles of these zzso
