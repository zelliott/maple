zzso is a human protein zzso belonging to the cell division cycle 2 zzso zzso family, and is the zzso zzso of a zzso complex that contains several cellular zzso zzso complexes from several cell lines and zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso basic protein zzso In the present work, we have found that zzso is zzso by zzso complexes on both zzso and zzso zzso Two different zzso raised to zzso zzso virtually identical zzso activities, as zzso by zzso zzso mapping and zzso acid zzso We have identified the zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a major zzso site for zzso In addition, our results suggest that one of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also selectively zzso by zzso These data, together with analysis of different zzso zzso derived from sites on zzso that are zzso by zzso indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso In addition, our results show that zzso has a zzso site specificity distinguishable from those of the zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso
