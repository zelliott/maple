We constructed a hybrid zzso zzso zzso virus zzso bearing both a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso envelope protein zzso on its zzso The zzso zzso consisting of a surface domain of zzso and the zzso two-thirds of zzso zzso was expressed on the cell zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso zzso was incorporated into the zzso as efficiently as the zzso zzso zzso The hybrid zzso could zzso human zzso cells (although not with high zzso only if the cells were expressing human zzso virus type 1 zzso This method of zzso incorporation into a zzso may lead to a development of a zzso zzso zzso for targeting gene zzso
