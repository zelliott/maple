The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso presents a specificity zzso towards zzso and zzso zzso incompatible with use in direct zzso The corresponding zzso variable zzso zzso cloned and produced in zzso coli, exhibited a zzso lower affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso and a slightly increased specificity zzso for the zzso zzso zzso revealed critical zzso involved in zzso recognition and produced zzso exhibiting up to a zzso increase of the binding affinity for zzso and up to a zzso decrease of the zzso with zzso A comparative model of the zzso zzso complex was built in which the zzso zzso is buried into the binding pocket while the zzso 6- and zzso are zzso exposed, agreeing with the lack of specificity for these three zzso Two potential alternative zzso of the zzso one close to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the other one close to zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been considered for the zzso of zzso none of which could be zzso privileged taking into account data from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For both zzso zzso is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the zzso group with zzso zzso and zzso in the first case, or zzso only, in the second case and by van der zzso contacts from zzso with zzso or zzso of zzso respectively, and from zzso and zzso with the opposite zzso To zzso the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso as compared with that of another zzso zzso zzso single variable zzso zzso and zzso and zzso hybrids have been zzso The binding activity of zzso as well as the specificity of the zzso hybrid, both similar to zzso zzso revealed a prominent role of zzso in zzso zzso These findings establish zzso for zzso engineering to reduce zzso especially with zzso
