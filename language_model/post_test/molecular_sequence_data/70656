The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso death domain module similar to that of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso Here, we describe the selection of zzso zzso from a zzso library using a variation of the zzso zzso zzso method directed to the death domain of zzso The binding sites on the death domain of zzso were identified for a 15 zzso acid zzso zzso by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The selected peptides may be useful for probing the function of the zzso death domain and aid in defining its downstream zzso zzso
