The first zzso of the human Pro alpha zzso collagen gene contains an zzso zzso composed of both positive and negative zzso elements involved in the zzso regulation of this zzso zzso of a 360 zzso zzso 3A zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso to zzso zzso resulted in dramatic zzso of zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso protection zzso we demonstrate a single footprint located at zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso nuclear extracts prepared from zzso and zzso cells exhibited similar binding zzso A double stranded zzso representing a consensus zzso binding sequence zzso with zzso for zzso In contrast to what occurred in response to zzso deletion which was always accompanied by reduced zzso the deletion of the zzso binding site zzso to zzso caused either increased or decreased expression of the reporter gene depending on the target zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of Pro alpha zzso were also tested in transient expression zzso zzso with the paradoxical results of zzso zzso we observed that the functional consequences of zzso in the zzso site also varied in different zzso In zzso cells, one point zzso which resulted in the loss of protein binding to zzso led to increased zzso activity while another point zzso which retained binding of the zzso like zzso zzso showed decreased zzso zzso The effects of these two zzso in the zzso cells were exactly opposite of what was seen for zzso zzso Based on these zzso we zzso that the zzso site plays a critical role in the zzso activity of the human Pro alpha zzso zzso The implications of an apparently dual mode of regulation through a single zzso element are zzso
