The zzso characterization and zzso of zzso zzso genetic zzso are becoming increasingly important in the vaccine zzso We investigated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in 30 Korean zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso was amplified using zzso chain reaction zzso followed by zzso All of the zzso zzso Korean zzso were one type of zzso zzso which were identical to that of the zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso could not be used as a genetic marker for identifying or zzso zzso zzso Korean zzso It revealed that the zzso pattern was acquired basically by zzso and modification or deletion event of a 33 zzso zzso ended by zzso zzso zzso and that there were at least three complete and one partial 33 zzso sequences within the zzso region in the longest cases such as those of South Korean and zzso zzso In addition, we clustered zzso zzso zzso with zzso criteria on the basis of zzso zzso patterns zzso zzso
