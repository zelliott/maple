Human zzso a new member of the zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso family, zzso certain zzso drugs, such as zzso To investigate the roles of this zzso we cloned a mouse zzso of zzso from a mouse heart zzso library, named zzso The deduced mouse zzso protein is zzso identical with that of human zzso and possesses features common to the ABC zzso It was found that zzso was mainly expressed in the liver and heart, similar to human zzso We further evaluated the effect of acute zzso (a zzso for zzso intoxication on the zzso expression of zzso using northern zzso with a 3' zzso region as a probe to avoid zzso with other zzso zzso Following acute zzso infusion, the zzso expression of zzso was significantly reduced in the liver zzso h after injection zzso of vehicle zzso but not in the heart and zzso zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction analysis confirmed the reduction in zzso zzso Similar reductions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso A comparable amount of zzso did not affect zzso zzso expression in the zzso The results suggest that zzso may play a role in zzso metabolism in the zzso
