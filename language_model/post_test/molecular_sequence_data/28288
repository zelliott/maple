We describe the molecular identification of a zzso designated zzso whose expression in mouse zzso zzso cells is strongly induced by the zzso and zzso zzso and by zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso as predicted from its primary sequence and shown by in zzso zzso The protein was processed at its zzso zzso and extensively modified by zzso zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso with the zzso data base zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed similarity to the human zzso zzso a tumor marker which is zzso in colon zzso and in fetal zzso zzso sequence similarity has also been observed to the short zzso region of other proteins which, like zzso zzso are zzso by members of the zzso gene zzso
