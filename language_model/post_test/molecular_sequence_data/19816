Fifty percent of lung zzso harbor zzso zzso in six genes that zzso proteins in the zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We performed zzso profiling of a large cohort of lung zzso to uncover other potential zzso zzso in genes of this signaling zzso that could contribute to lung zzso 

We analyzed zzso DNA from a total of 261 zzso clinically zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso The coding sequences of 39 genes were screened for zzso zzso via zzso zzso sequencing of zzso gene zzso zzso were considered to be zzso only if they were found in an independent zzso zzso product but not in matched normal zzso zzso of zzso of tumor sequence identified 239 putative genetic zzso We further examined 22 zzso found in zzso family genes and 135 zzso localized to zzso zzso the zzso domain of respective zzso We identified a total of 37 zzso zzso zzso 36 were found collectively in zzso zzso zzso and zzso One zzso zzso was a previously zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso zzso identified in 1 of 158 zzso The zzso zzso is analogous to a reported zzso zzso zzso in zzso and is located in the same zzso as a previously reported zzso domain zzso in zzso zzso in a lung zzso cell zzso 

This study is one of the first comprehensive zzso analyses of major genes in a specific signaling zzso in a zzso cohort of lung zzso Our results suggest the majority of zzso zzso within zzso genes in the zzso signaling zzso have already been zzso Our findings also zzso zzso in the zzso of a subset of lung zzso
