The potential role of ticks as zzso of zzso species has recently been zzso In this study, we investigated the presence of zzso species in zzso ticks removed from humans in zzso Province, zzso By using zzso derived from the zzso heat shock protein gene zzso zzso DNA was amplified and zzso from four zzso zzso ticks zzso To confirm this finding, we performed amplification and partial sequencing of the zzso protein and the cell division protein zzso zzso zzso This process allowed us to definitively identify zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA in the four zzso zzso of zzso zzso in these ticks might represent a highly sensitive form of zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso identified from zzso zzso a common European tick and the zzso of various zzso zzso The role of ticks in the transmission of zzso should be further zzso
