Nuclear DNA of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso nuclear zzso via specific zzso attachment regions zzso In order to investigate the interactions between zzso DNA and nuclear zzso isolated the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso As the first zzso random zzso library was set up and then the binding affinity of the selected clones to nuclear zzso was tested in this zzso Three DNA fragments were found to bind specifically to the nuclear zzso in zzso which two were strong zzso and all contained known consensus motifs and a hairpin loop structure of zzso
