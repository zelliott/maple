zzso in zzso zzso was used to examine the expression of zzso for nerve growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in different brain regions of adult zzso and aged zzso zzso zzso The brain regions studied were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diagonal zzso and zzso Prior to zzso zzso zzso impaired as well as severely impaired animals were selected from a large group of old rats according to their performance in the Morris water zzso The impaired rats showed longer escape zzso and, thus, implicitly impaired performance in the place version of the task, but did not differ from adult controls on the platform crossing measure registered during the spatial probe zzso The severely impaired rats were significantly impaired on both measures, both in comparison with the adult animals and in comparison with the impaired aged zzso zzso of the zzso revealed no zzso or zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso The overall expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was found to be decreased in the impaired zzso as well as the severely impaired aged rats zzso A significant increase in zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso of the impaired rats in comparison with the severely impaired aged rats zzso and adult animals zzso These findings show that age-related maze performance deficits are accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels observed in impaired, but not severely impaired, aged rats may reflect an early manifestation of processes underlying age-related cognitive deficits and may constitute a zzso and/or zzso zzso since these rats displayed fewer deficits in navigation of the zzso
