zzso forms on and binds to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso when exposed to flowing zzso zzso These processes have been investigated by employing a human ex zzso zzso model, a synthetic zzso zzso and a zzso zzso factor zzso which zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on plastic zzso was prepared from cultures of zzso human zzso following brief exposure to zzso M zzso zzso blood was drawn directly from an zzso vein by a pump at zzso zzso and zzso zzso wall zzso rates over the zzso zzso positioned in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on the zzso was zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso inhibited zzso deposition by zzso at both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso had no effect on the zzso time in a modified zzso zzso zzso where zzso was initiated by zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating that the zzso zzso with the binding of zzso to the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso factor zzso which blocked the zzso activity ( zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the modified zzso zzso also inhibited zzso deposition on the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso at both zzso zzso In the absence of either zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and more so at zzso zzso zzso zzso formation on the zzso coat was in particular pronounced at zzso zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly through tissue zzso and that the resulting zzso zzso forming on the surface zzso rapid zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the binding of zzso to the zzso may indicate the presence of specific zzso zzso binding zzso with a recognition sequence of zzso
