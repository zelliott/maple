zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso is an abundant, ubiquitous protein that binds zzso and DNA sequences specifically, and has been implicated in the zzso regulation of the human complement zzso 2 zzso We found that in zzso expression of zzso zzso fusion proteins increased the zzso activity of a zzso reporter zzso providing direct proof that zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso We found, using truncated zzso zzso proteins fused to zzso that 29 zzso acids in the zzso region are critical for zzso We established, using a series of zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso that the tandem zzso zzso alone were not able to bind zzso zzso Nevertheless, 24 additional zzso acids of the zzso imparted zzso DNA zzso zzso using zzso zzso supported the importance of the zzso region in DNA zzso and suggested the involvement of the zzso alternative insert which is present in zzso B and zzso The zzso had an zzso effect on binding of zzso zzso to zzso but not to zzso zzso Although both zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound DNA, only the B zzso recognized DNA in zzso We propose that the B zzso of zzso zzso functions in the nucleus as a zzso zzso and has distinct zzso and zzso zzso
