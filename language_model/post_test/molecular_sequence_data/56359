zzso a human zzso cell line, can be persistently infected with zzso zzso We performed detailed serial analysis of zzso DNA replication and zzso zzso of synchronized zzso zzso zzso appeared as an early event following infection, with viral zzso detected about 6 zzso after zzso In contrast, zzso intermediate forms of zzso DNA did not appear until more than 16 zzso after zzso Northern analysis of specific transcripts showed an earlier appearance of zzso protein zzso (6 zzso compared to zzso protein zzso (24 zzso The addition of an inhibitor of protein synthesis to block synthesis of zzso protein abolished zzso protein zzso zzso as well as DNA zzso zzso extension analysis confirmed the initiation of all zzso from the single zzso zzso zzso zzso precedes DNA replication of zzso zzso in these cells, and zzso processing may have a major role in regulating gene zzso
