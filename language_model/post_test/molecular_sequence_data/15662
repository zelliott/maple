zzso artifacts introduced during library preparation for the zzso Genome zzso increase the likelihood that an appreciable proportion of these sequences will be zzso and cause an uneven distribution of read coverage across the targeted sequencing zzso As a consequence, these zzso features result in difficulties in zzso assembly and variation analysis from the short reads, particularly when the sequences are from zzso with base compositions at the extremes of high or low zzso zzso Here we present an zzso method of library preparation, in which the cluster amplification step, rather than the zzso zzso for fully zzso template zzso reducing the zzso of duplicate zzso improving read mapping and single zzso zzso calling and aiding de zzso zzso We illustrate this by generating and analyzing DNA sequences from extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
