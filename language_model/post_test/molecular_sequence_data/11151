In a previous study with zzso of zzso it was proposed that core zzso of the folate zzso zzso is required for the proper folding of the protein zzso (1991) Blood 77, zzso The human zzso zzso type alpha and type beta have three and two candidate sites for zzso respectively, only one of which is zzso The significance of zzso at each of these zzso in the expression and function of zzso was examined by eliminating the sites both individually and in combination by introducing zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso showed that the zzso did not alter the synthetic rates of the zzso The zzso proteins were expressed in human zzso zzso Treatment with zzso and analysis by Western zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins revealed that all of the candidate sites in both zzso and zzso are zzso When all of the zzso sites were zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso respectively were expressed on the cell surface compared with the corresponding zzso zzso the residual zzso zzso in the cell zzso were unable to bind zzso zzso In both the zzso the inclusion of each additional zzso site partly contributed to restoration of cell surface zzso acid binding and zzso folate zzso Further, in zzso the introduction of an additional zzso site of zzso resulted in the enhancement of the expression of the cell surface zzso compared with the zzso zzso The results indicate that the total mass of zzso not a specific locus of the zzso is critical for the efficient folding and optimal expression of functional zzso and zzso
