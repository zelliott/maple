A general strategy for the construction of an internal standard for the zzso chain reaction zzso is described together with its application in the evaluation of clinical zzso This internal standard is a zzso containing a modified target sequence that is zzso with the native target using the same set of zzso The zzso reaction will generate two fragments of different size that are readily separated without the need for restriction zzso zzso zzso they are detected and zzso by zzso to the same zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA was chosen as a model for this competitive zzso The zzso proved to be a sensitive tool for the detection of zzso zzso and allowed zzso of zzso with a zzso variation zzso Despite limitations that appear inherent to the amplification process, internal standards appear to be useful tools for quantitative analysis by zzso
