The zzso of Alzheimer's disease involves zzso changes of A zzso A series of zzso recognizing a distinct zzso of A beta zzso zzso is useful for both understanding the mechanism of molecular conversion and identifying diagnostic and therapeutic zzso As A beta with various zzso can be prepared in zzso under varying zzso conditions, snapshot zzso can be isolated by directly binding to target molecules with zzso zzso We tested the feasibility of this zzso We show a feature of several A zzso zzso isolated from our human zzso zzso zzso library and particularly report the characteristics of an zzso zzso zzso selected from the zzso A beta zzso zzso B6 bound to zzso A beta zzso as well as zzso A beta zzso but not to soluble A beta zzso or A beta zzso B6 inhibited A beta zzso zzso formation with 600 zzso zzso in spite of being the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the binding site might be located at the zzso sheet of the zzso of A beta zzso Although it is believed that zzso zzso tend to show the capability to inhibit A beta zzso zzso B6 is the first human zzso zzso recognizing the zzso of A beta zzso
