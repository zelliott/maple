zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso carbon reduction cycle zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was isolated from cucumber leaves zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso contained zzso zzso with a complete open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso which was predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis by real-time zzso and western zzso revealed that zzso zzso was abundant in cucumber leaves and zzso in zzso fruits and zzso zzso activity and the gene expression at the zzso and protein levels was higher in zzso leaves (4th zzso zzso than in upper position leaves zzso and base position leaves zzso The zzso variation of zzso expression and zzso activity in the optimal functional leaf (4th zzso was a zzso curve, and the peak appeared at zzso on a sunny zzso Low temperature zzso and low light zzso induced zzso zzso but the expression level decreased after zzso of chilling zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso activity, zzso abundance and activities of other main zzso in Calvin cycle, and net zzso rate zzso in transgenic cucumber zzso zzso plants showed a higher ratio of female flower and yield relative to the wild type zzso zzso The decreases in zzso and zzso efficiency zzso were less in transgenic plants than that in zzso during low temperature and low light zzso
