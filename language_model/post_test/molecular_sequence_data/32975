Two zzso encephalitis zzso virus zzso were zzso mouse zzso strain zzso and its zzso adapted to zzso zzso zzso The zzso virus exhibited zzso zzso and slower replication in zzso cells, higher yield in zzso decreased zzso in mice, increased binding to zzso A total of 15 zzso zzso distinguished zzso of these zzso six zzso resulted in protein sequence zzso and two were in zzso Two zzso acid zzso in E protein were responsible for the observed zzso zzso Data obtained during reverse zzso of the zzso virus in zzso and in zzso suggest that zzso virus exists as a zzso population that contains virus zzso most adapted to reproduction in either ticks or zzso Host switch results in a change in the ratio of these zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso virus resulted in the prompt emergence of new zzso with different zzso for zzso
