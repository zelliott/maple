The complete coding sequence of rainbow trout zzso has been zzso The gene contains a short zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso open reading frame and a zzso zzso 3' zzso which includes a zzso zzso 7 zzso motifs and an 18 zzso zzso A zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso contains 3 potential zzso sites, with a predicted molecular weight of 29 zzso and shows between 49 and zzso zzso acid similarity to zzso zzso and 57% similarity to carp zzso Greatest zzso was apparent within the secondary structure of the zzso with few of the zzso acids known to bind to the zzso zzso being zzso No ICE cut site was apparent but multiple alignment with zzso sequences allowed a putative mature zzso of 166 zzso acids to be identified, in which zzso be the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that whilst no zzso expression was zzso in head kidney zzso immediately after isolation, expression could be induced by stimulation with zzso for 4 h in zzso Similarly, with isolated head kidney zzso expression was significantly increased following stimulation with zzso
