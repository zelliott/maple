Little is known about zzso zzso strains because no zzso strains that can zzso the host plants have been isolated from zzso zzso zzso we studied the diversity of the zzso zzso strains by using molecular zzso zzso strains inhabiting root zzso of nine zzso species were zzso The zzso species used represent the zzso diversity and geographic range of the zzso therefore, the breadth of the diversity of zzso strains that zzso zzso zzso was zzso DNA was amplified directly from zzso material by using the zzso The amplified region included the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a large portion of the zzso zzso zzso A series of restriction zzso zzso of the zzso product allowed us to identify zzso zzso length zzso zzso groups among the zzso zzso strains zzso Twelve different zzso were used, which resulted in four different zzso zzso The groups did not follow the zzso lines of the zzso host zzso Instead, the zzso strains present were related to the sample collection zzso
