zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and the corresponding gene was cloned and zzso The zzso had similar structural properties to the zzso zzso of zzso coli, but differed in its zzso properties, such as zzso zzso pH dependency and kinetic zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso but not the reductive zzso of zzso The zzso reaction required the addition of cell extract and zzso suggesting the existence of additional zzso zzso Further analysis of the zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing revealed that the two zzso are zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso but do not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso but was not active in stimulating zzso zzso zzso zzso the novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were essential for the reductive zzso of zzso These observations indicate that the novel zzso protein is an zzso factor, which is involved in the reverse zzso reaction of zzso zzso
