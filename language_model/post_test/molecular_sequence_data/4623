zzso zzso coli zzso are the major cause of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are expressed by most strains bearing the colonization factor zzso The zzso gene cluster determining zzso zzso has been previously cloned and zzso and it has been shown that zzso encodes the major zzso zzso and zzso zzso an assembly zzso In the work described here we have sought to define the surface exposed zzso on zzso and to manipulate them so that zzso can be used as a means of expressing foreign zzso zzso on the bacterial zzso Using a panel of 21 zzso zzso which we have used in western zzso zzso zzso and colony zzso together with computer predictions, we have identified three zzso within zzso Two of these sites were zzso for zzso and we have introduced, zzso either an zzso from the B zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or the entire coding sequence of mature ST zzso stable zzso to construct hybrid zzso These proteins could be assembled into hybrid zzso which could be recognized by zzso to both zzso and the foreign zzso as shown by zzso zzso and colony zzso The zzso of the zzso has been evaluated following both oral and zzso zzso of mice with the attenuated zzso zzso strain zzso zzso the hybrid zzso zzso Although zzso stability is currently a problem, these experiments showed that zzso to both the carrier and the foreign zzso were zzso
