zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso an extremely zzso zzso were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso About 1200 spots were detected with silver zzso on the gel between pH 3 and zzso According to the zzso size of zzso zzso we consider that more than half of the proteins in the cell are zzso on a two-dimensional zzso Using zzso standard marker zzso the molecular weight and zzso point of each protein spot were zzso The average molecular weight and zzso point values were estimated to be 30 zzso and zzso zzso The average size and zzso point of detected protein from zzso zzso were smaller and more zzso than those from zzso zzso After the protein spots had been zzso onto a zzso zzso membrane and stained with zzso zzso Blue, the zzso zzso acid sequences were determined for about zzso protein zzso Few proteins had blocked zzso Some spots were identified as proteins whose sequences had been reported previously from zzso zzso Others had zzso acid sequences zzso with those of various proteins from other zzso The zzso acid sequence information of this report will be useful for obtaining stable proteins and for identifying open reading frames determined from the zzso DNA zzso Considering its small zzso size and protein stability, zzso zzso will be an excellent candidate for studying the molecular biology of an zzso living cell at the atomic zzso
