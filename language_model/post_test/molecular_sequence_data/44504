zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso in different zzso but no functional zzso gene has been characterized in the mouse so zzso We have cloned an zzso zzso from a mouse fetal zzso library, zzso screened with zzso versus zzso zzso zzso We showed this gene contains a region zzso to the reverse and complementary zzso zzso We believe such a structure could have been generated by zzso during the evolution of both zzso and zzso gene zzso The sequence coding for zzso is zzso zzso to the mouse zzso gene at the zzso level and differs in only one zzso acid at the protein zzso The high degree of zzso between these genes and the zzso zzso zzso from other zzso reveals the conservation of these zzso class of zzso throughout zzso Analysis of gene expression reveals a zzso regulation concurrent with zzso zzso with the highest level of transcript detection zzso with zzso onset during both zzso and zzso
