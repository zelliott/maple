As a problem in molecular recognition and for drug discovery, great interest has developed around the possibility that zzso structures could be zzso by peptides and other small zzso Although small peptides have been shown to have the capacity to discriminate specific zzso and zzso in zzso zzso discrimination of double zzso regions by a zzso zzso has not been zzso Indeed, the most accessible part of an zzso zzso is the minor groove, and fundamental zzso considerations have suggested that discrimination of at least some base pairs would be difficult in the minor zzso Here we report the design and isolation of a zzso zzso that zzso the most subtle kind of discrimination of base pair differences in the zzso minor zzso zzso discrimination of a single atomic group is demonstrated as well as the difference between two different angular zzso of the same zzso This report of zzso zzso discrimination by a zzso zzso suggests a richer potential for zzso minor groove recognition than previously zzso
