DNA repair zzso play a pivotal role in zzso zzso Within the gene zzso for the base zzso repair zzso zzso several zzso zzso have been zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso that is less capable of initiating DNA zzso We developed a multiplex zzso zzso to simultaneously detect two zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Both of these zzso resulted in zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso 399 changes zzso into zzso and deletion of A in the second position of zzso zzso results in a zzso We established the frequency of these zzso in zzso patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso zzso of G in second position of zzso 399 and A in the second position zzso zzso are zzso and zzso respectively, in these zzso This fast and reliable method allows for simultaneous detection of the zzso zzso C or CT zzso instead of the A deletion at zzso zzso The method may be used in zzso studies of zzso zzso
