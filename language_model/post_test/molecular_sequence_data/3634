zzso tune the function of their zzso by zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso Both zzso line the zzso exit channel of the zzso at the binding site of zzso zzso and zzso B zzso Resistance to the zzso zzso which is produced by zzso zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso and a database search against all presently available sequences revealed a further two dozen zzso from a wide variety of zzso No zzso were found among the zzso or zzso The bacterial sequences adhere to the species zzso and segregate into two groups, in which the zzso sequences align with zzso and the zzso with zzso zzso in more than 20 species tested, the distribution of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso at zzso and the zzso zzso at zzso perfectly matches the bacterial zzso Cloning and expression of representative zzso genes showed that this specificity of zzso is determined solely by the zzso zzso and is independent of the origin of the zzso zzso This is the first case in which the position of an zzso zzso defines a sharp division between the zzso and zzso zzso Given the zzso and distribution of these zzso we propose a change in the nomenclature of zzso to zzso zzso large zzso zzso and of zzso to zzso
