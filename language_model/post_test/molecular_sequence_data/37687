zzso is a zzso gene that is involved in synthesis of the zzso coli zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a repeating unit of zzso zzso The equivalent structural O zzso in the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso strains is zzso zzso with an excess of one zzso in the zzso zzso We have cloned zzso genes from these zzso and zzso strains and shown by genetic and functional studies that zzso is the only gene determining the zzso structure of zzso or zzso Based on functional analysis of zzso genes and zzso zzso we showed that a single zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso of zzso coli zzso converts the zzso zzso into zzso DNA sequencing revealed the substitution to be zzso in other zzso coli zzso zzso The reverse zzso zzso in zzso of zzso coli zzso resulted in zzso synthesis showing no zzso profile instead of the conversion of zzso to zzso This suggests that more than one zzso acid substitution in zzso is required for conversion from zzso to zzso
