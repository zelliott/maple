zzso inflammation is a hallmark feature of asthma and a driver of airway zzso zzso is a key zzso of airway inflammation in zzso models of respiratory disease, but a role for zzso has not been demonstrated in zzso 

We sought to test the efficacy of a zzso zzso to human zzso in a zzso monkey model of lung zzso 

Using zzso monkeys zzso zzso that are zzso to zzso zzso through natural exposure, we developed a zzso model of acute airway inflammation after zzso A zzso zzso zzso This model was used to test the in zzso efficacy of zzso a mouse zzso directed against human zzso and zzso the humanized counterpart of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso fluid were collected before and after zzso challenge and zzso for cellular content by means of differential zzso 

Total zzso cell count, zzso number, and zzso number were all reduced in animals treated with zzso or zzso compared with values in control animals that were zzso given zzso or treated with human zzso of irrelevant zzso In addition, levels of zzso and zzso in zzso fluid were reduced in zzso animals compared with levels seen in control zzso 

These findings support a role for zzso in maintaining lung inflammation in response to zzso challenge in nonhuman zzso 

zzso zzso with a specific zzso could be a useful therapeutic strategy for zzso
