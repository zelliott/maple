zzso zzso is the major zzso agent causing zzso and zzso outbreaks zzso We developed a novel duplex real-time quantitative zzso zzso designed for the simultaneous detection of and discrimination between zzso zzso zzso and zzso by targeting the short junction region between zzso and zzso with sensitivity and efficiency comparable to those of each zzso zzso zzso This new duplex zzso was evaluated against clinical stool zzso zzso zzso and environmental zzso or surface water, zzso zzso zzso specimens from South Korea, and the results were compared with those of conventional zzso zzso zzso The duplex zzso detected more positive samples than did the zzso for both clinical zzso zzso zzso and, more zzso environmental (24 zzso 10) zzso No zzso against specimens containing other enteric viruses such as zzso zzso and zzso were zzso These results suggest that this newly developed duplex real-time zzso zzso can be used for the sensitive and simultaneous zzso detection of zzso in both clinical and environmental zzso
