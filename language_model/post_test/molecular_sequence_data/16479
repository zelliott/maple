The optical rotation and zzso zzso for zzso zzso systems were measured at pH 4, 7, and 10 to zzso the effect of pH on the zzso of zzso zzso The optical rotation study suggests that pH affects the zzso of zzso zzso chains and their zzso behavior but the zzso transition zzso By comparing the chain mobility estimated from the zzso zzso between different pH conditions, it has been revealed that the degree of expansion of zzso zzso chains varies with zzso These results indicate that the effect of pH is explained by the change in the zzso nature of zzso chains rather than in the shielding effect of hydrogen zzso surrounding zzso chains as a zzso zzso
