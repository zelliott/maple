zzso proteins zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso under the influence of zzso and consist of multiple charge zzso Evidence has been previously presented by this laboratory that these zzso zzso are distinct from serum zzso We have followed the zzso of the zzso zzso during two stages of zzso examined their properties and zzso acid zzso and attempted to clone their zzso Analysis of the charge forms present in zzso zzso by zzso zzso showed that forms 1 zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso predominated at Day 13, whereas forms 2 zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso were most abundant at Day zzso All four charge forms appeared to form stable complexes with zzso zzso and were recognized by zzso to human serum zzso on Western zzso Several zzso clones isolated from an zzso zzso library all appeared to code for a protein identical to classical zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of the first ten zzso of two of the more divergent charge forms of zzso zzso indicated complete sequence identity with pig serum zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso charge forms may be slightly modified forms of a single protein product corresponding to the classical form of zzso The change in appearance of the charge forms during zzso is probably due to chemical zzso These modifications do not appear to influence the binding of each charge form to zzso
