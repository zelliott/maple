This study describes the zzso sequencing and functional characterization of an zzso zzso channel zzso gene isolated from zzso zzso zzso of the freshwater zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso consisted of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso identity at the zzso level zzso zzso acid zzso with published fish sequences and zzso identity at the zzso level zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso Secondary structure of the zzso zzso closely resembled that of cloned zzso zzso zzso expression was exclusively restricted to zzso associated with zzso influx and was virtually zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with expression levels in zzso expression in zzso was zzso greater and expression was highest in zzso zzso zzso greater than in zzso Compared with baseline expression levels in zzso stage, expression of zzso in zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso stages of the zzso zzso This increase was localized primarily in the labyrinth and zzso canal, regions of the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso appears to be expressed in zzso associated with zzso zzso influx and relative expression is correlated with rate of zzso zzso
