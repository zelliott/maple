It is well known that the zzso zzso play an important role in the degradation of bone zzso zzso the purpose of this study was to clarify the prevention effect of bone zzso by milk zzso Using zzso reverse zzso we found a 20 zzso protein in milk which inhibited zzso zzso This zzso protein was identified as zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso B against zzso K was stronger than that of zzso zzso zzso B specifically inhibited zzso type zzso zzso such as zzso K and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso B inhibited zzso K zzso and the Ki value was zzso zzso The formation of zzso pits in the culture system was effectively inhibited by zzso M zzso B in zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso B inhibited degradation of type zzso by zzso zzso Using the zzso method in rat small zzso it was found that zzso was more easily absorbed from the zzso of young rats (5 zzso than from those of older rats (more than 20 zzso The zzso products of zzso B with zzso showed a similar zzso activity against zzso K to the intact zzso B zzso zzso zzso intake of zzso in milk and its zzso peptides are expected to help protect zzso bone zzso via zzso of zzso zzso K and zzso
