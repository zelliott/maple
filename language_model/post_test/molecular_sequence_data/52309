To provide an experimental system amenable to a detailed zzso and structural investigation of the zzso zzso zzso domain of the insulin zzso we developed a zzso zzso cell expression system from which tens of milligrams of the soluble zzso zzso (the zzso zzso can be routinely zzso using methods that do not require harsh zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein has a zzso radius of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso from which we calculate a zzso mass of 281 zzso zzso microscopic images, using both rotary zzso and negative zzso techniques, demonstrate a characteristic zzso for the zzso protein consisting of two zzso arms, with a zzso domain at each end, connected to each other at a point somewhat off-center to form a Y zzso Analysis using circular zzso and zzso zzso illustrate that insulin binding results in zzso changes in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso data reveal zzso mobility within the zzso protein that is successively frozen as a result of insulin zzso in contrast to results obtained in a previous study of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso This result suggests a divergence in zzso signaling mechanisms used by the insulin and zzso growth factor zzso
