The zzso class I-A and zzso genes of zzso zzso are highly zzso These genes zzso proteins presenting peptides to zzso T cells to initiate zzso immune zzso zzso events are one way the diversity of these zzso can be zzso Such events have been well characterized in humans, but have not been as well characterized in zzso In order to identify and examine zzso that create new zzso it is important to analyze zzso zzso zzso sequences have been shown to be important to understand the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the generation of major zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso Thus far, there have been relatively few zzso sequences reported for zzso class I zzso in zzso and this has hampered the understanding of zzso organization and evolution in zzso In this study, we present evidence of a gene conversion event generating the zzso zzso lineage by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A potential zzso between the zzso and zzso lineages was also observed, but it is less clear due to lack of zzso 2 zzso This report stresses the role that zzso can play in zzso class I diversity in zzso zzso and the importance of zzso in identifying and analyzing such zzso
