The human, zzso zzso vaccine zzso significantly reduced severe zzso zzso episodes in a clinical trial in South Africa and zzso but vaccine efficacy was lower in Malawi zzso than reported in South Africa zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to examine the molecular relationships of circulating zzso zzso detected during the clinical trial in Malawi to zzso (the strain contained in zzso and to common human zzso zzso Of 88 zzso zzso stool zzso 43 zzso exhibited identifiable zzso migration patterns when examined by zzso gel zzso The genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 5 representative strains possessing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso While their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were confirmed, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were either zzso or zzso indicating that they were of human zzso zzso zzso zzso using 21 zzso strains showed that Malawian zzso had a zzso zzso constellation common to either the zzso or the zzso like human zzso Overall, the Malawi strains appear similar in their genetic zzso to zzso described in countries where vaccine efficacy is greater, suggesting that the lower efficacy in Malawi is unlikely to be explained by the diversity of circulating zzso
