zzso and zzso zzso represent sister zzso within the zzso zzso zzso We used genetic zzso and bacterial artificial zzso zzso approaches to estimate the level of zzso between the zzso of these model plant zzso zzso of 82 tentative zzso gene pairs reveals a lack of extended zzso between the two zzso although marker zzso is frequently observed over small genetic zzso zzso estimates based on zzso zzso zzso suggest that a majority of the genes under analysis have experienced zzso in zzso subsequent to divergence of the two zzso potentially zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in cases of localized zzso genetically linked zzso in zzso zzso often share multiple points of zzso with zzso this latter observation is consistent with the large number of zzso zzso that compose the zzso zzso More detailed analysis, based on complete sequencing and zzso of three zzso zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso suggests that the two zzso are related by networks of zzso that are often highly zzso In some cases, the erosion of zzso could be ascribed to the selective gene loss from duplicated zzso whereas in other cases, it is due to the absence of close zzso of zzso zzso genes in zzso
