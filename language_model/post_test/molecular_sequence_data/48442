zzso zzso zzso are key regulators of the cell zzso In zzso zzso plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso and zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso during zzso in zzso we cloned a complete zzso sequence of zzso from the freshwater giant zzso zzso zzso and examined its zzso and expression in the developing zzso The prawn zzso zzso is zzso in length and encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein contains a zzso zzso binding motif zzso and shares high zzso with reported zzso zzso of other zzso zzso analysis showed a wide distribution of the zzso zzso in all tested zzso including the zzso zzso heart, muscles, zzso and zzso and the highest level of expression in the zzso and zzso zzso by in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso showed high expression in the zzso of zzso and the zzso of late zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso transcript is low in zzso high in zzso but reduced in zzso and zzso The high expression of the zzso transcripts in zzso zzso and zzso indicated that the zzso gene has the conservative function in the germ cells zzso during zzso
