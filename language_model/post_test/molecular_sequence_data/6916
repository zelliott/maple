The zzso specific transcript - 1 zzso represents the human zzso of the mouse zzso transcript, zzso within the tumor necrosis factor zzso region of the human major zzso complex class III zzso The gene is localized about 4 zzso upstream of the zzso beta zzso It spans a zzso zzso region encompassing the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 3 and a zzso zzso II restriction site 260 base pairs downstream of the zzso zzso Isolation of a full-length zzso clone revealed that zzso codes for zzso 800 zzso zzso which are present in zzso zzso T cells, zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso contains three long open reading frames zzso with the most likely zzso zzso a zzso zzso Its close linkage to the zzso genes and pattern of expression point toward a possible role for zzso in the immune zzso
