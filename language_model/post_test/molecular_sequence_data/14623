Tight regulation of cell cycle is of critical importance for zzso biology and is achieved through a combined action of a large number of highly specialized zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, as they execute sister zzso separation at zzso to zzso zzso In contrast to extensively studied zzso and zzso zzso very little is known about the role of zzso in plant zzso Here we describe the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso segregation in zzso and zzso models, discuss new emerging but zzso functions of zzso and highlight major gaps in our knowledge about plant zzso
