The zzso zzso zzso gene is required for zzso regulated zzso of zzso cell zzso in the zzso zzso encodes a large ( approximately 250 zzso protein with only one recognizable zzso acid sequence zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, at its C zzso It has been proposed that zzso zzso nuclear migration by linking the nucleus to the zzso organizing center zzso Here we perform genetic and zzso experiments that provide a critical test of this zzso We analyze zzso in the zzso zzso gene and also flies that express deleted forms of zzso protein from zzso We find that the zzso domain of zzso is critical for zzso zzso and for zzso In addition, we find that the zzso portion of zzso is also important for function and contains a domain that zzso the protein to zzso zzso to the zzso These results provide strong support for a model in which zzso links the nucleus to the zzso
