Two novel families of zzso zzso named zzso and zzso were cloned and characterized in a putative ancient asexual zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso is the founding member of a novel zzso of zzso zzso which also contains zzso families from the sea zzso and the zzso and forms a sister zzso to zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso exhibits evidence of relatively recent activity, zzso in high levels of sequence similarity between individual copies and a three- to zzso excess of synonymous zzso which is indicative of zzso zzso The zzso family may have very few copies with intact open reading zzso and exhibits neutral zzso ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso It can additionally be characterized by formation of zzso truncated head-to-head zzso All of these features make recent activity less likely than in the zzso zzso Our results are discussed in light of the evolutionary consequences of long-term zzso in general and in zzso zzso in zzso
