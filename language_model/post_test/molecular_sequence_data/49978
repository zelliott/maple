zzso a zzso protein found naturally in the cabbage zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our recent studies suggest that zzso consists of an zzso zzso domain, and a zzso region that binds to receptors on the surfaces of target cells and incorporates the protein into zzso The present study was undertaken to identify receptors for zzso The zzso and cloning experiments suggested that the proteins on cell membrane had no binding ability to zzso zzso zzso of zzso lipids from human cervical zzso zzso cells, which are highly sensitive to zzso indicated neutral zzso on the cell surface to show zzso zzso zzso zzso and TLC zzso using zzso zzso demonstrated two neutral zzso as active zzso Analysis of their structures with zzso zzso and negative secondary zzso mass zzso identified them as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso and zzso for zzso were also confirmed with these authentic zzso zzso mouse melanoma zzso cells were found to lack zzso zzso including zzso and zzso but zzso of the cells with zzso zzso or zzso enhanced their sensitivity to zzso Thus, zzso and zzso were proven to serve as zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso consists of possible zzso zzso of a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso which are essential for its structural zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso caused marked reduction of zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso binds to zzso and zzso receptors at the zzso region, in a manner similar to zzso and then exhibits zzso after incorporation into the zzso
