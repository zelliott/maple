The avian coronavirus infectious zzso virus zzso strain zzso is an zzso virus that has extended species zzso in cell zzso In order to understand the acquired zzso of the zzso strain, we compared the S protein sequences of several zzso zzso The zzso strain was found to contain a putative zzso zzso zzso site, indicating that the zzso virus may use HS as a selective zzso To ascertain the requirements of zzso HS for zzso zzso we zzso for zzso in the presence of soluble zzso as a competitor and determined zzso in zzso cell lines with no HS or zzso zzso Our results indicate that HS plays a role as an attachment factor for zzso working in concert with other factors like zzso acid to mediate virus binding to cells, and may explain in part the extended zzso of zzso zzso
