zzso A virus zzso is highly endemic in the zzso However, few data are available regarding zzso zzso circulating in this region of the zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize genetically zzso zzso circulating in the Brazilian part of the zzso 

Blood samples were collected from zzso zzso zzso positive patients zzso zzso zzso zzso was extracted and the zzso protein zzso junction region of the zzso zzso was successfully amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction for 81 samples zzso zzso sequences (210 zzso of the 81 zzso were zzso 

All zzso samples were from zzso I, with 78 zzso belonging to zzso zzso and three zzso to zzso zzso By zzso analysis, it was shown that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso formed a cluster separated from the other South American zzso zzso previously zzso 

The present study provides valuable new data on the genetic zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the Brazilian Amazon but the zzso zzso is zzso similar to what occurs in most South American zzso
