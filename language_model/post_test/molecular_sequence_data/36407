We have analyzed a zzso zzso minus highly differentiated B zzso zzso zzso library and identified eight genes that are expressed in most zzso but at a much lower level, or not at all, in most B zzso Four of the genes are markers of the terminal differentiation of B zzso into plasma zzso zzso alkaline zzso also expressed in zzso zzso zzso a new zzso member of the zzso zzso family zzso a zzso zzso with sequence features of an zzso zzso zzso a gene that is zzso by zzso but without obvious sequence zzso Two of the genes are not clearly related to normal B cell zzso appearing to be associated with zzso transformation of plasma zzso zzso is a new member of the zzso mosaic protein gene zzso It is an zzso zzso expressed at a very low level in zzso but in no other normal zzso including zzso or zzso plasma zzso It has a high level of expression (apparently zzso in most zzso zzso mineral oil induced zzso However the likelihood that zzso is expressed decreases as the tumor zzso decreases when different zzso agents are used to accelerate mineral oil induced zzso This suggests that zzso expression may be a late event in a zzso process of zzso zzso a new member of the zzso growth factor zzso family, most zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
