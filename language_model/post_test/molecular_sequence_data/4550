zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and the zzso is formed in an zzso reaction that zzso a zzso precursor and converts a zzso zzso into zzso The wild type potato zzso zzso processed much faster than the human zzso and did not require zzso for an optimal rate of processing despite the presence of three zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso that were demonstrated in previous studies to be required for the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso processing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A fourth zzso that is also needed for the zzso stimulation of human zzso zzso processing was identified in the present studies, and this zzso zzso is not present in the potato zzso The site of potato zzso zzso processing was found to be zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which is the equivalent of zzso in the human zzso Replacement of the zzso precursor with zzso or zzso by zzso zzso in either the potato or the human zzso zzso did not prevent processing but caused a significant reduction in the zzso Although the zzso regions of the known zzso zzso are not zzso only relatively small zzso of 8 zzso from the human protein and 25 zzso from the potato zzso were compatible with zzso The zzso truncated proteins show no similarity in zzso zzso acid sequence but each contained 46 zzso acid zzso after the last zzso zzso suggesting that the length of this section of the protein is essential for maintaining the zzso zzso needed for zzso zzso
