We isolated 4 different clones of the zzso zzso gene from a bovine zzso zzso These zzso clones were highly zzso with each zzso Two of the isolated clones were zzso zzso of its zzso sequences indicated that the bovine zzso zzso gene is divided into 9 zzso by 8 zzso and that it is about zzso zzso in total zzso The number of zzso and the locations of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso gene are identical with those in the case of zzso but different from those of other zzso zzso
