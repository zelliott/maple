zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most active toxin to Aedes aegypti in this zzso We previously reported that, in addition to a 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the toxin also binds a 250 zzso membrane zzso Since this protein is the same size as zzso which in zzso insects is an important zzso toxin zzso we developed an zzso zzso This zzso detects a 250 zzso protein in zzso of zzso zzso zzso border membrane zzso The zzso zzso zzso toxin binding to zzso and zzso the zzso protein to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is consistent with areas to which zzso toxin binds and causes zzso zzso the full-length Aedes zzso zzso was isolated from Aedes larvae and partial overlapping fragments that covered the entire protein were expressed in zzso zzso Using toxin overlay zzso we showed that one zzso fragment, which contains zzso zzso repeats zzso bound zzso and this binding was primarily through toxin domain II zzso zzso and zzso zzso repeats zzso but not zzso bound zzso under zzso zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso with high affinity with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso Finally we showed that this zzso site could also be zzso by zzso and zzso but not zzso These results indicate that Aedes zzso is possibly a zzso for zzso and, together with its ability to bind an zzso suggest a similar mechanism of toxin action as previously proposed for zzso zzso
