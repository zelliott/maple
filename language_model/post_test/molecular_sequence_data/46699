To clone the variable genes of zzso zzso against zzso zzso 

The zzso variable region genes were isolated by zzso technique from the zzso zzso and its zzso acid sequences were analyzed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The gene of zzso was 360 zzso long zzso 120 zzso acids and the gene of zzso was 330 zzso long zzso 110 zzso zzso Only one open reading frame could be found in each of the variable zzso A comparison of the sequences of zzso and zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso with those of the published mouse zzso genes in zzso by computer revealed that the zzso gene was zzso to the zzso zzso gene family zzso and zzso gene was zzso to the zzso 

Both of the two genes are rearranged variable region zzso which are zzso for the zzso and zzso J zzso for the zzso
