The possibility of inducing transplantation tolerance by zzso gene transfer is under investigation in our miniature zzso zzso As a crucial step in this project, we have used a zzso zzso engineered to express both a zzso gene zzso and a zzso class II zzso zzso to zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso Analysis of cultured zzso zzso exposed to zzso viral zzso demonstrated that drug resistance had been zzso and that transferred zzso sequences were transcribed zzso Similar zzso studies with zzso zzso demonstrated the transfer of drug resistance to as high as zzso of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso chain reaction zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in colonies derived from primitive zzso and high zzso zzso cell zzso as well as in drug-resistant zzso colonies grown from zzso bone zzso zzso maintained in long-term zzso cultures zzso for up to 5 zzso These results indicate that a significant proportion of both zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and that both zzso genes were expressed in the differentiated progeny of these zzso
