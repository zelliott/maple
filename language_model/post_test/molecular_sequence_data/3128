zzso is a bacterial regulatory protein able to prevent the premature arrest of zzso When zzso zzso binds to a 29 base zzso hairpin overlapping a zzso located in the zzso zzso leader region of the target zzso We have determined the solution structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso in complex with its zzso zzso zzso target by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso no important zzso changes upon complex zzso It zzso through mostly zzso and stacking zzso with the distorted minor groove of the hairpin stem that is interrupted by two zzso internal zzso Although different in zzso these zzso share sufficient structural zzso to be recognized similarly by zzso elements of the protein zzso leading to a zzso zzso structure reminiscent of that observed with zzso zzso regulators bound to zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that this zzso binding mode, where the zzso strands are clamped by the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso
