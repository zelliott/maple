A negative element has previously been localized to a zzso pair segment approximately 300 base pairs upstream of the human zzso promoter zzso Within this element, a zzso pair region was protected in zzso from zzso I zzso with a zzso cell nuclear zzso Two specific zzso complexes were identified in gel zzso zzso using zzso cell nuclear extracts and an zzso probe spanning the zzso zzso zzso and chemical footprint analyses suggested that the binding sites for both complexes are almost entirely zzso One of the complexes was eliminated by zzso competitors possessing known zzso binding zzso This same complex reacted strongly with zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in governing zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein bound to zzso DNA that was immobilized on beads confirmed the involvement of zzso in a specific complex with the zzso upstream zzso In contrast, the other complex seen by the zzso probe could not be competitively inhibited by zzso binding sites and was not affected by zzso zzso Instead, this complex was efficiently eliminated by zzso zzso containing the zzso DNA motif found in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso proteins formed stable complexes with the zzso pair zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso in the consensus recognition sequences of these distinct factors allows each of them to bind the zzso negative zzso The interaction of known zzso zzso with a negative element suggests that the same factors can mediate both zzso zzso and zzso
