zzso is a new family of repetitive sequences detected in the zzso zzso zzso Two of the four described zzso elements zzso a zzso central zzso with no zzso ORF, flanked by two long zzso zzso These elements are composed of a set of repetitive zzso which are zzso repeat zzso direct repeat zzso zzso sequence zzso long sequence zzso and short sequence zzso These five zzso can be found either clustered or dispersed as single zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In addition to the 3' region of zzso zzso single zzso and zzso blocks were found associated with the promoter region of different zzso in particular, zzso blocks have also been found associated with functional genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the DR block is highly similar to satellite zzso from some other species of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso elements share some structural features with IS elements described in different zzso zzso It is likely that both zzso and IS sequences would be zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso
