In the zzso fungus zzso zzso mating type is specified by a single locus with two alternate zzso termed zzso and zzso A previous study has shown that the zzso sequence consists of zzso zzso and contains a single gene relevant to the sexual zzso This zzso called zzso encodes a protein with a zzso zzso domain and is required for zzso and for the development of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is zzso zzso in zzso displays a more complex zzso We present here the characterization of two zzso called zzso and zzso which are present in the zzso zzso along with the zzso zzso zzso whose role in the sexual cycle has been already partially zzso encodes a protein with an alpha zzso and was shown to control zzso We demonstrate that these three genes are required for the zzso events that occur in the female organ after zzso The additional role of zzso requires a region of unknown function that is distinct from the alpha zzso zzso encodes a protein with a putative zzso zzso which has been proposed to be a feature common to zzso zzso The protein sequence deduced from zzso contains an zzso motif suggesting that it is a zzso zzso
