zzso and zzso hormones zzso and zzso from zzso zzso cells initiate zzso in zzso and zzso through direct actions on the central nervous system zzso Using zzso we found zzso cells in representatives of all major insect zzso In most insects, zzso cells are numerous, small and scattered throughout the zzso zzso Only some higher zzso insects exhibit zzso pairs of large zzso cells attached to zzso in each zzso and abdominal zzso The number and zzso of zzso cells can be very variable even in the same individuals or related insects, but all produce zzso hormones that are completely released at each zzso zzso of zzso extracts prepared from representatives of several insect orders zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso larvae of zzso indicating functional similarity of these zzso We isolated several zzso peptides from zzso extracts of the zzso zzso zzso and the bug zzso zzso and identified the gene zzso two putative zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also are stained with zzso to zzso zzso and other peptides sharing zzso zzso zzso However, our zzso zzso show that these zzso zzso with zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells of different insects produce only zzso hormones closely related to zzso and zzso which are essential zzso factors required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
