The zzso restriction zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso DNA containing two zzso zzso separated by about 40 to 2000 zzso zzso is unique in that zzso is totally dependent on zzso zzso zzso is the zzso binding and zzso zzso whereas zzso stimulates its zzso zzso The zzso part of zzso contains the sequences characteristic for zzso zzso consisting of the zzso motif zzso zzso followed by the zzso motif zzso zzso The third motif zzso is present only in a zzso form zzso zzso Here we report a zzso analysis of the putative zzso domain of zzso zzso acid zzso were initially performed in the three proposed zzso zzso Whereas zzso in motif 1 zzso and 2 zzso show the expected, albeit modest effects, zzso in the motif 3 is at zzso with the zzso Unlike the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso does not change the zzso specificity from zzso to zzso but results in a lack of zzso stimulation by zzso The finding that zzso is not a typical G protein motivated us to perform a search for similar sequences in DNA zzso Eight microbial sequences were found, mainly from unfinished sequencing projects, with highly zzso sequence blocks within a zzso zzso zzso From the five sequences showing the highest zzso 17 zzso charged or polar zzso outside the classical three zzso motifs were identified and subsequently exchanged to zzso Several zzso specifically affect zzso affinity and/or zzso zzso Our data allow us to conclude that zzso is not a typical member of the zzso of zzso zzso but defines a new zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso together with similar zzso proteins of as yet unidentified zzso
