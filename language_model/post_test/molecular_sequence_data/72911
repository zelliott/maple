We have previously located the genes of the five human main type zzso genes and the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso to the region zzso to zzso on the short arm of zzso zzso To investigate the organization of the zzso genes in this region, we isolated two zzso from a human zzso library by zzso screening with zzso specific for zzso zzso This screen revealed two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso contains an insert of about zzso zzso whereas the smaller zzso 4A zzso to zzso spans about 340 zzso and is completely covered by zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso in zzso determined the linear orientation of the zzso by zzso walking, and constructed a restriction map of the entire region by mapping the individual zzso using partial zzso and zzso with labeled zzso complementary to the zzso site of the zzso zzso analysis, zzso restriction zzso and sequencing revealed that most of the previously isolated zzso and zzso clones containing zzso genes are part of this zzso including the clones containing the four human main type zzso zzso genes zzso to zzso the zzso zzso and core zzso zzso Thirty-five zzso genes map within 260 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso All newly identified zzso genes were zzso and the sequences were deposited with the zzso zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso gene is not part of this region, and we therefore conclude that the zzso gene and the associated core zzso genes form a separate zzso within this zzso zzso
