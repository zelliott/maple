zzso gene zzso thus giving rise to variable zzso levels, constitutes a major mechanism for controlling cell development and cell zzso In order to investigate these changed zzso levels, a sensitive and quantitative zzso is zzso A quick and easy method is described to zzso specific zzso by a combination of the zzso chain reaction zzso and an zzso zzso detection of the amplified zzso Total cellular zzso is reverse transcribed and amplified with a zzso forward primer and a TBR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso The amplification product is captured on zzso zzso beads and zzso by zzso detection using the zzso system zzso The results can be converted to quantitative values with an external standard zzso In the present study, zzso zzso expression in T zzso was zzso zzso zzso was measured at the zzso range in a dynamic range up to three orders of zzso The zzso detection is zzso rapid and zzso
