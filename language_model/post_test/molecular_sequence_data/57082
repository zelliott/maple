zzso are zzso zzso zzso from human and rat zzso cells and structurally related to the zzso family of growth zzso zzso A zzso form of zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso fish zzso zzso and Bennett, zzso (1988) zzso Cell zzso zzso 629 zzso This study reports the structure of three zzso zzso from the zzso and head kidney of the carp zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the observed primary structures and demonstrated that each zzso was zzso in nature with all zzso linked via zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the carp zzso sequences demonstrates that zzso 2 and 3 are most closely related with sequence variations occurring primarily toward the zzso zzso A rabbit zzso zzso was raised against carp zzso to develop a zzso for this zzso which showed no significant zzso with zzso and zzso The distribution of carp zzso was studied by screening zzso tissue extracts for zzso using zzso high performance liquid zzso A single form of zzso zzso was identified in all carp zzso studied including zzso head zzso heart, skin, zzso and zzso These studies have established that members of the zzso family are found in a lower zzso and may serve important growth zzso functions throughout the zzso zzso
