zzso zzso zzso such as collagen zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso have recently been recognized as promising drug targets for the treatment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso catalyze identical zzso zzso yet lead to quite different zzso consequences, collagen synthesis and the regulation of oxygen zzso Selective zzso of the two zzso should provide a therapeutic benefit upon zzso In an in zzso zzso capture zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso was effectively prevented by zzso oxide zzso donors, zzso zzso and zzso The NO donors also caused zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein in zzso human lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated both NO zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In the presence of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso degradation of zzso was deterred and zzso zzso was zzso zzso while being an effective inhibitor of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso did not diminish zzso zzso of collagen by zzso Our data suggest that NO zzso zzso via competing with zzso and that the zzso effect of NO on zzso and zzso is attributable to the difference in the affinity of the two zzso toward zzso
