Iron is a trace element important for the proper folding and function of various zzso zzso regulation of iron stores is of critical importance for zzso production and zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of iron levels within the zzso Under conditions of iron zzso zzso expression is reduced to promote increased iron zzso from the diet and release from cells, whereas during conditions of iron zzso induction of zzso restricts iron zzso and movement within the zzso The zzso zzso is well established as an important zzso of zzso The presence of this zzso during inflammatory states can induce zzso production, iron zzso and zzso In this study, we show that zzso also influences zzso production in zzso zzso of mice with zzso mouse zzso zzso fused to the N zzso of mouse zzso zzso an zzso zzso with prolonged and enhanced functional zzso induced zzso production, with a subsequent decrease in circulating serum iron and zzso levels and a zzso increase in iron zzso within the zzso This response was independent of zzso and was attenuated in the absence of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso partially reversed the effects on iron biology caused by zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso production to zzso influence iron zzso
