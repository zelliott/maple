The zzso domain of each zzso beta zzso is hypothesized to contain an zzso binding site that is key to cell zzso A new hypothesis regarding the structure of this site is suggested by the zzso of the I zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell 80, zzso zzso zzso and Leahy, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 92, zzso In those zzso an essential metal zzso is bound by a metal zzso zzso site zzso The zzso is presented at the zzso of a larger protein module called an I zzso The metal zzso in the zzso can be separated into three zzso spaced clusters of zzso zzso These three coordination sites also appear to exist in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we examined the putative metal binding site within zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso We also investigated the fold of the domain containing the putative metal binding site using the zzso structural zzso The results of the study point to the similarity between the zzso beta zzso and the zzso motif at two of three key coordination zzso zzso though, the study failed to identify a zzso in either beta zzso that zzso to the second metal coordination group in the zzso Moreover, structural zzso indicate that the fold of the beta zzso is considerably different than the I zzso Thus, the zzso beta zzso appear to present a zzso motif in the context of a protein module that is structurally distinct from known I zzso
