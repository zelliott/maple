The neutral and basic zzso acid transport protein zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso result in Type 1 zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso retains the zzso acid transport and zzso interaction properties of zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso related to zzso expression in zzso are zzso by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso although significant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso is accompanied by loss of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with smaller zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are not expressed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the 13 zzso zzso acid zzso but the zzso expresses zzso transport activity zzso zzso equivalent to that of full-length zzso The deleted region of zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso which may be the targets of zzso zzso The synthetic zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso at pH zzso but not vice versa, establishing the existence of distinct pathways for zzso and neutral zzso acid zzso zzso is zzso at pH zzso and zzso at pH zzso We suggest that zzso expresses a combination of system zzso and zzso activities, possibly by interacting with different zzso zzso zzso to zzso (as does the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso may also have an zzso direct role in the mechanism of System zzso transport (the major transport activity that is defective in Type 1 zzso
