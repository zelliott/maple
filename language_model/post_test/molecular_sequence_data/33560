A high level of genetic stability has been formerly identified in segments of the gene coding for the liver stage zzso zzso a zzso vaccine candidate against zzso zzso The exploration of zzso zzso was extended to the whole sequence of this large zzso in 20 clinical zzso from four geographical zzso zzso zzso islands, Brazil and zzso 

The whole zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction and zzso The clinical isolate sequences were aligned on the sequence of the laboratory reference zzso zzso strain zzso 

The zzso sequence of zzso was very well zzso with only a few zzso variations scattered along the zzso Interestingly, a formerly identified zzso region, employed for the majority of zzso vaccine development, was totally zzso at the genetic zzso The most significant variations observed were in the number and organization of zzso repeated units, but not in their zzso resulting in different lengths of these repeated zzso The shorter repeated regions were from Brazilian zzso A correlation between the geographical distribution of the zzso with single zzso zzso was not zzso 

The lack of correlation between zzso zzso with a specific transmission pressure suggests that zzso is a structurally constrained zzso The unusual characteristics of the zzso gene make the zzso an interesting candidate for a zzso vaccine against zzso
