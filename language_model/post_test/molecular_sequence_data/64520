Most biological zzso are made of zzso however, eight classes of natural zzso have been discovered that zzso fundamental zzso zzso The central functions of zzso in modern organisms support the hypothesis that life passed through an zzso zzso before the emergence of proteins and zzso We have identified a new class of zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso is activated by zzso zzso which is the zzso product of the zzso zzso Additional data indicate that the zzso serves as a zzso genetic switch that zzso the zzso gene in response to rising zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso switches may have functioned as zzso sensors in primitive organisms, and further suggest that modern cells retain some of these ancient genetic control zzso
