The zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso the high zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined and zzso The predicted zzso protein of zzso zzso acids zzso has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso corresponding to the size of the protein expressed in zzso and in zzso A zzso zzso zzso showed that the Pa zzso gene product zzso binds zzso The deduced zzso zzso sequence has features typical of zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso portion containing a potential zzso segment which might anchor the protein to the zzso zzso an zzso module with the zzso boxes 1 zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso and 4 zzso a zzso module with the zzso boxes 5 zzso zzso and zzso an internal extension at zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso at the end of the zzso module at zzso zzso to zzso The highest percentage of similarity zzso was found with the class A zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso The observed extensive zzso in the modular design of the Pa zzso with the zzso zzso zzso suggests structural and functional relationships between these proteins and zzso the proposed correspondence between Pa zzso and zzso zzso
