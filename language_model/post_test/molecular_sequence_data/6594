zzso 3 zzso is the major zzso for zzso zzso against zzso components of zzso which are strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso Recent data that zzso may be expressed by zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells suggest potential for a direct zzso effect against these cells by zzso or zzso T zzso Using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso we studied zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso By zzso no zzso expression was found in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso either zzso or when treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso 24 zzso zzso (20 zzso 6 zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 zzso or zzso + zzso (6 zzso zzso vein and artery zzso cells did not express zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was detected in zzso cells and zzso by zzso expression being confirmed by sequence zzso Three zzso zzso showed no binding to zzso or zzso zzso either by zzso or by indirect zzso zzso The zzso cell line zzso expressed zzso when zzso by zzso However, three zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and one zzso showed little or no zzso expression by zzso or zzso These studies fail to demonstrate evidence for zzso expression by zzso cells, even when using the highly sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso cells is intriguing, the relevance of this in the pathology of zzso is doubtful considering the negligible expression by zzso zzso cell zzso
