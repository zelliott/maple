zzso plays an essential role in zzso coli cell division and is nearly ubiquitous in zzso Several zzso zzso the ability of zzso to interact with other zzso proteins and with zzso To investigate these binding properties, we screened a zzso library with zzso The isolated peptides defined a zzso consensus zzso which in turn displayed a striking similarity with zzso zzso of zzso zzso This result suggested that zzso zzso were involved in zzso of zzso The hypothesis was supported by the analysis of correlated zzso which identified a mutual relationship between a group of zzso acids encompassing the zzso site and a set of zzso immediately downstream to zzso acids zzso This information was used to assemble a model of a zzso zzso whose accuracy was confirmed by probing multiple alternative zzso zzso Moreover, a prediction of zzso responsible for zzso interaction validated the proposed model and confirmed once more the importance of zzso zzso for zzso To functionally characterize this region, we introduced a deletion in zzso where zzso zzso were zzso This zzso failed to complement conditional lethal zzso of zzso demonstrating that zzso acids zzso play an essential role in zzso zzso
