zzso of the germ line zzso zzso into the zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso requires several DNA zzso zzso These include zzso zzso and subsequent elimination of several thousand internal eliminated sequences zzso scattered throughout the zzso zzso and zzso breakage of the zzso zzso into hundreds of DNA fragments, followed by de zzso zzso addition to their zzso zzso breakage sequences zzso that determine the sites of breakage and short regions of DNA adjacent to them are also zzso Both processes occur zzso in the developing zzso Two zzso protein factors involved in germ line DNA elimination have been described zzso zzso and zzso (for programmed DNA zzso physically associate with internal eliminated sequences in transient zzso structures in the developing zzso Here, we report the zzso sequence analysis, and characterization of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the peripheral regions of DNA elimination structures, but is also found more zzso DNA zzso and zzso with zzso or zzso zzso is enriched in zzso but not zzso suggesting that different protein factors are involved in elimination of these two groups of zzso
