The human zzso zzso zzso has specific structural bodies, zzso associated at one end to the zzso and at the other to the zzso during zzso A zzso zzso specific for a component of this structure was zzso It recognizes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 477 zzso zzso analysis of this protein shows that zzso belongs to the family of large zzso zzso sharing a highly versatile protein folding motif adaptable to many biological zzso zzso act as an anchor to zzso cellular activities and components to the zzso zzso zzso It may represent a new class of structural zzso since similar proteins were found in many zzso
