We have previously shown that the zzso protein of zzso can be used as a carrier to promote the zzso delivery of zzso zzso Here we have tested if the zzso technology can be used to direct zzso class I presentation of native zzso using zzso zzso as a model zzso We show that a zzso zzso zzso can be delivered into cells and that subsequent processing and presentation occurs, resulting in effective and specific killing of these target cells by an zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso line that expresses the zzso gene indicates that zzso delivery is as efficient as zzso expression in this zzso zzso zzso protein delivery may be useful both as a research technique and, zzso as a therapeutic or zzso zzso
