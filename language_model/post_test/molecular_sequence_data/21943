zzso plays an important role in defense signaling in zzso A few genes of this family have been zzso Here we report on a zzso zzso zzso in zzso Using sequence information of wheat gene zzso which we had previously zzso we were able to amplify a zzso of zzso from zzso zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso zzso and contained a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with those of other zzso zzso from rice, wheat and other species revealed that zzso had the 12 zzso acid positions zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression was present in zzso leaves and young spikes but not young zzso the expression was high in leaves and low in stems and zzso And zzso zzso could induce the expression of zzso To test the activity of zzso the zzso domain at the zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein could zzso red blood cells of zzso and the zzso activity was strongly inhibited by zzso compared with other zzso These results indicate that zzso with zzso and zzso zzso exists in rice as well as zzso This is the first report of zzso cloning of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso domain in zzso region from zzso zzso
