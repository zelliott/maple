The major zzso sites of bovine zzso zzso in the A chain, zzso and zzso and/or zzso in the B chain have been previously zzso Further analysis of total zzso isolated from the zzso of calf zzso incubated in the presence of zzso demonstrated the presence of additional zzso sites in both zzso At least three additional zzso sites were found in the A chain and at least one in the B zzso These additional sites accounted for approximately zzso of the zzso incorporated in the zzso Two general sequences were found in most zzso sites of both chains of zzso zzso and zzso In spite of the 57% zzso in the sequences of the A and B zzso the zzso sites are located, in the A zzso at the zzso third and in the B zzso at the zzso zzso The alignment of the regions containing the zzso sites of both chains zzso third of the A and zzso third of the B zzso revealed an unexpected similarity in the relative positions of the sites in each zzso
