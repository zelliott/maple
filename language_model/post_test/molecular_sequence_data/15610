Avian zzso are broadly distributed among birds, but only scarcely characterized on the molecular zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences of eight group A zzso from chickens and zzso determined here indicate a low degree of sequence similarity with zzso zzso An zzso region was missing in all chicken zzso except for isolate zzso Four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assigned by the zzso zzso Working zzso Generally, chicken and turkey zzso clustered into separate branches of zzso zzso However, chicken isolate zzso consistently clustered together with turkey zzso Chicken isolate zzso has a zzso sequence of unknown origin, but possesses zzso zzso and zzso zzso typical for chicken zzso These results might indicate zzso transmission and zzso among avian group A zzso under field zzso zzso protocols enabling amplification of avian and zzso group A zzso were developed for use in further zzso zzso
