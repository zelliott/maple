The zzso zzso proteins form complexes with a group of cellular zzso including a protein of 130 zzso zzso zzso was zzso through zzso with zzso and sequence data from four zzso peptides was zzso zzso derived from the zzso sequences were used to clone a zzso zzso The zzso contained an zzso open reading frame with zzso to the zzso protein and zzso zzso but was more closely related to zzso In zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso zzso detected zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso of zzso A and E and was an efficient zzso in zzso for zzso activities associated with these zzso The zzso gene mapped to zzso zzso a region that zzso zzso loss in several types of tumors, including zzso zzso and breast zzso
