Chicken pancreatic zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso using ammonium zzso and ethanol zzso followed by sequential column zzso steps on zzso zzso and size exclusion zzso zzso zzso was found to be a zzso zzso protein with a molecular mass of 14 zzso and a specific activity of 400 U zzso zzso in the presence of 1 zzso sodium zzso and 4 zzso zzso with zzso as zzso The zzso sequence of the first 15 zzso acids of zzso was determined, and showed a high degree of zzso with known zzso pancreatic zzso zzso The gene zzso the mature zzso was cloned and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso confirmed the high level of identity with zzso pancreatic zzso To investigate the zzso zzso a zzso model of group zzso zzso was built using the zzso pancreatic zzso zzso structure as zzso
