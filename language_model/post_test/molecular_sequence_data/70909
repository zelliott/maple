We have used the two zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso the alpha and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso to isolate fragments of the respective genes from the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso The complete coding sequences were obtained by combining sequences of zzso fragments and fragments obtained by inverse zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso and zzso comprise open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso zzso with deduced molecular masses of 109 zzso and 104 zzso The genes presumably evolved by a zzso event from a zzso type zzso followed by another zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso revealed that each gene alone was able to complement the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso double zzso In zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso was not only obtained after zzso of both zzso but also in conjunction with the respective complementary zzso from zzso zzso This indicates the formation of functional zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso specific zzso activity was shown to decrease twofold upon induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso raised against zzso and displays similar zzso properties, zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso
