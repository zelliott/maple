Several molecular forms related to the zzso zzso were characterized and zzso in various brain structures of intact and zzso male and female zzso zzso zzso were separated by high performance liquid zzso zzso and zzso against zzso zzso of different zzso The zzso contained the highest concentration of zzso material detected by the zzso The zzso zzso molecular form recovered from that structure was zzso zzso zzso of the material corresponded to zzso zzso an zzso zzso product of the zzso zzso and the residual zzso was accounted for by zzso fragments of both zzso as assessed after zzso zzso columns with appropriate synthetic or zzso zzso zzso The proportions were the same in both sexes and were not affected by zzso in spite of a lesser overall zzso activity in females and in zzso zzso and zzso were also detected in the zzso bulb and the zzso In these structures however, most zzso zzso molecules corresponded to zzso derived from zzso whereas only very few fragments derived from the zzso zzso were zzso Sex or zzso affected neither total nor relative zzso of zzso molecules in the zzso bulb and the zzso Taken altogether, these observations are suggestive of a different zzso zzso regulation in zzso projecting to either the median zzso or zzso zzso In the latter case, larger amounts of the zzso precursor appear processed to zzso Recovery of relatively high zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso bulb and the zzso reflects the higher resistance of the zzso than the zzso zzso bond to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In view of reports that zzso administration of zzso fragments of zzso are able to trigger sex behavior, our finding that zzso structures contain relatively high zzso of the zzso more stable zzso suggests that these zzso may have a role in the regulation of sex zzso
