zzso is a generally expressed protein of 334 zzso acids that is involved in the repair of DNA zzso breaks and in zzso zzso but its function is zzso In this study, we have used a zzso approach and the zzso zzso method to perform an initial characterization of this zzso We show that the zzso protein is located in the zzso We also demonstrate that several potential zzso sites are not required for zzso function in a transient zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso forms a zzso in zzso with the zzso domain being located within zzso acids zzso Finally, we define a core domain of zzso that functions in zzso zzso and comprises zzso acids zzso Potential functions of zzso are zzso
