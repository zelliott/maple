Surface zzso resonance zzso detection requires no labeling of zzso or zzso and allows zzso of two or more interacting molecular zzso The automated zzso instrument used here consists of an optical detection unit, an integrated liquid handling unit, and an zzso A first zzso is immobilized to the zzso modified surface of the sensor zzso By sequential introduction, the zzso formation of zzso complexes can then be zzso A zzso binding zzso which allows characterization of zzso zzso zzso is zzso A zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso immobilized to the zzso surface is used to capture the first zzso from zzso zzso culture zzso After introducing the zzso the ability of a second zzso to bind to the zzso is zzso The analysis cycle which is fully automated can be performed more than 100 times using the same zzso zzso Since the detection principle allows monitoring of each zzso in the consecutive formation of a zzso complex, zzso binding experiments can be zzso Five zzso recognizing different zzso on an zzso were shown to bind zzso forming a zzso zzso zzso were further characterized by zzso analysis using synthetic peptides derived from the primary structure of their zzso As a model system zzso against zzso zzso core protein zzso were used in all zzso
