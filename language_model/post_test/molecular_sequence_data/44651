We have designed protein molecules based on an zzso zzso zzso These proteins can be tailored to complement nutritionally unbalanced seed zzso In particular, these proteins may contain up to zzso zzso of the essential zzso acid zzso Genes zzso such proteins were constructed using synthetic zzso and the protein stability was tested for in zzso by expression in an zzso coli model zzso A protein containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in transgenic tobacco seeds utilizing the seed specific bean zzso and soybean zzso zzso Both promoters provided a level of expression in the mature transgenic tobacco seeds which resulted in a significant increase in the total zzso content of the zzso Several of these transgenic lines were analyzed for three generations to determine the stability of gene zzso Plants transformed with the soybean zzso zzso 3-5 gene consistently expressed the zzso zzso through three zzso However, expression of the zzso zzso in plants transformed with the bean zzso 3-5 was zzso This is the first report of a significant increase in seed zzso content due to the zzso expression of a de zzso protein zzso
