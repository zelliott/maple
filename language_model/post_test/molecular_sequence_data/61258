The molecular cloning of the first zzso C of the plant zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso were zzso from barley leaves by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were separated by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso a zzso was recognized in the molecular mass range of 40 zzso with an zzso point of about zzso and tentatively identified as zzso zzso The zzso spot was excised from about 50 zzso gels and subjected to zzso zzso C zzso Two zzso peptides were zzso and the zzso acid sequences were used to design zzso zzso followed by zzso amplification with zzso template and screening of a zzso library zzso from zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso The full length clone of zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 354 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso Da and an zzso point of zzso zzso acid identity with sequences of zzso from animals and zzso is in the range of zzso to zzso zzso of the cloned gene was demonstrated by Northern zzso and zzso
