The small zzso zzso zzso zzso was discovered in several zzso screens in zzso coli and zzso Its high degree of zzso zzso its frequent recovery by shotgun sequencing, and its association with the zzso zzso zzso identified zzso as an abundant zzso zzso small zzso yet its function remained zzso Here, we report that zzso acts as a zzso regulator in zzso zzso the zzso of the widely distributed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso a zzso acquired zzso zzso protein zzso Both zzso and zzso are regulated by zzso of the zzso binding zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso is targeted in the coding sequence zzso arguing that zzso targeting is more common than zzso zzso analysis of an zzso deletion strain further argued for the existence of a distinct set of zzso zzso specifically regulated by zzso In contrast, increased expression of the zzso altered the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso and rendered the bacteria zzso Deep sequencing detected a dramatically changed profile of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the unprecedented zzso effects by a single zzso might in part be caused by altered zzso zzso
