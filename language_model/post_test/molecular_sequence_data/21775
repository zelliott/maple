zzso modifications zzso are important strategies used by zzso organisms to zzso their zzso One of the well-studied zzso zzso zzso is zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso with SAM as the zzso zzso The functions of zzso have been broadly studied in different biological processes and diseased states, but the molecular basis for zzso zzso is not zzso In this study, we report the zzso kinetic analysis of zzso zzso The fast association and zzso rates suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso follows a rapid equilibrium sequential kinetic zzso The data give direct evidence that the chemistry of zzso transfer is the major zzso step and that binding of the zzso SAM or zzso affects the association and zzso of zzso with zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso we have identified a critical kinetic step suggesting a zzso zzso transition induced by zzso zzso These results provide new insights into the mechanism of zzso zzso and the rational design of zzso zzso
