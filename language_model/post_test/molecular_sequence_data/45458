zzso zzso are produced by the exquisitely zzso zzso zzso of a linear zzso probably via a zzso zzso We report here that deletion of either or both of the zzso and zzso genes from the zzso zzso gene cluster gave strains that produced, in place of zzso A and B, a mixture of zzso and a number of minor zzso including zzso zzso All the minor components were efficiently converted into zzso by subsequent acid zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso ring opening and zzso zzso ring formation are zzso by the zzso zzso rather than by the zzso zzso as previously zzso zzso with this, zzso modeling shows that the structure of zzso zzso closely resembles the recently determined structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso
