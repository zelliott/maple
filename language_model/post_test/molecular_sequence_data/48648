A zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso red zzso using a protocol that entailed affinity zzso zzso exchange zzso and gel zzso The molecular mass was determined by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso was highly zzso to zzso and zzso peptides from several plant zzso The zzso zzso the growth of a number of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso was fully preserved at temperatures up to 100 zzso and pH values from 0 to zzso zzso red deposition at the zzso tip of zzso zzso was detected after exposure to the zzso signifying that the zzso had suppressed zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not manifest zzso activity toward human breast cancer zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, in contradiction to the bulk of previously reported plant zzso The data suggest distinct structural requirements for zzso and zzso zzso
