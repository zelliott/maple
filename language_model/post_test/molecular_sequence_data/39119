The mechanism of attachment of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso is poorly zzso We have isolated, zzso and cloned a zzso protein that zzso with zzso from human zzso nucleus and that we propose forms a part of a complex of membrane proteins attached to this zzso It is a short protein of 136 zzso acids and has a molecular mass of 18 zzso The sequence contains stretches of both zzso and zzso zzso acids and two zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence reveals that the coding region is divided among five short zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso the gene to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that this gene is widely expressed in the brain with an expression pattern that parallels that of zzso
