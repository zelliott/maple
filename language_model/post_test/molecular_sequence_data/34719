zzso disease is the most commonly reported zzso disease in the United States and is transmitted by zzso zzso zzso zzso The disease is typically characterized by an zzso zzso zzso rash at the site of tick zzso zzso zzso have also been associated with feeding by zzso zzso ticks despite evidence suggesting that they are incompetent zzso for zzso zzso In 1996, a zzso zzso only recently cultivated in the laboratory was described in zzso zzso ticks and designated zzso zzso This zzso is believed to be the zzso agent of a novel zzso disease, southern tick associated rash illness zzso This study examined ticks collected from eight eastern states to evaluate the epidemiology of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their tick zzso Three hundred individual or small pool samples were evaluated from tick zzso that included zzso zzso and zzso DNA was extracted following tick homogenization and the zzso chain reaction zzso was performed using zzso derived from the zzso gene that amplify sequences from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Species specific zzso labeled zzso were designed and used to differentiate between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in approximately zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso tick samples, but none was present in any of the zzso samples zzso Positive samples were detected in ticks collected from Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and zzso This is the first known report of zzso zzso from Massachusetts and New York and the first detection in zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso and its putative association with zzso may be more widespread than previously zzso
