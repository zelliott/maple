We have previously described a method for producing zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso which is as zzso as the authentic hormone in the zzso cell zzso zzso in contrast, a zzso zzso lacking zzso 28 was essentially devoid of zzso In the present study we have investigated this loss of zzso at the molecular level by determining the zzso of a number of zzso zzso engineered to contain specific changes in their primary zzso It was found that the presence of zzso per zzso at the 28 position in zzso was not essential for high zzso since zzso zzso prepared by replacing zzso 28 with other zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso still had substantial zzso zzso that of zzso Neither was the loss of zzso related to a shift in the relative positions of zzso zzso 27 and zzso in fact, zzso 27 was found not to be essential for the zzso of the zzso The loss of zzso after deletion of zzso 28 from zzso appears to be related to the removal of an zzso acid from the middle of a putative zzso zzso 1) rather than to the loss of a zzso specific to zzso zzso This suggestion is supported by the finding that zzso zzso obtained by deletion of selected single zzso acids from center zzso of putative zzso 2, 3, or 4 were also essentially devoid of zzso It is speculated that this lack of zzso reflects an inability of the proteins to assume a native zzso
