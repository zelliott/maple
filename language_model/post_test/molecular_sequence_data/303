zzso DNA zzso have proven to be remarkably diverse in their functions and in strategies for replicating through DNA zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso complex has revealed the most radical replication strategy, where the zzso itself dictates the identity of the incoming zzso as well as the identity of the zzso zzso We show here that many of the key elements of this highly unusual strategy are zzso between zzso and human zzso including the zzso of template G from the DNA zzso and the pairing of incoming zzso zzso with a surrogate zzso zzso We also show that the zzso core of human zzso is uniquely zzso by two large zzso zzso and zzso wherein zzso extends zzso A away from the active site and may serve as a platform for zzso interactions specific for zzso role in zzso DNA synthesis in human cells, and zzso acts as a zzso on the zzso pocket accommodating template zzso We suggest that these novel structural features are important for providing human zzso greater latitude in promoting efficient and zzso zzso DNA synthesis through the diverse array of bulky and potentially zzso zzso DNA zzso in human zzso
