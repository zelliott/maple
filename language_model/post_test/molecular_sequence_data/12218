The zzso zzso in zzso adrenal zzso zzso due to zzso zzso contains a deletion of most of the active zzso gene and the entire adjacent zzso zzso The zzso gene produces a protein which is zzso zzso but zzso zzso In the Old Order Amish, the zzso zzso contains no zzso but is zzso identical to the zzso zzso in both areas zzso the crossover zzso We compared some of the genes in the zzso Class II and Class III regions in the Amish and zzso zzso to define further the relationships between the zzso The complement factor B zzso proteins zzso but no zzso zzso were zzso The complement factor 2 genes exhibited different zzso zzso zzso of the tumor necrosis zzso genes revealed the same zzso restriction zzso The zzso genes contained zzso of the same zzso zzso of the zzso Class II DR and zzso and Class III zzso and C4 zzso were zzso The zzso 2 sequences of zzso and zzso were identical in the two zzso In the Amish zzso both zzso and C4 gene pairs were present and functionally zzso The zzso zzso had two sequence zzso from zzso to zzso in the 7th zzso and from zzso to zzso between zzso zzso zzso 26) and 1157 zzso zzso A model is proposed which accounts for the zzso zzso zzso arising from a zzso zzso via three zzso
