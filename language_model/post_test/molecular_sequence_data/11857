zzso is a basic zzso zzso factor in the zzso zzso zzso that is required for zzso and regulated expression of zzso the gene zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso In respiratory incompetent zzso degree petite cells, zzso zzso is elevated as much as zzso compared with respiratory competent zzso + zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso interacts directly with a zzso upstream zzso site zzso and that the zzso zzso + regulation is not due to a change in the levels of zzso A fusion protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of zzso fused to the zzso zzso of the full-length zzso zzso was able to zzso an integrated zzso reporter under control of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso to deletions or zzso of zzso indicate that the zzso domain is essential for zzso zzso expression of zzso also requires the zzso gene zzso The zzso fusion was unable to zzso the zzso reporter gene in a strain deleted for zzso suggesting that the zzso product does not act independently of zzso in the zzso zzso + zzso zzso
