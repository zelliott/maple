The coat protein zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso is required to initiate infection by the viral zzso zzso zzso whereas infection by the zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso stimulates translation of zzso zzso in zzso 50- to zzso The 3' untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 contains at least two zzso binding zzso A zzso binding site in the zzso 112 zzso of zzso 4 was found to be required for efficient translation of the zzso whereas an upstream binding site was zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso 3' zzso zzso a zzso change of the zzso but this change alone was not sufficient to stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso is unable to bind to the 3' zzso and translation in zzso of zzso 4 zzso this zzso occurs at zzso zzso Replacement of the 3' zzso of this zzso zzso 4 by the 3' zzso of zzso zzso 4 restored translation of zzso to zzso zzso Apparently, the zzso 3' zzso stimulates translation independently of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is defective in the formation of zzso zzso and did not stimulate translation of zzso 4 in zzso although the zzso zzso did bind to the 3' zzso The finding that zzso does not promote zzso infection corroborates the notion that the requirement of zzso in the zzso reflects its role in translation of the viral zzso
