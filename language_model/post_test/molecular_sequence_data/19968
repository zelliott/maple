We report the isolation and characterization of a new zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso activity is sensitive to zzso K, is zzso and is stable at a variety of pH values zzso The zzso mass of zzso S zzso by high performance liquid zzso as determined with mass zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso experiments provided the sequence of the 18 zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso S has the same zzso sequence zzso as zzso zzso and zzso 17, produced by zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso respectively, and could therefore be classified as a new zzso zzso zzso
