Using a previously developed method that allows the identification of zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso genes which stimulate transient expression from a late and a very late viral promoter zzso and Miller, zzso zzso 67, zzso zzso we have identified three genes between zzso and zzso map units of the zzso zzso involved in expression from a late and a very late promoter but not from an early viral zzso One zzso zzso was previously shown to be essential for viral DNA replication and shares sequence motifs with DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The second zzso previously zzso and originally referred to as open reading frame 6 zzso renamed late expression zzso zzso was located just downstream of the zzso zzso core protein zzso zzso The third zzso late expression zzso zzso was defined and zzso The zzso gene was located immediately upstream of, and in opposite orientation to, the major zzso protein zzso zzso The position and direction of zzso appeared to be zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso The gene product of zzso zzso is predicted to be an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids in length with a molecular mass of zzso zzso
