The zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso is a high affinity cellular zzso for protein zzso zzso The zzso gene is under multiple modes of zzso control, including zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study evaluated the zzso control of zzso gene expression during early development of zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso with its zzso and avian zzso its zzso and protein were abundant in the maternal pool and increased after the zzso transition zzso The zzso zzso gene was similar to those of other species, except that a second zzso interrupted the zzso untranslated zzso By zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso with reporter gene zzso containing serial deletions of zzso zzso zzso we identified a zzso pair minimal promoter that was critical for promoter zzso zzso gel shift zzso revealed that a zzso factor and an zzso factor bound to this region in a manner zzso with the onset of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso in the promoter that abolished binding of these two factors also completely inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso gene at zzso The binding sites for these two factors are highly zzso in the human and mouse zzso zzso suggesting that these elements might also regulate zzso zzso in other zzso These studies not only increase our knowledge of the zzso regulation of the zzso genes but also have implications for the mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso
