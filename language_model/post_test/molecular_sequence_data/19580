The natural evolution of zzso zzso zzso is characterized by a variety of zzso mainly in the zzso zzso Although positive selection has been previously reported in zzso little is known about its overall contribution to viral adaptation in the canine zzso zzso the influences of the zzso constraints on zzso during a period of viral adaptation into a previously zzso population are more clearly zzso To do this, 31 sequences of zzso gene obtained from symptomatic domestic dogs in Brazil were used, sampled from 1980 to zzso zzso evolutionary changes in zzso associated with a process of zzso adaptation were zzso Specifically, sequences from the 1980s revealed two distinct zzso types zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, analysis of the selective regimen showed that zzso of the zzso sites were zzso zzso In contrast, sequences from the 1990s were composed solely of zzso with zzso of zzso sites under zzso selection zzso and site 297 under strong positive selection zzso Important features regarding the demographic history of zzso in Brazil were also zzso The viral population size passed through a short period of explosive growth that declined and then stabilized into a constant rate of zzso zzso the explosive growth coincided with the appearance of zzso zzso that presented a unique repertoire of zzso never before seen in other worldwide zzso The analysis also showed that the estimated zzso substitution was similar to those commonly observed in fast evolving zzso zzso The present results demonstrated the zzso potential of zzso to zzso in short zzso of 10 years, key zzso in the zzso 2 gene that increased viral fitness and enabled the virus to zzso even in vaccinated zzso
