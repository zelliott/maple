To define the early stages of the interaction between zzso and host zzso we have cloned and characterized three early zzso sequences from an alfalfa zzso zzso zzso zzso library by probing with a zzso of a zzso clone for zzso an zzso zzso from pea zzso zzso zzso Although the coding regions of the three clones are 95 to zzso zzso to each other, they are only zzso zzso to the pea zzso However, the putative signal zzso zzso by the alfalfa zzso clones is zzso zzso to the zzso signal zzso The spatial and zzso expression patterns of zzso and the alfalfa clones were zzso In zzso zzso experiments detected zzso transcripts in the invasion zone of mature zzso zzso the same site where zzso zzso are zzso zzso were also found by in zzso zzso in cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso penetrated by infection zzso but northern analysis did not detect transcripts in zzso zzso thread zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or in zzso zzso by treatment with the zzso transport inhibitor zzso zzso In addition, the alfalfa gene represented by these zzso clones exhibited a zzso expression pattern that differed from that of zzso which is zzso zzso These data, plus information derived from Southern zzso analysis, indicate that we have isolated zzso clones for a novel early zzso which we have designated zzso zzso zzso Early zzso zzso
