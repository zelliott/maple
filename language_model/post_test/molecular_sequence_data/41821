New zzso and zzso zzso triple resonance experiments are presented which allow zzso assignments of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two slightly different experiments employing double zzso forward and back zzso transfers are zzso to obtain the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The correlation of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso is obtained in a zzso zzso To correlate zzso with their respective zzso zzso selective zzso and zzso zzso are applied to zzso the zzso transfers along the desired zzso The approach employs the zzso zzso zzso interactions and allows the zzso zzso and zzso zzso chemical shift correlation of zzso along and adjacent to the zzso zzso Since the zzso correlations obtained are based exclusively on zzso zzso zzso these experiments resolve the ambiguity of zzso and zzso zzso assignments obtained from the zzso zzso zzso These experiments are applied to a zzso zzso zzso which contains the binding site for Rev protein from zzso
