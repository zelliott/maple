The hormone zzso growth zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso The liver produces most circulating zzso under the control of zzso growth hormone zzso and nutritional zzso To study the regulation of liver zzso production in zzso we established a primary zzso culture system and developed a zzso quantitative real-time zzso zzso for salmon zzso gene zzso A portion of the zzso salmon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for use as a reference zzso A systematic bias across the 96 well zzso plate was discovered in an initial zzso zzso which was corrected when the zzso was zzso zzso zzso levels measured with the validated zzso correlated well with levels measured with an zzso protection zzso and were highest in liver compared with other zzso We examined the time course of zzso zzso gene expression over 48 h in culture, the response to a range of zzso zzso in zzso from fed and zzso fish, and potential effects of variation in zzso in the zzso zzso gene expression decreased over time in culture in zzso in plain zzso and in cells treated with 5 zzso zzso with or without a combination of zzso hormones (1 zzso insulin, 100 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression at all time zzso In cells treated with zzso plus zzso hormones, zzso gene expression was intermediate between the controls and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso gene expression response zzso in cells from fed and zzso fish, with the threshold for stimulation from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso response from 5 to 50 zzso and a reduced response at 500 zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso did not affect zzso or zzso zzso zzso gene zzso This study shows that primary zzso culture and the zzso zzso zzso can be used to study the regulation of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso and provides the first evidence of a zzso response to zzso concentration in fish zzso zzso
