Gene amplification, which is generally considered to occur late in tumor development, is a common feature of high grade zzso Up until now, there have been no reports on amplification in zzso grade zzso In this study, we report cloning and sequencing of a zzso termed zzso sequence zzso which was identified recently in a zzso cell line by zzso zzso zzso This technique is tailored to isolate amplified genes from human zzso An increased copy number of zzso was found in zzso zzso and zzso III, and at a high frequency in zzso grades I and zzso zzso comparison indicates a high zzso between the zzso zzso the zzso and human zzso and the human zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso belong to a new class of zzso factors, indicating that zzso might also represent a zzso zzso With zzso being the first gene found with increased copy number in low grade zzso this study provides the first evidence that gene amplification can occur in early tumor zzso
