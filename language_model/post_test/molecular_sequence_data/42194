Mice that presumably differ just in the major zzso complex zzso zzso region provide the best evidence that zzso genes affect zzso Further evidence is that zzso region genes in some cases are known to influence zzso growth, and zzso Moreover, zzso genetic associations with disease are well zzso This paper summarizes and defines aspects of the molecular biology, cellular function, and evolution of zzso genes (with special emphasis on the zzso zzso class I and II zzso which are important in aging, and attempts to integrate these into an evolutionary genetic perspective of zzso It is suggested that zzso genes provide a zzso paradigm for the zzso of lifespan because of their zzso and zzso diversification, evolutionary selection, and zzso zzso
