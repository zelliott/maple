The tomato zzso zzso exhibits a zzso in zzso zzso Despite high zzso and zzso iron zzso the zzso shows characteristic symptoms of iron zzso Using a zzso approach, we have screened for zzso clones specific for genes with altered expression in zzso versus zzso root zzso Based on this clone collection, we have isolated and zzso a zzso full-length zzso zzso a zzso zzso The corresponding gene is zzso as a single copy on zzso zzso Its expression is strongly induced by changes in the iron status of the zzso This zzso regulation is superimposed upon a strict root specificity of gene zzso zzso functions of the gene product other than in protein zzso will be zzso
