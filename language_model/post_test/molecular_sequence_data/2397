The sequences involved in enhancement of zzso of the zzso U2 small nuclear zzso gene by the zzso sequence element zzso of its promoter were analyzed in detail by zzso of zzso genes into zzso zzso The zzso was shown to be roughly 60 base pairs zzso Within this region, four motifs were found to contribute to zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso an zzso binding site, and two additional motifs which, since they are related in zzso may bind the same zzso zzso These motifs were named zzso (for zzso zzso Both the zzso sequence and the zzso site bound nuclear factors in zzso but no factor binding to the zzso motifs was zzso All four elements were independently capable of enhancing zzso of the U2 gene to some zzso Furthermore, when zzso under both competitive and zzso conditions, the individual units of the zzso displayed functional zzso
