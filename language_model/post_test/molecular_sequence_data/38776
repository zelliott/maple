A new satellite DNA family, named zzso has been cloned from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is represented as zzso repeated sequences with a zzso unit of zzso zzso The zzso are present at approximately zzso copies per zzso zzso and represent about zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso independent zzso have been cloned and zzso The deduced consensus sequence is zzso A + T rich, with frequent stretches of A and zzso zzso Several direct or zzso zzso are present in the zzso which may allow the formation of a zzso structure, suggesting some potential role of this repetitive sequence in zzso zzso The zzso are very homogeneous in zzso showing on average zzso divergence from their consensus zzso Moreover, Southern zzso experiments and sequence analysis of zzso zzso from the zzso of geographically distinct zzso zzso populations have shown that this satellite DNA is zzso distributed and highly zzso within the zzso zzso it is hypothesized that this unusually low level of zzso either within the zzso of a given population or between zzso could be achieved as the result of some highly effective homogenization mechanism acting upon the zzso zzso
