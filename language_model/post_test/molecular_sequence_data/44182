The peptides zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso An increase of zzso strength reduced the zzso of exchange activity by zzso and zzso consistent with an important role for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso we conclude that at least one of the positive charges at the zzso zzso positions zzso 11, or 17) is important for zzso zzso zzso has zzso at 12 and 14 and only one zzso (at zzso inhibited zzso zzso thus positive charges at 12 and 14 are not zzso zzso zzso did not zzso thus a positive charge at 19 is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso but not the PM zzso zzso These results show that the structural zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso and the PM zzso pump are different, that positive charges at 7, 11, or 17 (or some zzso are more important than positive charges at 12 and 14 for zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso
