zzso zzso zzso is a widely expressed zzso that has been shown to regulate both cerebral zzso zzso and plasma insulin levels in zzso zzso linkage and zzso association have been reported between the zzso gene locus and both zzso Alzheimer's disease and Type II diabetes zzso suggesting that altered zzso function may contribute to some cases of these highly prevalent zzso Despite the potentially great importance of this zzso to health and disease, many fundamental aspects of zzso biology remain zzso Here we identify a previously zzso zzso zzso of zzso generated by translation at an zzso initiation zzso 123 zzso upstream of the zzso translation start site, which results in the addition of a zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso Fusion of this sequence to the zzso of green fluorescent protein directed this normally zzso protein to zzso and full-length zzso zzso containing this sequence were also directed to zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso where it was protected from zzso by zzso and migrated at a size consistent with the predicted removal of the zzso targeting sequence upon transport into the zzso zzso we provide evidence that zzso can degrade zzso zzso targeting zzso Our results identify new mechanisms regulating the zzso zzso of zzso and suggest previously zzso roles for zzso within zzso
