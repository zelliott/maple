The crystal structure of zzso zzso protein from seeds of zzso zzso zzso was solved at zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso contains three zzso zzso each zzso linked to an zzso zzso at positions, 10, 44, and zzso zzso The high-resolution structure clearly shows the three zzso to have either an zzso or a zzso Two of zzso are located on the same side of the zzso with the active zzso Except one hydrogen bond, there are no zzso interactions between the zzso chain and the zzso Instead the sugar zzso appear to be stabilized by zzso zzso The sugar structure defined at high resolution provides a structural basis for understanding their possible biological zzso The structural comparisons of zzso with other zzso reveal that the major disparity of these zzso molecules is the different charge distribution on the upper right side of the front side near the active zzso Based on the available structure of the zzso zzso zzso the possible interactions between zzso and the zzso are zzso
