A male zzso gene zzso designated zzso was isolated from flower buds using zzso primer pairs and was submitted to zzso under zzso number zzso zzso of zzso gene with zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso revealed some differences in gene structure and zzso The full zzso DNA sequence of zzso was zzso zzso in length containing 8 zzso and 7 zzso more than those of zzso but less than zzso zzso showed that zzso gene expressed only in stage III flower buds of male fertile Chinese zzso zzso and there were no detection in all zzso of zzso zzso male zzso zzso line zzso and zzso zzso line zzso Furthermore, zzso revealed that zzso expressed only in zzso of male fertile material and there were no expression in zzso zzso filaments and zzso These results suggested that zzso was an zzso gene and might be essential for the fertility of Chinese zzso
