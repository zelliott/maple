This paper reports on the solution structure of the zzso zzso positioned opposite zzso in a DNA zzso duplex which provides the first zzso based solution structure of an zzso complex of a zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso bound to the zzso of zzso The combined zzso zzso zzso studies were undertaken on the zzso zzso embedded in the same zzso zzso segment of the complementary zzso duplex studied previously with the zzso trans zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso acid were assigned following analysis of two-dimensional zzso data sets in zzso and zzso zzso The solution structure of the zzso zzso duplex has been determined by incorporating zzso and zzso zzso distances defined by upper and lower bounds deduced from zzso data sets as restraints in energy zzso zzso The zzso ring of zzso is zzso between intact zzso zzso and zzso base pairs in a right-handed DNA zzso The zzso ring is in the minor groove while the zzso ring sacks with zzso zzso and zzso bases on the same zzso The zzso ring of zzso is not zzso base paired but displaced into the minor groove with its plane parallel to the zzso axis and stacks over the sugar ring of zzso The zzso base on the partner strand is displaced from the center of the zzso toward the major groove by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso structure of the zzso zzso duplex exhibits several unusually shifted zzso zzso which can be readily accounted for by the ring current contributions of the zzso and zzso rings of the zzso zzso Several zzso zzso are shifted to low and high field of the zzso zzso spectral region and have been assigned to zzso zzso centered about the zzso modification zzso These studies define the changes in the zzso at the central zzso segment needed to generate the zzso site for the zzso bound zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
