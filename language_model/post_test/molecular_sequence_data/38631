The zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Most zzso proteins contain repetitive zzso and are thought to be involved in zzso cell zzso Previously, we have reported the isolation and characterization of six zzso genes zzso a zzso region of the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso In the current study, zzso zzso were used to clone several fragments from a zzso library of zzso DNA and assemble a single zzso zzso containing 11 zzso zzso The middle region of the zzso locus contains a large open reading frame zzso that is not a zzso gene and has undergone an internal deletion in some zzso The zzso is predicted to zzso a membrane protein that may have a role in disease zzso To examine zzso genes in a strain of zzso zzso that is unrelated to zzso strain CT was zzso Through Southern zzso and zzso cloning zzso CT was found to possess zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and two unique genes zzso and zzso that were not found in zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso serve to regulate the zzso production of individual zzso zzso As a result of the sequence analysis of zzso zzso products, a model in which DNA inversion arises from strand exchange involving at least six zzso of the zzso box is zzso
