Three new zzso peptides were isolated from the Brazilian zzso zzso zzso and their complete zzso acid sequences were determined by zzso degradation as well as by zzso zzso One zzso of them was a new analog of zzso family; therefore, we named it zzso zzso Another zzso zzso had an zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso from zzso The third zzso zzso was structurally unique, possessing an zzso zzso zzso Not only zzso zzso zzso but also zzso and zzso caused zzso release from rat zzso mast cells as zzso as zzso zzso were about 1 zzso zzso M for zzso and 2 zzso zzso M for zzso In addition, zzso in a concentration higher than 1 zzso zzso M induced zzso though whose zzso activity was about a half potency of that of zzso However, zzso did not cause zzso up to the concentration of 10 zzso We have named them zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso
