Previously it was demonstrated that zzso zzso are able to functionally replace the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, in zzso binding studies suggested that a key binding partner of these molecules is the zzso zzso zzso zzso more specifically the zzso domain within this zzso Here we show that zzso plays an essential role in the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso in zzso zzso with this model, zzso are able to function as competitive zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso both of which zzso a binding interaction with zzso to zzso zzso Further, modification of the zzso side chain produced three zzso with enhanced potency against zzso transcription, although increased zzso was also zzso zzso these small zzso molecules will be useful tools for zzso the role of the zzso domain in a variety of pathological zzso
