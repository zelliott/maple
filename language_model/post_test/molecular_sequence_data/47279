Increased synthesis of the protein zzso zzso the exclusion of zzso in cells harboring the F zzso In contrast to zzso or cells defective in zzso zzso of zzso allows zzso to form plaques at normal efficiency even though the burst size is reduced to about half that obtained on the zzso zzso zzso No zzso in DNA synthesis was observed but late protein synthesis remains partially inhibited and a reduced level of cell zzso a prominent feature of zzso cells zzso infected by zzso zzso The zzso protein is shown to be a zzso membrane zzso How zzso avoids exclusion by F in cells that exhibit increased levels of zzso is discussed in terms of its membrane zzso
