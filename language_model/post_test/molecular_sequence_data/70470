Four zzso zzso the major zzso complex zzso class I alpha chain were isolated from a channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests these zzso represent three different zzso class I zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso class I alpha zzso zzso those involved in zzso zzso salt bridges, zzso bond formation, and zzso Southern zzso analyses of individual zzso and second-generation zzso fish indicated the existence of both zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso studies demonstrated that zzso B, zzso and zzso cell lines transcribed markedly higher levels of class I alpha and zzso zzso zzso than zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso data showed that a 41 zzso Mr zzso (presumably class I zzso was associated with zzso on the surface of zzso B zzso This latter finding is the first direct evidence for the cell surface association of zzso with the zzso class I alpha chain on zzso cells and supports the notion that functional zzso class I proteins exist in zzso
