To identify zzso and zzso of the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso that interact with the type I zzso two zzso zzso of zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso within the zzso sequence were replaced by zzso zzso thus creating two zzso derivatives with a zzso zzso acid in either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso part of the zzso The zzso properties and the efficiencies of these zzso zzso as zzso were tested for pig brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retained the high binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso reduced the affinity about tenfold zzso zzso zzso thus demonstrating the importance of zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not change the binding affinity of the zzso zzso zzso labeling using pig brain membrane demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso specifically label a zzso protein zzso zzso labeling of the rat brain zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells resulted in two specifically zzso zzso a major band of Mr zzso and a minor band of Mr zzso By treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso both of the zzso bands were converted to a single zzso band of Mr zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Despite its lower zzso zzso zzso labeled the zzso type I zzso in pig brain zzso and the rat zzso expressed in zzso cells with much higher efficiency zzso for the pig zzso than zzso These findings suggest that zzso in zzso is located in or close to the zzso site of the zzso type I zzso The results provide evidence that the zzso zzso region of zzso is directly involved in zzso zzso
