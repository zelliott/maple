zzso of a human zzso brain zzso DNA library allowed us to isolate an zzso zzso containing 6 zzso of the zzso region, the open reading frame and 4 zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso region zzso zzso revealed that the first 900 zzso zzso to the start zzso are very rich in zzso zzso contain several zzso sites and lack a consensus zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso transcript were determined by zzso zzso carried out with a series of zzso zzso The data obtained with cellular zzso from zzso cells demonstrated that zzso is initiated zzso bases upstream of the zzso site and that the zzso site is located 550 bases downstream of the stop zzso These results are consistent with the existence of a zzso zzso box zzso and the presence of a unique zzso signal zzso They also fit with the size of zzso found by zzso analysis zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso promoter region was investigated by zzso several cell types with zzso zzso containing various fragments of the zzso region and zzso as a reporter zzso The activity of the construct containing the entire zzso region appeared to depend on the host zzso zzso of the zzso region resulted in loss of cell specificity and a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells with zzso deleted of additional zzso fragments permitted the definition of a minimal 200 zzso promoter zzso containing the zzso box and two putative zzso zzso
