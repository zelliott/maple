The object of this study is to propose a new method to identify small compact units that compose protein three-dimensional zzso These fragments, called zzso units zzso are a new level of description to well understand and analyze the organization of protein zzso The method only works from the contact probability zzso zzso the zzso zzso translated into zzso It uses the principle of conventional zzso zzso leading to a series of zzso partitions of the zzso zzso Every step aims at dividing zzso a unit into 2 or 3 zzso according to a criterion called zzso zzso assessing the structural independence of the zzso newly zzso Moreover, an zzso squared correlation R is used for assessing globally the protein structure zzso The method is compared to other splitting zzso and shows relevant zzso 

An Internet server with dedicated tools is available at zzso
