Small zzso zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso are widely expressed in diverse zzso however, little is known about the molecular regulation of SK channel zzso zzso zzso of zzso channel zzso by zzso is a candidate mechanism for functional zzso of these zzso We find that zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso causes a dramatic decrease in surface zzso of the zzso channel zzso expressed in zzso cells due to direct zzso of the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso studies using the zzso zzso of the zzso channel zzso expressed as zzso zzso fusion protein zzso showed that both the zzso and zzso regions are zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis identified a single zzso zzso site within the zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso studies identified four zzso zzso sites: zzso zzso zzso and three zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso A zzso zzso channel zzso with the three zzso zzso zzso to zzso to block zzso at these sites, shows no decrease in surface expression after zzso zzso Thus, our findings suggest that zzso zzso of these three sites is necessary for zzso reorganization of zzso surface zzso
