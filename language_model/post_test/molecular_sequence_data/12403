Because of the abundance of the classical form of zzso zzso zzso among Jews and people of Mediterranean origin, studies have been conducted to find an association between zzso and zzso zzso No conclusive results have been drawn, although in a number of these investigations an increased zzso of zzso was zzso In our study 49 zzso patients of Jewish origin were zzso analyzed for zzso class I and class II zzso We found no significant zzso in zzso defined zzso zzso zzso between patients and 99 ethnically matched zzso However, a zzso decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso and the combination of zzso was zzso Then we determined in these patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso on zzso zzso In this molecular analysis the only notable finding was a decreased frequency of the combination zzso which appeared in one zzso patient compared to 13 zzso of the zzso However, the decrease was not statistically zzso On the basis of both zzso and molecular analysis done on a relatively large group of zzso patients, we conclude that there is no significant linkage between zzso zzso and zzso in Jewish zzso
