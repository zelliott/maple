zzso zzso are currently classified into two zzso within the species zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences of six American and zzso German zzso zzso with published zzso sequences revealed the necessity to revise the zzso of these zzso zzso data indicate that the bovine zzso are composed of two clusters zzso zzso and zzso each with two and three zzso zzso Whereas low zzso acid identity of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the main criterion for the discrimination of zzso the zzso zzso presumably representing species, differ in sequence identity of all viral zzso In addition, characteristic lengths of zzso the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso region are zzso The zzso can be distinguished from the other zzso by sequence identity and unique features of the zzso region, zzso a zzso second zzso and characteristic zzso structures of the internal zzso entry zzso zzso the closest relatives of the bovine zzso are the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region, the zzso proteins and the zzso zzso indicate frequent zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso and the zzso region of the zzso zzso
