zzso The study of the zzso zzso and zzso of a Caucasian family revealed that a zzso zzso zzso was associated with the poor zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the previously described zzso zzso and zzso are not associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso To explore the molecular basis of the poor zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso complete sequencing of the nine zzso and zzso boundaries of the zzso gene was undertaken after amplification by zzso zzso All the zzso were successfully amplified using zzso zzso zzso except zzso 1 which required a combination of zzso zzso zzso primer and a zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso data derived from this amplified product revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso to a novel zzso of the zzso This involved a deletion of an approximately 20 zzso zzso DNA segment generating a hybrid zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso presumably due to an zzso in zzso 1 zzso of the zzso 1 of the zzso zzso which causes a shift in the reading frame with premature termination of zzso
