To search for the genetic cause of juvenile zzso glaucoma zzso in a Caucasian family and to perform zzso correlation studies in the zzso 

Six members of a zzso family originating from Uzbekistan and now living in the Middle East were recruited from one large clinic in zzso zzso investigations comprised of visual field zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso disc zzso and zzso Medical charts were obtained to date the onset of glaucoma and to evaluate zzso of the zzso We screened the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso by direct zzso sequencing of its three zzso in all family zzso 

zzso zzso as an zzso dominant trait in four members of the zzso The zzso a 14-year-old girl, had been diagnosed with juvenile zzso glaucoma at 12 years zzso Her mother, maternal aunt, and maternal grandfather all had zzso that started at an early zzso The disorder progressed rapidly even under optimal medical treatment, and all four patients had to undergo zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 371 zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso with the disorder in all affected members and was absent in 200 Caucasian zzso The zzso zzso zzso has not been reported zzso One cousin of the zzso was a silent zzso carrier of the zzso and was still zzso at nine years of zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso in zzso from a Caucasian family who presented with an aggressive form of zzso that required early zzso zzso screening of the zzso zzso was beneficial in predicting one zzso zzso zzso
