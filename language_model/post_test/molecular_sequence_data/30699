zzso zzso viruses have been isolated from four species of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso African green monkey and zzso While none of these viruses is a replica of zzso the zzso and zzso viruses represent correct genetic models for zzso possessing exactly the same complement of zzso Recently a zzso has been identified in two wild chimpanzees zzso zzso zzso in zzso west equatorial Africa, and isolated from one of zzso This virus is referred to as zzso zzso from these animals cross reacted with all the zzso proteins including the envelope zzso Here, we describe the molecular cloning and sequencing of an infectious zzso clone of zzso The overall genetic organization was the same as that of zzso but zzso analysis revealed that the sequence was more divergent than any zzso sequence reported so zzso The zzso gene product, found only in the type 1 zzso was particularly different zzso divergent to zzso suggesting that the zzso represents a distinct zzso These findings indicate that there is a larger pool of zzso zzso than previously suspected and zzso debate as to the origins of zzso
