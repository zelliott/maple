zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 135 zzso zzso zzso is regionally expressed at the cellular zzso zzso later in zzso the expression of the protein becomes restricted to cells of the peripheral and central nervous zzso zzso zzso shows zzso protein at points of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was isolated that encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso location of the zzso gene is zzso The zzso domain at the zzso end of the zzso protein shows a strong structural and sequence zzso to zzso zzso without retaining the zzso acids forming the active zzso zzso therefore belongs to a growing group of proteins including zzso zzso and zzso that are known to share this zzso zzso protein domain motif without retaining the active center of the zzso
