A zzso zzso isolated from zzso plants of zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative protein that is similar to the regulatory zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and contains a putative zzso zzso at the zzso A zzso gene with the putative zzso sequence of the zzso gene fused to the synthetic zzso protein zzso gene was constructed and introduced into zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso protein directed the zzso protein into the zzso of the zzso and functioned as a transit zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that expression of the zzso gene was induced not only by water stress, such as zzso and high zzso but also by natural zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was not strongly induced by zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene with the zzso zzso promoter region of the zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene was constructed, and tobacco plants transformed with the zzso The zzso reporter gene driven by the zzso promoter was induced by zzso and high salt stress at significant levels in the transgenic zzso The zzso gene was strongly expressed in older leaves without dehydration, and was induced by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was reduced by zzso treatment during zzso zzso These results indicate that expression of the zzso gene is zzso zzso by zzso as well as by water zzso
