zzso is the zzso that zzso zzso to a subset of retinal zzso cells zzso that regulate many zzso tasks such as the detection of light for zzso zzso Recent studies have begun to zzso the zzso on the basis of zzso and function, but the origin of these differences is not yet fully zzso Here we report the identification of two zzso of zzso from the mouse zzso zzso a previously described long zzso zzso and a novel short zzso zzso that more closely resembles the sequence and structure of rat and human zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso cell layer of the zzso traffic to the plasma membrane and form a functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is 40 times more abundant than zzso The two zzso zzso predicted proteins of 521 and zzso zzso and only differ in the length of their zzso zzso zzso raised to zzso zzso identified two discrete populations of zzso zzso those that zzso zzso and zzso and those that express zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso show a range of anatomical zzso which may reflect the functional diversity reported for mouse zzso light zzso The distinct zzso of zzso described in this study provide a potential molecular basis for generating this diversity, and it seems likely that their differential expression plays a role in generating the variety of zzso light responses found in the zzso zzso
