A zzso clone containing the gene for human zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The gene is divided into three zzso spans zzso zzso and was localized to zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, the protein and activity levels of zzso were increased by zzso This increase was prevented by zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region of zzso 1, which exhibited strong promoter activity, responded zzso except that zzso induced a transient increase followed by a zzso As zzso 2 expression has been reported to respond in a similar fashion, a zzso regulatory basis for the observed zzso with zzso is zzso The strong zzso by zzso raises important issues concerning its mechanisms of zzso
