The zzso protein 1 zzso gene encodes the two major proteins of the central nervous system zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso are associated with a large spectrum of zzso zzso disorders ranging from zzso zzso zzso disease zzso to zzso zzso zzso according to the nature of the zzso zzso zzso exists and zzso in the zzso alpha 12 zzso gene have been related to zzso About zzso of patients with the zzso zzso remain without zzso in these two genes and are classified as affected by zzso disease zzso To study zzso zzso zzso we analyzed zzso transcripts from nerves and/or skin cultured zzso of 14 zzso patients carrying different zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso We found that various types of zzso zzso result in zzso including one considered as a zzso in zzso 2 and a zzso substitution in zzso 3 outside the classical donor and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated for two patients that the zzso transcript pattern was in accordance with the one observed in the corresponding zzso nervous system zzso zzso Finally, we observed no abnormal zzso in zzso of 20 zzso patients zzso suggesting that zzso gene zzso zzso potentially caused by zzso zzso zzso are either not involved or are very rarely implicated in the zzso zzso These results confirm that zzso are reliable, accessible cells useful in detecting zzso transcript zzso better characterizing the functional consequences of zzso zzso for zzso zzso characterizing new zzso zzso regulatory zzso and identifying zzso zzso zzso by conventional zzso zzso
