zzso zzso is one of a limited number of zzso viruses that are capable of inducing zzso zzso A small, zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso by the first open reading frame of a zzso viral zzso is responsible for this fusion zzso zzso comparisons to previously characterized zzso fusion proteins indicated that zzso represents a new member of the zzso small zzso zzso protein zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is a representative of a minor subset of integral membrane zzso the type III proteins zzso zzso that lack a zzso signal sequence and use an internal reverse zzso sequence to direct membrane zzso and protein zzso This zzso results in the unexpected, zzso zzso of the essential zzso zzso domain of zzso across the cell zzso The zzso and structural motifs present in this novel zzso membrane fusion protein further accentuate the diversity and unusual properties of the zzso protein family and clearly indicate that the zzso proteins represent a third distinct class of viral membrane fusion zzso
