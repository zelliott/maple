One of the main goals in cancer zzso is the efficient zzso of the host immune system against zzso zzso zzso cells zzso can induce specific zzso immune responses in both experimental animal models and zzso However, most zzso studies using small animal models show only limited correlation with studies carried out in clinical settings, whereas laboratory dogs naturally develop zzso that are biologically and zzso similar to their human zzso Here, we describe the generation and characterization of zzso zzso against canine zzso isolated using the Tomlinson zzso display zzso We successfully isolated highly specific zzso variable zzso zzso zzso in a sequential three-step panning strategy involving depletion on canine peripheral blood zzso cells followed by positive selection on native canine zzso This provides the basis for an zzso method for the zzso detection and manipulation of zzso and for monitoring zzso immune zzso
