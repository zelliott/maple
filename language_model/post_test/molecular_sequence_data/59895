In this work, we demonstrate tandem mass zzso on an zzso trap zzso zzso mass zzso zzso Ion isolation and zzso were achieved by resonant zzso using zzso and zzso zzso generated from an analog zzso zzso zzso of small zzso are zzso which are comparable in fragmentation to those acquired on sector or hybrid mass zzso Several important parameters governing the tandem mass zzso process, including the zzso zzso zzso type of collision gas, zzso period and cooling period after the fragmentation were zzso using zzso as a zzso Although the limited energy deposition from zzso zzso in our experiments does not allow efficient fragmentation of large zzso charged zzso with zzso higher than zzso the problem may be partially solved by taking advantage of zzso the multiply charged zzso produced from the zzso zzso source as demonstrated for a synthetic zzso of molecular weight zzso Compared to the zzso charged form, the reduced zzso of multiply charged forms experience a greater zzso force as described by the zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso for multiply charged species permit the use of greater fragmentation energy at lower zzso zzso These conditions facilitate the fragmentation of large zzso yet are suitable for zzso zzso charged zzso These experiments indicate that the high efficiency associated with zzso zzso and zzso collection in the trap and the storage capability for detection of zzso using the zzso mode of the zzso zzso zzso may provide an alternative means for acquiring zzso information of zzso at low zzso levels of zzso
