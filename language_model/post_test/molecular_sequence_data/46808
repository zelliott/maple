To examine genetic and zzso zzso associated with zzso integration in zzso we compared zzso DNA profiles of primary zzso zzso zzso and cell lines that either contained or did not contain integrated zzso To accomplish this, we carried out zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a two-dimensional system that displays zzso Not I landmark sites in a single gel zzso zzso We identified one Not I landmark spot that showed high signal intensity in zzso cell lines or in primary zzso but not in zzso or zzso lines free of zzso zzso Cloning of this spot revealed that it consisted of a Not I cluster sequence enriched with zzso zzso This zzso zzso in association with zzso integration, was found in the zzso region of human zzso The results demonstrate that zzso changes at specific sequences in the zzso occur in association with zzso integration during the process of zzso
