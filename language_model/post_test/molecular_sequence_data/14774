zzso zzso uses zzso to interact with zzso zzso on the gastric zzso surface to establish persistent zzso The number of CT repeats in zzso is variable and thus influences zzso translation, but the expression of zzso determined by Western zzso does not fully match with a CT zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso tract located upstream of zzso has been observed, but its role in regulating zzso expression is still zzso 

zzso zzso start site zzso of zzso in strains zzso and zzso was determined by zzso zzso One hundred and zzso clinical zzso were zzso to analyze the distribution of the zzso tract length and promoter zzso Finally, zzso and an zzso zzso reporter system were used to determine the zzso promoter activity with different lengths of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso was located at 66 or zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso tract close to the zzso element varied from zzso to zzso in 115 clinical zzso and zzso of the zzso contained a stretch of zzso zzso The zzso gene displayed slipped strand zzso zzso of the zzso zzso generating varying zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with lengths of zzso and zzso had higher zzso promoter activity than the common length of zzso 

zzso findings indicate that the zzso promoter region zzso its zzso activity through a variable zzso zzso and zzso generates mixed zzso in the zzso
