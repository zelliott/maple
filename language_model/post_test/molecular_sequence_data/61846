zzso zzso which leads to severe and progressive muscle zzso in patients with zzso muscular zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A relatively new therapeutic strategy is based on zzso zzso zzso that induce the specific skipping of a single zzso such that the reading frame is zzso This allows the synthesis of a largely functional zzso associated with a milder Becker muscular zzso zzso We have previously successfully targeted 20 different zzso zzso that would, zzso be beneficial for zzso of all zzso To further enlarge this proportion, we here studied the feasibility of double and zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso double skipping of zzso 43 and 44 was zzso and zzso synthesis was restored in zzso from one patient affected by a nonsense zzso in zzso zzso For another patient, with an zzso zzso zzso the therapeutic double skipping of zzso 45 and 51 was zzso zzso in control zzso the latter combination of zzso caused the skipping of the entire stretch of zzso from 45 through zzso This zzso zzso skipping would be therapeutic for a series of patients carrying different zzso zzso In fact, we here demonstrate its feasibility in zzso from a patient with an zzso zzso zzso The application of zzso skipping may provide a more uniform methodology for a larger group of patients with zzso
