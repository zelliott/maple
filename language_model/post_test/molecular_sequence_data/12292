zzso of zzso zzso zzso that were deficient in the ability to produce zzso that degrade zzso were detected among the survivors of chemical zzso One such zzso zzso showed reduced production of zzso activity, zzso activity, and zzso A zzso zzso zzso from a gene bank of zzso that zzso defects in zzso was zzso zzso zzso and deletion derivatives of the clone were used in conjunction with zzso tests to determine the physical location of the gene of zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso zzso a putative zzso protein zzso with zzso to zzso regulators of zzso sensing systems such as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Further sequence analysis downstream of zzso revealed an independently transcribed gene zzso that encodes a putative zzso protein with zzso to members of the family of zzso zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequences were also recently reported by others zzso zzso and zzso Reiser, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso as an zzso regulation mechanism for zzso zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso with defects in zzso or zzso were constructed in zzso by gene replacement, using clones modified by zzso zzso Compared with the wild type, the zzso and zzso zzso both showed defects in the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the gene for zzso as measured with a zzso fusion, demonstrated that production of zzso was subject to cell zzso gene zzso in zzso However, zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso which had lost the zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso showed low zzso activity and had lost all cell zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso represent the second zzso regulatory mechanism found in zzso zzso that controls expression of multiple zzso factor zzso including zzso
