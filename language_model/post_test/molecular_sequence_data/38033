The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a central zzso in protection against zzso damage or the zzso control of cell zzso Previously a zzso zzso zzso zzso for rat zzso zzso 1 zzso was characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso and Holmgren zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, the major rat zzso zzso was determined as zzso zzso by Northern zzso A corresponding full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso being extended in the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso compared with the previous zzso Among zzso zzso lowest zzso zzso levels were found in zzso and zzso and highest in liver and zzso High expression in kidney was unexpected and in zzso zzso of adult rat kidney was zzso This revealed a highly structured expression pattern with the zzso being prominently zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso rat kidney zzso a zzso zzso domain of zzso was found that was different from that in zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso domain was instead highly similar to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso By sequence determination of the rat zzso sequence upstream of the open reading frame for zzso an zzso was encountered that zzso a third alternative zzso zzso domain that could also be zzso as confirmed by its presence in a mouse skin zzso zzso zzso It can therefore be concluded that zzso zzso is expressed in at least three different zzso that differ at their zzso zzso
