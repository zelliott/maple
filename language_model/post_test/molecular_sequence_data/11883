A zzso had been isolated from the zzso media of a human zzso cell line and had tentatively been named zzso zzso because of the size of its core zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso and zzso analysis were consistent with the assumption that zzso is identical with the zzso form of zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso induced mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso On a zzso basis, however, about zzso to zzso higher doses of zzso than of zzso human zzso were required for the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso removal of the zzso chain, the zzso core protein exhibited higher activity, but was still about zzso less active than zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for 48 h at 37 degrees C led to the formation of a zzso zzso zzso either by zzso or by the action of a zzso not yet zzso The zzso zzso exhibited almost the same zzso activity as zzso The zzso chain of the growth factor was not only shown to inhibit zzso activity but also to increase the stability of the core protein when the zzso zzso cells were maintained in a collagen zzso These findings provide a link between a zzso highly active zzso and its zzso zzso storage form of comparatively low zzso
