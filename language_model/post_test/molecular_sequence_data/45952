We zzso a zzso zzso clone spanning the bovine prion protein zzso zzso and compared the zzso structure with that of zzso As a result, we determined the precise zzso between the two zzso zzso located on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and discovered two highly repetitive sequences near the zzso Further analysis demonstrated that the zzso structure of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso region of the bovine zzso is highly zzso in order and zzso The zzso locus was not found in bovine but is zzso in several zzso including zzso Moreover, we confirmed that the bovine zzso is composed of 10 zzso as is the human zzso showing some difference from a previous zzso Our findings may provide useful clues for understanding the zzso process in the zzso locus and also the mechanism that allows zzso from cattle to zzso zzso
