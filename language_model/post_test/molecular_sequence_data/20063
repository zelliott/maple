The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the zzso and zzso states of zzso zzso zzso and to investigate how the zzso states of zzso and zzso zzso zzso are coordinated in response to light intensity and zzso concentration during photosynthesis in leaves of the zzso plant zzso grass zzso zzso There was a zzso zzso relationship between the zzso state of zzso and its zzso state, determined in a selective zzso that zzso zzso from zzso forms of the zzso At high zzso flux density and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within 1 h of zzso The zzso state of both zzso did not zzso until high light zzso (about 1,400 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso After zzso at lower light zzso and zzso zzso the overall change in zzso state was smaller and it took longer for the change in zzso state to zzso zzso states of zzso and zzso showed a zzso similar, but zzso pattern in relation to changes in light and zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso acid, promoted the zzso of both zzso The protein synthesis zzso zzso blocked dark zzso of zzso The data show that zzso and zzso zzso states are closely coordinated in zzso despite being located in the zzso and bundle sheath cells, zzso
