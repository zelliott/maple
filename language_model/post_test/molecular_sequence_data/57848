zzso zzso strains that zzso three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso To understand the role of these toxins in the zzso of this disease, we have previously reported the cloning of the zzso gene zzso zzso et zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso To clone the third toxin gene zzso a new zzso library using zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso DNA was zzso A series of five overlapping zzso zzso clones carrying the gene zzso for this zzso zzso were identified using a DNA probe containing sequences from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a region of the cloned DNA reveals four open reading frames zzso proteins with predicted masses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, are similar in sequence to the zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso The toxin produced by the cloned gene kills zzso cells and is not zzso in zzso
