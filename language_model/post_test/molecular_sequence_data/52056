zzso zzso factor zzso is a potent zzso zzso that zzso the release of zzso and zzso from various cells and zzso We examined the capacity of zzso alone and in combination with soluble stimuli to enhance zzso synthesis and adherence of human zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and washed before exposure to the soluble stimuli zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with 1 zzso zzso enhanced the release of both zzso and zzso in response to each of the three zzso in contrast with the zzso zzso zzso was specific for zzso since zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso also zzso the adherence of zzso to zzso in the presence of the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso release and zzso adherence was shown to have similar zzso and zzso zzso Further, the zzso effects of zzso on adherence could be reversed by zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso but not by zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso adherence to zzso through a zzso dependent zzso
