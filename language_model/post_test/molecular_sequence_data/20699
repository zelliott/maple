The complement system is one of the first line of immune zzso mechanisms as well as a modifier of acquired zzso zzso is the central complement component primarily zzso in zzso The local synthesis of zzso in zzso other than liver may play an important role in local inflammatory zzso The present study aims at looking into zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso expression that is yet to be explored for Indian zzso zzso eggs, and eggs after 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 h zzso and hatchlings at 24 zzso and 3 and 7 days zzso were collected from three zzso fish of zzso zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted from approximately 50 zzso of tissue and subjected to zzso using zzso carp zzso to amplify zzso zzso A product of 155 zzso size of zzso zzso was zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence of which had zzso similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in zzso and 6 h zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected 12 h zzso Similarly, zzso from liver, zzso zzso muscle, brain, zzso zzso blood, heart and zzso collected from juveniles of zzso were subjected to detection of zzso transcripts by zzso and zzso zzso was detected in all the zzso Thus, it is concluded that there is zzso synthesis of complement zzso in zzso zzso and the synthesis of this component occurs only 6 h zzso
