Generation of factor VIII zzso activity requires zzso metal zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso from isolated factor zzso zzso revealed the presence of a functional zzso binding site within the A1 zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated at least two zzso binding sites of similar affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso within the A1 zzso zzso of an zzso zzso region in the A1 domain zzso zzso zzso to a putative zzso binding site in factor V zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso factor VIII molecules yielded zzso to probe zzso and zzso binding in a functional zzso zzso activity observed for wild type factor VIII in a metal zzso buffer was enhanced approximately zzso with zzso zzso or zzso and yielded functional zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding affinity was greatly reduced (or zzso in several zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed wild zzso activity with little or no reduction in zzso zzso However, zzso affinity was minimally altered except for zzso zzso (and zzso These results are consistent with region zzso serving a critical role for zzso coordination with selected zzso capable of contributing to a partially overlapping site for zzso and that occupancy of either site is required for zzso zzso zzso
