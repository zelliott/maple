Nuclear zzso signals zzso have been classified as either zzso or zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso show that the zzso of a zzso cluster zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso This zzso comprises two zzso basic sequences and the first basic sequence of the zzso Neither the two zzso basic sequences nor the zzso zzso zzso zzso drive our construction to the zzso zzso zzso in the second basic sequence are suppressed by zzso that restore the zzso of the zzso The integrity of the zzso is not necessary for nuclear zzso A tandem repetition of the two basic zzso sequences results in a strong zzso Complete nuclear zzso is observed when the whole zzso domain, including the putative zzso element, is included in the zzso At zzso with what is seen with tandem zzso all zzso here is zzso This suggests that retention and nuclear entry are functionally zzso With the whole zzso zzso we observe zzso retention and also a striking zzso within the zzso Nuclear zzso and zzso are zzso (not dependent on zzso zzso In contrast with what has been observed by others in zzso zzso none of our constructions are zzso during zzso This is the first analysis of the zzso of a zzso cluster protein and the first zzso of a zzso zzso
