Of the five sodium channel zzso expressed in cardiac zzso the rat zzso and human zzso zzso are thought to be the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso expression zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso were used to confirm protein expression and to zzso zzso protein in cardiac zzso 

zzso zzso zzso adult rat heart tissue in a manner identical to that obtained with zzso zzso All zzso specifically bound to the surface and zzso systems of zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso reflecting nascent sodium channels or zzso stores of sodium channel zzso was zzso Most notably, all zzso also specifically labeled the subset of zzso disks located at the ends but not the sides of adjacent zzso muscle zzso 

zzso is the zzso zzso expressed on rat zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso protein zzso in surface and zzso zzso is consistent with its proposed role in zzso membrane zzso along the length and deep within cardiac muscle zzso zzso protein zzso in terminal zzso disks suggests that sodium channels may also act as a localized zzso current amplifier, raising the safety margin for zzso they also may contribute to zzso or zzso zzso in cardiac zzso These zzso properties would be particularly important under conditions of altered, channel function resulting from zzso channel gene defects zzso long zzso zzso zzso drug therapy, zzso or other heart diseases by influencing the zzso zzso for zzso zzso
