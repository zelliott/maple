zzso zzso usage plays a critical role in virus zzso and zzso A switch from zzso to zzso viruses occurs during the course of zzso infection and zzso with subsequent disease zzso A single zzso at position zzso within the zzso loop of the zzso envelope zzso zzso from a zzso to a positively charged zzso was found to be sufficient to switch an zzso virus to an zzso zzso In this study, the zzso structure of the zzso region of an zzso strain, zzso in complex with an zzso zzso was zzso zzso charged and zzso charged zzso at positions 304 and zzso respectively, oppose each other in the zzso structure, enabling a favorable zzso interaction that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region zzso charged zzso at position zzso reveals that zzso zzso between zzso 304 and zzso in zzso strains triggers the observed one register shift in the zzso strand of the zzso zzso We zzso that zzso interactions at the base of the zzso zzso can zzso the zzso and thereby influence the zzso zzso In addition, we suggest that zzso zzso interactions between positively charged and aromatic zzso induce the switch to the zzso zzso as a result of the zzso zzso The existence of three pairs of identical (or very zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso strand zzso the switch between the zzso and zzso zzso
