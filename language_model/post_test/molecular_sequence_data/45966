The closely related peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso have opposing effects on blood zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso in the zzso whereas zzso stimulates zzso and zzso in the zzso The identification of a hybrid zzso acting as both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso would provide a novel approach for the treatment of type 2 zzso Toward this end a series of hybrid peptides made up of zzso and either zzso or zzso a zzso zzso was zzso Several peptides that bind to both the zzso and zzso receptors were zzso The presence of zzso sequence at the N zzso removed the zzso IV zzso site and increased plasma stability compared with zzso zzso zzso were incorporated into the optimal zzso binding zzso to identify a zzso with the highly novel property of functioning as both a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso To overcome the short zzso of this zzso zzso in zzso while retaining dual zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, zzso attachment of long chained zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso at the C zzso retained the in zzso activities of the zzso while dramatically zzso the duration of action in zzso Thus, we have generated a novel zzso zzso with potential for development as a therapeutic for type 2 zzso
