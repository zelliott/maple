zzso zzso in the frequency range of zzso zzso characteristic of zzso sleep zzso are often referred to as the delta zzso or delta zzso Delta power reflects sleep intensity and zzso with the zzso response to sleep zzso A published survey of zzso strains of mice demonstrated that the time course of zzso of delta power varied among zzso zzso and the segregation of the rebound of delta power in zzso zzso zzso strains identified a zzso region on zzso 13 referred to as the delta power in zzso (or zzso The quantitative trait locus zzso contains genes that modify the zzso of delta power after sleep zzso Here, we narrow the zzso using zzso zzso analysis and present a comprehensive zzso of the remaining genes in the zzso region with sequence comparisons to identify zzso within the coding and regulatory zzso We established the expression pattern of selected genes located in the zzso zzso in sleep and zzso in B6 and zzso parental zzso Taken together, these steps reduced the number of potential candidate genes that may zzso the zzso of delta power after sleep deprivation and explain the zzso zzso The strongest candidate gene is zzso which is supported by expression differences between sleep and zzso and the zzso zzso in the upstream regulatory zzso
