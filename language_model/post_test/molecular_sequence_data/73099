As one of the first steps to zzso the relationship between the structure and function of zzso zzso zzso zzso in plants, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for a protein of 331 zzso zzso The deduced structure of the zzso was composed of three main zzso the zzso domain in the zzso half, the zzso zzso region and the zzso domain in the zzso The zzso domain region was relatively well zzso among different organisms, showing 76 and zzso zzso with the rat and zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso profile revealed that the zzso zzso portion of the protein was very zzso highly enriched in zzso charged zzso acid and zzso acid zzso In the region between the zzso domain and the zzso region, there was an zzso zzso domain, which was believed to bind the membrane surface in the active zzso Unlike animal counterparts, there was only one potential site of zzso by protein zzso C and none by zzso protein zzso II in the zzso zzso The identity of zzso zzso was verified by successful transformation of a zzso zzso defective in the zzso activity, using an expression zzso inserted with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This was further confirmed by in zzso analysis of the zzso reaction product after labeling the zzso zzso with radioactive zzso Southern analysis indicated the presence of a single copy of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
