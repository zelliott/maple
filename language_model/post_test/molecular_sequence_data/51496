zzso zzso zzso play an integral role in T cell zzso zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso of a number of cellular zzso One of these is the zzso zzso chain, which can mediate the zzso of zzso stimuli into cellular zzso zzso We have recently identified a 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso that associates with zzso and zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso clone zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso and is expressed in T and natural killer zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and association of zzso with zzso require the presence of zzso family zzso and provide a potential mechanism by which the zzso family zzso and zzso may interact to mediate zzso signal zzso
