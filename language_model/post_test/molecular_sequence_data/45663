zzso zzso in the human breast cancer zzso genes zzso and zzso account for the majority of zzso breast and zzso zzso In spite of the large number of sequence zzso identified in zzso and zzso zzso zzso many of these genetic zzso are still classified as zzso of unknown significance zzso In this study, we evaluated 12 zzso zzso zzso in order to differentiate their zzso or zzso effects on the zzso zzso zzso We detected the existence of zzso zzso in three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso All but one of the zzso transcripts arise from zzso affecting the zzso zzso zzso or donor sequences and all would be predicted to result in expression of truncated zzso or zzso zzso However, we demonstrated that four of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with premature termination zzso were highly unstable and were unlikely to zzso for abundant expression of a zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in our studies show no effects on the normal zzso process, and they are considered to be benign zzso zzso Our studies help to clarify the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso as well as provide information that can be used clinically to help counsel zzso cancer prone zzso
