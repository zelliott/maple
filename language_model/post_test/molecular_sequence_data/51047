Several zzso zzso mouse zzso T cell zzso clones recognize zzso peptides in association with class I zzso molecules zzso zzso However, cell modification with zzso zzso acid zzso also leads to the formation of zzso zzso zzso attached to zzso molecules zzso zzso To determine the importance of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso we used the zzso cell line zzso which expresses zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules at 26 degrees zzso Additionally, we stabilized zzso molecules on zzso cells at 37 degrees C using the zzso binding zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso this zzso remains unmodified by zzso and, therefore, only allows the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso on occupied zzso zzso zzso targets, zzso or zzso with zzso upon zzso modification were only zzso poorly or not at all by four different zzso zzso In contrast, all of these clones efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and three of them strongly reacted with zzso or zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the clone zzso for zzso peptides also recognized zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data clearly show that zzso zzso linked to zzso via associated peptides but not by zzso zzso represent the dominant zzso zzso for class I zzso zzso T zzso
