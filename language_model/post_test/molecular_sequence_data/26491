Chemical mapping methods probe zzso structure by revealing and leveraging correlations of a zzso structural accessibility or flexibility with its zzso to various chemical zzso zzso work by zzso and colleagues has expanded this method to probe hundreds of molecules at once on an zzso sequencing platform, obviating the use of slab gels or zzso zzso on one zzso at a zzso Here, we describe zzso to this method from our lab, resulting in the zzso protocol zzso zzso zzso read out through zzso version zzso The protocol permits the quantitative probing of thousands of zzso at once, by several chemical modification zzso on the time scale of a day using a zzso zzso zzso This method and a software package zzso ( zzso ) address several potential sources of bias, by eliminating zzso steps, improving zzso efficiencies of zzso zzso and avoiding problematic zzso in prior zzso We hope that the zzso description of zzso zzso will help other zzso mapping laboratories to transition from zzso to next-generation sequencing methods and to further reduce the turnaround time and any remaining biases of the zzso
