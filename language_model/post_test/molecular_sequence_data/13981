zzso zzso G proteins play important roles in a large number of signal zzso zzso While the zzso of zzso protein zzso is well zzso nothing is known about how these proteins are zzso In this article, a novel zzso activity has been identified from bovine zzso and is shown specifically to remove the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of T zzso When tested in a zzso binding zzso freshly prepared zzso T beta gamma was unable to catalyze the binding of zzso zzso zzso to T alpha in the presence of zzso zzso zzso The optimum pH for this zzso activity is approximately 6, and the pH profile zzso to an zzso having zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for its active site zzso After analyzing a series of zzso zzso we found zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso to be the most effective irreversible inhibitor of this zzso suggesting that the zzso might be a zzso zzso zzso labeling studies using zzso affinity labeling zzso have identified a 35 zzso protein as a candidate for the zzso
