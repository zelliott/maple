High affinity zzso and zzso zzso transport into zzso nerve terminals and fine zzso processes removes the neurotransmitter from the synaptic zzso thereby terminating zzso zzso This report describes that the zzso zzso zzso from pig brain is zzso by protein zzso C, predominantly at zzso zzso Upon exposure of zzso cells, a cell line of zzso origin, to zzso about a zzso stimulation of zzso transport is observed within 30 zzso zzso the level of zzso increases with similar zzso The zzso zzso also stimulates zzso transport in zzso cells infected with a zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso The latter is a recently cloned rat brain zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 113 to zzso does not affect the levels of expressed transport but zzso its stimulation by the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of the regulation of a neurotransmitter zzso by zzso
