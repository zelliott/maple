Due to the limited zzso information about the zzso little is known about the interactions acting at the interface between zzso and viral zzso Knowing that subtle zzso in the zzso zzso of the M protein are already zzso we have now zzso the equivalent domain of the spike zzso protein by extending it terminally with a foreign sequence of 27 zzso the green fluorescent protein zzso When expressed individually in zzso cells, the zzso zzso protein induced the formation of fluorescent zzso indicating that it was zzso and folded properly, zzso and transported to the plasma zzso where it exhibited the two key S protein functions, zzso interaction with virus zzso molecules and membrane zzso zzso into zzso particles demonstrated the assembly competence of the zzso spike zzso The zzso S gene of mouse zzso coronavirus zzso was subsequently replaced by the zzso construct through targeted zzso A viable zzso was zzso infection by which could be zzso by the zzso zzso The efficiency of incorporation of the zzso protein into particles was, however, reduced relative to that in zzso particles which may explain, at least in part, the reduced zzso produced by zzso zzso We conclude that the incorporation of spikes carrying the large zzso zzso is apparently impaired by geometrical constraints and selected against during the assembly of zzso Probably due to this zzso deletion zzso having lost the foreign zzso rapidly evolved and zzso the zzso viruses during virus zzso The fluorescent zzso will now be a convenient tool to study zzso cell zzso
