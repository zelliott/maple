The zzso forms of transforming growth zzso zzso and stem cell growth factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso are converted to soluble growth factor forms by a regulated zzso zzso zzso Each of these proteins is zzso at a distinct site, however their zzso is activated via a common set of zzso signaling zzso By using a panel of zzso zzso we show here that at least two zzso zzso zzso activities with distinct zzso participate in membrane growth factor zzso Two zzso zzso zzso of broad zzso zzso and zzso prevent the zzso of zzso and zzso but not that of zzso Of the agents tested, zzso zzso zzso and various zzso zzso derivatives are the most potent zzso of zzso of all three membrane growth zzso It is concluded that zzso of zzso growth factors involves a zzso system with multiple zzso zzso activities regulated through common zzso
