The zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso mediates entry of the zzso into cultured zzso cells by binding several beta 1 chain zzso In this study, we identified the region of zzso responsible for cell zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso were isolated, and of those, six blocked cell attachment to zzso These six zzso recognized zzso within the last 192 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso fusion proteins were generated and tested for cell zzso All of the zzso derivatives that carried the zzso 192 zzso acids retained cell binding zzso One zzso zzso zzso and seven zzso fusion proteins were zzso The zzso derivatives that retained binding activity inhibited bacterial entry into cultured zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso 192 zzso acids of zzso contains the zzso domain, even though this region does not contain the zzso sequence zzso
