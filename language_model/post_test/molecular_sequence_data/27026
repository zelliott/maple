A zzso moderately zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso sample collected from a salt lake in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso by means of zzso zzso and formed zzso zzso lying in zzso swollen zzso Growth occurred with zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso and at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso degrees C zzso zzso degrees zzso It was unable to grow with zzso as the only zzso zzso acid was present in the zzso zzso The strain contained zzso 7 zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso and zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso as polar zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between strain zzso zzso and the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The combination of zzso analysis, zzso data, zzso characteristics and zzso differences indicated that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso
