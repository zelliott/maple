zzso dominant lateral zzso zzso zzso or zzso dominant partial zzso with auditory features zzso is an inherited zzso syndrome with onset in zzso and benign zzso The hallmark of the syndrome consists of typical auditory zzso or zzso zzso in most affected family zzso zzso is associated in about half of the families with zzso of the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso In addition, de zzso zzso zzso are found in about zzso of sporadic cases with idiopathic partial zzso with auditory features, who are clinically similar to the majority of patients with zzso but have no family zzso Twenty-five zzso zzso have been described in familial and sporadic lateral zzso zzso zzso The zzso are distributed throughout the gene and are mostly zzso zzso occurring in both the zzso zzso rich repeat zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We show a zzso model of the zzso protein region that allows zzso zzso of this region to be divided into two distinct groups: structural and functional zzso zzso nonsense and zzso site point zzso have also been reported that result in protein zzso or internal zzso The various types of zzso are associated with a rather homogeneous zzso and no obvious zzso correlation can be zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso appear to prevent zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a loss of function effect of zzso The function of zzso is zzso Several molecular mechanisms possibly leading to lateral zzso zzso are illustrated and briefly zzso
