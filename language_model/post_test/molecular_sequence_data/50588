zzso zzso zzso zzso the rate limiting step in the production of zzso needed for DNA zzso It is composed of two dissimilar zzso zzso the large zzso containing the zzso regulatory sites, and zzso the small zzso containing a zzso iron center and a zzso free zzso Recent isolation of the zzso and zzso zzso genes has shown that, in addition to the well documented zzso regulation, the synthesis of the zzso is also tightly regulated at the level of zzso The zzso for both zzso are zzso regulated and, in zzso zzso by DNA zzso zzso zzso a second large zzso zzso zzso that is expressed only in the presence of DNA zzso This regulation is thought to provide a zzso state that zzso DNA zzso repair zzso
