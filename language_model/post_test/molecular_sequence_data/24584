zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the first two zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Type I zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The zzso zzso belong to a family of specific zzso present in zzso in some zzso and also in zzso zzso a Type II zzso zzso These zzso are not part of the zzso family, which is broadly distributed among zzso including the Type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli was specific for zzso and zzso as are its zzso zzso The sequence of zzso and zzso zzso formed a zzso group more closely related to zzso and zzso sequences than to zzso zzso of other zzso and zzso The findings show that certain zzso of the energy metabolism of these zzso zzso originated from sources different than those of other zzso The observation that the two zzso and zzso zzso share the same unusual zzso and zzso is consistent with gene trees that suggest a close relationship between zzso and zzso The intriguing relationships of these zzso to zzso (and zzso zzso might reflect horizontal gene transfer between the common zzso of the zzso and zzso lineages and the zzso of zzso
