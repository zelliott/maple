The zzso molecular motor zzso zzso along zzso touching down with alternate motor zzso and zzso bridging between sites spaced 8 zzso apart zzso To allow zzso the coiled zzso tail of zzso would need to zzso a region immediately adjacent to the heads, and the tail region sequence at this point indeed contains potentially zzso interruptions in the regular zzso zzso zzso We noticed that such interruptions are substantially absent from the coiled zzso tails of zzso a slow zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso and we wondered if this precluded their zzso We measured the temperature dependence of zzso zzso an index of the chemical zzso of a zzso the number of zzso split per productive zzso encounter of motor with zzso We found zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to be slightly if at all zzso in solution over the range 4 degrees C to 30 degrees zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and became substantially more so with increasing zzso zzso plots for the solution zzso were linear for all three zzso zzso plots for zzso gliding zzso were linear and essentially parallel for zzso and zzso zzso zzso 61 and 63 zzso zzso but for zzso the plot was zzso with a break at 17 degrees C, corresponding to a zzso reduction in zzso from 84 to 57 zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso and zzso are only slightly if at all zzso and suggest that this may be related to structural differences in their coiled zzso neck zzso
