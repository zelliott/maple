The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a great potential for the study of Arctic marine zzso Subdivision of the zzso has been based on single or few zzso characters zzso lateral line zzso with contradicting results and zzso approaches have not been zzso Here we present the first zzso analysis of the zzso employing DNA sequences of the zzso genes zzso b and zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis with the two genes combined resulted in two equally zzso zzso In both zzso most of the previously suggested zzso are zzso or zzso except for the so-called zzso zzso zzso with a short tail, a single zzso lateral line zzso and a shallow or filled zzso zzso The group of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso types of lateral line zzso and a deep zzso zzso appears to be zzso since Pacific and Atlantic species in this group are not each other's closest zzso Thus, the zzso species are placed in a derived zzso indicating a secondary zzso of the tail, and a zzso to zzso type of zzso This is not in accordance with earlier assumptions of the more zzso deeper living species being the more zzso The zzso position of zzso Pacific species supports earlier theories of Pacific origin of the zzso Small genetic differences between zzso species indicate a rather recent radiation in these areas after the opening of the zzso Strait zzso million years zzso
