We determined the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso similar to those seen for the two zzso of the zzso as found in all other zzso species studied are present in a single open reading frame of zzso zzso This apparent gene fusion joins the C zzso of the large zzso zzso to the N zzso of the small zzso zzso through a short connecting zzso We designate the fused gene zzso The gene is flanked by a typical zzso zzso at the 3' end and a complex regulatory region at the zzso end resembling those of zzso under zzso zzso zzso The location of the promoter was determined by zzso zzso protection, using zzso zzso Although this promoter was inactive in zzso coli, zzso zzso activity were easily zzso One of these was a zzso change at position -9 in the zzso zzso The zzso position of the zzso is the first base of the initiation zzso of the leader zzso zzso that unlike zzso which has a normal zzso zzso the leader zzso gene lacks a zzso zzso
