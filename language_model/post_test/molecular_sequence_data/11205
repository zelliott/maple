The human zzso zzso has been implicated in several inherited diseases including zzso zzso three forms of zzso zzso zzso and the eye disorders zzso zzso 2, zzso stationary night blindness, and zzso Island eye zzso In constructing zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso we have previously shown that the region around the zzso zzso gene is zzso to cloning in zzso but highly stable in zzso zzso analysis of the latter suggested that this might reflect a high density of coding sequences and we therefore undertook the complete sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso data were extensively analyzed using computer programs such as zzso (to mask zzso zzso (for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso (to predict zzso This revealed the presence of 29 putative zzso organized into three zzso in addition to the 7 zzso of the complete zzso coding region, all mapping within a zzso zzso Two genes are novel, one zzso showing high zzso to zzso zzso of calcium channels, the other zzso zzso a product with significant similarity to zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso studies confirmed that these zzso are indeed zzso The third locus is the previously zzso but not previously zzso A4 zzso zzso Given that the zzso boundaries predicted by the analysis are consistent with previous information where available, we have been able to suggest the zzso organization of the novel genes with some zzso The region has an elevated zzso content zzso and we identified zzso islands associated with the zzso ends of zzso zzso and zzso The order of zzso was zzso with zzso distances ranging from approximately 300 zzso to approximately 5 zzso The density of transcribed sequences in this area zzso is comparable to that found in the highly zzso zzso band zzso Further studies may aid our understanding of the long-range organization surrounding such zzso zzso
