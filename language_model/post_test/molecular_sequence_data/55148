To study the functions of zzso proteins independent of their zzso activity, zzso methods have been developed, based on the use of the zzso domain of a zzso zzso protein and its target zzso Two zzso proteins have mainly been used as zzso the zzso coat protein and the zzso N zzso Here we report an alternative system using the zzso zzso zzso from the bovine zzso virus zzso which binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the usefulness of this system by applying it to the analysis of the zzso zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso
