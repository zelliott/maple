zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso A gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso was isolated using zzso zzso deduced from zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the cloned region revealed the presence of an open reading frame coding for zzso zzso and interrupted once by an zzso of 102 zzso in the zzso part of the zzso The start zzso is followed by a sequence coding for a putative signal zzso zzso of zzso is controlled at the level of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso After cell growth in zzso zzso a transcript of about zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso at at least seven start points within a region located zzso zzso upstream from the start zzso In zzso of zzso zzso expression of multiple copies of zzso resulted in up to more than tenfold higher zzso levels than in the zzso zzso
