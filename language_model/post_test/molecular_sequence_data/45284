To clone the gene coding for the zzso recognition protein zzso domain zzso of mouse long zzso zzso and express the protein in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was obtained by zzso from the total zzso of zzso mouse liver cells and cloned into zzso zzso The zzso zzso were identified by zzso restriction zzso and sequence zzso The zzso gene zzso was amplified by zzso from the zzso zzso inserted into zzso zzso and transformed into zzso coli strain zzso and the expressed zzso protein was zzso 

A zzso zzso of about 500 zzso was amplified by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was constructed by linking the zzso to zzso zzso The results of restriction mapping of the zzso zzso were consistent with those of computer zzso zzso analysis showed that the cloned gene zzso zzso zzso had identical sequence with the gene zzso zzso of zzso gene in zzso The zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso showed that the expressed product existed mainly in the zzso zzso as a soluble protein with relative molecular mass of 29 zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso has been successfully cloned and expressed in zzso coli, which provides the basis for further study of zzso zzso
