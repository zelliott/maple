The human zzso virus type 1 zzso region encodes zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso frame encodes an zzso late assembly L domain and a zzso zzso binding zzso In the Pol frame, substitution at a zzso motif decreases zzso zzso The role of the highly zzso central region of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso Analysis of this central region demonstrated that 35 % of zzso appears to be zzso for virus propagation in zzso and smaller deletion and zzso zzso can be tolerated in zzso zzso Pol deletion zzso 42 % of zzso did not alter zzso zzso
