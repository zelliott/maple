zzso zzso belongs to the 57 most common species present in zzso of zzso Previously, we identified an zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso family 36 from zzso zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Giardina, zzso Simon, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified a novel zzso gene from the same strain and termed it zzso Although zzso showed a very simple genetic organization, zzso is part of an zzso of unique structure, including genes zzso zzso a regulator, a zzso two zzso system zzso zzso and a zzso probably involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso deduced zzso protein shares approximately zzso identity with zzso Both zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli showed strict specificity for zzso zzso Both zzso were active on natural zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso occurred as zzso in solution, as shown by zzso zzso Modeling of zzso and zzso identified key zzso acids which may be involved in zzso specificity and stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso within the active zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso were both able to perform zzso reactions with zzso zzso leading to the formation of product structures up to zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso play essential roles in the metabolism of dietary zzso and could be used for the design of zzso zzso zzso known to selectively zzso the beneficial gut zzso
