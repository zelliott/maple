zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso zzso zzso We have determined the primary structure of mouse zzso by characterization of complementary DNA zzso clones and by zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates that mouse zzso is zzso as a zzso precursor protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso mature mouse lung zzso demonstrated the sequence to begin with zzso These results indicate that zzso as initially zzso contains a zzso precursor zzso and that the mature protein is 227 zzso acids in zzso Computer zzso that predict the most likely site of zzso signal zzso zzso suggest that processing will occur between zzso acids 18 and 19 or 20 and 21, which implies that zzso may be initially zzso as a zzso Like human zzso mature mouse zzso is zzso The full-length mouse zzso zzso is zzso base pairs long and is zzso zzso for zzso identical to rat zzso but only zzso zzso for zzso identical to human zzso The mouse zzso gene locus zzso was mapped by zzso zzso zzso analysis as being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso locus on mouse zzso 5, a position suggesting that the human zzso of zzso will map close to the human zzso locus zzso Of nine zzso examined by Northern zzso analysis, those of the kidney and lung are by far the major zzso that express zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso in the mouse zzso we demonstrate zzso gene expression to be highly localized to zzso Type II zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso Type II cells play a central role in zzso zzso zzso function in the zzso
