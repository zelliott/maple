The zzso zzso in the reaction center core of zzso binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the terminal zzso of the zzso electron transfer chain in the zzso II zzso This complex is the target of the zzso zzso an environmental zzso competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso and consequently it represents an excellent zzso to develop zzso for zzso monitoring in zzso In this context, we have undertaken a study of the zzso zzso zzso proteins aimed at designing site directed zzso with increased affinity for zzso The three-dimensional structure of the D1 and zzso proteins from zzso zzso has been zzso modeled using the crystal structure of the highly zzso zzso zzso proteins as zzso zzso of D1 and zzso were then generated in zzso and the zzso binding affinity of the zzso proteins has been calculated to predict zzso able to increase zzso affinity for zzso The zzso approach has been validated through comparison with available experimental data and production and characterization of one of the predicted zzso The latter analyses indicated an increase of one order of magnitude of the zzso sensitivity and affinity for zzso as compared to the control zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso were designed and selected which, according to our model, increase zzso binding affinity by up to 20 zzso representing useful starting points for the development of high affinity zzso for zzso
