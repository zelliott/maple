The zzso gene family constitutes a zzso group of genes with a broad range of zzso This family encodes four zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are targets of the zzso complex, and function as negative regulators in the zzso signaling zzso Recently, it has been reported in both zzso and rice that zzso zzso and especially zzso zzso may be involved in plant defense against insect zzso zzso pathogens and zzso zzso Nonetheless, knowledge concerning the specific expression patterns and evolutionary history of plant zzso family members is zzso especially in a woody species such as zzso 

A total of two zzso four zzso two zzso and 11 zzso genes were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein sequences from zzso zzso and rice indicated that the grape zzso proteins are more closely related to those of zzso than those of zzso Both zzso and tandem zzso events have been major contributors to the expansion of the grape zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis between grape and zzso demonstrated that zzso of several grape zzso genes were found in the corresponding zzso blocks of zzso suggesting that these genes arose before the divergence of lineages that led to grape and zzso zzso of zzso and quantitative real-time zzso expression data revealed that grape zzso genes are not a major player in the defense against zzso pathogens or zzso However, many of these genes were responsive to zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso 

The zzso zzso evolutionary and expression analyses of grape zzso genes should facilitate further research of this gene family and provide new insights regarding their evolutionary history and regulatory zzso
