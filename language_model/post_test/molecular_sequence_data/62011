zzso an zzso zzso zzso rich hormone has been implicated as molecular link between obesity and type 2 diabetes in a zzso zzso zzso at the protein level mouse and human zzso show remarkable similarities with respect to zzso zzso zzso the zzso role of human zzso is not yet zzso In the present study we describe the zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso using two different zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of protein zzso by both the methods revealed that human zzso zzso like mouse zzso has a tendency to form zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso appears to be zzso by both zzso zzso bond zzso and zzso interactions as seen on reducing and zzso zzso zzso zzso spectral analysis revealed that human zzso zzso backbone is a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso with significant amounts of zzso structure, similar to the mouse zzso It is likely that the first zzso zzso of human zzso which is equivalent to mouse zzso may be involved in stabilizing the zzso through zzso zzso
