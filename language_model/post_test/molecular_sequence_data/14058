The gene region coding for zzso alpha and 9 of the zzso zzso zzso exhibit an identical DNA sequence in zzso zzso and the zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso However, zzso containing both genes show different sizes depending on the nuclear zzso To investigate zzso interactions leading to this variation, we performed a comparative transcript analysis with various lines carrying defined nuclear and zzso zzso Northern analyses showed that all wheat lines investigated possess a single zzso zzso of zzso whereas in rye and five independent zzso lines an additional transcript of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicate that the zzso of this gene have staggered zzso zzso in some lines, whereas the 3' zzso seem to be similar in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is initiated at position zzso upstream of the zzso gene in all lines investigated, giving rise to a zzso zzso In rye and zzso staggered zzso zzso were observed closer to the zzso zzso The DNA sequences upstream of these zzso exhibit zzso to plant zzso sites, therefore the zzso zzso ends are most probably generated by zzso zzso As the processing event occurs more frequently in zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso factors from rye are likely to interact with other zzso factors resulting in the observed zzso zzso Most interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso inducing male zzso in zzso zzso fails to generate the zzso zzso in zzso The data support our hypothesis that nuclear factors affect zzso gene expression and thus control sexual fertility in wheat and zzso
