Recent events have created an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies to treat zzso We have applied a zzso zzso library approach to rapidly determine the optimal zzso zzso for the anthrax lethal factor zzso a zzso with an important role in the zzso of the zzso Using this approach we have identified zzso zzso that inhibit the zzso in zzso and that protect cultured zzso from zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso bound to an zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso provide a rationale for the observed selectivity and may be exploited in the design of future generations of zzso zzso
