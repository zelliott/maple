A zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso region of zzso zzso has been hypothesized to be the zzso origin of replication or zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This region included the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a major portion of the zzso gene as well as the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of this region revealed that a zzso DNA zzso from the zzso zzso region was sufficient to exhibit zzso activity, while a zzso zzso from the same region failed to exhibit zzso zzso The zzso activities of plasmids containing the zzso sequence was less than the activities of those containing the entire zzso region, suggesting that the regions zzso the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso The zzso region contained several putative zzso zzso recognition sequences zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso at position 9 in five of the putative zzso boxes decreased zzso zzso zzso at other positions in two of the zzso boxes also decreased zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cluster completely abolished zzso zzso These data indicate that the designated zzso boxes and the zzso cluster of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region are essential for zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso replication could involve interactions of the zzso protein with the putative zzso boxes as well as with the zzso zzso
