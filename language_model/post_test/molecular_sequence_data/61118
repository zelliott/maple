From a library of DNA fragments associated with zzso protein in zzso we have isolated zzso a new zzso gene that encodes a putative zzso protein zzso in evolution from zzso zzso to zzso zzso expression occurs zzso in zzso cells at zzso proceeds in zzso and zzso lineages during germ band movements and becomes then restricted to anterior and zzso zzso in the visceral zzso The zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso are likely acting simultaneously to repress zzso in the other parts of the visceral zzso
