The sequence analysis of the zzso region of zzso disease virus zzso zzso 2 zzso which had zzso with the gene zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso C zzso of zzso zzso virus revealed that there was a single open reading frame zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein from this zzso had strong zzso regions in both the zzso and zzso zzso and several potential zzso zzso sites, as seen in those from the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis using a DNA zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a probe, zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts were identified in zzso zzso When the alignment of zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso genes of three zzso zzso were zzso the zzso between zzso and zzso and that between zzso and zzso showed about zzso identity, whereas that between zzso and zzso was about zzso zzso These results suggested a possibility that the evolutionary distance between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso is shorter than that between zzso and zzso
