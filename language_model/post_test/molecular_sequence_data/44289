To evaluate the role of zzso zzso in the differentiation of cells of neural origin, we developed a molecular approach aimed at the identification of zzso target genes by zzso differential display zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso More than zzso zzso were zzso a few of which displayed a differential regulation pattern in response to zzso zzso zzso analysis of three zzso amplified zzso products showed zzso with the zzso nuclear protein zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso and one zzso previously described by others in fetal human zzso Two zzso products, referred to as zzso and zzso corresponded to new DNA zzso Northern analysis confirmed that zzso treatment of zzso cells resulted in the zzso and zzso of expression of these zzso In particular, zzso was found to accumulate at both 1 and 17 zzso after zzso treatment, whereas zzso product accumulated only at 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and the fetal zzso zzso were significantly decreased by the zzso Further time course analysis of zzso and zzso zzso levels indicated that the hormone exerted a marked zzso regulatory effect on expression of both messages during the course of cell zzso In the present study we report for the first time the identification of a panel of zzso target genes in neural cells that provide new insights in the molecular mechanism of action of zzso in cells of neural zzso
