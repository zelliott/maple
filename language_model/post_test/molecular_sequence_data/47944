The presence of zzso linkages in multiply charged zzso zzso tends to inhibit the formation of structurally zzso product zzso under conventional zzso zzso trap zzso zzso zzso In particular, fragmentation that requires two zzso zzso zzso of a zzso linkage and a zzso zzso is strongly zzso Reduction of the zzso zzso by use of zzso yields parent zzso upon zzso without this zzso Far richer structural information is revealed by zzso trap zzso zzso of the zzso species than from the native zzso These observations are illustrated with doubly zzso native and reduced zzso the zzso + zzso zzso of native bovine insulin and the zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso of the zzso of bovine insulin produced by reduction of the zzso linkages in insulin, and the zzso + zzso zzso of native chicken zzso and the zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso of reduced zzso In each case, the product zzso produced by zzso trap zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso transfer reactions to facilitate interpretation of the product zzso zzso These studies clearly suggest that the identification of zzso with one or more zzso linkages via application of zzso trap zzso zzso to the multiply charged parent zzso formed directly by zzso could be zzso Means for zzso the zzso linkage, such as reduction by zzso prior to zzso are therefore desirable in these zzso
