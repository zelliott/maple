A platform for specifically modulating zzso signaling using peptides derived from the zzso domain of the zzso is zzso This technology, termed zzso zzso the zzso structure of protein zzso The targeted regions zzso V and zzso IX and zzso are analyzed and their zzso three-dimensional structure, and involvement in zzso interaction are zzso Short zzso peptides were derived from the target regions of the zzso zzso zzso and Lyn and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso For each zzso an active designer zzso is shown to selectively inhibit the signaling of the zzso from which it is zzso and to inhibit cancer cell proliferation in the zzso zzso This technology emerges as an zzso tool for zzso zzso selective zzso for a broad range of protein zzso as hits that may be further developed into zzso Moreover, it enables identification of novel zzso targets for selected therapeutic indications as demonstrated in the zzso zzso
