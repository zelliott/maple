We report an improved method for the detection and identification of zzso using zzso and the zzso mobility shift zzso zzso The zzso for detection of zzso was based on the zzso within the DNA coding sequences for zzso zzso A remarkable shift between zzso zzso and zzso bands in PAGE was observed among the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of amplified zzso products from zzso DNA coding for zzso zzso derived from culture showed a specific zzso formed among different zzso zzso Other zzso species were distinguished from zzso due to slow zzso zzso mobility bands observed when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were used as a zzso The specific zzso were detected when as little as 1 zzso of DNA template was used, although better results were obtained with 5 zzso and when zzso products of sample test and zzso standard were mixed at a ratio of zzso To correctly evaluate the feasibility of using zzso to detect and identify zzso 15 clinical sample patients were zzso All zzso clinical samples were identified by zzso as well as the negative zzso In addition, zzso will, in principle, be zzso to the detection and zzso of any zzso showing differences within the zzso zzso as well as to the identification of new and zzso bacterial zzso
