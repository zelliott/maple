The zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso are members of a family of genes that zzso insect zzso proteins zzso zzso are believed to transport zzso zzso through the zzso fluid within zzso zzso to the underlying zzso zzso The recent discovery of a large family of zzso zzso genes in zzso raises new questions about the function, diversity, regulation, and evolution of the zzso zzso We have investigated the zzso and zzso genes in a variety of zzso zzso These studies highlight potential regions of functional significance in the zzso and zzso zzso which may include a region required for interaction with zzso zzso Our results suggest that the two genes arose by an ancient gene duplication, and that in some zzso one or the other gene has been zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene shows a different spatial pattern of expression than in zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso shows a striking degree of conservation between the two species, and we identify a putative regulatory sequence within this zzso Finally, a zzso analysis places both zzso and zzso within a large family of insect zzso and zzso zzso
