zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of 28 zzso that is first produced as a protein of 42 zzso zzso and is later processed at its zzso zzso displays optimal activity towards zzso at zzso and 50 degrees C and shows no activity against zzso cellulose or zzso The zzso of zzso shares similarity with zzso included in family 12 of the zzso and the zzso shares similarity with bacterial zzso zzso included in family zzso This latter domain enables the precursor to bind so tightly to zzso that it can only be zzso by boiling in zzso zzso zzso Another open reading frame zzso situated 216 zzso downstream from the zzso zzso encodes a protein of 40 zzso zzso that does not have any clear zzso activity against cellulosic or zzso compounds, but shows high affinity for zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is processed in old cultures to give a protein of 35 zzso that does not bind to zzso zzso of both zzso is impaired in zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso situated at the fourth position of the first zzso is responsible for this zzso zzso zzso protection experiments demonstrate that both zzso are zzso
