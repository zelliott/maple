zzso family zzso factors have been identified in many organisms and are frequently associated with patterning events during embryonic zzso With an interest in the molecular basis of patterning in the sea zzso zzso we identified several members of the zzso family in zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning and characterization of an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To characterize the spatial distribution of zzso protein throughout sea zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso initiated at the zzso zzso stage and protein was present into the zzso zzso zzso was zzso throughout this period and zzso with marker genes indicated that asymmetry was about the zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso was observed in the zzso territories of all three germ zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was dynamic because expression appeared initially in all zzso zzso cells zzso but, zzso became refined solely to the zzso ones during zzso To determine if the zzso expression of zzso is linked between germ zzso and to place zzso in the sequence of events that specifies the zzso zzso the effects of a series of zzso to zzso polarity on zzso expression in each germ layer were zzso Preventing the nuclear zzso of zzso pharmacological disruption of the zzso axis with zzso zzso of zzso and disruption of the zzso zzso all blocked zzso expression in all germ zzso This indicates that expression of zzso in the zzso territories of each germ layer is a common aspect of zzso zzso downstream of the molecular events that specify the zzso Furthermore, blocking the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and disruption of the zzso zzso also prevented the oral zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso axis is established by a complex series of zzso zzso the function of zzso in the formation of the zzso axis was characterized by examining the zzso consequences of zzso expression of zzso zzso on embryonic development and the expression of marker genes that identify specific germ layers and zzso zzso expression of zzso produced profound zzso defects in derivatives of each germ layer with no apparent loss in zzso events in those zzso This indicates that zzso functions as a regulator of zzso movements in the zzso compartments of the zzso zzso and zzso
