The zzso coupled receptors form a vast zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso regions can be consistently and zzso aligned for nearly all, even zzso zzso members zzso to striking zzso zzso As the fold is highly zzso in evolution, a model of the structure of the zzso zzso bundle built for any individual zzso will thus be of zzso zzso zzso the model must comply with key results zzso obtained for other individual zzso Meeting this demand can greatly reduce the uncertainties in zzso zzso coupled zzso This present communication shows how our recent template model based on the backbone structure of zzso is revised according to that zzso Although it turns out to be in accordance with the experimental data in most of its parts, this revision suggests a sequence accommodation to zzso G that is different from all other published zzso
