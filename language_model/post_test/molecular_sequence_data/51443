zzso of human breast cancer was analyzed in small DNA samples prepared from zzso zzso by means of the zzso chain reaction zzso The method used for zzso analysis was based on restriction zzso length zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene and on the differential zzso of the zzso gene due to random zzso of one of two zzso by zzso in zzso All the 20 breast cancer samples analyzed by the zzso method were zzso in origin and adjacent normal breast zzso were zzso When DNA samples were prepared from widely separated sites of zzso every sample was found to be zzso always exhibiting zzso of the same zzso in each zzso The study on sensitivity showed that the zzso method for zzso analysis can detect the presence of zzso cells against a zzso background when the zzso cell population is 50% or zzso These results demonstrate that zzso analysis by means of zzso offers a good method for studying the zzso in small DNA samples prepared from zzso sections of zzso This method could be applied to distinguish between benign zzso and zzso zzso breast zzso
