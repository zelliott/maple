Previously, we observed that crossovers sites of zzso zzso clustered within or close to zzso regions during genetic zzso in zzso mosaic zzso zzso zzso zzso Nagy and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To test whether zzso sequences can facilitate zzso zzso zzso sequences were introduced into parental zzso zzso zzso and zzso These insertions created a zzso zzso zzso zzso Two other zzso sequences also supported zzso zzso zzso if a common sequence with high or average zzso content was present immediately upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not require any additional sequence motifs or zzso structures and was position zzso within the 3' zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso content zzso the presence of common zzso zzso or moderately zzso and 3' zzso zzso is the important factor that determines the sites of zzso zzso A mechanism that involves zzso switching during synthesis of zzso zzso strands is presented to explain the observed zzso
