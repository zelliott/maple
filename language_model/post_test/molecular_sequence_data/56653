The effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on small cell lung cancer zzso cells was zzso In zzso zzso loaded zzso cells, zzso or zzso elevated zzso calcium in a zzso zzso The zzso calcium was elevated from 133 to 185 zzso with zzso zzso zzso Because zzso strongly elevated zzso calcium after the addition of 1 zzso zzso zzso released calcium from zzso pools using zzso zzso similar results were obtained for zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso binding to zzso cells with high affinity zzso zzso 30 and 5 zzso whereas zzso inhibited zzso and zzso binding with zzso values of 5 and 200 zzso Both 100 zzso zzso and zzso elevated zzso levels in zzso zzso In contrast, 1 zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso whereas 100 zzso zzso caused a strong calcium zzso Both 100 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso growth of zzso zzso These data suggest that biologically active zzso and zzso receptors are present on zzso zzso
