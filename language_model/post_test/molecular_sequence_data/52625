Many zzso interactions involve zzso acid sequences containing zzso motifs and even zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso in such regions zzso assignment, since zzso zzso assignment strategies cannot be zzso Two such systems that we are currently studying include an zzso domain from the protein zzso with a region containing 9 zzso in a 14 zzso acid zzso as well as a WW domain that interacts with a zzso zzso A modified version of the zzso pulse zzso originally described by zzso and co-workers zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso and an experiment which zzso the zzso zzso zzso chemical shifts with the zzso shift of the subsequent zzso are presented and applied to the two systems listed above, allowing sequential assignment of the zzso
