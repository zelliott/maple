Iron is one of the most important minor elements in the shells of zzso This study was designed to investigate the involvement of zzso the principal protein for iron storage, in shell zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso from the freshwater pearl zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The complete zzso contained zzso zzso with an open reading frame zzso of 525 zzso a 153 zzso zzso untranslated region zzso and a 144 zzso 3' zzso The complete zzso DNA was zzso zzso containing four zzso and three zzso The zzso zzso a protein of 174 zzso acids without a signal zzso The deduced zzso contained a highly zzso motif for the zzso center zzso seven zzso of a typical zzso zzso zzso It contained one zzso iron associated zzso zzso and zzso region signature 1 zzso The zzso contained a 27 zzso zzso element with a typical zzso structure in the zzso zzso Copy number zzso zzso of zzso in two populations zzso and zzso were detected using quantitative real-time zzso zzso between zzso and growth were also zzso The results showed that the copy number of the zzso gene of in the zzso zzso ranged from two to 12 in zzso and from two to six in zzso The copy number variation in zzso was higher than that in zzso In terms of shell zzso zzso with four copies of the zzso gene grew faster than those with three copies zzso suggesting that zzso in the zzso gene are associated with growth in shell length and might be a useful molecular marker in selective breeding of zzso zzso
