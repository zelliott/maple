With the human zzso project advancing into what will be a 7- to 10-year DNA sequencing phase, we are presented with the challenge of developing strategies to convert zzso sequence data, as they become available, into biologically meaningful zzso We have analyzed zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequence from a zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with gene expression studies of zzso isolated from humans as well as from mice containing human zzso zzso This zzso zzso has been noted previously for containing the zzso gene cluster and a quantitative trait locus associated with inflammatory zzso Our analysis identified and verified expression of 16 new zzso as well as 7 previously known zzso Of the total of 23 genes in this region, zzso had similarity matches to sequences in protein databases and zzso had exact expressed sequence tag zzso database zzso Comparative mapping studies of eight of the new human genes discovered in the zzso region revealed that all are located in the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso Our analysis demonstrates an approach for examining human sequence as it is made available from large sequencing programs and has resulted in the discovery of several zzso important zzso including a zzso a zzso factor that is zzso to an zzso a protein involved in DNA repair, and several new members of a family of zzso zzso
