To describe the first instance of zzso in a Latin American family with zzso syndrome zzso 

Four affected siblings and their healthy parents were zzso zzso examination included best corrected visual acuity determination, zzso zzso retinal zzso and zzso kinetic zzso zzso methods included linkage analysis using zzso markers located on the markers located on the zzso syndrome 1 zzso region at zzso zzso amplification and direct zzso sequencing analysis of the complete coding region and zzso junctions of zzso In addition, zzso cloning and sequencing techniques were used to characterize a zzso zzso zzso 

The four affected siblings presented with a homogeneous clinical picture characterized by early onset diabetes zzso severe zzso zzso and progressive hearing zzso zzso analysis indicated that all four zzso were zzso for markers linked to the zzso region and that each inherited the same zzso from the mother and the same from the father, suggesting compound zzso zzso zzso analysis disclosed a zzso inherited novel zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso cloning and sequencing revealed a novel zzso 16 zzso deletion that was inherited from the zzso 

Our report of two novel zzso zzso expands the molecular spectrum of zzso zzso This is the first documented case of the molecular basis of the disease in a Latin American zzso Analysis of more patients from this population will establish if compound zzso is commonly found in affected individuals from this ethnic zzso
