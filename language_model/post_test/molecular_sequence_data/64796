Three reporter gene zzso were constructed by a zzso fusion method using the zzso promoter of zzso zzso zzso which can extensively degrade zzso and zzso by zzso zzso The reporter genes used for the construction of the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The reporter fusion plasmids were introduced into zzso coli zzso and the zzso reporters examined for the production of fluorescent light by exposure to aromatic compounds, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The reporter cells, carrying the respective gene zzso responded well to the aromatics when exposed to a concentration of zzso zzso for 10 zzso In particular, the reporter cells carrying the zzso gene fusion produced zzso most extensively to the above mentioned zzso This means that the zzso reporter gene fusion may be useful in bacterial zzso for the detection of aromatic pollutants in the environment, and may also be valuable for examining the zzso of the inducing zzso
