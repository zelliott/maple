zzso reorganization is important for regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome protein zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso and also known to be strongly expressed in zzso Recently, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be required for zzso to activate zzso from zzso zzso zzso has three functional zzso an zzso domain at the N zzso an zzso at the center, and an zzso domain at the C zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of plasma zzso while zzso binds both zzso and zzso through the zzso domain and the zzso zzso However, the zzso role of zzso is completely zzso Here we have investigated the neural function of zzso zzso is strongly expressed in zzso including zzso zzso in developing brain at early zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppresses zzso zzso through the zzso domain with a membrane zzso property, suggesting an implication of membrane trafficking in the neural function of zzso In addition, zzso of zzso to our surprise, also enhances zzso zzso in zzso cells, which is in clear contrast to the previous report that dominant negative zzso of zzso suppress zzso extension in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso in cultured rat zzso zzso enhances zzso branching a little but not zzso zzso while zzso of zzso enhances both zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that a zzso trafficking regulator zzso regulates different aspects of zzso zzso from zzso
