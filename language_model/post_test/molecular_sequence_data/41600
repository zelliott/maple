zzso is globally the zzso manifestation of zzso zzso We report the detection of a novel canine species causing human and canine zzso in Hong zzso Three human cases occurring over 10 months were identified, one presenting with cervical zzso one with an abdominal subcutaneous mass, and one with a zzso zzso zzso worms recovered from the zzso abdominal subcutaneous mass were zzso compatible with zzso The zzso gene sequences of the three human zzso were zzso however, they were only zzso and zzso identical to the zzso gene of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene cluster was successful in the intact worm, and the zzso sequences were zzso and zzso identical to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the blood samples from 200 dogs and 100 cats showed the presence of the novel zzso species in zzso zzso of the zzso but none of the zzso blood zzso zzso sequences of the zzso gene and zzso gene clusters of the zzso samples were identical to those in the human zzso The zzso of zzso infected by this novel zzso species were negative when tested with the zzso zzso zzso zzso detection zzso except in the case of dogs with a mixed infection with zzso zzso as detected by zzso The results from this study suggest that this novel zzso species is a cause of zzso infection in humans and dogs in Hong zzso We propose to name this zzso species zzso zzso zzso
