The zzso acid sequences recognized by five zzso and one E alpha A beta zzso zzso T cell clones were zzso The clones had been raised to a synthetic zzso representing zzso acids zzso of influenza virus zzso It was found that although all of the T cell clones recognized a single zzso region of the zzso zzso different clones could recognize minimal zzso zzso spanning 8, 9, or 10 of these zzso zzso To see whether particular zzso acids within the sequence zzso were universally important for T cell recognition, the six clones were zzso for their ability to tolerate single zzso acid zzso of the 10 zzso zzso In all, 190 zzso of the zzso in which each zzso acid in the sequence was zzso in turn, by each of the other 19 naturally occurring zzso acids were zzso It was shown that 1) the six T cell clones had very different requirements for recognition of the zzso 2) zzso at every single position within the zzso could be shown to affect recognition in a T zzso manner, and 3) every single position within the zzso could be replaced by a large number of zzso acids and still be recognized by at least one T cell zzso These results demonstrate the great diversity exhibited by the T cell repertoire in recognizing a zzso acid zzso as well as the zzso of zzso binding to zzso
