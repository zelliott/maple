We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso DNA using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 665 zzso zzso which shows very high zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of molecular zzso and resides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a putative zzso signal sequence of 30 zzso acids together with the zzso zzso zzso the typical zzso retention zzso at the extreme zzso We have zzso the effect of zzso zzso placing the gene under control of the strong alcohol zzso promoter zzso on the zzso of artificially produced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso overproduction did not lead to any growth defects of the zzso at the zzso level, proliferation of zzso zzso was zzso However, artificially enhanced zzso levels strongly affected zzso zzso and led to zzso of this protein in the zzso zzso This was not simply due to the high zzso zzso because it was also observed under conditions of low zzso induction during growth of cells on zzso zzso zzso Y was properly sorted to its target zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
