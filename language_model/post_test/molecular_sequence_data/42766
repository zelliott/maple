The zzso zzso zzso was tested for its ability to zzso unmodified as well as modified DNA zzso without attempting to zzso the zzso These experiments were conducted to establish whether it may be feasible to employ zzso zzso for control of gene expression in zzso species without zzso or zzso the zzso The zzso was found to bind zzso synthetic zzso that were added to culture zzso zzso of a zzso zzso into zzso regions was determined following cellular zzso The zzso was recovered primarily from the zzso and zzso layer of the zzso however, a significant fraction was recovered from the bacterial zzso The extent of zzso depended on both the concentration of zzso as well as culture medium zzso A maximum of zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved when a zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso was added to bacterial cultures in an artificial seawater zzso zzso zzso Several terminally modified zzso were found to become associated with bacterial cells, albeit less efficiently than the zzso None of the zzso tested was toxic to the bacteria at zzso zzso and the zzso was only marginally toxic at 10 zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso even after 8 zzso of incubation intact zzso zzso could be found in both zzso
