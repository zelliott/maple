In zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity is controlled by the zzso exchange factor zzso We have identified the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as an approximately zzso protein zzso with the zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso coli, zzso can functionally replace zzso and interacts physically with zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso gene that is induced strongly by heat shock and slightly by zzso Alternative zzso generates two zzso that differ only by two zzso in the zzso zzso The larger form is zzso zzso during heat zzso whereas the smaller one dominates at lower zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso associate with zzso zzso in an zzso zzso By zzso native PAGE and pulse zzso zzso zzso were found to assemble rapidly into zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was found to form zzso complexes with zzso of approximately 230 and approximately 120 zzso the latter increasing dramatically after heat zzso
