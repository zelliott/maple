zzso zzso and related compounds zzso several zzso systems by altering hormone zzso enhancing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso a human breast cancer zzso zzso This zzso occurs at the gene expression level and is zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso regulatory region has identified three motifs which resemble zzso response element zzso core zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso identified the zzso motif located at zzso to zzso as being required for zzso zzso A point zzso within this core motif zzso abolished the zzso by zzso while zzso zzso zzso and competitive gel zzso zzso demonstrated zzso complex binding to this zzso Further study of this region also revealed an adjacent putative zzso site, zzso by one base pair from the consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso cell nuclear extracts showed an induced complex binding to the zzso zzso Competition studies and zzso zzso confirmed that the retarded complex consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso specific to the zzso motif greatly diminished the zzso in response to zzso These results suggest that an interaction between zzso complexes and zzso proteins may be responsible for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
