The zzso zzso Group comprises organisms that are widely distributed in the environment and are of health and economic zzso We demonstrate an zzso structure of populations in the zzso zzso Group using zzso molecular data from Fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns, zzso gene zzso partial zzso gene zzso zzso DNA sequence signatures and zzso zzso and descriptive data from range of growth temperature, zzso and zzso zzso Seven major zzso groups (I to zzso were thus identified, with ecological differences that provide evidence for a zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A moderate zzso group zzso was zzso to the zzso group I, from which in turn distinct zzso lineages have emerged, zzso two zzso groups zzso zzso an intermediate group zzso and two zzso groups zzso zzso This zzso evolutionary transition toward zzso was particularly well illustrated by the relative abundance of the zzso zzso signature (as defined by zzso et zzso copies accumulated in strains that varied according to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso signature (as defined by Francis et zzso was specific to group VI and provided a useful way to differentiate it from the zzso group zzso This study illustrates how adaptation to novel environments by the modification of temperature tolerance limits has shaped historical patterns of global ecological diversification in the zzso zzso zzso The implications for the zzso of this Group and for the human health risk are zzso
