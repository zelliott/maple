Control of zzso zzso zzso is a serious problem for agriculture all over the world because of the limited range of zzso that are zzso zzso resistance in zzso zzso has been reported for all major zzso zzso Our previous studies showed that zzso zzso zzso is a major mechanism responsible for zzso resistance in this zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to identify zzso genes that might be involved in zzso resistance, in a laboratory population of zzso zzso Associated sequences were classified as belonging to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction analyses revealed that two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in adults and zzso larvae of the resistant population, when compared with the susceptible population, suggesting their possible involvement in resistance to zzso
