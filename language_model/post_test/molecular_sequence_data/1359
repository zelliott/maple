Drug resistance of zzso is now a problem, but its underlying mechanisms are not fully zzso Cellular zzso of the major zzso drugs is thought to occur through an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso has previously been cloned from zzso zzso zzso and when expressed in zzso it showed very similar zzso specificity to the zzso zzso but could not transport zzso zzso and zzso We have cloned and zzso a similar gene zzso from zzso zzso and found it to have zzso identity to the zzso zzso To zzso the role of the zzso gene on zzso zzso effect, we genetically engineered zzso zzso for conditional zzso of the zzso gene by zzso interference zzso zzso of the zzso resulted in zzso depletion of zzso zzso with zzso significant resistance to zzso zzso zzso The induced zzso zzso normally and attained peak cell density at an in zzso concentration of zzso zzso higher than the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso activity of zzso and zzso but zzso some resistance to zzso Our findings validate the significance of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso Further, we show for the first time that zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso can be induced using plasmids designed for zzso zzso We also demonstrate the usefulness of real-time zzso in rapidly zzso zzso levels in zzso
