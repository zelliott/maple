zzso zzso viruses zzso from Europe and America were compared by zzso analysis of 43 zzso obtained over four zzso An additional 22 virus sequences were retrieved from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso genes were amplified by zzso prior to sequencing and construction of zzso zzso The trees revealed many distinctive zzso consistent with prolonged diversification within geographically separated host zzso Two large groups and five zzso were zzso Group I consisted mainly of viruses from North America, whilst group II consisted mainly of European zzso In most instances, where the geographic origin of the viruses appeared to be at zzso with the zzso predicted zzso the horses from which the viruses were recovered had been transported between Europe and America or vice zzso Analysis of the zzso gene revealed similar zzso relationships although not all of the groups were as clearly zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso represented separate zzso based on analysis of both zzso zzso The results of this study confirm the value of the zzso gene of zzso for zzso virus genetic diversity and as a useful tool for tracing routes by which zzso is zzso In addition, zzso predictions of zzso sites on the zzso protein revealed considerable zzso among the zzso especially with respect to regions associated with zzso zzso
