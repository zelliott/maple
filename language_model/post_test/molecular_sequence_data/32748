The human zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, we have identified an identical point zzso in two human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that changes zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was not identified in a similarly sized cohort of healthy zzso In the zzso zzso lymphoma, the zzso in zzso is of zzso zzso In both tumors, the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso shows enhanced in zzso transforming activity in chicken zzso zzso zzso has a reduced ability to activate the human zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso however, the zzso protein shows increased expression in zzso chicken zzso cells as compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso is a site for zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso reduces zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso by a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso chicken zzso cells are more resistant to zzso cell death than cells transformed by zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso contributes to the development of human zzso zzso by affecting an zzso zzso activity of zzso
