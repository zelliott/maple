Although dogs have been proposed as carriers of zzso zzso zzso coli zzso with infectious potential for humans, presumed host zzso differences between canine and human zzso strains have cast doubt on this zzso The recent discovery that zzso III of zzso (the P zzso zzso zzso zzso among human zzso zzso and zzso an adherence zzso resembling that of canine zzso prompted the present zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Sixteen paired zzso urine and zzso zzso coli zzso from dogs with urinary tract infection were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso type, zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and randomly amplified zzso DNA and zzso gel zzso fingerprints were analyzed and compared with those of human zzso zzso The 16 canine strains contained predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strictly according to zzso zzso status and were homogeneous among strains with the same zzso zzso profile irrespective of their human versus canine zzso zzso and human zzso zzso III zzso sequences were highly zzso without host zzso zzso The most prevalent canine zzso zzso was zzso a novel zzso recently identified among human zzso zzso In addition to zzso human zzso zzso genes detected among the canine strains included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a marker for a zzso island from zzso human zzso strain zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso origin of all but one canine urine isolate and showed one pair of zzso canine urine and zzso zzso to be extremely similar to an zzso human zzso isolate with which they shared all other zzso and zzso characteristics zzso These data demonstrate that canine zzso strains are similar to, and in some instances essentially indistinguishable from, human zzso zzso which implicates dogs and their feces as potential reservoirs of zzso coli with infectious potential for zzso
