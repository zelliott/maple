The zzso zzso 6 zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso containing six zzso zzso zinc zzso The zinc finger zzso cluster is necessary and sufficient for interaction with both DNA and several proteins and for nuclear zzso However, the functional specificity of the six zzso in these cellular roles is zzso To characterize this domain, we zzso individually each zzso of zzso Our results reveal that zzso of the two zzso zzso does not impair zzso zzso cellular zzso of the protein nor the zzso repression capacity of zzso By contrast, zzso of any of the remaining zzso zzso the binding of zzso to DNA in zzso and the zzso function of the protein in zzso Finally, none of the six zzso affect the interaction between zzso and class II zzso zzso Thus our experiments demonstrate that zzso uses each of the four zzso zzso for binding to a target sequence while the two zzso terminal fingers are likely engaged in other unknown zzso
