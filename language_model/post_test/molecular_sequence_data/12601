The zzso coli DEAD zzso box protein zzso is a putative zzso zzso and established zzso zzso and is the only member of the DEAD box protein family for which a specific zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso has been zzso We have investigated the nature of this specificity in depth and have localized by deletion zzso and zzso a single region of 93 bases zzso zzso in zzso zzso that is both necessary and sufficient for complete zzso of zzso activity of zzso This target region forms part of the zzso center and includes many bases involved in interaction with the 3' terminal zzso of both A- and zzso zzso zzso of stem zzso within the zzso segment abolished zzso zzso Similarly, point zzso that disrupt base pairing within stem structures zzso stimulation of zzso zzso These data are consistent with roles for zzso either in establishing and/or maintaining the correct three-dimensional structure of the zzso center in zzso zzso during zzso assembly or in the zzso zzso
