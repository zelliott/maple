During plant zzso the central cell of the female zzso becomes zzso to produce the zzso a storage tissue that zzso the developing zzso within the zzso The molecular mechanisms controlling the zzso and differentiation of the central cell are poorly zzso We identified a female zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that is affected in central cell zzso In zzso female zzso the central cell's zzso and zzso fail to mature zzso In addition, zzso development is not initiated after zzso of zzso female zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso box family of genes that likely zzso zzso zzso An zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the zzso Within the zzso and seed, zzso is expressed exclusively in the central cell and zzso zzso zzso expression is also detected in roots, leaves, floral zzso zzso and young flowers by real-time zzso zzso is required for the expression of two central zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not for a third central zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso functions as a zzso factor within the central cell gene regulatory network and controls the expression of downstream genes required for central cell development and zzso
