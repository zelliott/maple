The zzso zzso of zzso coli comprises several genes which are required for the synthesis of all three zzso zzso zzso were introduced into each of the zzso zzso transferred to the zzso and the resulting zzso were zzso for zzso 1, 2 and 3 zzso The products of three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be essential for the synthesis of all three zzso zzso A zzso in zzso as previously observed, could be zzso by high zzso zzso in the zzso whereas the effects of zzso in the other genes could zzso zzso in zzso prevented development of zzso 3 activity, did not influence the level of zzso 1 but led to a considerable increase in zzso 2 activity although the amount of zzso 2 protein was not drastically zzso zzso in zzso on the other hand, led to a reduction of zzso 1 activity and abolished zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso besides being required for zzso 3 formation, therefore may have a function in modulating the activities of the three zzso with respect to each other and adjusting their levels to the requirement imposed by the zzso zzso zzso in all five zzso genes prevented the apparent processing of the large zzso of all three zzso zzso It is concluded that the products of the zzso genes play a role in zzso incorporation into zzso zzso and/or processing of the constituent zzso of this zzso The importance of their roles is also reflected in their zzso conservation in zzso related zzso
