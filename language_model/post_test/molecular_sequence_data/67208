High efficiency zzso liquid zzso mass zzso zzso was used to examine the proteins extracted from zzso zzso cells across six treatment zzso While our previous study provided a zzso overview of the cellular metabolism based on proteins with known functions zzso Zhang, zzso zzso zzso Moore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Camp II, zzso Smith, zzso zzso A zzso view of the metabolism in zzso zzso determined by liquid zzso coupled with tandem mass zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso this study describes the global detection and functional zzso for hypothetical zzso zzso zzso Using criteria that a given zzso of a protein is identified from at least two out of three independent zzso zzso and that for any protein at least two different peptides are identified among the three zzso 129 open reading frames zzso originally zzso as hypothetical proteins were found to zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso for the zzso hypothetical proteins was performed by a combination of several zzso based zzso zzso context analysis, zzso zzso and analysis of a combination of experimental information, including zzso detection in cells grown under specific culture conditions and cellular location of the zzso Using this approach we were able to assign possible functions to 20 zzso hypothetical zzso This study demonstrated that a combination of zzso and zzso zzso can provide zzso of the expression of hypothetical proteins and improve zzso zzso
