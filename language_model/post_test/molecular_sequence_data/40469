This study reports the zzso zzso and genetic resistance zzso of 39 zzso zzso strains isolated from the zzso of zzso infants as well as one reference zzso zzso showed that all the strains were susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Resistance was observed to zzso zzso zzso G, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Investigation of the genetic basis of the observed resistance zzso showed that resistance to zzso was due to zzso activity and that resistance to zzso involved zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance may involve another genetic zzso different from those commonly described for zzso
