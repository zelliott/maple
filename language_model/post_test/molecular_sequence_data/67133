We describe zzso linear zzso detected by zzso in the zzso and all of the structural proteins of a US zzso strain, using zzso of 15 zzso infected zzso The zzso was found to contain the highest frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to structural zzso Ten of these 18 zzso peptides were zzso with 80 to zzso of the examined zzso In the structural zzso zzso consistently recognized by immune zzso were located at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso 2) and N zzso zzso zzso Overall, the highest degree of zzso and conservation was exhibited by two zzso identified in the zzso end of the M protein zzso The zzso recognizing the zzso zzso of each protein were detected as early as days 7 to 15 zzso and remained zzso until the end of the experiment zzso 90 zzso These findings have direct implications for zzso differential zzso and eventual zzso as the identified zzso may represent zzso marker candidates for differential zzso zzso vaccines, derived from infectious zzso zzso
