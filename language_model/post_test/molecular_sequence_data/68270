The three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso in complex with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined by X-ray zzso in crystal forms different from those described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso 1991, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In both complexes, the interactions of the zzso zzso segments of the zzso binding to the zzso zzso of zzso are clearly established, including zzso zzso which are zzso in the earlier crystal zzso The interactions of the zzso group of zzso in the zzso complex structure explain why natural zzso zzso binds with a zzso lower zzso than the zzso zzso zzso In this new crystal form, the zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in the earlier crystal form, is ordered due to crystal zzso zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are not influenced by crystal contacts in this new crystal form, in contrast to the earlier zzso In the zzso zzso complex, the zzso bond between zzso zzso seems to be zzso
