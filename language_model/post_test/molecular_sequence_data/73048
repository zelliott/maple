Nerve growth factor zzso and zzso zzso mediate activities such as survival, zzso and proliferation in various zzso of zzso In this report, we define precisely the zzso in human zzso responsible for zzso biological activity and binding specificity to the zzso zzso zzso In earlier studies we defined five zzso acid zzso of zzso which zzso zzso activity to zzso when replacing corresponding zzso in the zzso acid long zzso zzso Using this zzso strategy we report the further dissection of this functional zzso We also define another motif separated zzso in the zzso zzso and determined to be independently responsible for zzso zzso The first of the two motifs determined to elicit zzso specificity is defined by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are situated in the two top zzso of zzso The second motif is represented by zzso zzso and zzso situated in the zzso part of the zzso zzso Both motifs contain structurally important zzso revealing a novel principle, where specificity for zzso zzso interactions could be determined by variable zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso These findings will enhance further the possibility of mimicking zzso with low molecular weight zzso
