A new class of zzso deficient in nitrate zzso was obtained from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso by means of random zzso zzso A zzso zzso region had been replaced by a zzso resistance gene cassette in the zzso resulting in zzso of two zzso one of which was zzso to the recently characterized zzso gene of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Flores, zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not affect expression of the nitrate zzso zzso or the activity of the nitrate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the other zzso designated zzso resulted in specific loss of the cellular nitrate zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein is a zzso protein consisting of 161 zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso at a low zzso The zzso gene has its zzso only in the zzso strains that are capable of nitrate zzso In most of the zzso zzso zzso is located downstream of zzso the structural gene of the zzso nitrate zzso suggesting the functional link between the two zzso zzso is clearly not the structural component of the zzso nitrate zzso The zzso zzso zzso normally expressed zzso indicating that zzso is not the zzso regulator of the structural gene of nitrate zzso These results suggested that zzso is required for either synthesis of the prosthetic group of nitrate zzso or assembly of the prosthetic groups to the zzso zzso to form functional nitrate zzso in zzso
