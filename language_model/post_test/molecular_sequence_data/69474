In addition to its synthesis in the developing zzso human zzso or the isolated zzso and zzso are zzso by a wide variety of both zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso zzso unique biological activity on the hormone and is zzso by a family of six genes or zzso linked physically with beta zzso at one locus on zzso zzso Previous work has demonstrated that members of the beta zzso family are not expressed to the same extent in zzso zzso The factors allowing differential expression of the six nearly identical genes are zzso It is also zzso which of the multiple beta zzso genes are actively expressed in the tumor cell lines that produce zzso zzso One potential mechanism for control of beta zzso gene expression is DNA zzso A unique method of two-dimensional DNA zzso was used to analyze the zzso status of each of the individual beta zzso genes in zzso and in tumor cell lines that either do or do not express the zzso The DNA from each source exhibited unique, zzso zzso patterns over the six beta zzso zzso Particularly interesting were the observations that: 1) despite their nearly identical sequences and close zzso zzso the six beta zzso genes are distinguished from one another within the same and different cell types by their extent and pattern of zzso 2) the beta zzso locus is significantly zzso in zzso a state maintained in zzso cells zzso 3) the beta zzso gene cluster is zzso at a limited set of sites in DNA from both zzso (a transformed zzso cell line that does not produce zzso and zzso (a zzso cell line that produces zzso zzso suggesting that general zzso of the domain does not accompany zzso of the locus in zzso but rather that zzso changes may be responsible, at least in part, for inappropriate beta zzso zzso and 4) the ratio of beta zzso gene 3 transcripts to beta zzso gene 5 transcripts is at least zzso higher in zzso cells than in zzso cells, suggesting that the reduced zzso in zzso cells of gene 3 compared to gene 5 may be a factor contributing to the activity of these zzso
