zzso of the zzso libraries of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso activity led to the isolation of two positive zzso The results of zzso and sequence analyses identified two zzso zzso and zzso zzso two different zzso and genetic zzso in the zzso locus was revealed from zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso of 248 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and the zzso gene encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso Both zzso were zzso to near zzso from zzso strains of zzso zzso The results of zzso characterization showed that while both zzso possess optimal activities with short chain zzso zzso zzso has a broader pH tolerance zzso zzso and optimal temperature range zzso degrees zzso than zzso The zzso energy of zzso zzso zzso was found to be significantly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were stable at 60 degrees C for more than 2 zzso at 70 degrees C, the zzso for zzso zzso was 40 and 180 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso With zzso zzso as the zzso and zzso at 60 degrees C, zzso had zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso exhibited values of zzso zzso and 38 zzso zzso studies indicated that both zzso and zzso were strongly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso consistent with the proposed presence of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso and zzso reported here warrant the potential applications of these zzso in zzso zzso
