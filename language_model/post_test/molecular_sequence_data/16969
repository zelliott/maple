In rat zzso two alternatively spliced transcripts are generated from the V2 zzso zzso zzso The large transcript zzso zzso encodes the zzso V2 zzso whereas the small transcript encodes a zzso zzso displaying a distinct sequence corresponding to the putative seventh zzso domain and the zzso C zzso of the V2 zzso This work showed that the small spliced transcript is translated in the rat kidney collecting zzso However, the protein zzso by the small transcript (here called the zzso zzso zzso is retained inside the cell, in contrast to the preferential surface distribution of the V2 zzso (here called the zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso do not exhibit binding to zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the surface expression of the zzso zzso most likely via the formation of zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer experiments between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso would then be acting as a dominant zzso The effect of the zzso zzso zzso is specific, as it does not affect the surface expression of the G zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the sequence encompassing zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso also zzso the surface expression of the zzso zzso We suggest that some forms of zzso diabetes zzso are due to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which could retain the zzso zzso zzso inside the cell via the formation of zzso zzso
