Upon entry into the host, zzso zzso strains are presumed to encounter an zzso zzso zzso these bacteria have evolved a variety of zzso zzso acquisition systems to obtain iron in this restricted zzso We have identified an iron transport system that is zzso within the zzso 63 zzso island of zzso zzso The zzso composition of this locus is significantly different from that of the rest of this zzso island, suggesting a different ancestry and a mosaic structure for this region of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso designated sit, consists of four open reading frames which zzso zzso with extensive zzso to the zzso ABC iron transport system of zzso zzso as well as other ABC zzso The zzso gene encodes a putative zzso binding zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso two putative zzso zzso membrane zzso This zzso is capable of zzso the growth zzso of the zzso zzso coli strain zzso in zzso minimal zzso zzso of the sit zzso is zzso under zzso growth conditions in a zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso deletion into zzso zzso zzso resulted in no apparent growth zzso in either zzso or minimal medium and no measurable zzso zzso These results further support the existence of redundant iron zzso systems in zzso zzso
