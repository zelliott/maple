The inner zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso or its zzso zzso zzso in zzso large enhancements of the activities of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso or zzso requires the zzso prosthetic group and specificity zzso that distinguish zzso from the other zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso structure contributing to binding was mapped by comparing the capacities of well folded zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to interfere with zzso zzso by competitively binding to zzso or zzso Our results reveal the critical importance of a regional set of zzso near the zzso group and of the zzso but not the zzso ring structure of the zzso zzso At the other end of the zzso domain, substitution of zzso by zzso or zzso removed zzso binding to zzso or zzso and these zzso for the neighboring zzso also greatly hindered complex formation zzso zzso zzso Among 11 zzso in zzso at sites of major surface zzso differences between the zzso and zzso zzso only the conversion of zzso located between the critical zzso and zzso to the aligned zzso sequence of the zzso domain greatly reduced zzso zzso Certain modified zzso altered zzso zzso of zzso differently than zzso supporting significant impact of the regulatory zzso zzso on zzso binding to zzso Our results indicate zzso binding via the extended zzso structure of the zzso group and required adjacent zzso structure anchor zzso by acting in concert with an zzso cluster at the other end of the zzso
