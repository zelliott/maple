zzso regions of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for zzso synthesis in this zzso exhibit sequences that are similar to the sequences recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein is a sensor of iron availability and zzso zzso In the presence of zzso a zzso of zzso binds the zzso in their target zzso zzso their zzso When iron is absent the expression of those gene products is zzso Here, we show that zzso from zzso zzso binds in zzso promoter regions of several zzso zzso which suggests that zzso might zzso among other factors, zzso zzso The binding affinity is increased by the presence of metal and zzso suggesting a response to iron availability and zzso status of the zzso
