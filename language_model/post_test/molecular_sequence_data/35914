Northern zzso analysis of rat zzso from cell lines and isolated zzso with a specific rat zzso probe detected two zzso zzso I zzso species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The ratio between these two species varies between zzso and zzso in different rat zzso Using zzso derived from highly zzso regions in the rat and zzso coli zzso sequences a human zzso zzso I probe was obtained by means of reverse zzso and zzso zzso chain zzso The human zzso product consisting of 555 zzso was cloned and zzso It shows a zzso identity with the published sequence of the rat zzso The analysis of various human cell lines with this specific probe shows only one species of zzso zzso I zzso with an approximate size of zzso zzso
