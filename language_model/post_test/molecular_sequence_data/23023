In this paper, we present a review of zzso nuclear basic proteins zzso in zzso zzso The distribution of the three basic groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso their evolution and possible relation to the mode of zzso are zzso In this regard, we have characterized the zzso from two closely related species of zzso zzso internally zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both in the family zzso Despite the different zzso behavior of these two closely related zzso species, in both instances the zzso consists of zzso However, there is a significant increase in the zzso content of the zzso in the internally zzso zzso The relevance of this observation is discussed within the context of the zzso zzso in zzso The rapid evolution of zzso zzso including those in zzso has also allowed us to obtain a molecular zzso for this group of zzso fish that is almost indistinguishable from that currently available from the use of conventional zzso zzso
