A simple primer extension method for detecting zzso differences is based on the substitution of zzso zzso for natural zzso zzso This technique can detect any zzso difference that might occur including previously unknown zzso or zzso Two technical limitations of the original procedure have now been zzso First, switching to zzso zzso DNA zzso has eliminated zzso believed to be due to the addition of an zzso zzso base to the 3' end of DNA by zzso DNA zzso Second, with the zzso used in the original study, the mobility shift induced by a single base change can usually be resolved only in DNA segments 200 zzso or zzso This size limitation has been overcome by zzso zzso zzso with extraordinarily long zzso arms zzso atom zzso Using these new zzso and conventional sequencing gels zzso zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso alpha and zzso genes have been detected in DNA segments up to 300 zzso in zzso By using very thin zzso zzso gels, zzso zzso in the human zzso gene have been detected in zzso zzso
