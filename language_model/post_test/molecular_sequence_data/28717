A canine distemper virus zzso zzso zzso clone and expression plasmids required to establish a zzso rescue system were generated from a zzso strain of the zzso vaccine zzso In addition, a zzso zzso was prepared and used in transient expression studies performed to identify optimal virus rescue zzso zzso from the transient expression experiments indicated that zzso reporter gene activity was increased when zzso cell cultures were maintained at 32 rather than 37 degrees C, and when the cellular stress response was induced by heat zzso zzso these findings to rescue of zzso zzso zzso resulted in efficient recovery of virus after zzso zzso or zzso cells were zzso with zzso cell zzso zzso sequence determination and analysis of restriction site zzso confirmed that rescued virus was zzso A zzso strain also was engineered that contained the zzso gene inserted between the P and M zzso this virus directed high levels of zzso expression in infected zzso
