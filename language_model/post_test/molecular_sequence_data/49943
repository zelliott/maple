De zzso zzso zzso is localized to both zzso and zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but several of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso are zzso by single zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso protein in both zzso zzso active zzso was zzso separately from zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing showed that these two zzso matched the zzso zzso sequence but were processed at different sites following zzso the zzso zzso was five zzso acids longer than the zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso of a zzso digest of zzso zzso identified two internal peptides identical with the zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso zzso Western blots of proteins from zzso and zzso isolated from root tips showed a single zzso protein present at low levels in both zzso zzso protein translated from a zzso zzso was imported into isolated pea zzso zzso leaf zzso in zzso by an zzso process but not into zzso zzso from several plant and zzso zzso zzso of the mature protein are likely to be important for import because the zzso targeting sequence was unable to target green fluorescent protein to either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso The data confirm zzso of the protein translated from the zzso gene in zzso to both zzso and zzso and that it is zzso to both zzso but the mechanism underlying import into zzso has features that are yet to be zzso
