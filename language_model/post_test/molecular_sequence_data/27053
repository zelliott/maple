The zzso zzso zzso zzso is modulated by numerous zzso that are released locally in the zzso or that reach the zzso as zzso Using zzso zzso as a reductive screening zzso for zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso profiling of zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso analysis, we identified and zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso of the zzso Cancer zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso was discovered using the expressed sequence tag zzso database search strategy in both zzso borealis and the zzso zzso zzso and further confirmed with de zzso sequencing using zzso tandem zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that both zzso and zzso inhibited the frequency of the zzso rhythm of the zzso in a zzso zzso At zzso both peptides were only modestly effective when initial zzso of the zzso rhythm were zzso but almost completely suppressed the zzso rhythm when applied to preparations with starting zzso zzso Surprisingly, these zzso actions are similar to those of the structurally unrelated zzso A and zzso B families of zzso
