The mechanisms behind zzso reaction to nervous system zzso in zzso are not zzso We assessed the zzso of zzso from 50 zzso patients and 50 healthy controls to specific peptides from zzso and the zzso A significant percentage of zzso patients showed zzso in zzso against zzso and zzso peptides zzso For examining zzso between dietary proteins and zzso zzso zzso were prepared in zzso and binding of rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso was zzso In comparison to zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso at zzso the reaction of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso whereas the binding of zzso basic protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso was less than zzso Further examination of rabbit zzso zzso and zzso zzso 8 zzso acid zzso peptides with human serum zzso zzso and an unrelated zzso showed no zzso but the reaction of these zzso with both the zzso and zzso peptides was greater than zzso This zzso was further confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that a zzso of patients with zzso produce zzso against zzso cells and zzso zzso which may be responsible for some of the neurological symptoms in zzso
