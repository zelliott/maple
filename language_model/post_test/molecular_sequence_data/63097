zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in primary zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Two different types of zzso clones of zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which displayed an zzso zzso between them, were isolated using zzso library zzso zzso library zzso and zzso zzso Southern analysis employing specific zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso and zzso indicated the existence of a single copy of each gene in the bean zzso Both these proteins contain approximately 100 zzso acid sequences theoretically addressing each zzso to different zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso expression is higher than zzso during zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso also revealed that both of these genes are zzso regulated by zzso On the other hand, the expression of zzso but not zzso was inhibited with nitrogen zzso In zzso zzso and promoter expression analyses demonstrated that the zzso and zzso genes are zzso expressed in bean root and zzso zzso In zzso analyses of the zzso promoters revealed the presence of potential zzso elements in them that could mediate differential zzso and sugar and zzso acid responsive expression of these zzso
