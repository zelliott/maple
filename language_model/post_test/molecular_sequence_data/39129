We have identified a new human zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene was mapped to the zzso arm of zzso and was found to be essential for normal zzso zzso We used zzso and FISH analyses to search for genetic zzso of zzso in primary zzso A more precise zzso of zzso was completed using 6 known markers on zzso and a newly isolated zzso marker within the zzso zzso We also determined the zzso organization of the zzso gene using human zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that 14 of 26 zzso primary zzso had zzso imbalance in at least 1 of the 7 zzso zzso However, FISH analysis with a zzso probe showed that a majority of zzso had an increased copy number of the locus regardless of zzso zzso Thus, overrepresentation of the zzso locus may play an important role in the development of zzso
