zzso associations between animals and microbes are ubiquitous in nature, with an estimated zzso of all insect species harboring zzso bacterial zzso Most bacterial zzso share many zzso features including small zzso zzso composition bias, high coding density, and a paucity of mobile DNA, consistent with long-term host zzso In this study, we focus on the early stages of zzso zzso in a recently derived zzso zzso zzso zzso We present the complete zzso sequence and zzso of zzso zzso primary zzso zzso We also present the finished zzso sequence and zzso of strain zzso a close zzso relative of zzso and other insect zzso of the zzso zzso whose gene inventory is expected to closely resemble the putative zzso of this zzso zzso functional, and evolutionary analyses indicate that zzso has undergone extensive adaptation toward an zzso lifestyle in a very short time zzso The zzso of zzso is large in size when compared with many ancient bacterial zzso however, almost half of the zzso genes in zzso are zzso There is also evidence for relaxed selection on the remaining intact zzso zzso Comparative analyses of the zzso sequence of strain HS and zzso highlight numerous zzso zzso zzso and deletions facilitated by a recent expansion of insertions sequence zzso some of which appear to have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predictions suggest that zzso has lost the ability to zzso several essential zzso acids and zzso zzso of the bacterial cell envelope and genes zzso zzso systems suggest that these structures and elements have become simplified in the transition to a zzso zzso
