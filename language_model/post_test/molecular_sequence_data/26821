The zzso zzso is a novel zzso that zzso zzso screening of peptides with a small quantity of zzso 

We sought to use overlapping peptides of milk zzso proteins as a model system to establish a reliable and sensitive zzso zzso zzso for large-scale zzso mapping of food zzso 

A milk zzso zzso was developed by using commercially zzso peptides zzso 3 zzso covering the primary sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for printing and zzso were zzso using a serum pool of 5 patients with milk zzso zzso of the milk zzso zzso was evaluated using replicate zzso zzso with the serum pool, whereas specificity and sensitivity were assessed by using serial dilution of the serum pool and a zzso zzso zzso 

Our results show that zzso identified by the zzso zzso were mostly consistent with those identified previously by zzso membrane technology, but with specific binding to a few newly identified zzso of milk zzso Data from replicate zzso were zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso regardless of printing lots, zzso and serum pool zzso Using the serially diluted serum pool, we confirmed that zzso zzso binding detected in the array was zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding to the same zzso and overlapping peptides further confirmed the specificity of the zzso 

A reliable zzso zzso was established for large-scale zzso zzso mapping of milk zzso and this robust technology could be applied for zzso mapping of other food zzso
