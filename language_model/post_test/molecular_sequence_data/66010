zzso zzso of all zzso bonds in the zzso zzso zzso has been performed yielding 30 different zzso zzso of which only seven displayed a single zzso on the zzso time zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso peptides was recently reported by us zzso zzso zzso zzso 2006, zzso 15 zzso zzso Here we present the zzso characterization of nine additional zzso peptides from the previous library which are not homogeneous but exist as a mixture in which at least one zzso is preferred by over 80 zzso The structures of these peptides are investigated employing various zzso techniques, distance geometry calculations and further refined by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit zzso The comparison of the zzso of these nine peptides and the seven zzso homogeneous peptides allow us to draw conclusions regarding the influence of zzso on the zzso backbone of zzso zzso of the class zzso Here we present the different zzso classes of the peptides arising from the definitive pattern of zzso which can eventually serve as templates for the design of zzso zzso
