The human zzso zzso recognizes a zzso zzso on zzso and is one of the rare zzso zzso that neutralize a broad range of primary human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso We previously reported the isolation of zzso a zzso zzso that binds with high specificity to zzso and competes with zzso for zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that the affinity of zzso was improved zzso over its zzso counterpart by fusing it to the N zzso of a soluble zzso This zzso which is within an order of magnitude of that of zzso probably more closely reflects the affinity of the zzso zzso The crystal structure of a complex between zzso of zzso and zzso was determined at zzso A zzso The structural data allowed the differentiation of zzso that form critical contacts with zzso from those required for maintenance of the zzso structure of the zzso and revealed that three zzso zzso mediate zzso critical contacts with zzso This single region of critical contact between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is unlikely to mimic the zzso key binding zzso involved in the full zzso zzso for zzso as previously identified by zzso scanning zzso on the zzso zzso These structural observations are supported by experiments that demonstrate that zzso is an ineffective zzso mimic of the zzso zzso on zzso Indeed, an extensive series of zzso with zzso in various forms failed to produce zzso zzso zzso The functional and structural data presented here, however, suggest that the mechanism by which zzso recognizes the two zzso is very zzso Here, we present the first crystal structure of zzso bound to an zzso that was originally raised against a zzso protein zzso Our results highlight the challenge of producing zzso that mimic zzso protein zzso and the necessity of combining complementary experimental approaches in analyzing the zzso and zzso properties of putative molecular zzso
