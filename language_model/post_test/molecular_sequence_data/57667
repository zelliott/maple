The paradox that zzso zzso zzso zzso exist in the majority of human zzso virus type 1 zzso patients, whereas the zzso response against zzso zzso virus zzso is highly zzso motivated us to study the zzso and zzso zzso responses generated upon presentation of escape virus, and the viral zzso involved in the zzso Patients with zzso escape virus all developed zzso zzso which were zzso after a delay and disappeared prior to disease zzso The zzso tested inhibited the binding of zzso soluble zzso to zzso zzso but zzso virus zzso required binding of zzso to zzso prior to viral attachment to target zzso zzso escape virus zzso were tested for sensitivity to zzso by zzso zzso Only minor differences were demonstrated, suggesting that the majority of the change in zzso sensitivity is driven by the selective pressure of zzso zzso Furthermore, no differences were observed in sensitivity to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso A, indicating a zzso nature of certain zzso zzso zzso during zzso Finally the zzso sequence of three sets of consecutive virus zzso were zzso revealing zzso acid zzso in zzso sequences of all escape virus zzso The biological significance of these variations was confirmed further by the demonstration of changes in sensitivity to zzso by zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest a participation of the zzso response against the zzso loop in the zzso of escape zzso
