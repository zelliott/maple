A zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso using a zzso zzso The inclusion of zzso in the zzso reaction has been demonstrated to be essential for the correct amplification of zzso zzso templates with complex secondary structures caused by a high G + C zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence exhibited highest similarity with plant zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso was structurally more similar to higher plant zzso than to the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso extension present in zzso showed several characteristics of an zzso transit zzso with a length typical for zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that the zzso zzso zzso may contain a single copy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was strongly induced by zzso conditions (up to zzso the level observed in a zzso cell zzso and required the presence of a nitrogen zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a different pattern of regulation of zzso to that observed at the activity zzso To obtain an increase of transcript abundance a longer period of sulfur limitation was required, reaching a maximum level of approximately zzso zzso zzso when compared with the level of a zzso zzso
