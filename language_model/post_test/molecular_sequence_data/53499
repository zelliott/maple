In this study we present the complete zzso structure of the bovine zzso gene and its assignment to the long arm of the zzso zzso We determined a total of zzso zzso of the bovine zzso gene and compared it to the human zzso A very high similarity was detected between the zzso regions, interrupted primarily by several zzso zzso A deletion of 13 zzso in the vicinity to the translation start signal in the promoter of the bovine zzso gene was zzso zzso studies of the 3' region showed the use of several zzso zzso Three main transcripts were detected in adult cattle in the range of zzso zzso and 1600 zzso using Northern zzso zzso An additional shorter transcript was detected in the zzso of zzso
