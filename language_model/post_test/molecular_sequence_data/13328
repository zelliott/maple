The expression of the human zzso zinc finger gene zzso by human bone zzso cells is necessary for zzso We have analyzed the structure and function of the zzso gene by diagnostic zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso and promoter zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cell zzso with isolated zzso zzso clones indicated that the human zzso gene is without zzso and spans approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso mapping and Southern analysis indicated further that the human zzso gene is a zzso zzso zzso extension studies identified the major zzso start site as a zzso zzso located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso translation start zzso A putative zzso box sequence zzso was found at zzso zzso and a zzso box at zzso zzso relative to the zzso initiation zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso levels are increased by zzso zzso including zzso acid and zzso DNA upstream of the zzso start site contains zzso consensus zzso acid response elements at zzso through zzso zzso and paired putative zzso sequences centered at zzso and zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso containing these DNA regions promoted zzso and zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso acid and zzso when zzso into zzso zzso Additional putative regulatory binding sites included zzso zzso zinc finger binding zzso the importance of which was suggested by the enhanced expression of the zzso zzso gene following zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso leukemia zzso These findings provide a clearer basis for understanding the role of zzso gene expression in zzso cell growth and zzso
