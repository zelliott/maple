In this study, a novel single universal primer multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso technique that uses only one universal primer to perform multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso was zzso Two zzso complementary common sequences were designed on the zzso or 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso which allowed the zzso products to be amplified through only a single universal primer zzso zzso products were analyzed on sequencing gel zzso with extraordinary zzso This method avoided the high expenses associated with zzso zzso which was the commonly used detection zzso In comparison with conventional multiplex zzso which suffers from low sensitivity, zzso and amplification disparity, zzso had higher specificity and sensitivity and a low detection limit of zzso zzso for detecting single crop species when screening the presence of genetically modified zzso We also studied the effect of different lengths of zzso sequences on the zzso for the first zzso Through comparing the results of quantitative zzso the zzso with different zzso sequences did not affect the zzso efficiency, which further increased the zzso of this zzso The improved zzso and sequencing gel zzso method will be useful for food and animal feed zzso bacterial zzso and zzso of genetic modification status of zzso
