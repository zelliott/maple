The zzso channel is widely expressed in many cell types, where it fulfills a general zzso function as an zzso gate for zzso zzso zzso zzso the molecular identity of this channel is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of regulated zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso located in the plasma membrane has long been considered as the zzso underlying the zzso channel activity, based upon similarities in the zzso properties of these two channels and the zzso presence of zzso protein in the plasma zzso We have deleted each of the three genes zzso the zzso zzso individually and collectively and demonstrate that zzso channel zzso 400 zzso activity in zzso mouse zzso is zzso The channel activity is similar in zzso cells and in zzso cells with the zzso protein depleted by zzso zzso zzso deletion slightly zzso but never zzso the zzso zzso zzso The lack of correlation between zzso protein expression and zzso channel activity strongly argues against the long held hypothesis of zzso zzso being the zzso zzso
