Through a single genetic transformation in onion zzso zzso a crop recalcitrant to genetic zzso we suppressed the zzso factor zzso gene using zzso interference zzso in six zzso This reduced zzso zzso activity by up to zzso so that when wounded the onions produced significantly reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso We then confirmed, through a novel zzso zzso that this zzso had shifted the zzso zzso breakdown zzso so that more zzso zzso acid was converted into zzso zzso A consequence of this raised zzso level was a marked increase in the downstream production of a zzso produced zzso zzso and other volatile sulfur compounds, zzso zzso and zzso which had previously been reported in trace amounts or had not been detected in zzso The consequences of this dramatic simultaneous zzso and zzso of secondary sulfur products on the health and flavor attributes of the onion are zzso
