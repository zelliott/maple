We have adapted a zzso promoter trap screen developed by Burns et zzso zzso to search for genes whose expression is dependent on zzso a protein with an zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso acts upstream of the basic zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso All three proteins are known to be required for the expression of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso whose expression is also dependent on the functional state of zzso Using this screen, we have identified a previously zzso zzso zzso predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids that shares zzso zzso and zzso sequence identity with zzso interacting protein 2, zzso by the zzso zzso both proteins also share sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is dependent on the functional state of zzso and on all three of the zzso zzso whereas zzso expression is independent of the zzso proteins and the functional state of zzso Like zzso the zzso zzso region of zzso contains two R box binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both R boxes are necessary for full zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso activity, the former located in the zzso and the latter in the zzso zzso Our data thus provide gene assignments for two previously zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso
