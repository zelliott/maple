A comprehensive set of hybrid molecules of zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli has been constructed of zzso and zzso altered zzso zzso The zzso zzso that were virtually devoid of activity contained a replacement of zzso in the zzso zzso chains by either zzso or zzso The kinetic properties of these hybrid zzso molecules were analyzed to evaluate the basis for the unusual zzso constraint demonstrated by an zzso hybrid containing one zzso zzso zzso one inactive zzso zzso zzso the zzso to zzso zzso and three zzso regulatory zzso A similar zzso hybrid was constructed from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso in which zzso was replaced by zzso and it too demonstrated a pronounced decrease in activity relative to that expected for a hybrid containing three active zzso Moreover, neither of these hybrid zzso exhibited the zzso with respect to zzso that is characteristic of zzso zzso In contrast, hybrid zzso containing at least one zzso chain in each zzso zzso showed zzso Also, hybrid zzso containing different arrangements of five, four, three, or two zzso zzso chains with an appropriate complement of zzso chains had specific activities zzso to the number of zzso chains in the zzso zzso were observed only in hybrids in which one of the two zzso in the zzso was composed completely of zzso zzso zzso For these hybrids the negative zzso was zzso as a much lower zzso activity than expected from the number of zzso chains in the zzso and the loss of zzso Thus, the activity and zzso properties of these hybrids is dependent on the arrangement of zzso chains in the zzso in contrast to results obtained for hybrids containing native and chemically modified zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso containing one or two zzso chains exhibited one-third and two-thirds the activity of the intact zzso zzso zzso respectively, indicating the dominant negative effect that was seen in zzso hybrid zzso is absent within zzso
