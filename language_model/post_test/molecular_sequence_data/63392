We have identified the zzso regions of the zzso C virus zzso protein by performing an exhaustive study of membrane zzso zzso and fusion induced by a zzso zzso library on model zzso having different zzso zzso We report the identification in zzso of a highly zzso region located at the loop domain of the zzso Here, we have investigated the interaction of a zzso patterned after the zzso loop zzso zzso studying its binding and interaction with the zzso zzso and evaluated the zzso structural changes of the zzso and the zzso We show that positively rich zzso strongly binds to zzso charged zzso and it is localized in a shallow position in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibits a high tendency to zzso in the presence of zzso which could be the driving force for the formation of the active zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that the zzso loop could be an attractive candidate for zzso drug development, because it could be a target for zzso compounds that may lead to new vaccine zzso
