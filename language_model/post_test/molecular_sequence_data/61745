zzso elements are short zzso elements zzso approximately 300 zzso in zzso More than 1 million zzso are found in the human zzso Despite their being genetically zzso recent findings suggest that zzso elements may have a broad evolutionary impact by affecting gene structures, protein zzso zzso motifs and expression zzso Because of these effects, compiling a zzso database of zzso sequences that reside within zzso genes seemed a useful zzso zzso such data are limited since the structural and zzso information on genes and zzso sequences are scattered throughout incompatible and unconnected zzso zzso zzso provides easy access to a complete zzso map of the human zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso elements are zzso with respect to coding region and zzso zzso This design zzso queries on zzso zzso locations, as well as motifs and compositional properties via a one-stop search zzso
