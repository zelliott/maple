The recent completion of a first draft of the human zzso has allowed zzso zzso zzso browsing to become zzso Such computer-based research is now a useful adjunct to experiments based at the bench, and is accelerating gene discovery and the analysis and understanding of genes in their zzso zzso This review zzso recent findings on genes zzso proteins of the zzso zzso We describe the organization of the three pairs of genes which zzso zzso of zzso I and zzso and discuss how this relates to their evolution and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso context of the cardiac zzso I and slow skeletal zzso T genes reveals a region of densely packed zzso expressed zzso including new genes identified by automatic zzso zzso This information is discussed within the context of detailed analysis of the zzso gene in this region, cardiac zzso zzso In this way, we illustrate the uses to which a combination of conventional bench experiments and zzso zzso analyses may be put in understanding the relationship between structure and function within the zzso
