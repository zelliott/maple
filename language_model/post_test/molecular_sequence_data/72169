In some zzso species, the universal zzso zzso zzso is translated as zzso However, in most cases, the zzso zzso responsible for this zzso decoding zzso accept in zzso not only zzso but also, to some extent, zzso zzso replacement experiments indicated that zzso is critical for zzso zzso This finding was supported by the fact that the zzso possessing the zzso activity always have zzso whereas that of zzso zzso which possesses no zzso activity, has zzso zzso of defined zzso zzso in cells demonstrated that zzso of the zzso possessing zzso were, in fact, charged with zzso in zzso A genetic approach using an zzso zzso of zzso possessing this type of zzso also suggested that the zzso gene zzso due to the translation of zzso as zzso was rescued by a slight incorporation of zzso into the zzso which demonstrated that the zzso charged with multiple zzso acids could participate in the zzso These findings provide the first evidence that two distinct zzso acids are assigned by a single zzso which occurs naturally in the translation process of certain zzso zzso We term this novel type of zzso a zzso zzso
