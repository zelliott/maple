zzso etch zzso zzso is transmitted by zzso in a zzso manner with the assistance of a zzso protein known as helper component zzso To produce a biologically active form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso A zzso zzso the zzso zzso region, fused to a zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso coding region, was inserted into the zzso zzso zzso using a modified version of the zzso zzso The expressed zzso zzso protein was obtained directly from culture medium of zzso zzso zzso it was able to interact with zzso particles in a protein overlay binding zzso and also to assist zzso transmission of zzso zzso particles to plants using the zzso zzso zzso as zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso provides a rapid and low-cost zzso expression system that can be used to obtain biologically active zzso zzso protein for in zzso transmission zzso
