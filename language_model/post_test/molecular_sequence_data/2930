Genes for zzso zzso zzso components B, A, and C from the zzso zzso zzso and for components zzso zzso A, and C from the zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso They are organized in gene clusters in the order above, which zzso to the order of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in the corresponding zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso components A and C were aligned with each other and with the sequences of corresponding zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso with sequences of various zzso nuclear zzso zzso I, II, and III, and with the sequence of the zzso component from zzso coli zzso The zzso genes for component A are zzso to about the first two-thirds of genes for the zzso component A and the zzso component zzso and the zzso genes for component C are zzso to the last third of the genes for the zzso component A and the zzso component zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from both distance zzso and zzso analyses show the zzso are a coherent group closely related to the zzso nuclear zzso zzso II and/or III zzso The zzso zzso I lineage appears to arise separately from a zzso with the zzso zzso component zzso
