A novel application of zzso secondary zzso mass zzso zzso with continuous zzso cluster beams to zzso analysis was zzso In order to evaluate zzso structures, it is necessary to detect zzso zzso related to multiple zzso zzso acid zzso It is, however, difficult to detect these using conventional zzso primary zzso beams such as zzso cluster zzso Recently, zzso and zzso cluster zzso beams have been introduced to zzso as primary zzso beams and are expected to generate larger secondary zzso than conventional zzso In this study, two sets of model peptides have been zzso zzso and zzso zzso weights are approximately zzso and zzso zzso II and zzso I zzso weights are approximately zzso in order to evaluate the usefulness of the large cluster zzso beams for zzso structural zzso As a result, by using the zzso cluster beams, zzso molecular zzso and large zzso zzso which are not easily detected using conventional zzso primary zzso beams such as zzso zzso are clearly zzso Since the large zzso zzso indicating zzso acid sequences of the peptides are detected by the large cluster beams, it is suggested that the zzso cluster and zzso zzso beams are useful for zzso structural zzso
