In a zzso study of zzso zzso zzso species in zzso zzso zzso we discovered that species classified in zzso zzso a supposed sister zzso of zzso did not partition as a zzso zzso Species in these two zzso can be distinguished only by the position of the spore relative to a precursor structure, the zzso zzso as either within zzso or zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso spore differentiation follows identical patterns and zzso zzso zzso reconstructed from zzso gene zzso together with zzso data, support the hypothesis that the zzso mode of spore formation evolved many times and thus represents a zzso trait of little zzso zzso Therefore zzso zzso is rejected as a valid zzso group and it is integrated zzso into zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso and zzso zzso are erected as new combinations (formerly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of spore formation is demoted from a zzso character to one that is included with other traits to define zzso zzso In addition we describe a new AM zzso species, zzso zzso zzso that originated from a zzso prairie in North zzso zzso spores of zzso zzso are small zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to pale yellow and form via zzso development based on structure and organization of zzso and attached zzso Each spore consists of a zzso spore wall and two zzso inner zzso A zzso zzso likely forms after the completion of spore development to initiate zzso but this structure was not zzso A character distinguishing zzso zzso from other zzso species is zzso to zzso zzso zzso on the surface of the outer spore wall zzso A zzso reconstructed from partial zzso gene sequences zzso placed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
