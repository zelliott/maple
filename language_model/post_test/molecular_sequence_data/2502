A probe representing the zzso zzso zzso zzso the structural gene for a zzso zzso zzso detects zzso sequences in many different organisms, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso clones representing a zzso of the zzso zzso gene were isolated from rat libraries and zzso This gene has been named zzso One zzso clone defines a large open reading frame of approximately zzso zzso zzso predicting a protein sequence of 610 zzso acids with significant zzso to a zzso domain of approximately 275 zzso found in most other zzso The zzso acid identity value to the zzso zzso zzso within this domain is a striking zzso Other zzso clones show blocks of sequence divergence from this zzso clone close to the predicted N zzso indicating the potential existence of a family of related zzso zzso by alternatively spliced zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest the existence of at least one other rat gene with zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso are zzso in size between zzso with heart containing a major transcript of zzso zzso and brain one of zzso zzso The potential identity of the product of the zzso gene with known zzso is zzso
