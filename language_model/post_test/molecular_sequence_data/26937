The zzso motif is the zzso binding motif for zzso process of class I zzso zzso Although researches based on natural proteins inform us about the contribution of natural zzso acid sequences for the zzso they have difficulties in discussing the other alternative sequences and prohibited sequences for the motif to maintain the zzso zzso In order to reveal such the conditions for the alternative and prohibited zzso it is important to investigate a library of various zzso for the zzso For that purpose, we build a library of more than 200 zzso substituting the zzso loop, zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and their zzso abilities were examined by the zzso suppression zzso zzso of zzso and zzso still maintained zzso abilities to a certain zzso On the other hand, a variety of alternative sequences for zzso were zzso and some of those did not include either zzso or zzso which were regarded as necessary zzso in the zzso motif in previous zzso In this article, zzso activity of all the zzso are represented in detail and some suggestions for the condition of the motif are zzso
