In the diagnosis of zzso infection, more than zzso weeks is required to identify the species of zzso responsible for an zzso zzso the development of a method for the rapid detection and identification of zzso is necessary for selecting an optimal therapeutic plan early in the patient's zzso For this purpose, we developed a method combining a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso procedure and a restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene of zzso which codes for a heat shock zzso The zzso procedure allowed the sensitive detection of zzso DNA in clinical zzso Using only 10 zzso of zzso DNA as a reaction mixture, a zzso band of target DNA segments could be yielded on an zzso zzso This indicates that even with a single zzso amount, the zzso is able to detect zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso products allowed us rapidly to distinguish the strains belonging to the zzso complex from 11 different strains of zzso zzso Within 2 days, the method is able to identify the zzso species present in the zzso Moreover, it has the advantage of not requiring the use of zzso which strongly enhances its clinical zzso
