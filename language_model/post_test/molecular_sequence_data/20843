zzso are a group of zzso zzso muscle-wasting disorders caused by genetic defects in one of four cell membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso These four zzso form a zzso that is closely linked to the major zzso protein complex, which is essential for membrane integrity during muscle contraction and provides a scaffold for important zzso zzso Proper zzso trafficking and targeting of the zzso complex is of vital importance, and zzso that severely zzso zzso formation and zzso result in zzso Gene defects in one zzso cause the absence or reduced concentration of the other zzso Most genetic defects generate zzso proteins that are zzso through the cell's quality control system; however, in many cases, zzso modifications do not affect the function of the zzso yet it is zzso as zzso and prematurely zzso Recent evidence shows that zzso zzso could be rescued to the cell membrane by assisting their maturation along the zzso zzso zzso This review zzso the zzso of zzso and highlights the quality control machinery as a potential pharmacological target for therapy of these genetic zzso
