In an attempt to investigate the genes expressed in the zzso hair zzso we zzso screened a mouse zzso skin zzso library, and identified a zzso zzso a novel protein containing one zzso zzso 3 domain at the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence revealed a significant zzso with zzso zzso 84, the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso for which transcripts are expressed at high levels during zzso The sequence identity was remarkable at the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso 3 domain, suggesting that the novel protein is a mouse zzso of the zzso zzso and we have termed this protein zzso In northern zzso study, the transcripts were detected not only in the skin but also in other zzso especially the zzso stomach, small zzso and zzso Furthermore, in mouse skin, the expression of these transcripts basically followed the zzso cycle, increasing significantly during mid and late zzso zzso and decreasing during zzso zzso and early zzso zzso An in zzso zzso experiment showed that the zzso transcripts are expressed predominantly in the hair bulb, the hair zzso inner root zzso and outer root sheath in the lower half of the zzso during mid and late zzso zzso These transcripts were not detected in zzso zzso and early zzso hair zzso or in other skin zzso Thus, these data suggest the possible involvement of zzso in the development of hair zzso during the zzso zzso
