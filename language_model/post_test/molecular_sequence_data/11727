In order to investigate the mechanisms by which zzso hormones influence the vascular system, we have studied their metabolism and the functioning of zzso receptors in bovine zzso zzso cells from zzso cultures, a widely studied model of vascular zzso We have demonstrated the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in these zzso zzso zzso using two different zzso zzso that recognize zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso showed that this zzso has a predominantly zzso zzso even after the addition of zzso to the culture zzso We showed that the zzso complexes were functional by demonstrating their zzso ability in zzso experiments using the zzso gene reporter and an zzso element zzso zzso although the zzso of the response was in the range of only zzso this was not a consequence of the presence of a specific limiting factor, but instead might be related to the peculiar zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
