DNA zzso are the zzso responsible for maintaining the zzso states of zzso In order to change the zzso of DNA, zzso pass one or two DNA strands through transient single or double strand breaks in the DNA zzso zzso It has been proposed that both type zzso and type II zzso change zzso dramatically during the reaction cycle in order to accomplish these zzso In the case of zzso coli DNA zzso I, it has been suggested that a 30 zzso zzso moves away from the rest of the protein to create an entrance into the central hole in the zzso zzso of the 30 zzso zzso reveal that indeed this zzso can change zzso zzso The zzso is composed of two zzso and while the zzso themselves remain largely zzso their relative arrangement can change zzso
