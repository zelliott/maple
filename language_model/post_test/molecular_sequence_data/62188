The clams zzso zzso zzso and zzso possess a unique form of zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 80 zzso and an unusual zzso structure, a result of gene zzso and subsequent zzso These zzso also lack two functionally important zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso which are strictly zzso in other zzso zzso and are assumed to be key zzso for stabilizing the zzso zzso However, these zzso show higher zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso from the blood clam zzso zzso and the oyster zzso zzso were zzso While zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso zzso these two key zzso are replaced by zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso The native zzso from zzso and both of the zzso zzso show an zzso activity similar to that of zzso clam zzso and at least twofold higher than that of other zzso zzso Although the replacement of zzso or zzso by zzso in normal AK causes a considerable decrease in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a two- to zzso increase in zzso for zzso the same replacement in zzso AK had no pronounced effect on zzso zzso Together with the observation that zzso zzso are zzso distinct from other zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso have undergone a unique molecular zzso the characteristic stabilizing function of zzso 62 and 193 has been lost and, consequently, the zzso shows higher activity than zzso
