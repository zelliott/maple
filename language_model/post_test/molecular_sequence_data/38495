Alpha zzso of protein or zzso zzso is an important component of the zzso interactions during zzso In this process, zzso zzso are considered as key zzso ensuring both zzso survival and adaptation in their zzso zzso In this paper, we report the molecular cloning of a putative zzso from zzso zzso that we termed zzso The full-length zzso encodes a typical zzso type II protein with a short zzso domain, a zzso segment and a long zzso zzso zzso In this region, the zzso binding site is well zzso whereas the putative zzso site displays sequence divergence compared to the corresponding region from zzso and zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that zzso is present as several copies or has highly related counterparts in the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso revealed a single zzso transcript at 2 zzso in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso identified a 50 zzso native protein that zzso to the zzso and zzso regions of adult zzso
