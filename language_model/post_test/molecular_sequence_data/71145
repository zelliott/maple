zzso genes serve two important functions during zzso development: they first initiate periodic patterns, and subsequently interact with each other to refine these patterns to the precision required for definition of zzso zzso Previously, we described a zzso input region of the zzso zzso Here we further characterize this region through the use of reporter gene zzso and by comparison with corresponding sequences from zzso zzso We find that many but not all regulatory properties of this zzso zzso are functionally zzso Moreover, the similarity between these zzso sequences is surprisingly zzso When compared to similar data for gap gene input element, our data suggest that zzso target sequences are less constrained during evolution, and that functional elements zzso zzso interactions can be dispersed over many zzso
