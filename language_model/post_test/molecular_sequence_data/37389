To determine whether zzso zzso zzso vaccination would alter gamma zzso zzso zzso expression in guinea pig cells exposed to zzso zzso we cloned a zzso zzso guinea pig zzso from a zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso is composed of 1,110 zzso with an open reading frame zzso a zzso protein which shows 56 and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to human and mouse zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells from zzso and zzso guinea pigs were zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso tuberculosis zzso or zzso and the total zzso was subjected to Northern zzso analysis with a zzso probe derived from the zzso zzso Compared to the zzso zzso expression in cells of zzso animals, that in zzso and zzso zzso cells exposed to various stimuli was enhanced after zzso zzso However, there was a significant reduction in zzso zzso levels when cells were zzso with a zzso of infection of greater than 1 virulent zzso tuberculosis zzso per 10 zzso The enhanced zzso zzso response in zzso animals was associated with an increase in the proportions of zzso T cells in the zzso as determined by zzso cell zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso population in the zzso enriched either by panning with zzso pig zzso zzso plates or by zzso on nylon zzso columns produced more zzso zzso than whole zzso cells following stimulation with zzso A or zzso This indicates that T cells are principally responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso expression following zzso zzso The mechanism by which virulent zzso suppress zzso zzso zzso is currently under zzso
