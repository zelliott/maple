The primary structure of the Lewis lung zzso protein zzso belonging to the nuclear group of proteins zzso zzso mobility group I) was determined using zzso and fast atom zzso mass zzso It was demonstrated that the sequence of the tumor protein zzso to the zzso acid sequence derived from the zzso from cultured cells and that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, the two high performance liquid zzso forms zzso and zzso of the protein zzso were shown to differ at the level of zzso zzso since they contain three zzso and two zzso groups, respectively, in the zzso zzso No other modification was detected in the remaining part of the zzso
