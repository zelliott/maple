zzso zzso is distinct among members of the zzso family for having the largest zzso zzso zzso zzso Packaging of large zzso zzso is known to give rise to a highly zzso viral zzso but molecular interactions conducive to the formation of zzso zzso resistant to zzso have not been zzso Here, we report a zzso electron zzso zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso resolution and describe the molecular interactions among the zzso protein molecules in the zzso zzso at the secondary structure zzso Secondary structural elements are resolved to provide landmarks for zzso with results from zzso prediction and for zzso zzso zzso The major zzso protein zzso upper domain zzso contains zzso and zzso zzso with those in zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso with the largest differences identified as a zzso zzso region, located at the tip of zzso and involved in interaction with the smallest zzso protein zzso zzso among the zzso zzso floor domain of zzso the middle domain of zzso the hook and clamp zzso of the triplex proteins zzso and clamp zzso of zzso and clamp domain of zzso contribute to the formation of a mature zzso These results offer a framework for understanding how zzso uses various secondary structural elements of its zzso proteins to build a robust zzso for packaging its large zzso zzso inside and for attaching unique functional zzso proteins zzso
