The zzso gene appears to affect zzso from a variety of promoters in zzso zzso The gene was zzso and sequence analysis revealed two completely overlapping open reading frames of zzso and zzso zzso on opposite zzso The zzso coding sequence was identified by selective zzso The predicted zzso zzso protein is highly charged but overall zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein was localized in the nucleus, as judged by zzso zzso The N zzso of zzso contains a sequence zzso to nuclear zzso signals and was sufficient to direct zzso to the zzso The zzso ends of the zzso zzso were zzso and included ends mapping downstream from the first zzso zzso Construction of a zzso zzso provided evidence that zzso initiation at the second zzso yields a partially functional zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso caused a wider range of zzso defects than the previously isolated point zzso including slow zzso zzso and molecular evidence suggested that zzso is functionally related to the zzso and zzso zzso These genes may function together to affect zzso
