zzso zzso type 2 zzso strains have been classified into two major zzso zzso and zzso and 8 genetic zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso To date, no studies have been performed to zzso zzso zzso strains enclosing eight zzso zzso The present study aimed to zzso zzso zzso and perform zzso competition analysis using zzso zzso zzso Fourteen zzso strains representative for eight clusters were tested with 20 zzso zzso of them were generated against zzso strain zzso and 5 of them against zzso strain zzso in zzso zzso zzso Four zzso reacted to all 14 zzso strains and one zzso reacted with all strains except for a zzso zzso One zzso reacted with all zzso zzso except for a zzso strain and one zzso reacted with all zzso zzso except for a zzso zzso Nine zzso reacted with the strains of zzso zzso and zzso Three zzso only reacted with the strains of zzso and zzso One zzso reacted specifically with the strains of zzso This suggests that discrete zzso differences exist between different zzso genetic clusters and that these clusters can be zzso by the use of a panel of universal and zzso zzso Six zzso were selected for zzso analysis by a competitive zzso using zzso strain zzso Six overlapping zzso were identified on the zzso zzso zzso The universal zzso recognized larger zzso than the zzso zzso These findings are helpful in the development of diagnostic tests and new generation vaccines against zzso
