We present here the zzso sequence for a zzso clone zzso zzso from sea urchin, zzso zzso The obtained zzso comprised 301 zzso acid zzso that contained the zzso domain to be important for binding to zzso zzso acid sequence similarity between this clone and other zzso zzso sequences averaged approximately zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso I, it was first suggested that zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso at both zzso site and two zzso zzso
