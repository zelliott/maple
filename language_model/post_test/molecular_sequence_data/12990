Human zzso is a member of a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but is expressed specifically in zzso large zzso zzso with natural killer cell zzso We have devised a zzso chain reaction strategy to delete the predicted zzso of human zzso zzso to zzso to enable its expression and zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, using zzso zzso we have derived a unique and specific zzso zzso detecting human zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso against a panel of zzso zzso zzso formally demonstrated that the human zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that specifically zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso side chain at zzso The expression of active human zzso and the generation of a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso will now enable a detailed zzso analysis of key zzso acids that zzso this unusual zzso zzso zzso
