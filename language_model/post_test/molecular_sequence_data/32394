The zzso AHL gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso involved in the reductive zzso zzso zzso A bacterial expression zzso containing AHL zzso was randomly zzso with zzso and transformed into the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colonies that did not show evidence of zzso zzso those that exhibited slower growth on zzso zzso were selected for further zzso zzso of the AHL zzso in one such clone revealed the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to zzso resulting in an zzso zzso to zzso zzso This microbial zzso procedure is useful in zzso zzso studies for zzso zzso
