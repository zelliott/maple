The precise mechanism governing the generation of zzso stem cells still remains to be zzso partly because the molecules required for early zzso have not fully been zzso 

We have identified a novel gene expressed in embryonic zzso zzso designated zzso (for embryonic large zzso derived from zzso zzso which has no significant zzso with any other known zzso Based on the zzso zzso mouse zzso protein is composed of zzso zzso acid zzso and contains an zzso zzso domain, eight nuclear zzso signals zzso at the zzso region, three nuclear export signals zzso and two zzso repeats at the zzso zzso zzso has a potential to shuttle between the zzso and zzso When in the nucleus, zzso is present in the nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain and various zzso zzso reveal the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene is predominantly expressed in embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and zzso whereas the expression is zzso in the zzso In the zzso zzso region of an zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso lining the zzso zzso In the adult bone zzso zzso is notably expressed in the zzso zzso 

We have reported the isolation and characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso seems to be a nuclear zzso factor associated with both early and mature zzso zzso
