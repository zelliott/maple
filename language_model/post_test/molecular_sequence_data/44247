zzso zzso methods have been used to study the controversial zzso relationships between the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using total zzso DNA from the two species as zzso for in zzso zzso to zzso we found that the zzso regions of the zzso arms of both species are similar, while zzso regions show substantial zzso Two dispersed repetitive DNA sequences were isolated: zzso is distributed along the zzso but amplified in the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso while zzso in both species, is less amplified in terminal zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso of DNA showed many repetitive fragments, but few in common between the two zzso After probing Southern transfers with zzso zzso zzso DNA, all lanes showed similar zzso patterns although one extra small band was evident in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, probing with zzso zzso DNA showed very substantial differences between the two zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso from an zzso hybrid showed seven zzso of zzso zzso origin and seven zzso from zzso zzso We also zzso the physical organization of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso repeated sequence from zzso Our data support an zzso origin for zzso zzso but its zzso and that of zzso zzso show extensive differences, so the zzso is unlikely to be directly derived from zzso zzso
