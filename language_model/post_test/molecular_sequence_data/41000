zzso zzso zzso is a five K zzso zzso zzso protein involved in the zzso control of zzso zzso during zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso The two proteins cooperate to recognize target zzso and convert them into a zzso zzso active zzso We report the zzso crystal structure of a zzso stable zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals that the four tandem zzso zzso are organized into a zzso structural zzso The zzso are involved in extensive side-by-side zzso similar to those observed in previous structures of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso X-ray scattering reconstructions show that the zzso zzso domain zzso forms a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso are putative zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso is unable in isolation to zzso zzso Instead, the zzso domain mediates the direct interaction with the zzso zzso pointing to a function of the zzso region as a zzso interaction zzso
