The hairpin zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso A and B, that dock to form the biologically active zzso Previously, the crystal structure of the hairpin has been solved as a zzso zzso junction that incorporated the zzso protein as an artificial zzso motif zzso & zzso (2001), Nature zzso zzso zzso Here, the zzso of a minimal zzso hairpin zzso zzso is reported in the absence of zzso zzso grow in space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso Complete zzso data have been collected to zzso A zzso zzso analysis should provide details of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso relevant to hairpin zzso
