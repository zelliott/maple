Using a combination of library screening and zzso zzso based on a partial human zzso zzso zzso zzso we have cloned the complete coding region for a human zzso zzso The sequence shows extensive similarity to the published zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso however, in comparison with the latter, we find an open reading frame corresponding to only 388 zzso acids instead of zzso zzso zzso This difference is due to a frame shift caused by an additional zzso found in the human sequence after position zzso Moreover, we also found the same additional zzso in the rat zzso zzso We confirmed the occurrence of the sequence by examining this part of the sequence in zzso DNA of 10 human volunteers and in rat zzso zzso Based on a part of the zzso zzso zzso sequence that was identified in the cloning process, there seem to be at least two possible zzso sites in the coding region of the zzso The human zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells, showed zzso binding properties similar to zzso receptors in guinea pig zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the guinea pig zzso zzso zzso were determined for four investigated zzso zzso and three zzso and appropriate binding zzso zzso were found in each zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso
