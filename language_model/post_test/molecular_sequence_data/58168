zzso zzso in the zzso tumor zzso gene represent the single most common genetic zzso observed in human zzso Interestingly, the great majority of zzso tumors of the zzso zzso contain zzso zzso zzso together with the DNA of specific types of human zzso zzso while the small portion of zzso cervical zzso often carry zzso in the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cellular regulatory genes has been implicated to play a key role for the zzso activity of zzso zzso as zzso zzso in general has lost the activity to stimulate zzso reporter zzso The detection of zzso and zzso active zzso protein in zzso cervical zzso cells enabled us to investigate the in zzso effects of putative zzso on zzso zzso function in cervical cancer zzso We show that the zzso zzso activity of zzso cell zzso is strongly zzso by zzso of E6 protein from zzso zzso type 16 zzso but is not influenced by low-risk zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso cellular zzso such as zzso zzso or the product of the human zzso gene also zzso interfere with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our findings indicate that, within a cervical cancer cell, the expression of E6 protein from high-risk zzso but not from low-risk zzso can lead to the same functional consequences as a zzso of the zzso zzso These results could provide a zzso basis for the inverse correlation between the presence of zzso sequences and zzso zzso of the zzso gene in cervical zzso
