The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso is needed for correct embryonic development, and related sequences are active during zzso zzso Here we report the protein coding sequence and embryonic expression pattern of the zzso zzso gene zzso which is directly zzso to zzso in mice and zzso The predicted zzso zzso protein shares zzso overall identity to its zzso zzso In addition to the highly zzso zzso region, sequence conservation is present within three short stretches in the zzso zzso The embryonic expression of the zzso gene was zzso by in zzso zzso to zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso are first detected in two lateral bands at the zzso stage, when zzso is zzso Within the next 2 h of development, these two bands migrate and fuse at the zzso By the time the neural zzso becomes visible zzso zzso a zzso stripe of zzso expressing cells is seen at the zzso zzso zzso Later this stripe becomes significantly compressed along the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso transcripts are detected mainly in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso expression seems restricted to the zzso of the zzso A second site of activity was observed in each zzso where specific zzso cells, the muscle zzso express zzso Our observations are discussed in relation to early zzso of the central nervous system zzso and the generation of zzso zzso
