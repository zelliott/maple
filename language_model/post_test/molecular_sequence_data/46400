Thirty-one potential zzso that belong to 16 zzso families were discovered from more than 324 zzso zzso sequences of apple zzso zzso In addition, precise zzso especially terminal zzso of the 16 apple zzso zzso in 16 families were validated by zzso a newly developed method for the determination of the potential zzso predicted zzso The expression of these 16 zzso could be detected in apple young zzso old zzso young zzso flower zzso flower and developing fruits by quantitative zzso zzso and some of them showed zzso zzso zzso potential targets were identified for the 16 apple zzso most of which were zzso factors that play important roles in apple zzso Twelve target genes were zzso verified by zzso with some exhibiting different expression trends from their corresponding zzso indicating the zzso mode of zzso on their target zzso
