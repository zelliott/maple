The aim of this study was to establish an in zzso experimental model that mimics the interaction of zzso B virus zzso and the zzso zzso 

The barrier was represented by zzso cell line, zzso cells, which were incubated with zzso in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis zzso zzso At 12-hour intervals after a 24-hour zzso the infection efficiency was examined by zzso zzso zzso of culture zzso zzso of cell zzso Western zzso of cell zzso zzso chain reaction amplification for viral DNA of infected cells, and transmission electron zzso for zzso particles in infected zzso 

In the absence of zzso many zzso cell colonies showed a negative or zzso positive pattern after incubation with zzso But when zzso cells were zzso with zzso before zzso with zzso the infection was greatly zzso whereas the differences observed between the various time points in the second series of experiments did not reach a statistically significant zzso 

zzso cells can support zzso infection in the presence of zzso Our in zzso system provides key basis on further study reflecting mechanism of in zzso zzso zzso infection and zzso
