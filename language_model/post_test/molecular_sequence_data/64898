Classic zzso mediate zzso zzso zzso in a variety of animals, but there are marked differences in their domain structures between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso classic zzso zzso I and type II classic zzso consists of five tandem repeats of zzso sequences called zzso zzso whereas that of zzso classic zzso zzso as type III classic zzso contains a variable number of zzso zzso followed by a characteristic domain complex made of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we identified a novel zzso type III zzso showing high sequence similarity to zzso zzso and named this zzso chicken zzso zzso because of the distinct expression in horizontal cells of the neural zzso zzso functioned as an zzso zzso when introduced into cultured zzso Database search revealed one zzso zzso in zzso and two in zzso fish, but none in other zzso species zzso These observations indicate that type III classic zzso have been zzso in zzso species, being expressed by limited cells types, but lost in particular zzso groups of the zzso
