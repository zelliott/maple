Three series of zzso DNA clones were constructed, with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene as a quantitative zzso to examine the activities of promoter and zzso sequence elements in the zzso long terminal repeat zzso of zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso sequences isolated from the mouse zzso zzso zzso expression was determined in mouse zzso zzso human zzso and mink zzso cultured cells zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso clones and the zzso zzso of four modified zzso zzso zzso in complete structures either with or without the adjacent downstream zzso all showed very little or negligible activities for zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso were highly zzso The zzso zzso were divided into three portions and examined zzso The 3' portion of the zzso zzso that contains the zzso and zzso boxes was found to be a functional promoter, being about one-half to one-third as active as the corresponding portion of zzso zzso zzso A zzso fragment, representing the distinct zzso to zzso inserted segment in the middle, was found to be a potential zzso especially when examined in combination with the zzso virus 40 promoter in zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso portion, which contains the zzso motifs of the zzso segment as well as the upstream zzso zzso showed moderate zzso activities in zzso cells but was virtually inactive in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso addition of this zzso to the zzso zzso zzso depressed zzso zzso Further analyses using zzso zzso zzso located the presence of a strong negative regulatory element within the region containing the zzso portion of the zzso and the immediate upstream sequences in the zzso zzso
