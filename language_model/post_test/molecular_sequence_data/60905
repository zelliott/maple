Members of the zzso family are known to play diverse roles in the zzso of zzso The zzso sequences of chicken zzso were identified and the role it plays in limb development was examined by comparing its expression pattern with that of two other zzso members, zzso and zzso and by zzso it with a zzso zzso in the limb zzso zzso expression is detected in the zzso region at stage 14, and in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the limb zzso The signal was graded along the zzso axis at stages zzso and also along the zzso axis during early zzso It disappeared in the zzso region after stage 26, and was restricted to the region surrounding the zzso at stage zzso zzso and zzso other members of the zzso were expressed with a distinct zzso pattern during the later zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso structure and zzso was expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso expression was partially reduced after zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso expression was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of these zzso was zzso regulated by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the limb bud with the zzso resulted in zzso of long bones predominantly in the zzso because of retarded zzso zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso and zzso were not significantly reduced in zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in pattern formation along the zzso axis by regulation of zzso zzso
