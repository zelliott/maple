In zzso analysis, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was produced to an outer membrane protein zzso of zzso zzso showed that a major zzso is heat zzso having a molecular mass of 28 zzso when the zzso zzso preparation was zzso at 60 degrees C and a mass of 37 zzso when the zzso preparation was zzso at 100 degrees zzso The zzso zzso reacted intensely with zzso zzso obtained from calves with experimental zzso zzso pneumonia in zzso zzso zzso microscopic and zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was not surface exposed on the intact zzso However, a decrease in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso analysis after zzso of zzso serum with intact bacterial cells of zzso zzso suggests that a zzso portion of the zzso zzso is expressed on the intact zzso zzso zzso reacted with 45 of 45 strains of zzso zzso tested in zzso zzso The apparent molecular mass of the zzso varied among zzso and five zzso patterns demonstrated by zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso also reacted with six species in the family zzso zzso coli, and zzso zzso but not with the other eight species of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed zzso zzso with the zzso protein of zzso coli K-12 and significant zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with the zzso proteins of zzso zzso We conclude that a major, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which elicits an zzso response in zzso zzso animals, is a common zzso among zzso zzso strains tested and is structurally related to the zzso protein of zzso zzso
