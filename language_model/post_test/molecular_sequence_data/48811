The dynamics of populations and activities of zzso and zzso zzso were investigated in rice zzso treated with two levels of zzso Different soil compartments zzso bulk, zzso zzso and roots zzso and old zzso were collected at three time points (the zzso zzso heading and maturity zzso of the zzso The population dynamics of bacterial zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by determining the abundance zzso zzso and composition zzso zzso and zzso of their zzso genes zzso for a zzso of zzso zzso that of zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso gene zzso for a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso The activity of the zzso was determined by measuring the rates of potential zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by zzso the copy numbers of zzso and zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso activity was much higher than potential zzso zzso activity and was not directly affected by nitrogen amendment demonstrating the importance of zzso zzso as pace makers for zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in the distribution of bacterial and zzso zzso zzso and of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found in the different compartments of planted zzso soil indicating niche zzso In bulk soil, zzso bacteria zzso and zzso were at low abundance and displayed no activity, but in surface soil their activity and abundance was zzso zzso zzso in surface soil was dominated by zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso seemed to dominate zzso in zzso soil and on rice zzso In contrast to soil zzso the level of N zzso and the time point of sampling had only little effect on the zzso composition and activity of the zzso zzso The results of our study show that in rice fields population dynamics and activity of zzso is mainly differentiated by the soil compartments rather than by nitrogen amendment or zzso
