zzso zzso of zzso gamma receptors zzso gamma zzso on zzso plays a significant role in their zzso shown here by contrasting the responses induced by low zzso immune complexes zzso and high zzso immune complexes zzso and by zzso zzso in zzso zzso after their addition to the zzso zzso flow zzso was used to measure immune complex zzso changes in zzso zzso concentration and initiation of the zzso burst simultaneously in the same cell and to correlate these with zzso gamma R zzso We have previously shown that zzso of zzso respond zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulate the entire zzso This zzso was not due to differences in zzso zzso The magnitude of the transient zzso increase was independent of the dose of zzso but depended on the dose when an zzso was zzso As shown here, zzso zzso zzso zzso responses similar to those observed in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso only minimal zzso delta pH and no zzso burst or membrane potential changes at all unless zzso gamma R was zzso accomplished by zzso or by zzso However, zzso zzso as determined by zzso release, was not observed in cells zzso by the in zzso zzso method, whereas the zzso preparation triggered zzso zzso Thus, some zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso functions such as zzso zzso and zzso burst initiation have an absolute requirement for zzso gamma R zzso whereas signaling functions such as changes in membrane potential, zzso zzso and zzso zzso concentration can occur, albeit more slowly and to a lesser extent, if single zzso gamma R are zzso
