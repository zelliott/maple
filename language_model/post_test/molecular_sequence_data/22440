zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso are destroyed by a zzso termed zzso protein degradation zzso zzso are often removed from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso before zzso degradation, which maintains the efficiency of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso has long been suspected, but not zzso to be crucial in this zzso We demonstrate that the efficient degradation of zzso zzso A chain requires the zzso complex, suggesting that this complex couples protein zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso binding protein involved in the transfer of zzso zzso to the zzso How zzso achieves its zzso specificity is zzso We show that zzso binds various regulators of zzso to facilitate the degradation of distinct zzso We propose that the zzso specificity of zzso and other zzso binding proteins is determined by their interactions with various zzso involved in specific degradation zzso
