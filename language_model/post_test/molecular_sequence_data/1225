In an attempt to isolate and identify the zzso zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to test their protective zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso was prepared to screen a zzso random zzso zzso Three rounds of zzso were performed and resulted in an zzso Six peptides selected randomly from the third zzso were all found to be positive by evaluating the binding to zzso zzso by zzso and Western zzso Three zzso acid sequences were deduced from the six zzso clones by zzso When they were used to zzso mice, the three peptides could induce significant reduction in adult worms zzso zzso and zzso as well as in liver eggs per gram zzso zzso zzso and zzso This result showed that three zzso on zzso were obtained and they could induce significant protective efficacy against zzso
