zzso sex evolved early in the history of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso belonging to an early zzso lineage of zzso shows no zzso or zzso evidence of zzso or sexual zzso Recent molecular analyses challenge the idea that zzso zzso is a strictly zzso zzso by providing evidence of zzso between zzso zzso within one zzso zzso zzso of this species as well as genetic transfer from one zzso to another zzso zzso Because zzso is not well documented and because it is not known whether the observed zzso transfer represents true zzso genetic exchange or a zzso process, we analyzed zzso sequences from all major zzso zzso zzso of this zzso For all zzso we detected molecular signatures consistent with zzso sex or genetic exchange, including low levels of zzso as indicated by zzso sequence divergence within zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The identification of zzso between zzso suggests a shared gene pool and calls into question whether it is appropriate to divide the genetically distinct zzso of zzso zzso into a species zzso
