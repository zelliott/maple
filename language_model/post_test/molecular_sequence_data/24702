zzso are structurally diverse natural products with a wide range of useful zzso zzso modular zzso zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso using a different set of zzso for each successive cycle of chain zzso The choice of starter unit is governed by the zzso specificity of a distinct loading zzso The unusual loading module of the zzso modular zzso from the zzso zzso zzso specifies a zzso acid starter zzso Attempts to design functional hybrid zzso using this loading module provide a stringent test of our understanding of zzso structure and function, since the order of the zzso in the loading and first extension module is zzso in the zzso zzso and the producing strain is not an zzso 

We have constructed zzso zzso based on zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso that contains only extension zzso 1 and 2 and a zzso zzso domain, by substituting one or more zzso from the zzso zzso A hybrid zzso containing the zzso zzso domain zzso instead of extension zzso domain zzso produced zzso zzso lacking a zzso group at zzso as expected if zzso zzso the addition of zzso during the first extension cycle on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso loading module AT domain by the zzso zzso domain led to the production of zzso zzso zzso as well as the normal products of zzso This zzso zzso zzso was also the product of a hybrid zzso containing the entire zzso zzso loading module as well as part of its first extension zzso zzso zzso was only produced when measures were simultaneously taken to increase the zzso supply of zzso in the host strain of zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that the ability to recruit a zzso starter unit can be zzso on a modular zzso by the transfer either of a single AT domain, or of multiple zzso to produce a zzso first extension zzso from the zzso zzso However, zzso needs to be provided within the cell as a specific zzso The data also support the respective roles previously assigned to the adjacent AT zzso of the zzso zzso extension zzso Construction of such hybrid zzso zzso should significantly extend the synthetic repertoire of modular zzso
