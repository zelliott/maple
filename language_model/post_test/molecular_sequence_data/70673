From a rabbit zzso library a full length zzso was isolated which predicted a novel zzso zzso sharing zzso identical zzso acids with the rabbit zzso zzso product analysis of the zzso expressed protein identified it as a zzso zzso zzso This proves the zzso of a zzso and a zzso in one zzso zzso Among the six zzso acids that are different to rabbit zzso zzso 353 is shown to be the primary zzso for zzso zzso In the zzso region of the zzso a zzso zzso repetitive element has been found, closely related to the differentiation control element zzso of the rabbit zzso which is organized by ten repeats of 19 zzso By zzso zzso the zzso part of the gene for the novel zzso containing the zzso zzso has been amplified and zzso The zzso were very similar in length to the corresponding zzso zzso with zzso to zzso identical zzso zzso By screening a rabbit zzso library an alternative zzso transcript of zzso zzso has been detected containing a zzso zzso longer zzso region zzso than the main zzso zzso zzso The determination of the tissue distribution by Northern zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso was only expressed in zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso was exclusively expressed in zzso The only cell type which has been found to express the zzso abundantly are zzso The results indicate that the expression of zzso and zzso is highly zzso The zzso of the zzso contained a novel zzso repetitive zzso motif of 23 bases length which is related but not identical to the zzso of 19 bases in the zzso The analysis of a zzso zzso of the complete zzso zzso zzso gene confirmed that zzso and zzso are not interrupted by an additional zzso
