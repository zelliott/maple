In recent years, the zzso have emerged as the largest family of naturally zzso zzso zzso display potent zzso activity that varies with the structure of the zzso and combined with their unique structure, they represent novel zzso zzso However, their mechanism of action is yet zzso In this work we show that disruption of cell zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been isolated from zzso zzso Cell viability and zzso studies on the human zzso cell line zzso zzso showed that cells exposed to 1 displayed disintegrated cell zzso within 5 zzso zzso studies on zzso zzso cells and on zzso showed rapid zzso release of their respective internal zzso The present results show that zzso have specific zzso zzso
