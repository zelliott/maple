The zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, a counterpart of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, is important for proper development by maintaining specific gene expression zzso The zzso zzso is strongly zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is required for full activity of the zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso of zzso caused by a single zzso acid substitution in the zzso repeat 2 region, implicated in a variety of zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso reveal that it functions as an zzso and that zzso has critical roles in tissue patterning and growth zzso zzso shifts show that zzso is continuously required, with essential functions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genetic interactions between zzso and zzso in genes zzso other members of the zzso complex suggest that zzso zzso zzso result from reduced zzso complex zzso zzso with this view, zzso is zzso associated with other components of the zzso complex at the restrictive zzso zzso can establish direct contacts through the zzso repeat 2 region with the zzso domain of the zzso regulator zzso zzso and zzso is partially defective for functional zzso zzso As zzso zzso of zzso are strongly correlated with aggressive zzso our results support the view that zzso and specifically the repeat 2 region, has a critical role in zzso cell growth control functions of the zzso zzso zzso
