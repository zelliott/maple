It has previously been shown that the zzso family in the mouse zzso contains two alternative zzso ends called the A- and zzso sequences zzso We show here that the zzso element is a major class of zzso zzso elements and report on the details of organization of the zzso motif of these zzso zzso Although the A- and zzso zzso sequences share no zzso sequence zzso the organization of an zzso zzso end is zzso similar to that of an zzso That is, the zzso zzso sequences consist of a tandem array of a small number of 206 zzso zzso while the zzso zzso motif consists of a tandem array of 208 zzso zzso All of the zzso elements characterized to date have a truncated zzso at the zzso end of the zzso Many of the zzso elements are also terminated at the zzso end by a truncated copy but unlike the zzso elements some zzso elements terminate with a zzso which is within a few zzso of being zzso In addition the zzso consensus zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso shows zzso zzso to the body of the zzso starting at the position where the zzso joins the rest of the zzso zzso
