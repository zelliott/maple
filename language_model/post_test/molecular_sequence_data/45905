zzso zzso of soluble tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso are associated with insulin zzso In a recent study, we provided evidence for the existence of a biologically active form of zzso produced by alternative zzso zzso We aimed to evaluate whether this circulating zzso is associated with insulin action in zzso 

Real time zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluated zzso expression in zzso zzso was measured using a zzso zzso against an zzso present in zzso zzso 14 zzso of the zzso zzso but predicted to be absent in soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was measured using zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso zzso and zzso model of assessment zzso value in a replication study of 223 zzso 

Real time zzso confirmed gene expression of zzso in zzso from healthy zzso A significant and positive association was found between serum zzso concentration and insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This association was most significant in subjects with normal zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The subjects in whom zzso was zzso were more insulin sensitive than those with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with body mass index, zzso ratio, zzso and zzso blood pressure, zzso serum zzso serum zzso and serum zzso acid concentration and with the zzso value zzso zzso zzso in the replication zzso zzso zzso declined with increased number of components of the zzso zzso 

Native zzso and zzso show opposite associations with insulin zzso zzso might play a role as a counterpart of the zzso environment associated with insulin zzso
