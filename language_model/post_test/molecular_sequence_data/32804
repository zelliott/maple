The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and adults of the cricket zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were previously called zzso zzso as they share some similar zzso zzso and replication aspects with members of the family zzso Their relationships to each other and to zzso are zzso by the sequence of the complete zzso of zzso which is zzso zzso has an AT content of zzso and potentially contains 98 predicted zzso open reading frames zzso zzso zzso of zzso share sequence similarities with zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Most notably, 15 zzso zzso are zzso to the zzso core zzso which are associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso replication zzso structural proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and proteins of unknown function zzso zzso and zzso zzso to these zzso core genes have been predicted in zzso as zzso Six zzso zzso are zzso to zzso zzso genes zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the remaining 57 zzso revealed no zzso or poor similarities to the current gene zzso No zzso repeat zzso sequences but zzso short direct repeat zzso regions were detected in the zzso zzso Gene content and sequence similarity suggest that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso group of zzso zzso DNA zzso which separated from the zzso lineage before this radiated into zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The accumulated information on the zzso zzso suggests that zzso form a highly diverse and zzso ancient sister group of the zzso which have evolved in a variety of highly divergent host zzso
