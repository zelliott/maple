We have developed zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the detection of medically important zzso zzso using different species and zzso zzso zzso selected within the zzso zzso a recently cloned gene zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were able to amplify zzso species DNA zzso zzso whereas DNA from all other zzso tested, belonging to other zzso zzso was not zzso The zzso zzso zzso allowed differentiation of each of five zzso species by the zzso length zzso No zzso were detected using zzso or zzso zzso in several bacterial or human DNA zzso The methods described in this study are zzso simple and zzso The total time required for each zzso method was less than 4 h from the extraction to the zzso zzso after zzso In conclusion, we developed zzso methods to differentiate the five most medically important zzso species using zzso directed to the zzso zzso
