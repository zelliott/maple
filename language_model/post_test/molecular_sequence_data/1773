The zzso zzso is a large structure into which specific constituent proteins must be targeted, transported and assembled after their synthesis in the zzso Using zzso zzso and a zzso approach, we have identified and characterized a novel set of zzso zzso proteins that are localized to the zzso These proteins represent unique zzso that are targeted to the zzso by an zzso extension to the protein and are incorporated into an zzso structure (the zzso zzso We show that the zzso extension is both necessary for zzso location in the zzso and sufficient for targeting of a green fluorescent protein reporter protein to the zzso Moreover, these zzso extension sequences are zzso in evolution and we find that they allow the identification of novel zzso zzso in the zzso of humans and zzso Given the existence of specific zzso of certain central zzso zzso and targeting sequences for these zzso we suggest that these zzso form part of a complex, zzso zzso capability that is built into the zzso zzso
