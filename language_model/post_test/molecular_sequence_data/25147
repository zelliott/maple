Using zzso zzso the occurrence of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substance P and some of their zzso was examined in 19 human acoustic nerve tumors and corresponding normal zzso The normal acoustic nerve tissue obtained by autopsy contained traces of zzso zzso and substance P (less than or equal to zzso zzso but neither zzso zzso nor zzso In contrast 8 tumors expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 tumors zzso zzso zzso and 14 tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were present in two and substance P in one zzso The results show that acoustic zzso often express the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but process their zzso poorly to zzso zzso The tumor synthesis of zzso contrasts to the rare, sporadic expression of the zzso gene in normal nerve zzso
