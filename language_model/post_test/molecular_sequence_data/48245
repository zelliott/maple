The zzso zzso virus zzso zzso host zzso zzso protein zzso gene zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso that triggers zzso of host protein synthesis and accelerated zzso degradation during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso displays weak zzso acid sequence similarity to the zzso family of zzso and zzso to induce accelerated zzso turnover through zzso zzso events when it is expressed as the only zzso protein in a rabbit zzso in zzso translation zzso Although zzso selectively targets zzso in zzso the basis for this selectivity remains obscure, since in zzso activity is not influenced by the presence of a zzso cap or 3' zzso zzso Here we show that zzso activity is greatly altered by placing an internal zzso entry site zzso from zzso virus or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso bearing the zzso were zzso zzso by the zzso zzso at multiple sites clustered in a narrow zone located immediately downstream of the element in a reaction that did not require zzso zzso was observed when the zzso was located at the zzso end or placed at internal sites in the zzso indicating that it is independent of position or sequence zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso can be selectively targeted by specific zzso elements in the zzso zzso possibly through secondary structure or a component of the zzso zzso
