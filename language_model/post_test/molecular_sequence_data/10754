zzso zzso is a key zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, which is responsible for generation of reducing zzso to protect cellular integrity from zzso oxygen zzso While zzso 2 and 3 are highly zzso the complete zzso gene is mapped to a single zzso locus zzso by several independent zzso Southern zzso zzso of a zzso 3' zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso cell hybrid DNA localized zzso to the zzso region of zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso 1 and 2 mapped zzso to zzso A truncated and zzso segment of zzso zzso 5 terminating with a zzso tail was identified in a zzso locus zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso cell hybrids revealed the presence of the functional zzso gene on zzso 11 and its absence on human zzso zzso zzso of radiation hybrids placed zzso between markers zzso and zzso on zzso
