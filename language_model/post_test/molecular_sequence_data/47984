We have identified and characterized 12 zzso in seven genes that affect the development of the zzso zzso zzso We find that the zzso can disrupt the zzso development of the zzso blast cells within the zzso the zzso zzso in both males and zzso and in some cases, the expression of a zzso marker in zzso zzso zzso in several of the genes also affect zzso On the basis of their zzso zzso we propose that the genes fall into four distinct zzso zzso zzso is required for regional identity of the zzso zzso zzso is required for a variety of zzso and zzso cell types, including cells in the zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso affect development of many cells, including zzso and zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for patterning fates within the zzso making certain zzso cells different from zzso We also describe a new zzso of the zzso gene zzso that is temperature sensitive and affects the zzso zzso of the zzso paired zzso Our results suggest that a combination of different factors contribute to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso
