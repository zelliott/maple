zzso and related zzso are potent zzso of zzso and zzso in cell zzso Previous analyses of resistant zzso implicated the viral zzso protein zzso as the likely target of drug zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso and selection of spontaneous zzso 14 zzso with several zzso zzso to confirm the link between zzso in zzso 14 zzso and the function blocked by zzso We also produced zzso 3A and zzso proteins for zzso zzso Despite extensive efforts, however, we were unable to demonstrate direct binding between zzso and any of several viral zzso nor could we demonstrate binding of zzso to a host zzso In addition, zzso did not disrupt zzso ability to bind zzso or zzso zzso the association of zzso with zzso or the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Finally, we identified an zzso zzso with an increased level of resistance which apparently has zzso in multiple proteins or zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso targets a complex of proteins and/or cellular zzso Such a complex mechanism of zzso might explain the low levels of viral resistance to these zzso as compared with other zzso zzso
