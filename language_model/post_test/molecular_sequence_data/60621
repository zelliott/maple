When cells exit from zzso cell division, their sister zzso lose cohesion and separate to opposite poles of the dividing cell, resulting in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso segregation of the first stage of zzso cell division zzso I) requires that sister zzso remain associated through their zzso and move together to the same zzso zzso cohesion is lost as cells exit from zzso II and sister zzso can then zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is specific to and required for zzso Here we show that zzso appears in the zzso and adjacent zzso arms during the zzso S zzso zzso zzso persists throughout zzso I and disappears at zzso of zzso zzso When the zzso gene is deleted, sister zzso separate at zzso I, resulting in zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso We propose that the persistence of zzso at zzso during zzso I maintains zzso cohesion, and that its presence in the zzso regions zzso the zzso so that sister zzso move to the same zzso This results in the zzso pattern of zzso segregation necessary to reduce a zzso zzso to zzso zzso
