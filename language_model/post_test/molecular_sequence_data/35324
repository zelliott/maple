We present an zzso web platform zzso to identify zzso and on the fly zzso zzso of the zzso expressed zzso in control as well as treated zzso The zzso zzso is not restricted only to zzso sequence zzso from animals and potentially analyzes a wider zzso for plants, animals and viral zzso zzso supporting zzso zzso 19 supporting 193 zzso The platform can handle the bloated amount of the read counts and reports the zzso zzso from plant, animal and viral zzso zzso zzso also provides an zzso of the the zzso of zzso with higher copy number relative to their mature reference sequences zzso in zzso zzso 19 supporting 193 zzso zzso enhanced zzso potentially display zzso expressed zzso which will help the user to demonstrate and correlate the abundance of the zzso as a signature event to the specific zzso An additional module for zzso the differential expression has been implemented allowing the users to zzso the differential expression across the user input zzso The developed zzso can be zzso at zzso
