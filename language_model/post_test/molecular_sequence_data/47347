The presence or evolution of immune escape zzso has been proposed to account for the failure of zzso envelope vaccines to protect zzso against challenge with zzso zzso virus zzso To address this issue, two groups of three zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso vaccines using two different vaccine zzso One group of zzso received four injections of zzso zzso zzso in zzso containing zzso zzso zzso as zzso A second group were primed twice with zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso and then zzso twice with zzso zzso zzso Both vaccine schedules zzso zzso zzso to zzso However, on the day of challenge, zzso of zzso zzso measured by zzso were higher in zzso primed with zzso zzso zzso Following intravenous challenge with 10 monkey infectious doses of the zzso zzso challenge stock, five of the six zzso zzso and all four zzso controls became zzso The virus burdens in zzso of zzso that were primed with zzso zzso virus were lower than those of zzso controls, as determined by virus zzso and quantitative DNA zzso zzso analysis was performed on zzso zzso amplified from the blood of zzso and zzso infected zzso No variation of zzso zzso sequence was observed, even in zzso with a reduced virus load, suggesting that the appearance of immune escape zzso does not account for the incomplete protection zzso In addition, this study indicates that the measurement of serum zzso zzso may not provide a useful correlate for protection zzso by zzso envelope zzso
