The zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are regulated by zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso complex contains 11 identical zzso arranged in a zzso structure termed the zzso The zzso zzso is regulated by an zzso mechanism in which zzso zzso binds to 11 zzso repeats in the zzso leader zzso zzso binding blocks formation of an zzso structure, thereby promoting the formation of an overlapping zzso resulting in zzso termination preceding the structural zzso When zzso is not zzso it is unable to bind to the transcript, which allows zzso formation and, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is also responsible for regulating translation of zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso transcripts promotes zzso of the zzso such that the zzso zzso sequence is zzso in a zzso thus zzso zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso binds to nine repeats that overlap the zzso site, thereby blocking zzso
