zzso linkage studies have provided significant evidence that a major gene zzso zzso for familial zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso is located at zzso zzso between the short tandem repeat zzso markers zzso and zzso defining a genetic size of zzso zzso for the zzso candidate zzso We constructed a physical map of the zzso region using zzso artificial zzso zzso selected from both the zzso and zzso zzso libraries using the zzso linked zzso markers as well as new zzso sites zzso designed based on zzso terminal zzso The zzso map is zzso in the region between zzso and zzso a region of zzso zzso and has an estimated physical size of zzso zzso The zzso zzso map was used as a framework to zzso three known zzso a zzso and two brain expressed sequence tags zzso zzso analysis studies in two Belgian zzso 14 zzso families zzso and zzso identified zzso zzso in family zzso with zzso and zzso reducing the genetic size of the candidate zzso region zzso The minimal zzso candidate region measured zzso zzso on the genetic map and is contained within six overlapping zzso zzso that covered a physical distance estimated between 2 and 6 zzso These zzso as well as other zzso in the zzso zzso map are valuable resources in gene cloning efforts or zzso sequencing experiments aiming at zzso the zzso zzso
