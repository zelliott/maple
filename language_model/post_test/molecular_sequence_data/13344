A human zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from an zzso zzso zzso We report the zzso and predicted zzso acid sequence of the human zzso which possesses zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with mouse and rat zzso zzso zzso Acting on zzso zzso zzso injected with zzso transcripts of the zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso inwardly directed current responses that displayed zzso Such currents were blocked in a zzso manner by selective and zzso zzso zzso zzso but were unaffected by compounds acting at G zzso zzso zzso A quantitative comparison of the pharmacological profiles of human and mouse zzso zzso zzso complexes revealed differences in the zzso of some zzso or zzso compounds tested, the most dramatic example being zzso which demonstrated an approximately zzso zzso in zzso zzso In view of the small number of sequence zzso that occur between the human and mouse zzso of the zzso in the zzso located zzso domain, compounds such as zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso may prove to be valuable in locating zzso acid zzso that contribute to the zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso Also, when zzso differences are taken into account, the present study suggests that a zzso assembly of human zzso zzso can account for the distinctive zzso binding properties of human zzso receptors established in zzso brain zzso
