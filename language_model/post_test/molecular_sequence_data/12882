The zzso acid sequence zzso by the zzso region of zzso B virus zzso is expressed on the surface of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region is involved in the recognition of specific receptors responsible for the attachment of zzso to the host zzso The cell zzso binding site was assigned to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to obtain a large quantity of zzso binding zzso of zzso the expression zzso zzso was zzso It contains four zzso joined DNA zzso each coding for zzso zzso zzso fused with the 3' end of a DNA zzso coding for 450 zzso of zzso zzso coli cells transformed with this zzso produce fusion protein zzso in the form of inclusion zzso zzso to the specific zzso zzso the zzso domain was zzso from the fusion zzso The resulting product, a 16 zzso zzso was isolated and zzso by zzso exchange zzso The presence of four zzso bonds in this sequence and the primary structure of the first 28 zzso zzso acids were zzso Following the confirmation of the zzso properties, the zzso zzso protein was used for detection of the zzso response in zzso from zzso infected zzso
