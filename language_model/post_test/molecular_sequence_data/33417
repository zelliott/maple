zzso zzso zzso infection is known to be associated with the development of zzso zzso gastric cancer and gastric zzso Currently, the bacterial factors of zzso zzso are reported to be important in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso is the best studied zzso factor of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein contains a highly zzso zzso zzso repeat region in the zzso This repeat region is reported to be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso The segments containing zzso motifs have been designated as segments A, B, C, and zzso however the zzso and disease relation are still zzso This study used zzso unique zzso sequences containing zzso zzso motifs collected from public resources, including zzso Western and zzso East Asian strains with clinical data obtained from 433 zzso Fifteen types of zzso or zzso sequences are zzso In addition to four previously reported major segment types, several minor segment types zzso segment zzso zzso and more than 30 sequence types zzso ABC, zzso were defined using our zzso zzso We confirm that the sequences from Western and East Asian strains contain segment C and D, zzso We also confirm that strains with two zzso segment C have a greater chance of developing gastric cancer than those with one segment zzso Our results shed light on the relationships between the types of zzso the country of origin of each sequence type, and the frequency of gastric zzso
