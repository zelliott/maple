The small zzso is the main zzso place of peptides and free zzso acids in zzso The zzso acid zzso system zzso mediates zzso zzso of basic zzso zzso especially zzso zzso and zzso The aim of the current study was to clone Tibetan zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso for comparing the sequences of Tibetan and common zzso zzso zzso and investigating the tissue distribution and zzso expression in the small zzso of Tibetan zzso zzso The Tibetan zzso zzso gene was first cloned from the zzso small zzso and found to zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso The entire open reading frame zzso of the zzso is zzso zzso and codes for zzso zzso acid zzso with a higher degree of sequence similarity with common pig zzso and horse counterparts zzso than with monkey zzso or human zzso The deduced protein has 12 putative zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso was detected in brain, zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, liver, lung and muscle from Tibetan pigs at 7 and 21 days by zzso We also investigated the zzso expression of zzso in Tibetan zzso zzso in zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and kidney from day 1 to zzso The abundance of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was highest and zzso zzso zzso patterns were similar in zzso and anterior zzso where the zzso level was decreased before the zzso period and increased until day zzso zzso zzso expression was increasing steadily with age, except on day zzso The zzso has the highest expression at day 14 and became steady after day zzso The zzso abundance in the kidney is opposite to zzso increasing until day 14 and reducing zzso Our results showed the pattern of zzso expressed in small zzso of Tibetan pig and lay the foundation for in depth investigations of the regulation of zzso in zzso
