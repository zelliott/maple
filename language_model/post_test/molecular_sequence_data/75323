zzso airway zzso cells requires vitamin A or its synthetic chemicals zzso for their survival and for the expression of normal zzso zzso By using molecular zzso we have shown that one of the effects of zzso on cultured human zzso zzso zzso cells is the enhancement (from zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso analysis has shown that clone zzso which was identified by differential zzso procedures, contained a zzso insert which zzso a protein closely resembling zzso zzso factor zzso alpha from brine shrimp and completely identical to the published sequence of human zzso factor zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso Van zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso to zzso from zzso zzso plant zzso and zzso coli are also zzso A single zzso band at zzso bases was observed for both zzso and zzso zzso cells, and for mouse liver and zzso zzso when Northern transfer from zzso zzso gel was zzso with a zzso zzso zzso An enhanced zzso acid incorporation and increased protein content per cell for zzso cells grown in the presence of zzso were zzso zzso presented by these studies indicate that zzso may regulate the zzso of a factor required for zzso
