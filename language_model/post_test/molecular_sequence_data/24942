zzso zinc finger proteins offer a stable and versatile framework for the design of proteins that recognize desired target sites on zzso zzso Individual fingers from these proteins have a simple beta beta alpha structure that folds around a central zinc zzso and tandem sets of fingers can contact neighboring zzso of zzso base pairs along the major groove of the zzso Although there is no simple, general code for zinc zzso recognition, selection strategies have been developed that allow these proteins to be targeted to almost any desired site on zzso zzso The affinity and specificity of these new proteins can also be improved by linking more fingers together or by designing proteins that bind as zzso and thus recognize an extended zzso These new proteins can then be modified by adding other zzso zzso or repression of transcription, for DNA zzso or for other zzso Such designer zzso factors and other new proteins will have important applications in biomedical research and in gene zzso
