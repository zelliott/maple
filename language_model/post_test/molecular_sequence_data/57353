When cells are infected by zzso zzso virus zzso zzso the zzso frequency is zzso To find which functions of the virus are responsible for this, a variety of viral strains and one zzso of viral DNA were tested in a zzso zzso zzso was dependent on the binding of the virus to the cell surface and zzso of the virus zzso but expression of virus genes was not zzso Since this implied that zzso was a result of the exposure of the interior of the cell to an internal structural component of the virus, the role of two likely components was zzso The zzso function of the virus was not required for zzso However, a zzso of DNA from within the minimum transforming region of zzso that encodes a possible zzso protein was zzso when expressed from a zzso expression zzso The zzso product of this DNA zzso is therefore a candidate for a transforming protein of zzso and is the only protein currently suggested to be responsible for that zzso
