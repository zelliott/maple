The essential zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso III interacts with zzso a component of zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the initiation step of zzso The protein sequence of zzso zzso by zzso is zzso from zzso to zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso (named zzso are known to be involved in a signal zzso zzso related to G zzso zzso not in zzso In the present work, we first establish that human zzso is the genuine zzso of zzso zzso was found to functionally replace zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Pol III contained zzso and had a decreased specific activity but initiated zzso Furthermore, zzso was identified by mass zzso in a highly zzso human Pol III zzso These results suggest that zzso has a dual function in zzso Next, we demonstrate by genetic and zzso approaches that zzso forms with zzso zzso by zzso a zzso akin to zzso in Pol zzso zzso and zzso were found to interact genetically in suppression screens and physically in zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis and molecular modeling indicated that the zzso zzso likely adopts a structure similar to that of the zzso zzso counterpart of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso appear to have evolved to meet the distinct requirements of the multiple forms of zzso zzso
