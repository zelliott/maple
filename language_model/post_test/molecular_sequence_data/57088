In this study, the minimal promoter requirements of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso gene promoter are zzso The zzso promoter is characterized by a short zzso zzso and a long zzso stretch zzso Two major zzso initiation sites, zzso zzso initiation site I zzso I, zzso and zzso zzso initiation site II zzso II, zzso are located in a zzso pair region zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso zzso zzso van der zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso promoter deletion and zzso zzso followed by zzso isolation and zzso zzso protection analysis showed that the process of zzso initiation through zzso I and zzso II is regulated by different promoter zzso The zzso directed initiation from zzso II but did not affect zzso I zzso which is dependent upon sequences between positions -5 and zzso Band shift analysis identified the zzso factor zzso as the protein interacting with the zzso A single zzso binding sequence was found to be present in the zzso zzso analysis confirmed the interaction of zzso with this zzso The differential initiation through zzso I and zzso II was substantiated by the introduction of point zzso in the zzso binding zzso only zzso that specifically abolished zzso binding zzso with zzso II zzso but all zzso left zzso I initiation zzso
