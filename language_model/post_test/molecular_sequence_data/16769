I have used indirect zzso with overlapping synthetic peptides representing the zzso zzso to study the generation and specificity of zzso zzso in pigs that were infected in zzso with zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso strain zzso and in North American field zzso submitted for zzso infection zzso zzso zzso appeared in zzso of the zzso pigs within about 30 days zzso zzso reaching maximum zzso zzso zzso and then decreasing slowly to about half of maximum zzso by about 400 zzso The formation of zzso zzso and of virus zzso zzso correlated and their initial appearance coincided with disappearance of virus from the zzso The zzso were specific for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso appeared within 7 zzso reached maximum levels at about 100 zzso and had decreased below zzso levels by about 200 zzso zzso field serum samples with virus zzso activity all possessed high levels of zzso binding zzso but the zzso bound about equally to zzso and strain zzso virus zzso zzso The indirect zzso results using various large peptides and competition zzso using small peptides (8 or 9 zzso acids zzso confirmed that the zzso recognized by the zzso is located in the zzso zzso sequence zzso of zzso Use of zzso peptides in the competition zzso showed that zzso to T and zzso to zzso zzso blocked zzso recognition, whereas deletion of zzso had no zzso In addition, 26 serum samples submitted by two farms for diagnostic tests were found to possess low levels of zzso that bound to zzso zzso zzso even though the zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso and lacked zzso zzso Competition zzso showed that the zzso recognized one or more zzso located downstream of the zzso zzso zzso An zzso located in the same area was recognized by zzso generated in mice by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso These zzso also lacked zzso zzso
