The initiation of reverse zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso requires cellular zzso as a primer and occurs at a site in the viral zzso zzso designated as the primer binding site zzso which is complementary to the zzso 18 zzso of zzso We previously described an zzso virus zzso as zzso which contained a sequence within the zzso region complementary to the zzso region of zzso in addition to a PBS complementary to the zzso 18 zzso of the zzso That virus maintained a PBS complementary to zzso after extended in zzso culture zzso et zzso zzso zzso 70, zzso zzso In the present study, we report that zzso a zzso DNA zzso encompassing the zzso and PBS regions from an integrated zzso of zzso back into the zzso zzso zzso resulted in an infectious virus, designated as zzso which again zzso maintained a PBS complementary to zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso region revealed only three zzso changes from zzso a zzso change at zzso zzso a zzso change at zzso zzso and a zzso change at zzso zzso The new zzso virus zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells similarly to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso gene of the zzso and zzso zzso virus revealed no zzso Although we found numerous zzso in the reverse zzso gene in zzso clones derived from zzso zzso no common zzso were found among the 13 clones zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso with those of the wild type revealed that both viruses incorporated a similar subset of cellular zzso with zzso being the zzso zzso found within zzso There was no selective enrichment for zzso within zzso of zzso virus which selectively use zzso to initiate reverse zzso The results of these studies suggest that the zzso and PBS regions in the viral zzso zzso are important zzso for zzso viruses in the selective use of zzso to initiate reverse zzso
