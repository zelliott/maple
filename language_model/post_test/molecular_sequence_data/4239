zzso is a zzso membrane zzso that promotes the attachment and zzso outgrowth of cultured zzso zzso zzso The zzso adhesive properties of zzso and its zzso at sites of zzso suggest that it may be involved in regulation of zzso formation or zzso zzso is expressed in zzso of zzso throughout the zzso By cloning the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have discovered that this zzso is a member of a family of zzso proteins and is identical to the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of two alternatively spliced forms of zzso and describe its zzso within the zzso by in zzso zzso
