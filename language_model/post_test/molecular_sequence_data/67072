The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in human disease, is the therapeutic target of zzso zzso and is clearly involved in zzso blood pressure zzso zzso belongs to an zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso that has two major branches with inverse zzso functions and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that mediate cellular zzso influx are activated by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso that mediate cellular zzso zzso are activated by zzso A cluster of three zzso zzso at the zzso domain has been implicated in the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso cell volume, zzso and zzso zzso Nothing is known, however, about zzso regulatory zzso By using zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso here we show that two independent zzso zzso strategies increased zzso activity by zzso The effect of both strategies was synergistic and zzso zzso zzso of enhanced green fluorescent zzso zzso showed no changes in zzso cell surface zzso whereas zzso analysis, using the zzso revealed increased zzso of zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso together with zzso zzso zzso completely prevented zzso response to zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is activated by a mechanism that involves zzso domain zzso
