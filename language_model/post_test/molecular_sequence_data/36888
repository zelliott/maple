The zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 DNA zzso involved in zzso viral DNA zzso contains several zzso acid consensus sequences common to other zzso DNA zzso Using zzso zzso we have studied the functional significance of a zzso zzso region, represented by the zzso zzso zzso Single point zzso have been constructed and the corresponding proteins have been zzso and zzso zzso of the activity of the zzso proteins indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso play a critical role in DNA zzso Interestingly, substitution of the zzso zzso either by zzso or zzso produced zzso with an increased or a largely reduced, respectively, capability to use a protein as zzso an intrinsic property of zzso DNA zzso On the other hand, the viral protein zzso which stimulates initiation of zzso 29 DNA replication by formation of a zzso complex at both DNA replication origins, increased (about zzso the zzso zzso of zzso 29 DNA zzso during the formation of the zzso initiation zzso We propose a model in which the special strategy to maintain the integrity of the zzso 29 DNA ends, by means of a zzso zzso could also contribute to increase the zzso of zzso 29 DNA zzso
