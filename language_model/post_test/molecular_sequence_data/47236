We report here the characterization and the molecular analysis of the two high affinity zzso that mediate the transport of zzso zzso and zzso zzso across the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso cells unable to use zzso as a sulfur source were first isolated and demonstrated to lack high affinity zzso transport zzso zzso zzso cloning allowed us to identify the corresponding gene zzso which encodes an integral membrane protein zzso 12 putative membrane spanning regions and belonging to the zzso acid zzso zzso Among zzso acid zzso members, the closest relative of zzso is zzso by the zzso open reading zzso zzso of zzso was shown to specifically lead to cells unable to use zzso as a sulfur zzso zzso transport zzso demonstrated that zzso disruption zzso impaired the high affinity zzso zzso and zzso was therefore renamed zzso Further study of zzso and zzso zzso cells showed that in addition to high affinity zzso both zzso compounds are transported into zzso cells by low affinity transport systems that appear to be zzso zzso
