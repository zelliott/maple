The zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been zzso Its three-dimensional structure was determined at zzso A resolution (1 A zzso zzso zzso A comparison with the structure of the zzso zzso from zzso coli as well as with the sequences of other related zzso showed that there are regions of appreciable sequence and structure zzso despite close overall zzso The zzso structure was analyzed with a bound zzso as well as without zzso zzso binding had a negligible effect on the zzso zzso It binds at the pore zzso assuming a zzso close to the natural zzso zzso
