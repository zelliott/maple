We have investigated the relationship between zzso in solution and DNA binding for the bacterial zzso protein zzso This was done by comparing zzso and DNA binding of zzso with that of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The double zzso zzso zzso that makes the zzso significantly more zzso leads to a dramatically enhanced and strongly zzso zzso zzso in solution, as detected by dynamic light zzso The DNA binding affinity of zzso zzso for the zzso promoter region is lower and has stronger temperature dependence than that of zzso zzso I zzso experiments show that at high zzso regions protected by zzso zzso are larger and less defined than for zzso In zzso zzso zzso show that the enhanced protection also leads to enhanced zzso zzso Whereas the lower affinity of the zzso zzso for DNA could be caused by competition between zzso in solution and zzso on DNA, the larger size of protected regions clearly confirms the notion that cooperative binding of zzso to DNA is related to zzso zzso These results emphasize the relative contributions of zzso interactions and zzso zzso in the control of gene repression operated by zzso
