We isolated and characterized two related zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene contained 18 repeats of the zzso zzso zzso unit arranged in zzso This gene was localized to a minor heat shock puff site, zzso and it zzso a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso whose level was induced zzso by heat zzso To investigate the pattern of expression of the zzso gene in developing animals, a zzso fusion gene was introduced into the zzso zzso by germ line zzso The fusion gene was expressed at high levels in a zzso manner at all life stages zzso The zzso zzso zzso consisted of one zzso unit directly zzso in frame, to a zzso tail zzso The zzso acid sequence of the tail portion of the protein had zzso zzso identity with that of zzso zzso zzso including a region that contained a potential zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso to a zzso zzso that was zzso zzso and in contrast to the zzso zzso it was not zzso by heat zzso
