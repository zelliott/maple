zzso is a zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso Two zzso elements have been cloned and zzso The complete zzso sequence for one element, zzso was reported previously zzso zzso Hansen, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this element is incapable of autonomous zzso The complete DNA sequence of a zzso competent zzso element, zzso is presented zzso Its sequence translates into two overlapping open reading zzso zzso and zzso which zzso proteins with zzso to the proteins specified by the zzso gag and pol zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence to zzso suggests that the zzso open reading frame of zzso is truncated by the deletion of a single zzso which causes a zzso zzso Restoration of the reading frame with zzso of a single zzso by zzso zzso converted zzso into a zzso active element, zzso zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso made against synthetic peptides identified zzso zzso proteins in zzso particle preparations from cells expressing zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso and zzso zzso produce zzso proteins with approximate molecular masses of 61 and 58 zzso zzso while cells expressing zzso produce zzso proteins of approximately 52 and 49 zzso Together, these data show that the zzso or zzso zzso or both, provides the zzso function of zzso
