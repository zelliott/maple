zzso P zzso zzso an zzso zzso that resembles the zzso stem and zzso structure of its natural zzso zzso When zzso linked with a guide zzso the zzso can function as a zzso zzso and cleave any target zzso sequences that base pair with the guide zzso Using a zzso ultraviolet zzso zzso approach, we have mapped the regions of the zzso that are in close proximity to a zzso that contains the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso virus zzso Our data suggest that the zzso site of the zzso zzso is positioned at the same regions of the zzso that bind to the zzso site of a zzso The zzso zzso include regions that interact with the zzso stem and zzso and in addition, regions that are unique and not in close contact with a zzso Identification of the zzso site provides a foundation to study how zzso P zzso achieve their sequence specificity and zzso the development of zzso zzso
