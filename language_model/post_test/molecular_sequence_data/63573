DNA sequence analysis of five zzso plasmids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that they share a considerable portion of their zzso and allowed us to define the zzso zzso Among these zzso the backbone is stable and seems to have zzso recently, since the overall identity among its members is higher than zzso The only gene in which significant variation was observed was zzso the changes in the coding sequence correlated with parallel changes in the corresponding zzso binding sites at zzso suggesting a functional connection between both sets of zzso The present zzso zzso diversity is shaped by the acquisition of zzso resistance genes as a consequence of the pressure exerted by zzso zzso zzso comparisons zzso the zzso events that differentiated the five plasmids zzso Of greatest interest is that a single acquisition of a class I zzso platform, into which different gene zzso were later zzso gave rise to plasmids zzso zzso and zzso while plasmids zzso and zzso do not contain the zzso platform and arose in the zzso world because of the zzso of several zzso resistance zzso
