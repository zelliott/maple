zzso gestation rat zzso zzso a number of proteins related to zzso including rat zzso zzso II zzso rat zzso protein A zzso and rat zzso protein B zzso This study identifies a new family of proteins zzso and zzso by gestation day 15 zzso zzso which exhibit zzso acid zzso to growth hormone precursors from several zzso zzso zzso medium was zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and analyzed by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso to isolate four distinct proteins with Mr values of zzso zzso 25,000 and 30,000 and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These proteins represent a major fraction of zzso proteins with Mr in the 20,000 to 30,000 zzso zzso analysis showed that none of the four proteins zzso with zzso zzso against zzso zzso or zzso These proteins were zzso transferred from two-dimensional zzso gels onto an zzso zzso membrane and zzso zzso acid zzso carried out with a gas phase zzso zzso sequences of 45, 37, 37 and 32 zzso acid zzso were identified for proteins 1, 2, 3 and 4, zzso The four proteins exhibit zzso to zzso zzso Computer analysis further revealed a zzso identity in a 32 zzso acid overlap which begins at zzso 14 of the 28,000 Mr protein zzso 1) and at zzso 31 of growth hormone precursors of zzso mouse and zzso The 32 zzso acid overlap is zzso zzso if conservative zzso acid replacements are zzso
