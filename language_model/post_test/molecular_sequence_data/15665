zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso early zzso severe functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the nerve zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso were reported in five zzso 

To characterize a novel zzso in zzso and describe the related zzso 

A 20-year-old woman born of healthy zzso parents and affected with zzso zzso muscular zzso underwent standard clinical, zzso and zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso was performed by direct sequencing of zzso zzso zzso analysis was done by reverse zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

The zzso disclosed a moderately zzso scarcely progressive zzso markedly slowed nerve zzso zzso and a zzso zzso characterized by prominent zzso zzso zzso analysis disclosed a zzso transition in the zzso site of zzso 14, which was predicted to cause a truncated zzso zzso 

The report confirms genetic zzso of zzso demonstrates that zzso has variable functional zzso and suggests that zzso plays a crucial role during zzso zzso
