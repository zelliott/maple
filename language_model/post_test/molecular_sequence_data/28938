zzso ray zzso in zzso zzso requires active cellular interaction regulated by multiple genetic zzso We report here the cloning of one of these zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is made exclusively in the zzso and resides in the zzso zzso Whereas the zzso domain of zzso displays a zzso activity in zzso mapping of zzso in different zzso zzso and functional analysis of deletion zzso reveal that both this zzso activity and zzso zzso are essential for determining body shape and ray zzso Based on the abnormal features in both the expressing and zzso ray cells, we propose that the zzso is required in the zzso for modification of its zzso In turn, ray cell interaction and the whole zzso process can be modulated by these zzso zzso
