zzso zzso is a zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein family, which plays key roles in zzso gene regulation by controlling zzso translation, stability and zzso zzso has been shown to regulate zzso expression in the central nervous system, but little is known about its roles in other zzso zzso proteins function as zzso and bind to zzso zzso zzso however, the structural and functional roles of zzso and zzso are still zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain, which adopts a similar stacked zzso arrangement as its zzso zzso zzso line development zzso and zzso zzso protein during zzso zzso but differs by an additional zzso inserted in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interface zzso likely ensures selective zzso by preventing association with zzso zzso family proteins in the zzso zzso that inhibit zzso also significantly impair zzso binding in zzso alter zzso protein levels and impair zzso function in a zzso zzso in zzso Together, our results indicate that a functional zzso zzso domain is required for zzso function in zzso zzso
