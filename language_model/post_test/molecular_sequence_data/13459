The zzso of zzso zzso coronavirus strain zzso differs extensively from that of zzso respiratory strains of zzso zzso The S protein of zzso was characterized as a first step towards identifying viral zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso protein specific zzso revealed that the zzso S protein was zzso zzso The zzso S gene was cloned and zzso It encodes a protein predicted to be zzso zzso acids zzso The presence of several zzso acids changes within and surrounding the predicted zzso site of the zzso S protein may contribute to its inefficient zzso
