The complete zzso of 30 zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso and strains were zzso in this zzso Together with zzso previously reported zzso we analyzed the genetic structure of the zzso zzso zzso of genetic diversity showed that different zzso regions of zzso are under different evolutionary constraints and that there was no significant genetic differentiation between East Asian and North American populations of zzso zzso analyses revealed a significant correlation between zzso of the zzso inclusion zzso gene of zzso and zzso resistance gene 3 zzso zzso of zzso suggesting zzso might be a zzso zzso in zzso disease zzso Interestingly, zzso analyses identified 19 zzso zzso events in the zzso zzso Furthermore, as several zzso strains were identified as zzso it appears that zzso might contribute to overcome host resistance in zzso zzso Our finding suggests that zzso as well as zzso is an important evolutionary process in the genetic diversification of zzso zzso
