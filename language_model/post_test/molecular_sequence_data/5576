zzso of the zzso B virus zzso zzso depends on the large envelope protein zzso which is expressed as a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrated that the zzso exposure of the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of L was required for zzso zzso zzso zzso of L up to zzso 103 were zzso To map sites in the remaining zzso part of zzso important for zzso zzso a series of 11 L zzso with zzso zzso between zzso 98 and Pro zzso was zzso The zzso formed stable proteins and were zzso in zzso cell cultures, probably as components of zzso zzso B surface zzso zzso All four zzso with zzso between zzso 98 and zzso 125 were unable to complement in trans the block in zzso formation of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso These zzso had a zzso negative effect on virus yield in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, all seven zzso with zzso downstream of zzso 124 were able to zzso the zzso and to zzso zzso The sequence between zzso 103 and zzso 124 is highly zzso among different zzso zzso and also between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Point zzso in this region introducing zzso zzso at zzso positions blocked zzso formation, in contrast to zzso at zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso sequence between zzso 103 and zzso 124 has an important function in zzso zzso
