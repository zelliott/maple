Attempts to characterize zzso integral membrane proteins zzso by mass zzso are frequently hindered by several factors including the zzso required for extraction and zzso that interferes with analysis, poor zzso incomplete zzso and limited identification of the zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to examine and develop methods for zzso of an zzso that are amenable to downstream zzso of the protein and zzso analysis by mass zzso In this study, we have zzso a candidate zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso and examined conditions for the efficient affinity zzso zzso zzso and analysis of the zzso Analysis of the intact zzso protein without zzso was performed by zzso mass zzso The zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and the resulting peptides were zzso A method that zzso differential zzso and zzso properties of zzso and zzso peptides was zzso Large zzso peptides were only detected in solutions containing 50% zzso zzso zzso of zzso peptides was suppressed in zzso acid, but they produced a strong signal in 50% zzso zzso percent sequence coverage of the protein was obtained with only one large zzso zzso that remained zzso The results demonstrate a simple method to purify and digest a zzso zzso for analysis by mass zzso
