zzso zzso cancer is an aggressive zzso with a low zzso median zzso zzso improvement on the development of more effective therapies depends in part on the availability of adequate zzso models for in zzso testing of treatment zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells, making it a potential target for immune zzso To create a zzso mouse model for zzso zzso tumors, we generated triple transgenic zzso mice that zzso express human zzso as a zzso and carry the conditional zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of triple zzso zzso mice triggers zzso tumors that, in zzso to human zzso cancer, express strongly elevated zzso zzso The tumors zzso zzso and are accompanied by high serum zzso closely mimicking the human zzso Compared with the zzso mice with tumors, the zzso mice show increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulatory T zzso zzso of zzso mice with type 1 polarized zzso cells zzso loaded with a zzso zzso zzso can circumvent zzso immune suppression in the host, activate multiple immune zzso genes and effectively prolong zzso Our studies report the first human zzso zzso zzso tumor model, reveal novel zzso functions in zzso cancer biology and demonstrate its suitability as a target for zzso zzso
