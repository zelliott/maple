zzso sequence comparison of the L gene of the Malaysian zzso zzso zzso strain zzso with other zzso strains revealed a single zzso zzso at position zzso This zzso is compensated by a zzso deletion downstream at position zzso which results in two forms of the L proteins containing a zzso acid substitution in zzso zzso This zzso zzso does not correlate with the zzso of the viral strains but it may affect the viral replication as zzso V is believed to play an important role in the replication of zzso
