In 2004, field zzso of zzso zzso zzso ex zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso were first found in commercial citrus zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this fungus were also detected in plastic zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Biological and molecular zzso of resistant zzso was conducted in this zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso grew well on zzso plates containing zzso or zzso at 1 zzso zzso supplemented with 1 zzso of zzso zzso an inhibitor of alternative zzso whereas the growth of sensitive zzso was strongly zzso zzso from this in zzso test were in good agreement with those of fungus zzso tests in zzso In resistant zzso the zzso at zzso acid position 143 of the zzso b zzso known to be the cause of high zzso resistance in various zzso zzso was found, but only zzso The zzso of zzso b gene was confirmed, and the zzso sequence often present in the majority of resistant zzso indicating that the proportion of zzso zzso b gene was very zzso 

The conventional zzso and sequence analyses of zzso zzso b gene are insufficient for molecular identification of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
