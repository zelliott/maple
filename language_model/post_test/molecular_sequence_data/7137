zzso zzso and zzso contain a zzso zzso sequence that is absent both from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and from a recently cloned zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso Since this zzso sequence occurs in zzso that are regulated by zzso family zzso but is missing from zzso and zzso activated independently of zzso we sought to investigate the role of this sequence in zzso and zzso regulation and zzso zzso of the zzso sequence from zzso blocked the ability of zzso to associate with members of the zzso family and markedly attenuated zzso of the protein in zzso following growth factor zzso In addition, this sequence was necessary for efficient zzso of zzso in zzso by zzso but zzso for zzso by a novel zzso zzso which we have previously detected in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that a zzso site within the zzso sequence of zzso was required for sustained zzso activity in response to serum stimulation of zzso zzso zzso with this zzso we observed that zzso which lacks a zzso site at the corresponding position, was activated only zzso following serum zzso Finally, we found that deletion of the zzso sequence from a zzso activated zzso zzso rendered the protein zzso in zzso zzso These observations indicate a critical role for the zzso sequence in directing specific zzso interactions important for the zzso zzso and downstream functioning of the zzso
