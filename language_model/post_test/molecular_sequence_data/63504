The human zzso gene encodes a zzso protein with zzso activity that helps import some zzso to the zzso by keeping them in an zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso frequently in zzso tumors, suggesting that it also has a role in the growth of cancer zzso In this context, zzso is a potential target for novel zzso drugs, and it might also be used in the diagnosis of zzso zzso Nuclear respiratory factors zzso play an important role in governing the zzso interactions implicated in zzso zzso Our previous studies revealed that zzso promote the expression of the major members of the zzso transport machinery, zzso and zzso Here we report the existence of binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso region of the human zzso zzso We determined the effects of zzso at these sites on promoter activity in zzso zzso and zzso cells, in conjunction with zzso zzso experiments, zzso mobility shift zzso and in zzso zzso analysis of the promoter zzso We conclude that zzso is the main zzso factor regulating the expression of zzso zzso interacts with zzso to stimulate the zzso full zzso
