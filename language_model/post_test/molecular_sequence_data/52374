We have cloned from a mouse zzso zzso library a mouse zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso which codes for a putative zzso zzso expressed in breast zzso The zzso protein is well zzso between humans and mice, and the pattern of zzso gene expression is similar in both species, and shows expression in the zzso in the zzso and during limb bud zzso We show that the zzso gene can also be expressed in the normal mouse zzso zzso zzso gene expression was not detected during zzso growth, neither in virgin nor in pregnant mice, but was specifically observed during zzso zzso of the zzso an zzso process associated with intense zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found in zzso immediately surrounding degenerative zzso suggesting that zzso gene expression may be associated with the basement membrane zzso which occurs during zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso gene is also specifically expressed in zzso cells surrounding invasive zzso cells of breast zzso we suggest that zzso is implicated in zzso zzso zzso processes common to zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso
