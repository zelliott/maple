zzso of rabbit lung zzso converting zzso zzso by zzso zzso has been shown to be due primarily to the modification of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Riordan, zzso zzso zzso zzso paper in this zzso zzso zzso zzso is also zzso by zzso The specific site of modification has been identified by zzso mapping of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Two principal zzso peaks, not observed with protein modified in the presence of zzso have been zzso zzso acid and sequence analyses show that these peptides contain two distinct zzso that have been selectively zzso The sequence of the major zzso than zzso of the total) modified zzso is zzso with the zzso group on zzso The sequence of the second, minor zzso is zzso with the zzso group on zzso zzso peptides were obtained from zzso rabbit lung zzso These modified zzso acids zzso to zzso 200 and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both peptides are present only in the zzso zzso of lung zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso sensitive, zzso functional active site is located in the zzso half of lung zzso
