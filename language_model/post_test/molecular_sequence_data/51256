zzso zzso syndrome is an acquired condition where zzso express zzso zzso and become susceptible to zzso by the naturally occurring zzso present in normal zzso Early studies had indicated that zzso zzso zzso was the sole zzso zzso zzso but more recently zzso zzso alpha 2, zzso also has been implicated as a zzso zzso zzso However, none of these studies were performed on zzso zzso In this report we examine zzso of zzso A and B zzso from zzso zzso of two affected individuals to establish how zzso and zzso zzso differ from zzso Analysis of zzso composition and treatment with zzso showed that the zzso unit of zzso A was not zzso zzso zzso were obtained by zzso in the presence of zzso sodium zzso The reduced zzso products were zzso by zzso zzso zzso and their structures were investigated by comparison with standards, by zzso zzso and by zzso of known zzso The results show that zzso zzso from both donors contain intact and truncated forms of zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso and zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso alpha zzso usually present in zzso A and zzso The truncated forms include the protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso The presence of intact zzso in the total population of zzso zzso was confirmed by their zzso to T zzso after treatment with zzso The proportion of the four species was not identical in zzso of these two donors but, in both, the truncated units predominated and the amount of the zzso was approximately one half of that of the zzso The data are consistent with zzso in zzso beta zzso zzso that may have multiple molecular origins and with induction of a specific zzso protein alpha zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso precursor zzso The molecular basis for these zzso awaits further zzso
