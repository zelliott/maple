zzso of zzso virus is initiated at the 3' end of the zzso zzso An zzso repeat sequence of 12 zzso that is capable of forming a zzso structure is located at the 3' end of the zzso 59 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso We screened the zzso region of the 3' end of the virus, including the zzso structure, for its ability to bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of three zzso proteins with relative molecular masses zzso of 61, 63 and 68 zzso to the zzso structure was observed by zzso zzso zzso zzso the stem structure by removal of specific bases abolished the binding zzso The binding of the host proteins is greatly increased after infection and zzso with the appearance of negative strand zzso zzso The increase in binding is dependent on new protein zzso The amount of the zzso protein that binds varies in zzso cells and is zzso in cells that are in the stationary phase of zzso All binding activity could be zzso by alkaline zzso treatment of cell zzso A possible role of these host proteins in the replication of zzso virus is zzso
