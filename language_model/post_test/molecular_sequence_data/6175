It has been shown that the protein zzso zzso type 2A alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso consisting of a zzso substitution for zzso at zzso in the zzso acid resistant zzso of zzso cells, and that the zzso protein is resistant to zzso acid zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 91, zzso zzso In this study we analyzed zzso acid responsive sequences in zzso alpha by introducing a zzso at around zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso alpha proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso were resistant to zzso acid, with zzso of 10, 24, 20 and 10 zzso respectively, as opposed to the zzso wild zzso alpha protein which had an zzso of zzso zzso This observation suggests that not only zzso at zzso but also other zzso zzso zzso between zzso are necessary for the high sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso
