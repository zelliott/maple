Based on the prediction that zzso zzso zzso may contain the zzso domain, we examined the zzso patterns of five zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Mass zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso showed increased modifications in all zzso except zzso zzso zzso was used to unequivocally differentiate zzso from zzso in various zzso zzso The relative abundance of specific fragments indicated that zzso zzso and zzso accumulate in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas both zzso zzso and zzso accumulate in zzso and zzso zzso zzso performed with strains zzso the zzso proteins yielded changes in zzso patterns that were the reverse of those obtained in the complementary zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso domain of zzso specifically zzso zzso primarily and zzso zzso zzso of zzso generated a growth zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso in addition to zzso our results identified three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and their sites of action in budding zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the methodology described here will be useful for identifying zzso zzso and their target sites in other zzso
