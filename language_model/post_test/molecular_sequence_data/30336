We established a pancreatic zzso cell line zzso from a patient with zzso zzso zzso and assessed some of its zzso The cells show zzso zzso and express zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of pancreatic duct zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso and zzso protein zzso and the zzso properties of single zzso channels in zzso are similar to those of airway and sweat zzso primary cultures and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso transport and single zzso channel activity was zzso by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The cells express the zzso gene and manifest the most common zzso zzso deletion of three zzso resulting in a zzso zzso These properties have been stable through greater than 80 passages (24 zzso suggesting that zzso can serve as a continuous cell line that displays the zzso zzso
