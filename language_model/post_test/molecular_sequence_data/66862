A full-length zzso clone of olive zzso virus 1 zzso a member of the zzso zzso family zzso was subjected to zzso zzso and coat protein gene zzso were zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by deleting the zzso in position zzso thus inducing a zzso and replacing the last 49 zzso acids of the viral coat protein zzso by a shorter sequence of 39 zzso zzso This zzso was viable, stable, able to zzso a smaller zzso and able to give rise to the formation of apparently intact virus zzso zzso movement of zzso in zzso zzso leaves was not affected, but, contrary to wild type zzso it failed to spread zzso These results indicate that zzso formation is necessary but not sufficient for long-distance movement for zzso and highlights the role of the zzso zzso domain in systemic zzso
