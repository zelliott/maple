The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to occupy a zzso zzso region on each zzso but the experimental demonstration of its zzso relationship remains zzso By functional zzso zzso we report that the zzso specifically the zzso region within the zzso of zzso is essential in zzso zzso Our studies also indicate that the zzso specific zzso zzso of the zzso region are required for zzso targeting and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is not found to complement zzso (the zzso zzso of zzso We also report the identification of zzso another component of the inner zzso protein complex and its association with zzso These studies thus delineate the structural zzso of zzso
