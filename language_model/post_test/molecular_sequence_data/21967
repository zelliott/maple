zzso zzso zzso channels provide a mechanism for the perception of mechanical stimuli such as sound, touch, and zzso zzso The bacterial zzso zzso channel zzso opens in response to increased membrane tension and serves to protect against cellular zzso during zzso zzso zzso proteins are found widely in bacterial and zzso species and have also been identified in zzso zzso and zzso None of the zzso members of the family have yet been zzso 

Here, we characterize two zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can rescue the zzso sensitivity of a bacterial zzso lacking zzso activity, suggesting that it functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso plants harboring zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso show abnormalities in the size and shape of zzso which are zzso zzso zzso responsible for photosynthesis, gravity perception, and numerous zzso zzso zzso and zzso are localized to discrete zzso on the zzso envelope and zzso with the zzso division protein zzso 

Our data support a model wherein zzso and zzso control zzso size, shape, and perhaps division during normal plant development by altering zzso flux in response to changes in membrane zzso We propose that zzso family members have evolved new roles in plants since the zzso event that gave rise to zzso
