A new species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is described from the brain and internal zzso of cultured red snapper zzso zzso from zzso The fish, 260 to 390 g in weight, exhibited anorexia and poor appetite and swam in the surface water during zzso zzso mortality was about zzso during a period of 3 zzso The red snapper exhibited numerous zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter, in the eye, swim zzso muscle and other internal zzso but especially in the zzso The number of zzso per infected fish was not correlated with fish size or zzso zzso spores were zzso in zzso view and zzso in side view, measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The 4 valves were equal in size, each with 1 polar zzso Polar capsules were zzso in shape, measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso in length and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso inflammatory responses or zzso of host tissue were associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The junction of shell valves appeared as zzso straight zzso The polar filament formed 2 to 3 zzso A general zzso zzso chain zzso primer for zzso amplified the small zzso zzso zzso zzso and the amplified gene was zzso It was evident from the zzso tree that the 3 strains tested, zzso zzso and zzso were identical and belonged to the zzso SS zzso zzso The evolutionary tree showed that these strains form a unique zzso at a distance from other zzso species and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the SS zzso properties of the zzso were also essentially identical and served to distinguish them from representative zzso It is, therefore, proposed that the strains isolated from the diseased red snapper be assigned to a new zzso
