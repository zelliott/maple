zzso muscle development requires the coordinated expression of genes involved in zzso formation and zzso as well as genes that determine muscle zzso However, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control the early stages of muscle zzso To explore this facet of zzso we performed a genetic screen for regulators of zzso muscle zzso in zzso and identified the putative zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso muscle precursors within the muscle lineage and controls two genetically zzso events: zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso fail to zzso in zzso zzso zzso even though the known regulators of zzso muscle zzso target recognition and muscle attachment are expressed zzso In addition, a majority of zzso zzso including zzso Heavy zzso zzso and zzso require zzso for their zzso A transgenic zzso construct that contains the zzso zzso promoter and a spliced open reading frame zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso demonstrating the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso but not in transcription, of muscle structural zzso In addition, the human zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle defects in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso skeletal muscle zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso regulator of muscle zzso and structural gene zzso
