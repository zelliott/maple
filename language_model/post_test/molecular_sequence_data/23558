zzso sodium channels zzso at high density in zzso initial segments and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso channels consist of a zzso alpha zzso and at least one beta zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of cell zzso molecules and interacts zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso In this study, we characterized zzso interactions with zzso and zzso in greater detail and investigated interactions of zzso with zzso zzso and sodium channel zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso fusion proteins and zzso techniques, we show that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso also interacts with zzso zzso sodium channel zzso and zzso but not with sodium channel zzso The interaction of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso requires the region zzso located in the zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso results in increased zzso cell surface density over alpha alone, similar to that shown previously for zzso and zzso We propose that zzso is the critical communication link between sodium channels, zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso
