The zzso and zzso proteins form a highly specific zzso regulatory system that controls the expression of genes involved in the degradation of zzso zzso and zzso via the zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso are transcribed from a single promoter called zzso once the response regulator zzso is zzso by the zzso sensor zzso in response to zzso zzso We show here that zzso is a zzso in solution and that it binds to three specific sites in the zzso promoter, centered at zzso zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso start zzso The zzso and zzso sites are zzso whereas the zzso site is half a zzso zzso binding to its target sites is zzso as shown by zzso mobility gel shift zzso and zzso The binding affinity values of zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso sites, respectively, and the binding zzso is one zzso per zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that all three sites contribute to zzso strength, although the most relevant site is the zzso one with respect to the zzso extended element of the downstream promoter zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso a truncated zzso of zzso that contains the zzso half of the protein bearing the DNA binding domain, binds in zzso to all three sites with affinity similar to that of the full-length zzso However, zzso in contrast to the full-length regulator, does not activate in zzso zzso from zzso We discuss the consequences of the organization of the binding sites on zzso control and propose that the zzso domain of zzso is necessary for appropriate interactions with other zzso zzso
