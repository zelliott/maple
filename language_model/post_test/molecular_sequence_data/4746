zzso zzso involving the zzso heavy chain zzso locus at zzso zzso represent a common mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In multiple myeloma zzso the most consistent zzso zzso is the zzso marker, which originates in one third of cases through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the remaining cases, the identity of the partner zzso has not been well zzso We used a Southern zzso approach based on the linkage analysis of the joining zzso and the constant zzso zzso zzso and gamma regions to detect cases bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso We evaluated DNA of 88 zzso patients with zzso (78 zzso or plasma cell leukemia zzso (10 zzso and found the presence of zzso rearranged zzso fragments (no zzso between the J and C zzso in 21 zzso To confirm this analysis, we cloned the illegitimate rearranged fragments from three samples, and the molecular and fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated the presence of zzso zzso zzso a switch zzso region to sequences from zzso zzso (one zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso on zzso occurred about 14 zzso apart in a zzso region located approximately 50 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso Moreover, Southern zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso detected a zzso in an additional zzso zzso FISH analysis of the zzso zzso cell line, reported to be associated with a zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene was zzso on zzso High levels of zzso zzso expression were observed in the cloned zzso tumors and zzso cell line, but not in the cases that were apparently negative for this zzso Furthermore, a point zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso gene resulting in an zzso acid substitution zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso cell zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso represents a novel, zzso zzso zzso in zzso and suggest that the zzso gene may be the target of this zzso and thus contribute to zzso in zzso
