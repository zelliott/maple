Avian zzso demonstrating in zzso zzso growth, also referred to as the zzso or zzso requirement, have mainly been classified with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso species zzso The aim of the present study was to assess the zzso position of 18 zzso zzso of zzso zzso organisms isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso birds as well as zzso and zzso birds including zzso by conventional zzso tests and zzso zzso gene zzso All zzso shared zzso characteristics which allowed zzso with zzso zzso of bovine red blood cells was zzso zzso zzso was not required for zzso zzso zzso analysis including zzso analysis showed that six zzso were related to the avian zzso zzso group and were classified as zzso according to zzso zzso sequence zzso Surprisingly, the other 12 zzso were unrelated to zzso Two zzso were unrelated to any of the known zzso zzso groups of zzso Two zzso were related to zzso of the avian zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso group and out of these, two zzso were closely related to zzso 14 and 32 of zzso whereas four other zzso were found to form a zzso group zzso related to zzso 40 and one isolate remained zzso related to other members of the zzso zzso One isolate was closely related to zzso 26 (a member of zzso zzso zzso The study documented major genetic diversity among zzso avian zzso beyond the traditional interpretation that they only belong to zzso underlining the limited value of zzso growth for identification of avian members of zzso Our study also emphasized that these organisms will never be isolated without the use of special media satisfying the zzso zzso
