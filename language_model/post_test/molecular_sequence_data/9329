The zzso gene encodes an zzso that zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso plus zzso and has been identified in various marine bacteria and some zzso The diversity of zzso genes was investigated by zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA extracted from 4 zzso zzso in Southern zzso A zzso tree of 144 cloned zzso sequences comprised 7 groups, 3 of which also included zzso genes from previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, most zzso of the zzso sequences from the zzso were in 4 other zzso that did not include sequences from known bacteria, demonstrating a high level of diversity of this gene in these zzso Each zzso contained clones from all of the sample sites, suggesting that different zzso types are widespread in zzso of different geographical zzso Furthermore, it was found the zzso zzso distribution was remarkably influenced by the soil properties zzso available zzso salt, and total zzso
