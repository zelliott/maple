The zzso of zzso zzso zzso I zzso I) from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated at gold and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were proved to be efficient in a temperature range of zzso degrees C, describing a potential window for zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso Search for enhancement of current zzso and zzso stability was achieved by the use of carbon zzso zzso We report high zzso currents for zzso zzso up to 1 zzso zzso 10 times higher than at the bare zzso Interestingly, high stability of the direct zzso process was observed when zzso zzso zzso zzso I into a zzso zzso single walled carbon zzso zzso This suggests a peculiar interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso The parameters that governed the orientation of the zzso before electron transfer were thus investigated using zzso gold zzso No control of the orientation by the charge or the zzso of the interface was zzso This behavior was explained on the basis of a structural comparison between zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso which revealed the absence of zzso zzso and an additional loop in the environment of the zzso zzso cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the effect of zzso on the direct zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso I zzso in a single walled carbon zzso network was zzso No zzso by CO and tolerance toward zzso were zzso zzso of the reasons for such tolerance was undertaken on the basis of structural comparison with zzso from zzso zzso
