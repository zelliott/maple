This study extends the finding that zzso zzso injection of 3M zzso extracts of T cells zzso transplant tolerance to the use of well defined zzso zzso class I zzso derived from the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso class zzso While three of the six synthetic zzso peptides were zzso three others were zzso when tested in zzso zzso In our initial studies, we examined the effects of IT injection of a mixture of equal zzso of the three zzso zzso peptides on zzso cardiac zzso survival in zzso zzso The results showed that a single IT injection of 100 and 300 zzso class I zzso zzso on day zzso relative to cardiac transplant did not significantly prolong graft survival in zzso zzso recipients zzso of zzso and zzso days zzso zzso days in zzso In contrast, 600 zzso zzso injected IT resulted in modest zzso of graft to an zzso of zzso zzso However, IT injection of 600 zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso ALS on day zzso led to permanent acceptance zzso zzso of cardiac zzso in zzso zzso recipients compared with survival of zzso days in ALS alone treated zzso In contrast, similar treatment led to acute rejection of third party zzso cardiac zzso zzso injection of 600 zzso zzso combined with ALS did not result in prolonged graft survival zzso zzso The long-term unresponsive zzso recipients zzso zzso challenged with zzso cardiac zzso accepted permanently zzso zzso zzso while rejecting the third party zzso zzso a finding that confirms acquired systemic zzso These findings confirm the role of IT injection of synthetic zzso zzso in the induction of acquired zzso tolerance and provide the rationale for testing this strategy in large animals and eventually in zzso
