zzso zzso regulation in the brain is thought to be one of the key components of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Heat shock factors zzso zzso cellular zzso through the control of gene zzso However, the roles of zzso in brain function have yet to be zzso zzso In the present study, we attempted to clarify the role of zzso gene regulation in zzso and behavioral development using zzso zzso zzso We found zzso zzso of zzso zzso and impaired zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso mice showed zzso affective behavior, including reduced anxiety and zzso but increased zzso behavior and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso enhanced behavioral vulnerability to repeated exposure to restraint zzso zzso rescuing the zzso zzso in the zzso but not the adult zzso reversed the zzso anxiety and zzso zzso These results indicate a crucial role for zzso zzso in zzso and behavioral zzso Analysis of the molecular mechanisms revealed that zzso directly zzso the expression of zzso zzso which then zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso removal of zzso from the zzso zzso resulted in zzso behavior during adulthood, similar to that observed in zzso zzso Thus, these results suggest that one role of zzso is to control zzso zzso levels through the zzso regulation of zzso a process that might be involved in zzso and behavioral development in zzso
