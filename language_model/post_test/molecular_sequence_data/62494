zzso particles contain a zzso zzso zzso which serves as template for the generation of zzso DNA by reverse zzso Transfer between zzso strands during DNA synthesis is governed by both sequence similarity between templates and structural features of the zzso zzso A kissing zzso believed to facilitate zzso recognition and zzso formation, was previously found to be a preferred site for zzso To investigate if hairpin zzso is the primary zzso for this zzso zzso we have devised a novel zzso leader zzso zzso based upon zzso of two zzso or zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso We found that zzso of an alternative zzso loop in one of the two zzso disrupted zzso template zzso whereas zzso was restored between zzso with complementary zzso zzso By pairing zzso zzso that contained identical zzso loop motifs and that were unlikely to interact by zzso zzso we found no preference for zzso at the kissing hairpin zzso Of zzso pairs designed to interact through base pairing of zzso loop zzso we could in one case restore zzso template zzso in spite of the reduced sequence identity, whereas another pair failed to support zzso directed zzso However, analyses of in zzso zzso zzso of all studied zzso combinations showed a good correlation between efficient zzso formation between zzso viral zzso and in zzso zzso transfer at the kissing zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso between zzso or zzso hairpin kissing zzso is essential but not sufficient for zzso zzso leader zzso and lend further support to the hypothesis that a specific zzso zzso interaction is guided by complementary sequences and maintained within the mature zzso zzso of zzso
