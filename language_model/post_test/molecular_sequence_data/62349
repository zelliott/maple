zzso coli zzso zzso zzso has suitable properties for processing fusion proteins to produce peptides and zzso However, zzso of this zzso for such production has been restricted due to its generally low zzso efficiency at zzso (or zzso where zzso is a zzso zzso zzso acid of a target zzso The objective of this study was to generate a specific and efficient zzso zzso and to zzso it as a processing zzso for producing various peptides and proteins by converting its zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is proposed to interact with the zzso zzso acid of its zzso zzso zzso with variations at zzso were constructed by replacing this zzso acid with 19 natural zzso acids to alter the zzso specificity at zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso that had a zzso at this position, but not the zzso zzso efficiently zzso a fusion protein containing the zzso acid sequence zzso downward zzso zzso in which zzso is a model zzso with a zzso at the N zzso The zzso zzso with zzso and zzso at position 97 were useful in releasing human zzso hormone zzso zzso at the N zzso and human zzso precursor zzso at the N zzso respectively, from fusion zzso zzso was produced by this method and was zzso up to zzso by two zzso zzso the yield was 160 zzso of zzso Our novel method in which the zzso zzso are used could be employed for production of various peptides and zzso
