zzso and biological properties of zzso human zzso zzso were compared with human urinary zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to apparent zzso from the urine of patients with zzso anemia and from the zzso medium of Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso clone for human EPO, zzso The zzso nature of both factors, observed on zzso zzso is derived from the difference of the number of terminal zzso acid zzso bound to the zzso chains of the EPO zzso The primary structure of zzso consisting of 165 zzso acid zzso was determined, and the zzso zzso predicted from the zzso sequence was confirmed to be missing, as described previously zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso and one zzso sites of both factors were determined as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso linkages are located between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso compared in normal and in partially zzso rats were approximately the zzso Both factors also zzso the colony formation of zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso From these results, it is concluded that zzso produced in zzso cells zzso with zzso clone for human EPO is indistinguishable from zzso zzso and biologically, and is valuable for further research and for clinical zzso
