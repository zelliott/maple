We have explored a general approach for the determination of absolute amounts and the relative zzso of proteins in a mixture using zzso and mass zzso We engineered a gene to express green fluorescent protein zzso with a synthetic fusion protein zzso in zzso coli to function as a zzso standard for the zzso of an analogous stable zzso zzso fusion protein zzso and for the zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso contain zzso sequences of specific zzso peptides that are derived from the zzso zzso and gamma protein zzso of zzso and that are each flanked by zzso regions that maintain the native zzso properties for these zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso provided a zzso scale for mass zzso ratios from zzso peptides of zzso and defined zzso responses for mass zzso signal zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and gamma was measured to be zzso over a zzso range of labeled internal standard with a relative standard zzso of zzso zzso a unique genetically coded zzso signal element with zzso zzso peptides provides a powerful method to accurately zzso and determine the relative zzso of multiple proteins present in complexes or zzso that cannot be readily assessed using classical zzso zzso or zzso zzso
