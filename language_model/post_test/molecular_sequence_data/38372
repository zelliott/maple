zzso type 1 zzso is a frequent zzso disorder that involves zzso derived from the embryonic neural zzso Besides the functional gene on zzso arm zzso zzso sequences zzso are present on a number of zzso including 2, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21, and zzso We zzso the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso Only the middle part of the functional gene but not zzso zzso zzso the functionally important zzso domain of the zzso zzso is presented in this zzso In addition to the two known zzso zzso on zzso 14 we identified two novel zzso A zzso tree was constructed, from which we concluded that the zzso zzso on zzso 2, 14, and 22 are closely related to each zzso zzso containing one of these zzso zzso with the other zzso in this zzso but did not reveal any in zzso zzso with the functional zzso gene or with zzso zzso on other zzso This suggests that their zzso specificity is mainly determined by zzso sequences zzso the zzso Strong support for this concept was obtained by sequence analysis of the zzso regions, which revealed more than zzso zzso We zzso that during evolution this subset of zzso zzso initially arose by zzso and zzso of the middle part of the functional zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso a much larger fragment, including zzso zzso was duplicated and gave rise to the current zzso zzso copies on zzso 14 and zzso
