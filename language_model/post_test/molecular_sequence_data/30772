A collection of zzso plasmids expressing either zzso coli zzso or human serum zzso under the control of several zzso coli zzso promoter derivatives were constructed and studied for both efficiency of expression and regulation by zzso Several zzso including the length of the upstream region, tandem zzso of a core promoter, and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene onto the expression zzso were zzso It is shown that derivatives containing sequences upstream from the zzso region or multiple copies of the zzso promoter produce twofold higher levels of protein than plasmids with a minimal zzso promoter truncated at zzso We show that the expression of a zzso protein such as zzso can be significantly improved zzso zzso zzso of total zzso if both the upstream zzso promoter region, which enhances promoter strength, and an intact zzso zzso are included on the zzso
