The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso was zzso The gene was identified as a coding sequence of zzso zzso corresponding to a protein with a calculated mass of zzso zzso a value in good agreement with that of zzso 16,000 found by in zzso coupled zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence indicated that the protein was a member of the major zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso resistance to zzso but not to zzso indicating that it was an zzso of type zzso The open reading frame upstream from the zzso gene was zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of total DNA from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the gene was located in the zzso The zzso gene was detected by zzso zzso in all 80 strains of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso against these strains of zzso zzso were lower than those of zzso zzso and zzso indicating that production of zzso contributes to zzso resistance in zzso zzso
