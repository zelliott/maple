zzso and identification of strain CW 1 zzso zzso isolated from corn zzso were zzso zzso CW 1 was a zzso zzso and zzso rod that produced the zzso of zzso zzso This strain exhibited more than zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity and greater than zzso zzso zzso with type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To clarify the zzso positions of these type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The three type strains displayed different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is a closer zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sharing zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso which was confirmed by the high zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be reclassified as later zzso of zzso zzso
