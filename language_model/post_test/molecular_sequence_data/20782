zzso zzso at three major zzso complex zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was investigated in order to get an overall understanding of zzso zzso zzso Little sequence variation was detected at the zzso zzso while extensive and considerable zzso were found at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso reconstruction and sequence comparison revealed extensive sharing of identical zzso zzso among different species at the three zzso zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso trees for these zzso zzso with the trees reconstructed only based on zzso sites revealed that zzso zzso possibly reflected common ancestry and were not due to zzso zzso At the same time, zzso evolution was also evidenced that the zzso diversity of the three zzso zzso clearly zzso species divergence events according to the relaxed molecular zzso It may be the forces of balancing selection acting to maintain the high sequence zzso and identical zzso in zzso manner at the zzso and zzso zzso
