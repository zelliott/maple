To determine whether avian zzso zzso were a factor in zzso zzso disease zzso we used zzso reverse zzso and zzso sequence analysis to examine zzso zzso or frozen tissue samples of 31 zzso birds with this zzso zzso is a fatal disease of zzso birds associated with zzso encephalitis and zzso of the upper zzso zzso zzso samples had been collected from 1999 through 2008 in Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, and zzso zzso demonstration of viral zzso within the brain and zzso nerve system of the gastrointestinal tract provides strong evidence for a zzso role of zzso in this zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso genes showed that virus in most of our cases belonged to the zzso and zzso groups among the 5 zzso described so zzso zzso sequences of 2 birds did not match any of the described sequences and clustered together in a new branch termed zzso
