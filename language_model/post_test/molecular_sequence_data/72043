zzso of zzso genes involved in zzso metabolism is controlled by zzso by zzso and by nitrogen zzso Here we report a novel control element containing a core zzso motif zzso the zzso response, demonstrating that a protein binds this element, that binding is modulated by zzso and that folate is required for the in zzso zzso zzso In an zzso zzso promoter the region needed for the zzso response of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso repression that was relieved by zzso It was also responsible for zzso control but not nitrogen zzso zzso and zzso have an zzso region in their zzso The zzso region zzso a zzso response on an zzso promoter acting as a zzso or zzso depending on promoter zzso A protein was identified that bound to the zzso regulatory regions of zzso and zzso only if the zzso motif was zzso This protein protected a zzso pair zzso region of zzso that is zzso between zzso and zzso zzso binding was increased by zzso and use of a zzso deletion zzso indicated the involvement of a folate in the in zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso may act as a zzso for the zzso factor controlling expression of zzso metabolism zzso
