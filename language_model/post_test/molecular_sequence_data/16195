We have characterized sequences of zzso DNA zzso to the coding region of the rat zzso zzso zzso This sequence possesses neither zzso nor zzso sequences in their usual positions but is rich in zzso zzso zzso similar to those found in the regulatory regions of other genes are zzso zzso analyses have revealed that sequences zzso to zzso are sufficient to initiate zzso although inclusion of information up to zzso is necessary for zzso promoter zzso
