zzso V is a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso which, in zzso or at low salt zzso in zzso binds zzso DNA through zzso interactions and remains associated with that DNA until all zzso have been recognized and zzso On the basis of the analyses of previous zzso that effect this zzso zzso activity, and the recently published zzso structure of a zzso deficient zzso V with zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cell 83, zzso four zzso zzso were created, the zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso coli, and the zzso zzso to zzso zzso kinetic analyses revealed that one of the zzso zzso maintained an efficiency zzso near that of the zzso zzso while zzso and zzso had a zzso reduction in efficiency and zzso was reduced almost zzso In addition, zzso and zzso exhibited a zzso increase in zzso zzso All the zzso experienced mild to severe reduction in zzso activity zzso with zzso being the most severely affected zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso showed dramatic effects in their ability to scan zzso DNA and zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso These zzso zzso and zzso appeared to zzso a zzso three-dimensional search mechanism even at low salt zzso zzso and zzso displayed somewhat diminished zzso zzso activities relative to that of the zzso zzso These results, combined with previous analyses of other zzso zzso and the zzso structure, provide a detailed architecture of zzso zzso DNA zzso
