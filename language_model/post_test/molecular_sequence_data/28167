zzso analysis of the zzso regions of the zzso 2, zzso 2, and zzso zzso which are expressed in the zzso zzso showed multiple sites of zzso interaction for each zzso Competition experiments demonstrated that a region from each zzso region zzso with the same zzso zzso zzso We show by in zzso binding zzso that this zzso activity also recognizes a sequence within the zzso regions of zzso 1, zzso B, zzso A, and zzso zzso zzso interference and protection studies showed that the zzso activity recognized a zzso zzso the zzso of which were separated by integral zzso turns of zzso The zzso 2 zzso sequence was found to enhance in zzso zzso of its own promoter in a zzso manner, which identified the zzso activity as a zzso factor zzso zzso The observation that zzso 1 bound to DNA sequences that have been defined as zzso enhancers by others suggests that this factor is involved in the coordinate expression of genes transcribed in the zzso zzso
