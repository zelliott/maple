A better understanding of zzso sexual differentiation could be provided by a study of models in which genetic sex determination zzso of zzso can be reversed by zzso In the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from adult zzso and the zzso or deduced zzso acid sequences showed a high level of identity with various zzso zzso In adults, zzso expression was found in zzso and zzso In developing zzso the expression was found to fit with the zzso period zzso and was detected in both zzso and zzso larvae, as well as in zzso submitted during the whole zzso to a zzso zzso In the latter individuals, in zzso zzso and zzso quantitative zzso showed that, at the end of zzso zzso expression was at the same level than in normal zzso larvae and was significantly lower than in normal zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso down regulation did not occur when heating was performed at the end of zzso Our results confirm the importance of zzso regulation in female versus male differentiation and demonstrate that a down regulation of zzso expression is involved in the process of sex zzso
