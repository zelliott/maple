The functional role of the bacterial organisms in the reef zzso and their contribution to the coral well-being remain largely zzso The first step in addressing this gap of knowledge relies on in-depth characterization of the coral microbial community and its changes in diversity across coral species, space and zzso In this study, we focused on the exploration of microbial community zzso associated with an ecologically important Caribbean zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We collected data from a large set of biological zzso allowing us to detect patterns of geographical structure and resolve zzso patterns using network zzso The zzso analysis of the resolved diversity showed consistent and dominant presence of two zzso affiliated with the order zzso which corroborates a specific pattern of bacterial association emerging for this coral species and for many other zzso within the zzso zzso We argue that this specific association might indicate a symbiotic association with the adult coral zzso Furthermore, we identified a highly diverse rare bacterial zzso zzso zzso also living along with the dominant bacterial zzso but the zzso of this zzso is significantly structured along the geographical zzso We further discuss that some of these rare bacterial members show significant association with other members of the community reflecting the complexity of the networked zzso within the coral zzso
