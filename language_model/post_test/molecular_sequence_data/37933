A zzso zzso zzso a structural zzso of zzso zzso (also identified as zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso class of zzso was zzso The gene zzso corresponding to this zzso has been characterized and mapped to the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of this zzso shows that the zzso protein contains one highly zzso zzso domain followed by two others with less zzso Northern zzso reveals that the zzso zzso is expressed throughout the zzso zzso In contrast to its zzso zzso in zzso zzso detected zzso expression in specific zzso the zzso zzso Garland cells and zzso cells, which are all specialized zzso in which intensive zzso cycling takes zzso Garland cells and zzso (also called zzso zzso function in taking up waste material from the zzso Finally, I have mapped an zzso trap element within the zzso region of zzso which may help in future studies to address the question of its function during zzso zzso
