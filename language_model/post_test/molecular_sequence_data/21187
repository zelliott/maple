Plant seed oil bodies, zzso zzso inclusions providing storage reserves, are composed of a neutral zzso core surrounded by a zzso zzso with several integrated proteins that play a significant role in stabilization of the particles and probably also in zzso zzso Oil zzso proteins are generally very zzso due to the long zzso sequences zzso them into the zzso core, which makes them extremely difficult to handle and to digest zzso Although oil bodies have been zzso studied during last decades, not all their proteins have been identified zzso To overcome the problems connected with their zzso a method based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis was zzso zzso was carried out with zzso and zzso single or in zzso which increased significantly the number of identified zzso namely the zzso zzso Thanks to this methodology it was possible to achieve an extensive coverage of proteins zzso to analyze their zzso modifications and moreover, to detect four new oil zzso protein zzso which demonstrates the complexity of oil zzso protein zzso
