zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen causing severe infections in hospital settings, especially with immune compromised patients, and the increasing prevalence of zzso resistant strains urges search for new drugs with novel mechanisms of zzso In this study we introduce zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso as zzso agents against zzso zzso We have designed and zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the translation initiation region of the zzso gene (an essential bacterial gene involved in cell zzso or the zzso gene (an essential bacterial gene involved in fatty acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso and characterized these compounds according to their zzso activity and mode of zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso or the zzso zzso exhibited complete growth zzso of zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso at 1-2 zzso zzso without any indication of bacterial membrane disruption (even at 20 zzso and resulted in specific reduction of the targeted zzso zzso One of the four compounds showed clear zzso activity while the other significantly reduced bacterial zzso These results open the possibility of development of zzso zzso for treatment of zzso zzso
