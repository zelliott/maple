On the basis of recent fundamentally novel developments in the protein structure a zzso code is suggested, that would potentially allow to describe zzso structure, and function of proteins by a spectrum of elementary zzso zzso All major characteristics of the nearly standard units are zzso and first five zzso of the zzso code are presented with their respective unique zzso structures, and zzso More such zzso are to be discovered, and the general procedure for their identification is zzso
