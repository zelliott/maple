zzso zzso zzso instability, and cellular viability were studied in serial passages of mouse embryonic stem zzso cells in which the zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso These cells lack zzso zzso activity, and their growth rate was reduced after more than 300 divisions and almost zero after 450 cell zzso After this growth crisis, zzso cells with a rapid growth rate did zzso Such survivors were found to maintain functional zzso in a zzso zzso Although zzso zzso maintenance has been reported for some immortalized zzso cells, its molecular mechanism has not been zzso zzso of the zzso structures in one of the zzso zzso cell lines showed amplification of the same tandem zzso of zzso and zzso sequences at most of the zzso zzso This evidence implicates zzso amplification as one mechanism for the zzso maintenance of zzso in zzso zzso
