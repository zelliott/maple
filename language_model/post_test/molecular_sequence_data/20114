The spike zzso gene of the attenuated zzso epidemic zzso virus zzso zzso was cloned and zzso to further explore the functions of wild type zzso and attenuated zzso zzso revealed a single large zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with predicted zzso of 151 zzso The coding region of the S gene of attenuated zzso zzso had 20 zzso changes that appeared to be significant zzso of function in that they produced changes in its predicted zzso acid zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso has previously been found to exhibit reduced zzso in zzso The regions containing these 20 zzso changes may therefore be crucial for zzso zzso The attenuated zzso zzso S protein contains 28 zzso zzso 21 zzso that are predicted to be zzso and a stretch of highly zzso zzso at positions zzso which is predicted to form an zzso and to function as a membrane zzso One (from N to K at zzso of the changes in the deduced zzso acid sequence destroyed zzso zzso sites, while another change (from N to S at zzso created a new one at a different zzso These zzso in zzso zzso sites reflected 3 zzso changes, which were related to the zzso zzso changes and are suggested to influence the zzso of attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA sequence identities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and parent zzso zzso Likewise, it shares zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with those genes at the deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso analysis suggested that attenuated zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso and parent zzso rather than to zzso and zzso and is especially close to the Chinese zzso strain zzso
