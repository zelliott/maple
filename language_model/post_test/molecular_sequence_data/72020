Although the molecular mechanism by which zzso exerts its effects on the zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso the drug has previously been found to interact specifically with the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso In this study we have determined the crystal structure of the complex between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The bound zzso is clearly seen within the zzso binding pocket of the zzso occupying a position similar to that of the zzso ring of the zzso zzso hence competes with zzso for binding to the zzso acting as a competitive inhibitor for this critical zzso zzso zzso interactions between the drug and zzso acids unique to the zzso form of the zzso suggest this binding is zzso zzso studies confirm that zzso acts as a weak inhibitor of zzso zzso with mild selectivity for the zzso zzso As zzso has been shown to accumulate to zzso zzso within the food zzso in the gut of the zzso even low levels of zzso may contribute to the biological efficacy of the zzso The structure of this zzso complex provides a template from which the zzso zzso might be modified to develop more efficient zzso of the zzso
