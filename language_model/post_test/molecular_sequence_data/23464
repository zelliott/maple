In animal cells, stable zzso zzso can be achieved by zzso small interfering zzso zzso expression system, in which Pol III zzso gene promoters are used to drive the expression of short hairpin zzso however, this has not been demonstrated in zzso Whether Pol III zzso gene promoter is capable of driving zzso expression in plants is zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso was achieved in plants through stable expression of short hairpin zzso which was driven by Pol III zzso gene zzso Using zzso zzso transformed tobacco as a model system, the results demonstrated that 21 zzso zzso duplexes, targeting at different sites of zzso zzso were zzso expressed under the control of either human zzso or zzso zzso zzso gene promoter, and zzso gene was silenced in zzso of zzso zzso The severity of zzso was correlated with the abundance of zzso expression but independent of the target sites and zzso zzso structures in zzso hairpin zzso Thus, the specific expression of zzso provides a new system for the study of zzso zzso pathways and functional zzso in zzso Moreover, the effectiveness of the human zzso promoter in a plant background suggested a zzso mechanism underlying Pol III complex zzso
