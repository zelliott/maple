By using a series of overlapping synthetic peptides covering zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein zzso of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso four helper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 to 25; zzso zzso 51 to zzso zzso zzso 61 to zzso and zzso zzso 111 to zzso in zzso mice zzso four zzso zzso 21 to zzso zzso zzso 91 to zzso zzso zzso 331 to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso mice zzso and two zzso zzso 81 to 95; and zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso mice zzso have been zzso All of these peptides were able to stimulate the proliferation of zzso zzso lines or freshly isolated zzso zzso cells from mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso of mice with synthetic peptides containing appropriate zzso zzso zzso strong cellular immunity in zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso with the helper peptides zzso zzso and zzso significantly accelerated the immune response induced by zzso zzso as determined by the production of zzso zzso When fused with a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the spike protein of zzso zzso and zzso assisted in the production of zzso zzso zzso in zzso These data provide useful insights regarding immunity against zzso and have the potential to help guide the design of zzso zzso
