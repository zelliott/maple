The gene of zzso disease virus zzso 2 zzso zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso was identified and zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso which includes putative zzso site and overlapping region with the zzso zzso zzso Although a putative zzso signal sequence was found in the downstream of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso DNA probe reacted only with the zzso zzso zzso transcript, representing the zzso and the downstream genes of zzso and zzso zzso pattern of this region of zzso was somewhat different from corresponding regions of zzso and infectious zzso zzso
