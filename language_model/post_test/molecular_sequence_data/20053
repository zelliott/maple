High affinity zzso zzso efficiently terminate zzso through synaptic zzso of released zzso We recently cloned and characterized a novel zzso high capacity plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso that is strongly expressed in the human brain and efficiently zzso zzso and zzso zzso In efforts to understand the zzso function of zzso and its relevance in zzso zzso we cloned the zzso zzso from the mouse brain, demonstrated its capability for transporting zzso and zzso and determined the regional and cellular zzso of mouse plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso in adult mouse brain by zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso and protein are broadly expressed in the mouse brain and are particularly abundant in zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with established zzso markers zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso is zzso in many brain regions with the high affinity zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but is also found in certain sites that receive zzso zzso but lack significant expression of zzso or zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a widely distributed, zzso zzso which may support the role of zzso and zzso zzso under certain zzso
