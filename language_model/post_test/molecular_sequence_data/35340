The zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a cellular protein that is activated during influenza virus zzso Although the function of human zzso has been studied for a long time, zzso zzso zzso has little been studied except for its zzso 

In this study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of the zzso zzso determine its zzso zzso and find its expression change during zzso or zzso zzso 

First, the sequence and structure of zzso were zzso Second, zzso gene was cloned into zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which were zzso into cells to determine its zzso zzso Third, Lung zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso infected and control groups were analyzed using zzso real-time zzso and zzso 

The sequence and structure of zzso was highly similar to the counterpart of zzso zzso protein distributed only in the zzso Lung zzso of zzso infected by zzso or zzso appeared obvious pathological changes, and the expression of zzso in both zzso and protein level was zzso by approximate zzso in zzso infected by zzso or zzso comparing with control zzso 

We analyzed the characteristics of the zzso zzso constructed a zzso tree, determined its zzso zzso and investigated its expression changes during zzso or zzso zzso The fundamental data accumulated in this study provides a potential medical model for investigating the function of zzso during influenza A viruses zzso
