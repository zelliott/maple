The regulation of zzso zzso constitutes a pivotal mechanism of the zzso control of gene zzso Here we show that the zzso protein zzso a component of the zzso zzso complex, is involved in regulating the expression of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains zzso elements zzso in its zzso region zzso which are recognized by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso recruits zzso zzso through interaction with zzso to form a zzso complex, zzso and zzso regulates the expression of zzso by accelerating the zzso and zzso of its zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso complex zzso while in cells zzso by the serum, both zzso and zzso are released from zzso and zzso expression is induced early after stimulation by the stabilization of its zzso as an zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso is a key factor in the regulation of zzso gene zzso which is essential for cell zzso Thus, zzso appears to function in the control of cell growth at least, in part, by regulating the expression of zzso
