zzso molecular recognition on a structural basis is an objective with broad academic and applied zzso In the complexes of zzso zzso and their zzso zzso recognition is governed mainly by zzso zzso in zzso with primary zzso zzso zzso The zzso soybean zzso inhibitor zzso should, therefore, interact at zzso zzso 1) with zzso and at zzso zzso 2) with zzso In contrast with this zzso a zzso assembly with zzso was observed in solution and in the crystal structure of zzso in complex with zzso determined at zzso A resolution by molecular zzso zzso zzso of zzso was fully embedded into the zzso pocket of zzso in contrast to primary zzso The zzso zzso unique to the zzso and the surface zzso surrounding the active site of the zzso formed a zzso far extended beyond the primary contact zzso Polar zzso zzso bridges and weak zzso contacts were zzso in zzso 1, interacting specifically with zzso However, close zzso contacts across the interface were characteristic of zzso 2 reacting with both zzso and zzso A zzso replacement shifted the ratio with zzso to the predicted zzso zzso Thus, the buried zzso responsible for zzso specificity was zzso in a zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso This may be used for adjusting the specificity of zzso zzso for applications such as zzso and cancer zzso zzso
