Since the function of a protein is largely dictated by its three zzso zzso determining a zzso structure is of fundamental importance to zzso Here we report on a novel approach to determining the one zzso secondary structure of proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from primary sequence data which makes use of Parallel Cascade Identification zzso a powerful technique from the field of zzso system zzso 

Using zzso divergent evolutionary profiles as input data, dynamic zzso systems are built through a black-box approach to model the process of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso are applied in order to zzso the architectural parameters of the zzso zzso The zzso prediction problem is broken down into a combination of three zzso zzso and protein structure zzso are built using 2 layers of zzso zzso zzso construction of the zzso training, and test zzso ensures that no zzso exists between any training and testing zzso A detailed comparison between zzso and 9 contemporary methods is provided over a set of 125 new protein chains guaranteed to be dissimilar to all training zzso Unlike other secondary structure prediction methods, here a web service is developed to provide both zzso and zzso zzso to zzso protein secondary structure zzso This server, called zzso is available at zzso In addition to a dynamic zzso web interface for humans, a zzso Object Access zzso zzso interface is added to permit zzso of the zzso service zzso This zzso interface zzso incorporation of zzso into zzso systems biology analysis pipelines requiring protein secondary structure information, and greatly zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to represent the input protein sequence data and also to zzso the resulting structure prediction in a zzso zzso To our knowledge, this represents the only publicly available zzso for a protein secondary structure prediction service with published zzso interface zzso 

Relative to the 9 contemporary methods included in the comparison zzso zzso zzso perform well, however zzso finds greatest application as a consensus zzso When zzso is used to combine a zzso zzso zzso with the current leading zzso method, zzso the overall error rate zzso is maintained while the rate of occurrence of a particularly zzso error is reduced by up to zzso This improvement in BAD score, combined with the zzso zzso web service interface makes zzso particularly useful for inclusion in a zzso structure prediction zzso
