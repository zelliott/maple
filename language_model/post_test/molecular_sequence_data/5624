Cloning and expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes confirmed the hypothesis that the gene zzso at the origin of the present human cluster of genes occurred between: zzso the great zzso radiation 80 million years ago and zzso the separation of man and zzso 10 million years zzso The zzso of zzso genes was completed by the addition of the zzso family of zzso zzso which are the oldest genes of the zzso zzso By analysis of data banks, a new zzso alternative zzso expressed in human zzso was identified, which allowed mapping the human zzso gene to zzso The results suggest that the zzso genes have evolved by successive zzso followed by zzso and divergent evolution from a single ancestral zzso
