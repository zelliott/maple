zzso brown zzso zzso zzso plants have reduced zzso content and offer significant advantages when used in zzso and zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso a key step in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as the underlying gene for zzso zzso since zzso plants have reduced zzso activity and lower zzso transcript zzso Here, we describe a Dow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains a zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso of zzso zzso As a result of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso contains a zzso insert between its 1st and 2nd zzso This zzso creates a premature stop zzso and is predicted to result in a truncated protein of 48 zzso acids zzso compared to zzso AA for the wild type zzso zzso We have also zzso zzso from the reference zzso zzso in zzso zzso stock and showed that it contains a zzso zzso zzso in the 3rd zzso which is predicted to result in a truncated protein of 147 zzso The levels of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso are reduced by 91 and 86 % respectively, leading to reductions in total zzso contents by 24 and 30 zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso in zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso zzso Based on specific changes in zzso and zzso high zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been developed to accelerate zzso molecular zzso
