There has been interest in the high affinity folate zzso zzso recently because of its high expression in the majority of zzso zzso The zzso genes are part of a family that includes an adult zzso a fetal zzso and one or more zzso which have been localized to zzso zzso As a step toward understanding why the adult zzso gene product is expressed on tumors, we have determined the organization of all the human zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated using the adult zzso zzso The organization of the locus was determined by zzso of zzso DNA and by zzso zzso Four zzso genes were found within 140 zzso The adult and fetal genes are not more than 23 zzso apart, with the 3' end of the adult gene facing the zzso of the fetal zzso A physical map of over 900 zzso of the surrounding region was also zzso The zzso assignment of the zzso locus was refined to zzso zzso of the zzso locus using zzso in zzso zzso
