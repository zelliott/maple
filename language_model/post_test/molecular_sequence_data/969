zzso B virus zzso core promoter contains a binding site for nuclear zzso A natural double zzso in this binding site, which changes zzso zzso 1765 from A to T and zzso zzso from G to A, selectively zzso the binding of several nuclear receptors without affecting that of zzso This double zzso also creates a binding site for the zzso factor zzso and changes two zzso acids in the overlapping X protein zzso In this study, we have examined the roles of zzso zzso and the X protein in the regulation of the core promoter activities in zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso could stimulate the expression of the zzso zzso and the core zzso from the core promoter of both the zzso zzso zzso and the double zzso although its effect on the former was more zzso In contrast, zzso which did not affect the zzso core promoter, suppressed the zzso zzso expression of the double zzso Further analysis using zzso zzso zzso with and without the ability to express the X zzso indicates that the X protein did not affect the zzso activity on the core promoter and affected the zzso activity on the core promoter of only the double zzso Thus, our results indicate that the zzso differences of zzso zzso and zzso core promoters are at least partially due to the differential activities of zzso zzso and the X protein on these two zzso
