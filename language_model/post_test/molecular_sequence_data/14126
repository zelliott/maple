A Northern zzso containing zzso zzso isolated from pregnant rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle, and zzso was zzso with an zzso probe to zzso zzso Only the zzso and zzso exhibited high levels of a zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to generate and amplify zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso each revealed a single zzso product that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso exhibited zzso identity with zzso a zzso gene identified in rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with zzso specific for zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells during abnormal conditions, such as mechanical or toxic zzso The protein is believed to have a role in zzso zzso cell differentiation and transformation that occurs under the above zzso This work shows, for the first time, the presence of high levels of message for zzso in normal zzso zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso and zzso may suggest an important role in cell differentiation and transformation that occurs in these zzso during zzso
