The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth hormone zzso was cloned by zzso from the total zzso of zzso zzso Its sequence zzso a putative zzso of 215 zzso zzso including a signal zzso of 25 zzso acids with no change to those of other previous reported zzso zzso The zzso precursor shares zzso zzso and zzso zzso to those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso sequence and its zzso sequences of the coding region shares zzso and zzso zzso to those of previous zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was also efficiently expressed in zzso coli carrying a zzso zzso in which the zzso was under the control of zzso promoter of zzso The expressed fusion protein zzso is comprised about zzso of the total cellular protein in such zzso The zzso zzso cannot only showed a obvious zzso curve when it reacted with the zzso membrane zzso proteins from zzso but also significantly increased the body weight and length of zzso after twice injection and such effects lasted two or three weeks after the last injection with zzso zzso
