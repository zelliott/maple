The dynamics of zzso zzso in zzso variable genes was investigated in order to define a population of B cells undergoing zzso zzso mice were injected with zzso and zzso zzso was prepared 5, 7, and 13 d zzso The zzso was zzso to gamma constant region zzso to make zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso 103 zzso clones corresponding to 18 different genes from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to identify zzso zzso genes had a low level of zzso on day 5 after zzso and accumulated more zzso by day 7 at a rate of zzso zzso per zzso per zzso However, by day 13, the number of zzso per gene did not increase, and most of the zzso zzso replacement zzso acid changes that were clustered in the zzso regions, indicating that the zzso process was less active during the second week and that zzso selection had zzso The data are consistent with a zzso regulated mechanism in which zzso is activated during the first week of the primary immune response for a limited time period, after which selection acts to preserve the beneficial zzso
