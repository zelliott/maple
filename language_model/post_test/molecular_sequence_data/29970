zzso at the zzso zzso zzso promoter displays an ordered but different zzso in different cell types as detected by a modified zzso protection zzso and accessibility to zzso In cells not zzso zzso zzso sequences between zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso initiation site exist as a DNA zzso between positioned zzso and appear to interact with a specific zzso zzso In contrast, a longer zzso DNA, from zzso to zzso is bound in a zzso zzso initiation complex in cells that specifically transcribe the zzso (adult) zzso zzso zzso These zzso interactions can account for a localized open zzso structure at the zzso promoter in zzso zzso The observed mutually exclusive patterns of zzso interactions in the zzso of different zzso cell types between zzso to zzso suggest a model for organizing alternative zzso structure associated with gene zzso Two DNA binding zzso one being a zzso box binding factor, compete for overlapping sites to allow either assembly of a zzso initiation complex and transcription, or positioning of zzso for stable zzso
