zzso zzso viruses have been zzso to genetic manipulation using zzso DNA zzso Recently, new techniques were developed that allowed the rescue of synthetic zzso molecules into influenza A viruses and, zzso into other zzso zzso zzso These techniques are presently being used to study the molecular biology of these zzso Questions concerning zzso and zzso elements that are involved in zzso and replication of zzso zzso viral zzso can now be addressed with reverse genetic zzso Further development of this methodology has enabled the zzso zzso DNA zzso influenza A viruses that contain altered zzso The zzso characteristics and possible applications of these novel zzso viruses are also zzso
