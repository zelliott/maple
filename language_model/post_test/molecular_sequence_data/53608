zzso zzso are major pathogens of humans and zzso zzso A fundamental aspect of zzso biology, which may provide novel molecular targets for zzso control, is the regulation of stage zzso Studies carried out on zzso zzso a bovine zzso zzso have provided evidence that a zzso process controls differentiation from the zzso to the zzso zzso It was zzso that this process involves the presence of regulators of zzso gene expression in the preceding stage of the life cycle, and that during differentiation a quantitative increase of these factors zzso This study was carried out to test these zzso Nuclear zzso analysis showed that zzso expression is controlled, at least in part, at the zzso zzso The zzso start site showed zzso with the consensus zzso zzso zzso and study of the zzso upstream region by the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that a 23 zzso motif specifically bound factors from zzso nuclear zzso Three complexes were shown to bind to a 9 zzso core binding site zzso Two of these complexes were present in zzso extracts but were found at elevated levels during zzso Both complexes contain a zzso of the same molecular mass and may be related via the formation of zzso or zzso zzso The third complex appears to be distinct and was detected at time points associated with the transition to high level zzso gene zzso
