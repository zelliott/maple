zzso is a zzso zzso factor that acts as an zzso or zzso in different zzso zzso binds to multiple sites in the mouse zzso promoter, inducing at each site a sharp DNA zzso zzso of zzso to a site situated between the zzso zzso response element zzso and the zzso box zzso the DNA in a way that interferes with the interaction of proteins bound at the zzso and zzso zzso resulting in repression of zzso Here, we show that binding of zzso to a different site in the zzso promoter has a different zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso serum response element zzso enhances the binding of serum response factor zzso This enhancement requires the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso can zzso the zzso at least zzso In the region of overlapping zzso zzso contacts DNA in the major groove, while zzso contacts DNA in the minor zzso zzso also enhances the association of zzso with the zzso in zzso insect zzso Thus, although zzso zzso similar structural changes in DNA at different binding sites, it can have distinct local effects on zzso and zzso zzso These data support a general role for zzso in the building of highly organized promoter zzso
