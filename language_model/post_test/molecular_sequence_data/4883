zzso analysis of a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was carried out on 10 human and 9 animal zzso Eight of the 9 animal zzso and 3 human zzso displayed the recognition sequence zzso whereas zzso human zzso exhibited the recognition sequence zzso zzso analysis of the ninth animal zzso which was recovered from a zzso revealed this isolate to be different from both human and animal zzso The AT richness of the zzso recognition sequences rendered them zzso for primer design and therefore a diagnostic randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso previously developed in our laboratory was also zzso Analysis of 2 human and 2 animal zzso again revealed distinct differences between animal and human zzso On the basis of this sequence information, diagnostic zzso were designed that could directly differentiate between animal and human zzso on the basis of the size of the zzso zzso The ability to differentiate directly between human and animal zzso has important implications for studies of the transmission and zzso potential of this zzso These results also raise further doubts about the uniformity of the species zzso zzso
