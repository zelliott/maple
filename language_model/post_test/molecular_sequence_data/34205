zzso zzso couple membrane potential to zzso changes in zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso zzso zzso and aromatic side chains assist the transfer of zzso side chains across the zzso electric field during zzso zzso We investigated the functional contribution of negative zzso zzso from these zzso to channel gating and zzso sensing with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The data show that zzso of two zzso zzso side chains in zzso segments zzso and zzso namely zzso and zzso in Shaker zzso channels, has little functional effect on zzso zzso although zzso appears to catalyze zzso zzso Our results suggest that neither zzso nor zzso engages in zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso likely because they zzso and possibly help create, a zzso zzso
