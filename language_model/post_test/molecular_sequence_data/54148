zzso invasion of root cells is required for the establishment of successful zzso in zzso of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In both interactions a requirement for successful entry is the zzso of a common zzso zzso that includes five genes required to generate calcium zzso and two genes required for the perception of the calcium zzso Recently, it has been discovered that in zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene is essential for the establishment of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we show by analyses of zzso that the same gene is also required for zzso colonization and zzso zzso encodes a protein featuring a Major zzso zzso domain, typically featured on proteins involved in membrane trafficking and zzso and a series of zzso zzso Plants zzso in this gene have abnormal zzso infection threads and fewer zzso and in the case of interactions with AM zzso zzso penetration defects and aborted zzso zzso zzso zzso in root hairs in response to supplied zzso factors is intact in the zzso zzso This, and the zzso of zzso transcripts upon application of zzso factors which we show to be dependent on zzso zzso and zzso indicates that zzso acts downstream of the common zzso zzso
