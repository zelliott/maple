Previous studies have indicated that a sizable fraction of adult human peripheral blood B cells may express zzso receptors zzso by zzso zzso V zzso From these studies it was uniquely associated with the peripheral blood B cell zzso was uniquely associated with the peripheral blood B cell zzso associated with particular zzso gene segments and/or B cell zzso We have addressed these issues by analyzing zzso 80 zzso and zzso zzso transcripts from zzso peripheral blood, zzso and zzso B cells, as well as from B cells separated on the basis of zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions are zzso expressed in zzso B cells in all peripheral adult human zzso zzso and that the occurrence of zzso zzso does not segregate with either zzso or zzso B cell zzso The distribution and nature of zzso as well as the occurrence of zzso related but divergent transcripts suggests that at least some of the zzso were selected by zzso
