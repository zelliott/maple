Two proteins essential for the zzso of the zzso acid zzso in zzso coli have been zzso and zzso to apparent zzso The protein zzso by the zzso gene has an zzso activity that results in the conversion of the zzso intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The second protein zzso by the zzso gene exhibits no zzso zzso properties with zzso intermediate zzso zzso or zzso In zzso the proteins are capable of a zzso conversion of zzso and zzso to form zzso zzso and zzso Neither protein alone is capable of zzso a conversion of the zzso zzso to a free zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins form a stable zzso zzso complex that constitutes the zzso zzso zzso zzso kinetic parameters for the zzso indicate that zzso is a more efficient zzso relative to ammonium zzso by a factor of zzso The zzso zzso will support an zzso reaction with a turnover number similar to that of the zzso with zzso The zzso activity for the zzso is zzso of that in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso There are critical zzso interactions that mediate the zzso properties for zzso zzso The zzso turnover of zzso can be increased up to zzso by the addition of either the product zzso or the zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso The zzso significance of this zzso activity compared to other zzso type zzso zzso is zzso
