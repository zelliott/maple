zzso gastric zzso zzso contain zzso activity which zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso at the terminal zzso beta zzso linkage faster than at the zzso beta zzso bond, producing mainly zzso beta zzso beta zzso In a marked contrast, zzso beta zzso beta zzso is zzso primarily at the zzso beta zzso bond, while partial zzso of zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso reveals similar rates of zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso Our data support the notion that the terminal beta zzso zzso unit of zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso may interact with the reducing end zzso unit zzso in water zzso
