zzso among the zzso species zzso zzso has long been debated in fish zzso Present study concentrates on the nature of the zzso relationship among the five zzso species using the sequence of major zzso DNA zzso zzso We have covered zzso sequence of approximately zzso zzso per individual, zzso zzso per species and zzso zzso as a zzso We also characterized the zzso and zzso zzso regions with respect to their zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso sequences were divided into four zzso First and second zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas third and fourth zzso consisted of zzso and complete zzso zzso The NJ tree was constructed for all the zzso The zzso species under study formed a zzso group well separated from the zzso zzso Similarly, the individuals of zzso zzso form zzso group with zzso species, indicating zzso as a sister zzso of zzso The findings from the present study provide greater insights into zzso status of zzso and set the stage for future investigations dealing with zzso zzso conservation and zzso within this interesting and important group of zzso
