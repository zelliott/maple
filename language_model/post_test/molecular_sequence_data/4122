Members of the zzso family zzso zzso receptors that zzso zzso zzso and zzso programs of many precursor cells, including zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes zzso followed by zzso of the zzso domain zzso to the nucleus, where it activates zzso of zzso responsive zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the mechanisms leading to the zzso of zzso a striking feature of zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso By zzso mobility shift zzso we identified a zzso factor complex zzso that binds sequence specific to one known and 4 newly identified putative zzso recognition sites in the zzso core promoter zzso With the use of zzso virus zzso B cells as a model for zzso zzso zzso zzso C1 was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the nuclear form of zzso is a component of C1 in zzso cells, supporting a model in which zzso activates zzso by binding to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with an activated form of zzso induced zzso zzso confirming that zzso is a target gene of zzso zzso Finally, reverse zzso chain reaction and kinetic analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso is not only zzso in zzso cells but might also be related to the failure of zzso characteristic for this zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that deregulation of zzso signaling is involved in the zzso expression of zzso in zzso
