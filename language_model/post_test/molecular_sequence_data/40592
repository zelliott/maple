During a research investigation to determine if cattle from British Columbia zzso Canada were infected with zzso zzso or other related zzso blood zzso a novel zzso zzso was zzso Blood from seven BC source cattle was zzso by intravenous zzso into zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso calves were used as zzso negative control or zzso zzso positive zzso zzso designed sets of zzso specific for the zzso gene of zzso zzso or for the zzso zzso gene were used to test blood samples collected from all source cattle and from all recipient calves prior to zzso and up to 72 days zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as well as microscopic examination of stained blood zzso failed to demonstrate zzso zzso in any of the animals except for the positive zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified DNA from samples from all BC source zzso five of six of the corresponding recipient calves, and the zzso zzso infected control zzso DNA sequence data indicated the presence of zzso zzso only in the positive control zzso zzso analysis in zzso showed that sequences of all other zzso zzso zzso products clearly fit within the zzso zzso in the zzso family which also includes members of the zzso zzso zzso analyses using the zzso zzso gene sequences strongly support the putative zzso zzso as a distinct zzso with sequences of various strains of zzso zzso as the closest zzso zzso zzso is the only other species of the zzso known to naturally zzso zzso apart from the present zzso zzso However, within the zzso zzso zzso is zzso the furthest removed species from the novel zzso The finding of this novel zzso represents the first known natural zzso infection in cattle in North zzso Nevertheless, it is unclear whether cattle are an incidental or primary host, particularly since deer are recognized as zzso hosts for other species of zzso Although other zzso zzso are known to be zzso for animals and zzso these features are presently unknown for this novel zzso
