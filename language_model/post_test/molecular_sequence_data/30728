The zzso locations of a zzso containing the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been mapped on the binding sites zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso by synthetic zzso proteins with zzso zzso at the zzso Analysis of the DNA zzso patterns for zzso of the zzso corresponding to zzso zzso 222 to 281 and 226 to 281 revealed that the zzso were in the major groove nine to ten base pairs apart and were zzso displaced four to five base pairs from the central C of the recognition zzso This result is consistent with the zzso zzso zzso zzso model recently proposed for a class of DNA binding proteins important in the regulation of gene zzso
