A novel zzso protein inhibitor of zzso and zzso called zzso was isolated from the seeds of zzso zzso The zzso protein gave a single band on zzso corresponding to a molecular mass of 15 500 zzso 1000 zzso The inhibitor is composed of two zzso zzso zzso consisting of 39 and 90 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the two chains was determined by zzso degradation of zzso isolated from zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of reduced and zzso protein zzso A segment of the zzso chain, between zzso 65 and 81, showed zzso with the zzso site loop region of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The basic zzso in position 39 zzso zzso or 70 zzso is zzso as zzso or zzso in all zzso from zzso zzso and in all zzso zzso zzso zzso the two families of zzso zzso have structurally similar zzso zzso zzso exhibits an extremely high zzso CD zzso showed that during heating to 97 degrees C it preserves a considerable part of the zzso backbone zzso Studies on the zzso properties of the inhibitor zzso in the absence and presence of neutral or zzso zzso demonstrated that the intrinsic zzso of this protein is dominated by a zzso zzso buried in the interior of the protein zzso zzso of the light absorbed by zzso 63 of the zzso chain is transferred to zzso 26 of the zzso zzso
