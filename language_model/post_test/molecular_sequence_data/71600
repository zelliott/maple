zzso zzso zzso is a powerful zzso drug whose target is cellular zzso In the reaction between DNA and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso Two solution structures of the zzso have been published zzso In both models the zzso is bent and zzso but with significantly different angle zzso We solved the crystal structure at zzso of a zzso DNA zzso containing a single zzso zzso using the anomalous scattering zzso of platinum as a unique source of phase zzso We found 47 degrees for zzso zzso and 70 degrees for unwinding in agreement with previous zzso zzso The zzso are stabilized by zzso contacts involving two zzso zzso from the zzso one of which makes a zzso with a terminal zzso zzso The platinum coordination is nearly square and the platinum zzso is embedded into a cage of nine water molecules linked to the zzso zzso to the two zzso groups, and to the zzso backbone through other water zzso This water zzso organization is discussed in relation with the chemical stability of the zzso
