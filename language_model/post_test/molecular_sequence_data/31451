Seven zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from zzso zzso root zzso and zzso on this zzso Based on the zzso zzso gene zzso they were shown to belong to the zzso zzso with the representative strain zzso being most closely related to zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso Additionally, these strains formed a distinct group in zzso trees based on the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso data including fatty acid profiles and analysis of respiratory zzso supported the assignment of the strains to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of our strains from the closest species of the zzso zzso with a zzso published zzso zzso these strains represent a novel species for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso is zzso
