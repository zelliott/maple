The 3' end of most zzso transcripts is decorated by zzso proteins zzso which influence the fate of zzso throughout gene zzso However, despite the fact that multiple zzso coexist in the zzso of most zzso how functional interplay between these nuclear zzso controls gene expression remains zzso By characterizing the zzso of the zzso zinc finger zzso in zzso zzso we show here that the two major zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso have opposing roles in zzso gene zzso zzso we find that zzso functions in zzso regulation in a manner opposite to that of zzso By studying the zzso gene zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso via a nuclear zzso zzso zzso that depends on the nuclear zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso promotes zzso expression by acting at the level of the zzso zzso Our data support a model in which zzso zzso zzso zzso by competing with zzso for zzso transcripts in the zzso The opposing roles of zzso and zzso reveal that interplay between nuclear zzso can influence gene zzso
