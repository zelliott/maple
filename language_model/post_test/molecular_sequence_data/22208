zzso is the most common zzso modification of zzso yet genes relevant to the synthesis of zzso structures and function are incompletely represented and poorly zzso on the commercially available zzso To fill the need for expression analysis of such zzso we employed the zzso technology to develop a focused and highly zzso zzso representing human and zzso zzso including zzso zzso sugar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this report, the array has been used to generate zzso profiles of nine zzso zzso Global analysis with a zzso zzso zzso reveals that expression profiles in immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso are more closely zzso relative to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso brain zzso and zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso those responsible for synthesis of the core regions of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso whereas zzso that elaborate terminal structures are expressed in a highly zzso manner, accounting for tissue and ultimately zzso zzso zzso of gene expression profiles with zzso laser zzso zzso of flight zzso profiling of zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso 9, zzso is the zzso responsible for terminal zzso in zzso and zzso a finding validated by analysis of zzso knockout zzso Two families of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are predominately expressed in the immune zzso consistent with their emerging functions in both innate and acquired zzso The zzso chip reported in this study is available to the scientific community through the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso
