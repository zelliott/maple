Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that the serum protein of molecular weight of 182 zzso which plays an indispensable role in the development of cardiac zzso may be a cardiac zzso of zzso zzso belonging to zzso family zzso Furthermore, reports on the stable expression in zzso of several reporter genes injected directly into the zzso of rat and the approach of direct gene transfer into adult zzso heart to characterize the activity of a cellular gene and to zzso overall cardiac function in zzso prompted us to evaluate the zzso inducing potential of a full-length zzso for the 182 zzso protein upon direct zzso The full-length zzso of the cardiac zzso of zzso M obtained from zzso rat heart zzso and cloned in an zzso expression zzso namely zzso zzso was injected directly into the rat zzso the protein whose expression was zzso triggered by the zzso promoter could be detected in the serum of the injected animals and it could exert its function of inducing the zzso by a highly plausible way, by which the cardiac specific 182 zzso protein may bind to many growth modulating factors in the serum, and then be targeted to zzso by a zzso zzso mechanism zzso The development of cardiac zzso was monitored by determining the heart zzso weight zzso This ratio along with Northern zzso analysis of muscle specific marker genes such as zzso zzso and zzso and the induction of promoter activity of zzso and zzso genes monitored using zzso zzso zzso as a reporter gene confirmed the induction of cardiac zzso upon direct injection of the full-length zzso of 182 zzso zzso
