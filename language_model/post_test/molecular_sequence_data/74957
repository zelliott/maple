The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene gives rise to multiple zzso zzso displaying zzso in the length of the 3' untranslated zzso These species are present in the zzso at levels that vary over 2 orders of zzso suggesting that certain zzso sites are preferred over zzso Previous observations have shown that three out of the four major sites of zzso do not display consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso We have further analyzed the sequences involved in directing multiple zzso events on the zzso gene by focusing our attention on the zzso and zzso zzso the lowest abundance zzso species observed on zzso zzso zzso Identification and sequence analysis of the zzso addition sites corresponding to these species revealed appropriately positioned consensus zzso zzso additional nearby zzso sites were also detected which apparently do not use consensus zzso to direct zzso addition to zzso zzso of relatively lower zzso We have also identified zzso sites downstream of the zzso and zzso sites which display consensus zzso signals and zzso to zzso species too rare for detection by routine zzso zzso zzso Our data bring to 11 the number of known functional zzso addition sites associated with the zzso zzso
