DNA repair in the zzso is relevant to the consideration of zzso maintenance and replication zzso in the last universal common zzso zzso from two zzso First, these zzso embody a mix of bacterial and zzso molecular zzso Second, DNA repair proteins would have been essential in zzso to maintain zzso integrity, regardless of the environmental zzso Yet we know very little of the basic molecular mechanisms of DNA damage and repair in the zzso in zzso Many studies on DNA repair in zzso have been conducted with zzso because of the additional stress imposed on their zzso by high zzso In addition, of the six complete zzso zzso sequences published so far, five are zzso zzso We have recently shown that the zzso zzso zzso has an extraordinarily high capacity for repair of zzso zzso breaks and we have identified and zzso several genes involved in DNA repair in zzso zzso At the sequence level, only a few genes share zzso with known bacterial repair zzso For instance, our zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso occur in two zzso gene families, one of which is very deeply zzso and both zzso are more closely related to the zzso zzso and zzso gene families than to the zzso coli zzso zzso We have also identified a gene zzso a repair zzso in the zzso of several zzso The zzso sequences are highly zzso to those of the zzso zzso family and they cluster with genes of the zzso zzso which are known to be involved in DNA replication and repair in zzso We argue that there is a zzso of mechanisms and protein zzso shared between zzso and zzso for several modes of DNA repair, reflecting diversification from a minimal set of genes thought to represent the zzso of the zzso
