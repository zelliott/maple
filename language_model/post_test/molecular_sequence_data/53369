We have isolated a human zzso zzso a zzso designated zzso that shows zzso zzso acid identity and zzso similarity to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is localized exclusively to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a novel zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in brain, where the highest levels are observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and thalamus, all of which express zzso zzso at low zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is expressed at low levels in zzso and zzso where zzso zzso is expressed at high zzso No zzso signal for zzso zzso is observed in the zzso region of corpus zzso In other regions zzso both zzso are moderately or highly zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso which coordinate zzso zzso transport in the zzso regions of the brain, may form a new class within the zzso zzso zzso
