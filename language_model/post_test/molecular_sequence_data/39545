The zzso zzso 1 zzso is an inhibitor of the insulin zzso zzso of zzso are associated with infantile zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso To study the functional relevance of this protein in zzso we cloned rabbit zzso and studied its regulation in zzso induced diabetes zzso We amplified and zzso the complete coding sequence of rabbit zzso gene out of a liver zzso library using redundant zzso deduced from other zzso Next, we performed quantitative zzso of zzso to study the tissue distribution of zzso expression and its regulation in an zzso diabetes zzso The putative rabbit zzso protein contains 873 zzso acids and is highly zzso when compared with human zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Particularly high levels of zzso zzso expression were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a significant zzso of zzso zzso in liver zzso zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso of diabetic rabbits compared with zzso zzso zzso expression is induced in diabetic rabbits when compared with zzso This approximately twofold zzso of zzso zzso in rabbit liver parallels previous findings in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso We provide further molecular information about zzso as a potential zzso target and characterize its regulation in an zzso diabetes zzso animal zzso
