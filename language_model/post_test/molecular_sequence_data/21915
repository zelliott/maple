zzso is a neural zzso zzso by cells of the zzso zzso A single zzso gene was identified until very recently in all tested zzso The only exception was zzso in which two close zzso of zzso named zzso and zzso and one gene more zzso from them, zzso were zzso Nevertheless, finding of three zzso zzso was attributed exclusively to specific zzso zzso in the fish evolutionary zzso However, very recently it was shown that zzso zzso have additional zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso Watson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in early development: two zzso genes in a zzso Gene zzso zzso 5, zzso which indicates at least two independent zzso genes in zzso zzso Now we report identification of two novel zzso zzso in each of so evolutionary distant species as zzso zzso chicken and zzso One of these zzso is zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas another, named zzso was not known zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso very resembles that of its counterpart in zzso zzso it begins with zzso at the anterior margin of the neural plate and, afterward, continues mainly in the zzso and zzso zzso At the same time, zzso is expressed starting from the beginning of zzso throughout the zzso with a local expression maximum in the prospective anterior zzso Later, it is widely expressed on the zzso side of zzso including neural tube, eyes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The data presented here demonstrate that the zzso zzso contains at least three distinct zzso zzso
