Previous studies demonstrated that zzso administered zzso incorporating a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso accumulate rapidly and selectively in mouse zzso The present investigation was designed to determine the molecular components in liver responsible for zzso zzso Studies of liver tissue slices demonstrated that zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso but not other tested zzso was distributed along zzso borders of zzso this zzso appeared associated with zzso cells of the zzso and with the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso bound to liver tissue in a pattern similar to the distribution of zzso zzso zzso either after intravenous injection of zzso in zzso or after incubation of zzso with liver slices in zzso Control zzso without the zzso displayed very light binding without a zzso zzso of liver slices with zzso but not zzso or zzso eliminated zzso zzso zzso but did not affect binding of control zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso but not with other zzso markedly inhibited zzso binding to liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso individually were less effective zzso of zzso binding than was zzso These results indicate that zzso containing a zzso from zzso target liver tissue by binding to zzso in the zzso zzso
