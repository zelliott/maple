zzso zzso is one of the zzso clock genes and the key regulator of the zzso system in many organisms, zzso a zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned cycle zzso zzso in zzso zzso We performed zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso deduced from the zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Then the partial clone obtained was used as a probe for screening a zzso library constructed from zzso brains of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and encodes 700 zzso acid zzso The zzso has zzso zzso A and zzso B zzso and the sequence identities for these zzso are 85, 60 and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and 69, 58 and zzso to human zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is 37% identical to that of zzso and zzso to zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso gene was expressed in all the zzso tested, which were head, fat body, silk zzso and zzso Also no significant day, night zzso difference in expression of zzso gene in the head was zzso
