During the zzso maturation of zzso zzso zzso many selected zzso are converted into zzso by a thus far undefined zzso The zzso contains a large number of small zzso zzso that share two zzso sequence zzso box H and zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso relies on short zzso signal sequences that are complementary to sequences in box zzso zzso zzso depletion and zzso studies on zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that box zzso zzso function as guide zzso in zzso zzso These results define a novel function for zzso and further reinforce the idea that base pairing is the most common way to obtain specific zzso interactions during zzso zzso
