The structure of the zzso channel zzso from zzso zzso at zzso resolution suggests a mechanism for zzso zzso regions of a protein zzso during its lateral delivery into the zzso zzso zzso segments of zzso orient the zzso zzso region of another zzso suggesting a general binding mode and a zzso guiding surface capable of accommodating diverse nascent chains at the exit of the zzso zzso To accommodate this putative nascent chain zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a lateral exit portal is opened throughout its entire length for partition of zzso zzso segments to the zzso zzso In this primed channel, the central plug still zzso the pore while the lateral gate is opened, enabling zzso zzso during early protein zzso In zzso a 15 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso fails to rescue a zzso strain, supporting the essential role of this zzso as suggested from the zzso
