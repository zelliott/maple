The human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso type II membrane zzso that functions both as a zzso signaling zzso and as an zzso zzso can transmit positive or negative signals regulating T and B zzso proliferation and differentiation and can zzso convert zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso a potent zzso calcium zzso To begin the genetic analysis of zzso we have isolated and characterized the human zzso zzso previously mapped to zzso zzso Human zzso is zzso by a single copy gene that extends over zzso 62 zzso and consists of eight zzso and seven zzso including a very long zzso that interrupts the zzso coding zzso The zzso upstream region of the gene is characterized by the absence of zzso zzso and zzso boxes, the presence of a zzso tract immediately upstream of the zzso zzso several zzso start sites, and potential binding sites for the zzso zzso factors T zzso zzso factor zzso nuclear zzso and zzso responsive zzso zzso of the zzso structure of human zzso with that of the genes for zzso bone zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which zzso proteins related to zzso in sequence and function, reveals their striking structural zzso This strongly suggests that the three genes evolved from a common zzso from which zzso and bone zzso zzso cell zzso 1 arose by gene zzso before the divergence of humans and zzso
