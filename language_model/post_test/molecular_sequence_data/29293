The role of zzso zzso T zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso disease, a viral model for multiple zzso is not yet zzso To investigate the specificity and function of zzso generated in response to zzso infection, we generated a panel of overlapping zzso peptides encompassing the entire zzso and leader protein region of the zzso strain of zzso zzso of these peptides to zzso and zzso class I molecules of resistant mice was assessed using zzso zzso Several peptides displayed significant binding to zzso zzso or zzso However, zzso zzso T cells in the central nervous system of zzso mice zzso zzso target cells zzso with zzso or zzso a previously defined zzso zzso shared by the zzso strain of zzso and other closely related zzso In addition, at a high zzso cell ratio, two additional peptides zzso and zzso zzso target cells for zzso by zzso T cells or zzso T cells from zzso zzso The minimal zzso within these peptides were defined as zzso and zzso Based on zzso profiles, zzso specific for these zzso zzso are zzso in contrast to zzso for the zzso zzso which are of the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso function towards both of these zzso zzso is restricted by the zzso zzso despite the fact that these zzso bind both zzso and zzso zzso This skewing toward an zzso response may zzso resistance to zzso zzso disease, which is known to be associated with the zzso genetic zzso
