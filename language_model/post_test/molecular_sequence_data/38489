zzso of malaria zzso generate a membrane potential through an electron transport system that is a possible target of zzso and a new zzso drug, zzso However, little information is available for conclusive understanding of the respiratory chain in zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned and characterized from zzso zzso the genes for the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a marker zzso for zzso and links the zzso cycle and respiratory chain zzso Each of the two genes contains a single open reading frame zzso which are located on different zzso 1860 zzso on zzso 10 for zzso and zzso zzso on zzso 12 for zzso The expression of these genes in zzso zzso stage cells was confirmed by observation of zzso and zzso zzso transcripts from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso proteins of zzso zzso and 321 zzso zzso acids with molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso essential for the import of zzso proteins zzso by nuclear DNA, as well as almost all the zzso zzso acids indispensable for zzso binding and the zzso reaction were found in these zzso indicating the functional importance of this zzso in the zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso deletion were found in the zzso acid sequence of zzso This is the first report of the primary structure of the zzso zzso zzso
