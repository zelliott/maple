We have produced a computer program, named zzso that zzso the following zzso zzso Two DNA sequences are given, where the shorter sequence is very similar to some zzso region of the longer zzso zzso determines such a similar region of the longer zzso and then zzso an optimal set of zzso changes zzso zzso deletions or zzso that will convert the shorter sequence to that zzso Thus, the alignment scoring scheme is designed to model sequencing zzso rather than evolutionary zzso The program can align a 100 zzso sequence to a 1 zzso sequence in a few seconds on a zzso provided that there are very few differences between the shorter sequence and some region in the longer zzso The program has been used to assemble sequence data for the zzso Division at the National Center for Biotechnology zzso
