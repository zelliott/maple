We have established a zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso The zzso recognizes a zzso zzso zzso protein that is expressed zzso in the zzso sheath cells near the zzso area of the hair zzso and in the differentiated zzso of the normal adult zzso zzso Upon being cultured in zzso however, the zzso strongly and zzso expressed this novel zzso zzso zzso in spite of low expression level of zzso by the freshly prepared zzso The zzso of zzso was isolated by expression cloning using zzso zzso analysis revealed that it had 242 zzso acid zzso with a signal zzso at the N zzso potential six zzso sites, a characteristic repetitive zzso rich domain, and a possible zzso zzso zzso site near the C zzso We examined various conditions in which expression of zzso was enhanced in zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was expressed accompanying tissue damages of the zzso It was zzso induced in zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso In addition, zzso was also induced in zzso edge zzso zzso during tissue zzso after an excised zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the recovering process from zzso
