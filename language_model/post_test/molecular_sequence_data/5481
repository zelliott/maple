The zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso a respiratory zzso pathogen of humans, was zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso and zzso sequences are zzso The zzso start point and zzso site were zzso The zzso gene contains eight zzso and a zzso zzso that translates a zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as deduced by computer analysis of the zzso zzso The translated protein revealed eight putative zzso zzso The deduced zzso showed comparable levels of zzso to reported zzso of the jack bean plant zzso zzso zzso and zzso of several zzso of bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso III of zzso and was shown to be a single copy gene by Southern zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli resulted in the production of a zzso zzso protein that was recognized in an zzso by zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of a zzso zzso zzso
