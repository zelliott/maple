The surface of zzso zzso shaped zzso bacteria related to the zzso is crowded with the zzso zzso zzso whose structure and function are zzso In this work, the secondary structure of zzso under the form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in water and at the zzso zzso alone or in interaction with zzso zzso was zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso data indicate that zzso in solution contains about zzso of zzso and zzso of beta zzso These zzso are consistent with a consensus zzso analysis of the protein sequence suggesting about zzso of zzso zzso of beta sheets and zzso of irregular zzso Brewster angle zzso zzso revealed that, in water, the zzso slowly zzso to form a stable and homogeneous layer at the zzso zzso exhibiting a surface pressure up to 10 zzso zzso zzso infrared reflection zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso display a complex zzso I band characteristic of a mixture of beta sheets and alpha zzso and an intense zzso II zzso zzso simulations indicate a flat orientation for the beta sheets and a vertical orientation for the alpha zzso with respect to the zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso show that, when zzso lipids are used to form a zzso at the zzso zzso zzso is zzso under this zzso and its zzso beta sheets are mainly parallel to the zzso layer of the lipids without deep zzso of the fatty acid chains zzso Based upon these results, we propose a zzso zzso for zzso organization at the zzso cell zzso In this model, zzso molecules anchored into the outer leaflet of the zzso zzso by their zzso zzso zzso are composed of two zzso zzso (instead of a single zzso zzso situated at the zzso zzso zzso to the very high amount of zzso in the zzso such carpets would cover most if not all the lipids present in the outer leaflet of the zzso
