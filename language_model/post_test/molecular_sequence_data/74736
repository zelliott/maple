A zzso study was performed on strain zzso which was isolated from a soil sample collected from zzso zzso The novel isolate was zzso and zzso zzso were short and zzso zzso Growth temperature ranged from 20 to 28 degrees C and the pH for growth ranged from zzso to zzso The optimum growth temperature and pH were 28 degrees C and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso Cell wall analysis showed zzso zzso containing zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The diagnostic zzso were zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso had less than 97 % similarity to any recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be the closest zzso zzso zzso to the novel zzso Based on the zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel member of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
