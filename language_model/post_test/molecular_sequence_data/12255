Using zzso against zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso cells, we isolated a zzso clone zzso reacting with the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso was zzso zzso and was strongly expressed in the zzso brain, kidney and heart as well as in zzso zzso The size of zzso in the zzso was zzso zzso the zzso clone revealed a putative zzso of 70 zzso which is rich in zzso zzso acids and has a characteristic sequence of zzso The protein also has an zzso zzso which zzso to the rule of binding capability to zzso zzso region zzso The zzso was translated as a fusion protein with zzso and was verified to have calcium binding activity, upon a calcium zzso zzso
