The zzso virus 40 large zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso is a zzso zzso it has been proposed that, in viral DNA zzso two of these zzso are combined to form a zzso zzso that acts zzso at both zzso of a replication zzso In a search for structural components of this zzso complex, we have identified zzso as a specific binding protein for the zzso zzso We show that zzso in zzso with human zzso I, mediates the cohesion of the zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso Our results provide zzso evidence for a direct role of zzso in DNA zzso in addition to its known function in zzso zzso The data presented here suggest that zzso enables the formation of a functional zzso complex at the replication zzso
