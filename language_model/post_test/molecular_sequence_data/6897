The initial differentiation event for the zzso zzso cell lineage occurs as the zzso localized stem cells yield, through zzso the highly zzso zzso amplifying zzso peripheral zzso This differentiation is characterized by the expression of zzso zzso as well as the loss of zzso and zzso All these are zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify and zzso through zzso analysis, changes in cell surface properties associated with zzso 

zzso sections of the zzso area from freshly dissected pigmented rabbit zzso were stained with fluorescent zzso 

Peanut zzso zzso binds to zzso if the Gal zzso is not zzso stained the plasma membrane of all layers of the zzso and zzso but was excluded from zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso acid attached to zzso through zzso bonds in either zzso or zzso stained exclusively zzso cell plasma zzso After complete tissue zzso all zzso plasma zzso became zzso positive with equal stain intensity across both sides of the zzso zzso The binding of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid attached through zzso zzso to the basement membrane displayed a large increase at the zzso side of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells express on the cell surface zzso zzso zzso that are recognized by zzso and that lack any zzso acid bound through zzso zzso The initial differentiation involves zzso of these zzso and the concurrent appearance of zzso zzso acid zzso suggesting expression or zzso of zzso zzso Changes in basement membrane zzso charge, or both may zzso this zzso
