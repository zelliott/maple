The zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso modifications of the protein during zzso present a major problem in terms of zzso and the yield of the drug zzso We report here the structural characterization of these zzso by mass zzso zzso zzso An extensive zzso study was conducted on zzso which is composed of up to zzso of the zzso zzso and on the native zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso generated from the two samples were analyzed by liquid zzso zzso and targeted peptides were further studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso was zzso as a novel zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso where the zzso bond between zzso and zzso was fully reduced and the other zzso bond pair, zzso was partially zzso Similarly, zzso was identified as a correctly zzso zzso zzso with zzso on zzso and zzso was identified as an zzso form zzso of partially reduced zzso zzso that was zzso on zzso Based on the characterization work, a zzso conversion procedure was successfully implemented to convert zzso to zzso zzso
