A recent study has shown that the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso B zzso factor is commonly associated with two molecules of a zzso protein zzso and that zzso appears to be required for zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso I zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso serves as a zzso for I zzso zzso zzso of I zzso B with zzso zzso prevented I zzso B from zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso Furthermore, excess zzso could very efficiently activate the zzso form of zzso B composed of zzso zzso and I zzso B, presumably by binding the I zzso B, which was released from the complex due to its inherent off zzso An additional function of zzso in modulating the zzso specificity of zzso was zzso In the absence of zzso zzso could bind with high affinity to completely zzso zzso The zzso recognized these sites with an affinity greater than zzso lower but preferred the less zzso zzso zzso B zzso The affinity of zzso for the most frequent zzso B motif zzso was enhanced twofold by zzso to yield a zzso constant of approximately 4 zzso zzso zzso This study describes novel functions for a zzso accessory protein of a zzso factor in controlling its zzso and zzso zzso
