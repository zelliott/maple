We took advantage of a zzso zzso procedure to isolate a set of zzso clones of zzso genes zzso zzso from developing soybean root zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso with a large excess of zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected and used to screen zzso zzso zzso By this procedure we isolated several novel zzso zzso clones together with most of the zzso zzso previously zzso Four novel zzso zzso which were expressed long before the onset of nitrogen zzso were further zzso zzso and zzso transcripts appeared in the roots less than 3 days after zzso and zzso with zzso but zzso transcripts were also detected at very low levels in the stems of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso first appeared at zzso days, just before zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the predicted products of zzso zzso and zzso exhibited no significant zzso to proteins identified so zzso The zzso zzso protein has a limited but significant zzso to some plant zzso suggesting that it is a zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso transcripts first appeared in the zzso cells of the root stele near the infected zzso During zzso emergence they were found in a few cell layers surrounding the vascular strands connecting the zzso zzso with the root zzso and in mature zzso they were present specifically in the zzso cells in vascular zzso These observations led us to zzso that zzso gene products play a role in the transport and/or degradation of zzso On the other hand, zzso transcripts first appeared in the primary zzso zzso just below the root zzso In mature zzso they were only present in the infected zzso
