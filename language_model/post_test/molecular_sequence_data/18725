zzso protein A zzso binds zzso and zzso clan zzso zzso of human and animal zzso zzso with each of its five zzso binding zzso zzso thereby supporting zzso zzso escape from zzso killing and suppressing zzso B cell zzso The zzso zzso cannot bind zzso yet retains zzso properties that elicit zzso zzso and disease protection in mice, whereas zzso zzso infection or zzso cannot elicit zzso zzso As a test for this model, we analyzed here zzso zzso which was isolated from zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso binds only the first zzso zzso but not any of the other four zzso zzso and its binding can neutralize only the E domain of zzso which does not provide disease protection in zzso These results are in agreement with a model zzso zzso zzso generates a limited zzso response without zzso and/or disease protective zzso
