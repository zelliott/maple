zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that functions as an zzso negative global regulator in zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso the synthesis of diphtheria zzso zzso zzso and other components of the zzso iron zzso zzso Three zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were reported zzso In this study, we identified and characterized three additional zzso zzso from zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso When zzso was expressed from these three new zzso operators in zzso coli containing zzso on zzso zzso levels were zzso to zzso lower during zzso growth than during zzso zzso In gel shift zzso the mobility of DNA fragments containing each zzso decreased in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso protected zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, from zzso by zzso zzso In the zzso core of each zzso 12 or 13 zzso matched the consensus for the zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso by the open reading frames zzso downstream from zzso and zzso were zzso respectively, to several bacterial zzso regulators and to the deduced zzso zzso by an zzso located between the zzso coli genes for zzso replication protein N and zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso by the zzso downstream from zzso was not zzso to any sequence in the protein database at the National Center for Biotechnology zzso When the zzso downstream from zzso and zzso were expressed under the control of the zzso zzso promoter in zzso coli, zzso products of the predicted sizes were detected in small amounts by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso
