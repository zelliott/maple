A zzso of zinc finger proteins containing a unique protein motif called the positive regulatory zzso domain has been zzso The members include the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene products, and the zzso interacting protein zzso Here we describe a member of this family, zzso that exhibits several distinctive zzso First, zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso and is redistributed from the zzso to the nucleus after nerve growth factor zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to the nucleus was specific for zzso as zzso binding to the zzso zzso did not lead to nuclear zzso of zzso Thus, zzso provides a downstream zzso for the effects of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Under normal growth conditions, zzso was found predominantly in the zzso On zzso zzso also zzso into the zzso A direct correlation between nuclear expression of zzso with the loss of zzso incorporation was zzso These results imply that zzso may be involved in events associated with growth zzso
