zzso laser zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso a zzso method for the characterization of peptides and zzso was used for analysis of protected zzso zzso It is shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, frequently used in zzso zzso of zzso causes partial zzso of zzso zzso protecting zzso Because this effect is strongly related to the zzso used, the observed zzso can be avoided by choosing an appropriate zzso such as zzso or zzso The advantage of neutral zzso compounds for zzso analysis of protected peptides is clearly demonstrated, confirming the potential of zzso mass zzso
