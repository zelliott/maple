The zzso zzso protein zzso soluble in zzso contains at least two separate zzso zzso The zzso form zzso I) was isolated, zzso after reduction, and submitted to structural zzso Its highly zzso nature complicated zzso zzso zzso and sequence zzso Acid zzso in 6 M zzso for 7 days was necessary for release of zzso zzso in full zzso zzso was the only zzso found to cleave the zzso protein and was used to complement zzso generation by chemical zzso with zzso The primary structure deduced consists of 79 zzso with 8 zzso zzso and a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, 11 zzso are charged at zzso zzso and all properties of the primary structure are not entirely outstanding in relation to those of other zzso zzso zzso coupled with a presumably tight folding from the presence of zzso bridges, probably explain the unusual properties and the zzso in organic zzso
