zzso is a novel gene family restricted to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso paired domain is highly zzso from other zzso zzso zzso and we were unable to identify an zzso zzso by zzso sequence zzso However, conservation of a paired domain zzso suggests that the zzso genes arose by zzso and divergence from an ancestral zzso zzso We have identified zzso genes in zzso zzso a zzso a zzso and a zzso indicating that the founding gene zzso occurred before the separation of those zzso and therefore early in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has two genes in this family, zzso and zzso which are expressed during embryonic zzso zzso is present in the zzso as a localized maternal transcript, and both show dynamic patterns of apparently zzso expression during later zzso These later expression patterns differ significantly, but both genes are expressed broadly in the zzso and also in the central nervous system during zzso
