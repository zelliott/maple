zzso is an alternative zzso factor specific for class 3 zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we randomly cloned zzso coli DNA fragments, which showed zzso promoter zzso Among the DNA fragments zzso one was found to be derived from a zzso zzso zzso analysis with the zzso zzso coli library indicated that this DNA zzso is located at around zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso where no zzso gene has been reported zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that it contains an zzso zzso sequence followed by an open reading frame zzso that can zzso a zzso zzso A zzso zzso sequence follows this zzso This putative gene was named zzso A gene zzso was constructed by inserting the zzso gene cassette into the zzso gene on the zzso This zzso was found to be actively zzso suggesting that this gene is unlikely to be involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
