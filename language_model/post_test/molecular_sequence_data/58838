Major zzso complex zzso class zzso cell lines which lack zzso expression accumulate class II molecules associated with residual zzso zzso chain fragments zzso zzso zzso chain peptides zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from class zzso complexes, promoting binding of zzso zzso Here the physical interaction of zzso with zzso molecules was zzso zzso complexes with class II molecules were zzso zzso in cells, zzso at the time when the class II molecules entered the zzso class II zzso zzso alpha beta zzso newly released from I chain, and those associated with I chain fragments, were found to associate with zzso in zzso zzso zzso DR molecules also associated at a low zzso These same species, but not zzso chain complexes, were also shown to bind to zzso zzso molecules in zzso zzso interaction was zzso superior with DR molecules isolated in association with zzso zzso complexes generated by zzso zzso with zzso DR alpha beta zzso contained virtually no associated zzso suggesting that this superior interaction reflects a prolonged zzso association with empty class II zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha beta zzso in the presence of zzso was found to prolong their ability to bind subsequently added zzso zzso zzso of empty class II molecules may be an important property of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
