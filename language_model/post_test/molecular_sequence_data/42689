We have zzso by zzso formation zzso single stranded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso sequencing the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso forms of the aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso present in zzso strains of zzso The zzso zzso found in the zzso and zzso zzso encodes a 95 zzso zzso with an affinity for zzso zzso times higher than the affinity of the 104 zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso Five overlapping fragments of the zzso coding sequence were obtained from liver zzso by reverse zzso synthesis of a zzso first zzso followed by zzso chain reaction amplification of these zzso sequences zzso Analysis by zzso and zzso revealed the presence of sequence differences in three of the five zzso When the complete zzso sequence of the coding regions was determined by zzso sequencing, we found a total of ten zzso differences between the two zzso nine of which localized to the three fragments where differences were detected by zzso and zzso Five of the differences are zzso Of the other five, one changes the zzso termination zzso in zzso to the zzso for zzso in zzso extending translation of the zzso by 43 zzso acids and accounting for the larger size of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso One of the four remaining differences causes the replacement of a zzso zzso in zzso by a zzso zzso in zzso and breaks a potential zzso near the zzso zzso zzso it is likely that structural changes associated with this zzso acid change are responsible for the differences in zzso affinity observed between the zzso receptors of these two strains of zzso
