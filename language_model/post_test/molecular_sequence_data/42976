An efficient zzso typing method for the highly zzso zzso genes is described for zzso like zzso sheep and zzso By means of the zzso chain reaction, the second zzso of zzso is amplified as well as part of the adjacent zzso containing a mixed simple repeat zzso Using this primer combination we were able to amplify the zzso zzso 2 and adjacent zzso from all of the investigated 10 species of the family of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso genes of novel zzso species can also be readily zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso of zzso zzso genes are used with which sequences differing in at least one single base can be zzso zzso zzso was found to be correlated with the zzso lengths and the patterns of the repeat zzso Hence zzso zzso specific for different simple repeats and zzso positions serve also for typing across species zzso The strict correlation of sequence length and zzso zzso permits a zzso of specific zzso for zzso Thus more than 20 zzso can already be differentiated from each of the three zzso
