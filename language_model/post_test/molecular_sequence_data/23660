zzso is one of the most potent and zzso antibiotics against bacterial zzso Its zzso activity is due to its ability to bind to the beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene have been characterized in zzso zzso strains of zzso coli and zzso zzso The genetic bases of zzso in zzso zzso are still zzso In the present study, the zzso sequences of the zzso gene of the zzso vaccine strain zzso zzso zzso and of 20 zzso clones derived in our laboratory from two zzso zzso zzso were zzso These sequences were then compared to those of the respective zzso zzso parental strains and to the published zzso zzso strain zzso All zzso strains carried one or more zzso zzso mapping in two regions of the zzso zzso These two zzso regions were investigated in eight additional zzso zzso laboratory zzso and in 20 reference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in all zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso zzso were found in any analyzed zzso zzso Our results represent the first from a study of the molecular characterization of zzso zzso in resistant zzso strains and provide an additional proof of the association of specific zzso zzso with the development of the zzso zzso in zzso In addition, because of the relationship between zzso and the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso studies of zzso in these zzso may provide useful information about the genetic basis of zzso in zzso
