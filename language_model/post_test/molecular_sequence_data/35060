zzso zzso is known to be regulated largely by zzso and zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso family including zzso hormone zzso and zzso The surge of zzso zzso and/or zzso A zzso the zzso process through binding to its zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To better understand the role of zzso in the zzso regulation, the full-length zzso of the blue zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso and their expression levels were determined in both zzso and zzso at various zzso zzso zzso show the expression of four putative zzso of zzso and zzso which differ in the length of the open reading frame but share the same domain structures as in typical nuclear zzso zzso zzso HR, zzso and zzso The putative zzso zzso are derived from a zzso insert in the zzso and a zzso zzso substitution in the zzso In contrast, an zzso of a zzso and/or a zzso in the zzso and zzso gives rise to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso show the zzso of zzso and zzso but at the different zzso In the zzso the expression levels of zzso are 3-5 times higher than those of zzso while in zzso zzso are zzso times higher than zzso A zzso response to the changes in the levels of zzso zzso indicates that these zzso may have differences in the sensitivity or responsiveness to zzso The presence of upstream open reading frame and internal zzso entry site in zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso analyzed by in zzso indicates a zzso strong zzso of the translation of these zzso
