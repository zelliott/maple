The zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid and, in certain circumstances, transient increase in zzso in response to stimuli that activate protein zzso zzso We have investigated the zzso zzso activity responsible for reversing the zzso of zzso In zzso zzso protein zzso 1, 2A and zzso zzso zzso and zzso all zzso zzso zzso or a synthetic zzso based on its zzso site zzso In intact Swiss zzso cells, zzso acid, a specific inhibitor of zzso and zzso had little effect on zzso zzso on its own, but largely prevented the zzso of zzso that occurred following zzso of protein zzso C by zzso with subsequent zzso zzso These results indicate that although the zzso of zzso can be zzso by zzso in zzso this protein is zzso by zzso zzso zzso in the intact zzso
