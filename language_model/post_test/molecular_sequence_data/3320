Previously characterized zzso zzso zzso to zzso virus A zzso showed a differential zzso against intact or partially zzso virus particles zzso In the present study, this differential zzso was confirmed and several peptides reacting with a panel of four different zzso were identified by the zzso method of zzso zzso zzso sequences comprised between coat protein zzso 61 zzso and 72 zzso were recognized by all the zzso zzso One of these peptides zzso was also zzso when expressed on zzso zzso particles as a fusion protein with protein zzso The specificity of this sequence for zzso binding was also demonstrated by zzso using one of the GVA zzso The results of this study suggest that GVA particles carry a highly structured zzso centered on a common zzso region of the coat protein zzso
