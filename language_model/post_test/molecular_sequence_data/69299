Short zzso zzso zzso are known to inhibit the zzso of several enveloped zzso Recently, it was shown that they inhibited the fusion of zzso virus with zzso zzso zzso as well as the low zzso fusion of these zzso with each other zzso zzso Flanagan, zzso zzso Young, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Therefore it was concluded that the peptides inhibit membrane fusion, an important step in viral zzso Here, it is shown that this zzso and a series of similar peptides did not inhibit influenza virus fusion with zzso or other zzso In fact, some peptides enhanced the overall rate of fusion of influenza virus with zzso zzso In our hands, the peptides did not inhibit influenza zzso in zzso canine kidney cells or zzso zzso zzso They also did not inhibit the zzso fusion between zzso or zzso zzso However, the zzso effect of one of the peptides on the fusion of zzso virus with zzso zzso and on zzso zzso fusion could be zzso These data indicate that the peptides do not, as had been suggested zzso zzso Young, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso act by preventing the formation of zzso structures with small zzso of zzso such as the zzso phase zzso that are thought to be involved in zzso zzso The results also suggest that the mechanism of zzso of zzso virus infection and zzso fusion by the peptides may be different after zzso
