The study on the evolutionary consequences of an zzso viral population's fluctuations can be approached by in zzso zzso This work describes the fitness recovery of zzso after 20 zzso passages in 10 zzso zzso The serial passages promoted an increase in viral zzso In addition, we detected a significant number of zzso fixed in the complete zzso consensus sequence of the final viral zzso Among the zzso events of zzso evolution with important zzso characteristics occurred in several independent zzso One common change, zzso in the nuclear zzso signal of the zzso protein appeared in four viruses of three different zzso Other common zzso mapped in position zzso of the reverse zzso or in position zzso of the zzso loop of the zzso zzso that is associated with the zzso zzso Together with this zzso analysis, we studied the zzso zzso of the initial and final zzso revealing that fitness increase correlated with an zzso in the genetic zzso of viral zzso However, while zzso was mostly composed of synonymous zzso zzso in the first 10 passages performed, at passage 21 it switched to zzso zzso zzso with significant differences in zzso - zzso values between passages 11 and zzso In zzso the zzso in zzso fitness recovery depicts a zzso process occurring first by generation of zzso followed by fixation of the beneficial ones, depicting a classical zzso zzso
