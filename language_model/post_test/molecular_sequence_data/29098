zzso comparison of the type zzso zzso zzso protein revealed two regions with high similarity in the first zzso zzso and third zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso loop contains functionally important sites that have been identified by zzso zzso we applied this method to corresponding sites in the zzso zzso The accessibility of novel zzso by zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were fully inhibited after zzso zzso exposure, whereas other zzso showed marginal reductions in zzso zzso None showed significant functional loss after exposure to zzso zzso zzso which suggested a zzso of zzso zzso Compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed altered zzso leak zzso whereas zzso exhibited decreased apparent zzso zzso To delineate the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso other zzso at this site were zzso Only two zzso yielded significant zzso zzso and inward zzso currents with decreased zzso zzso for the others, zzso application suppressed only the zzso zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso sites contribute to the transport zzso and that site zzso is implicated in defining the transport zzso
