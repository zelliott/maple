zzso zzso zzso zzso are regulated in a complex fashion during spore zzso and zzso zzso Species of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 500 zzso zzso are found which are expressed zzso during different stages of zzso DNA zzso analysis indicates that zzso genes constitute a zzso family of at least six zzso zzso representing all the zzso zzso transcripts were isolated and zzso The zzso zzso are organized as tandem repeats of the 76 zzso acid zzso unit zzso zzso We isolated one zzso containing seven of these tandem repeats, and two different five- and zzso zzso In addition, 2 zzso containing a single zzso repeat fused at its 3' end to an unrelated 52 and 78 zzso acid extension were zzso There is a remarkable similarity in the sequences of the zzso extensions among zzso and zzso zzso The extensions are very zzso containing approximately zzso zzso Another common feature of these proteins is the presence of a common structural motif containing zzso zzso at zzso positions, suggesting a metal binding domain that matches a consensus sequence of zzso zzso factor zzso and other zzso acid binding zzso The characterization of zzso zzso and zzso sequences in zzso zzso now makes the understanding of its zzso regulation zzso
