We describe the identification and characterization of a new gene deleted in the zzso zzso gene zzso This gene is predominantly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso libraries enabled us to obtain the zzso full-length transcript, which shows a zzso open reading zzso Since the resulting zzso zzso has a single putative zzso domain and a weak but suggestive zzso with zzso zzso a protein associated with the zzso zzso channel zzso we named this new gene zzso zzso To obtain greater insight into this new member of an apparently distinct protein family, we have identified and characterized the zzso mouse gene zzso which encodes a zzso of 143 zzso acids with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression pattern of mouse zzso in the developing zzso revealed strong signal in zzso in the zzso neural crest cells of zzso nerves, in the zzso and in the zzso layer of the zzso The specific distribution in adult zzso the putative channel function, and the expression zzso in the developing mouse zzso suggest that zzso could be involved in the development of the cardiac abnormalities as well as of some neurological signs observed in patients with zzso zzso gene zzso
