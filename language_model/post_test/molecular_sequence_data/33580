zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of freshwater and brackish water zzso distributed in zzso The genetic zzso of 40 samples representing 12 populations from north, south, and central Mexico, and 1 from Costa zzso was estimated by sequencing 2 nuclear genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso including the domain zzso + zzso The length of both genes ranged from 700 to zzso base pairs zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The genetic divergence among populations ranged from zzso to zzso with zzso and from zzso to zzso with zzso zzso likelihood and maximum zzso analyses were performed for each data set and also for 2 combined data sets zzso + zzso zzso with and without zzso showing strong similarities among trees, with high zzso support in all zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso zzso represents a complex of cryptic species, which is composed of at least 3 zzso The first zzso corresponding with zzso zzso shows a wide distribution, including localities from northeastern Mexico, zzso through central and zzso Mexico, and further down to Costa zzso This lineage is associated with zzso zzso in strictly freshwater zzso zzso 2 and 3 are distributed in brackish water systems along the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific slopes, zzso both are associated with zzso fishes, and apparently represent 2 cryptic zzso The diversification of the zzso and zzso lineages seems to be the result of independent zzso events from the ancestral zzso
