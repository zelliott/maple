A zzso form of human zzso 10 zzso has been engineered for detailed zzso studies on zzso and its zzso zzso Wild type zzso zzso is a domain swapped zzso whose structural integrity depends on the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso was converted to a zzso zzso by inserting 6 zzso acids into the loop connecting the swapped secondary structural zzso zzso of zzso by mass zzso size exclusion zzso zzso and circular zzso shows that zzso is a stable zzso zzso at zzso pH whose three-dimensional structure closely resembles one domain of zzso As previously reported, incubation of zzso with a soluble form of the zzso zzso generates a complex that consists of 2 zzso molecules and 4 zzso In contrast, zzso forms a zzso complex with the zzso zzso of the interaction using zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso zzso and yielded a zzso constant of 30 zzso with an apparent binding zzso of zzso zzso Despite forming a zzso complex, zzso is biologically active in cellular proliferation zzso These results indicate that the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso is sufficient for recruiting the signal zzso zzso chain zzso into the signaling complex and zzso zzso cellular zzso
