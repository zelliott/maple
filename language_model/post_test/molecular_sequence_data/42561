We developed the computer system zzso for analysis and recognition of the functional sites in DNA and zzso zzso It reveals contextual features essential for site function and thus enable the user to design efficient methods for recognition of the functional zzso We mainly considered only quantitative characteristics reflecting the uneven distribution of zzso in the sequences of functional sites of zzso The approach suggested makes use of available information about the zzso organization of the functional sites, and ensures highly precise prediction of the zzso The present analysis is concerned with the human donor and zzso zzso zzso A method for recognizing these sites in the sequences with an accuracy of approximately zzso was zzso
