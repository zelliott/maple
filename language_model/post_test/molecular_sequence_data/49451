B cell differentiation into a plasma cell requires expression of the positive regulatory domain zinc finger protein 1 gene zzso that encodes the positive regulatory domain I binding factor 1 zzso or zzso zzso It zzso the zzso of specific target zzso including zzso the zzso class II zzso zzso and zzso In this study we demonstrate the presence of an alternative protein product of the zzso zzso The new zzso zzso zzso has a disrupted zzso domain and lacks the zzso 101 zzso of the originally described zzso zzso beta has a dramatic loss of repressive function on multiple target zzso but maintains normal zzso activity, nuclear zzso and association with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines express the highest levels of zzso beta zzso relative to the full-length form, while primary cells and several other cell lines have very low, but zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso analysis and analysis of the zzso promoters demonstrate that zzso beta is generated from the same gene by alternative zzso initiation using an internal zzso These newly described features of the zzso gene are highly analogous to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in which each express a truncated protein missing the zzso zzso The expression of each of the truncated proteins is elevated in zzso cells and may play an important role in the zzso
