zzso of the zzso zzso am zzso zzso zzso gene is controlled by two upstream zzso elements designated zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso alpha is localized between - zzso and - zzso zzso with respect to the major zzso start zzso zzso of a 90 zzso sequence containing this element resulted in the loss of approximately 50% of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analysis indicated that a nuclear protein from zzso binds in a specific manner to sequences within the 90 zzso zzso We have now used a combination of zzso and affinity zzso to purify this nuclear zzso which we call Am Alpha zzso protein zzso The activity was monitored by gel shift zzso The protein was zzso more than zzso with a yield of approximately zzso The zzso protein appears as a zzso on zzso zzso gel zzso with only two strong bands visible in zzso zzso One band has an apparent molecular mass of 40 zzso the other appears as a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 30 zzso zzso I protection analysis indicated a protected region consisting of 30 zzso which contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif abolished the binding of zzso to the DNA zzso
