The human zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso gene encodes a zzso zinc finger zzso which was identified via the zzso zzso zzso fusing it to the zzso acid zzso alpha zzso gene in zzso zzso To determine its complete zzso zzso we constructed a zzso fully containing the zzso zzso The gene has seven zzso including a novel zzso untranslated zzso varying in size from 87 to zzso and spans at least zzso zzso zzso sequences were identified and all zzso zzso and donor sites zzso to the zzso zzso Five zzso markers could be fine located in its zzso These data will facilitate zzso analysis of zzso in zzso zzso cases, as well as assist mapping and zzso zzso Here we have tested zzso as a possible candidate for the zzso locus involved in zzso head and neck zzso However, zzso analysis revealed no aberration in 12 zzso patients from different zzso
