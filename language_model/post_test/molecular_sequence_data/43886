The zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are zzso zzso zzso Field inversion gel zzso and zzso mapping indicate that there are 19 zzso genes arranged in a tandem zzso Five genes from the array have been zzso and their expression zzso The first two zzso zzso and zzso differ significantly from the remaining 17 copies zzso in that: 1) they are expressed predominantly in zzso zzso (the form in the insect zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso rather than zzso (the form that zzso zzso 2) they zzso zzso with a zzso in the zzso extension, an unusual feature of these zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso into a zzso zzso zzso resulted in expression of an active zzso that was shown by zzso labeling with zzso zzso to be targeted to large zzso This demonstrates that the zzso acid zzso extension is not essential for the zzso or activity of the zzso or for its correct zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso of different copies of zzso and analysis of the zzso of the lines showed that individual zzso differ in their zzso preferences and ability to restore the loss of zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences of the zzso implicates five zzso located in the mature domain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with differences in the activities of the zzso zzso The results suggest that the individual zzso have distinct roles in the zzso interaction with its zzso This complexity reflects the adaptation of zzso zzso zzso zzso to diverse functions in zzso zzso
