In a search for an zzso muscle from which the muscle regulatory proteins could be obtained in a great quantity and at high zzso the regulatory zzso zzso zzso and three zzso of zzso zzso have been isolated from the lobster tail muscle, zzso and partially zzso The zzso zzso of lobster zzso was restored when zzso lobster zzso and lobster zzso were added to zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that the lobster muscle contains zzso zzso zzso with a zzso ratio zzso and that lobster zzso consists of three zzso one of each I, C and zzso Each zzso was identified according to its effect on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso composition in each fraction of zzso zzso zzso and in zzso are different from the rabbit skeletal muscle zzso zzso consists of a single species of zzso of zzso zzso the zzso fraction appears to be homogeneous with zzso zzso the zzso fraction contains five zzso all showing similar zzso zzso differing in zzso in the range from 28,000 to zzso two zzso zzso contain three zzso in total with a range of zzso from zzso to zzso Further study of the lobster zzso zzso that zzso by zzso A gave rise to a homogeneous preparation of truncated and zzso zzso which is devoid of 11 zzso at the zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of 11 zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso generated from zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study indicated that, despite zzso zzso to the occurrence of zzso the lobster regulatory proteins serve as an zzso source of the proteins for structural and zzso studies, alternative to zzso zzso
