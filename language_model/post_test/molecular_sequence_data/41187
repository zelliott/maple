zzso assembly proteins zzso are zzso zzso with vital roles in zzso assembly and zzso Decoding of zzso zzso modifications by zzso zzso is central in regulation of gene zzso We zzso binding zzso in zzso complexes using zzso zzso interaction zzso and chemical shift zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso enhanced zzso interactions while zzso modifications like zzso zzso and zzso diminished zzso zzso recognition regions in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lie in core regions of the zzso zzso and form a surface exposed zzso zzso zzso binding sites on zzso and zzso fall on opposite surfaces of zzso zzso and the latter can therefore accommodate two zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso overlap with route of wrapped DNA on zzso zzso zzso zzso residency on the zzso by either zzso or zzso Using zzso we mapped zzso zzso that undergo chemical shift zzso in presence of zzso zzso Taken together, we provide an architectural model of a zzso complex which likely forms during zzso zzso
