The zzso zzso zzso beta zzso precursor contains redundant zzso protein import information at its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To define the critical sequence and structural features contained within this zzso zzso one of the redundant regions (representing a minimal targeting zzso was subjected to zzso cassette zzso Each of 97 different zzso zzso zzso containing single (32 zzso double zzso zzso or triple (20 zzso point zzso was inserted in front of a zzso gene lacking the coding sequence for its normal import signal zzso 1 through 34 were zzso The zzso and zzso consequences of these zzso were then evaluated in a zzso strain deleted for its normal zzso gene zzso zzso zzso with the lack of an obvious consensus sequence for zzso protein import signals, many zzso occurring throughout the minimal targeting sequence did not significantly affect its import zzso However, some zzso did result in severe import zzso In these zzso zzso precursor accumulated in the zzso and the zzso cells exhibited a zzso defective zzso Although point zzso have previously been identified that block zzso protein import in zzso a subset of the zzso reported here represents the first single zzso zzso that have been demonstrated to significantly block zzso protein import in zzso The previous lack of such zzso in the zzso precursor apparently relates to the presence of redundant import information in this import zzso Together, our zzso define a set of constraints that appear to be critical for normal activity of this (and possibly zzso import zzso These include the zzso zzso zzso signals that exhibit a zzso moment greater than zzso for the predicted zzso zzso zzso of this sequence direct near normal levels of zzso import zzso at least two basic zzso are necessary for efficient signal function, zzso zzso zzso acids actively interfere with import zzso and zzso zzso zzso also interfere with signal zzso These experimental observations provide support for zzso protein import models in which both the structure and charge of the import signal play a critical role in directing zzso protein targeting and zzso
