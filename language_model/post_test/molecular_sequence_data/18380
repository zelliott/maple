We have examined the activity of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso in extracts from stressed and zzso zzso at various stages of development using DNA mobility shift zzso A specific interaction between zzso and a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso element zzso of the zzso zzso gene was greatly enhanced in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso binding was zzso at all zzso stages examined including zzso transition zzso stages which are incapable of expressing zzso zzso In zzso experiments with both zzso and zzso stage zzso the zzso of zzso binding was rapid and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso stage zzso from heat stress resulted in a rapid loss of binding zzso The molecular mass of zzso as determined by comparative gel zzso of zzso factor was 88 zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso stage zzso These experiments suggest that zzso derived zzso is stored in zzso zzso in a zzso form and may function in the regulation of zzso genes immediately after the zzso
