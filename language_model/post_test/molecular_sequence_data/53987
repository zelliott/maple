A zzso zzso complex was modeled from the known structure of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cluster zzso In the complex model, the side chains of 15 zzso and zzso zzso region zzso zzso and the main chains of two zzso zzso zzso contact the zzso zzso Among 15 zzso zzso which contact zzso in the model, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been confirmed in a previous zzso To test the accuracy of the zzso model, further zzso zzso was performed by zzso scanning on the remaining 12 zzso that are predicted in the model to have zzso interactions with zzso Of these 12 zzso eight that are all from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had significantly reduced zzso zzso and four consisting of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso retained zzso zzso zzso On the whole, this evidence suggests that the complex model, although not perfect, is correct in many of its zzso In a more general zzso these results lend credibility to the zzso modeling approach for the study of the molecular basis of zzso zzso
