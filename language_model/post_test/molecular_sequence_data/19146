zzso zzso have developed zzso mechanisms to control zzso intake and zzso Here we show that a major zzso zzso by zzso zzso previously reported as zzso of unknown function zzso and as zzso considered to be a zzso defense zzso belonging to the family of zzso proteins zzso is in fact a zzso zzso The zzso nature of the zzso protein was revealed in two independent zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso and subsequent analysis by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the binding ability of the synthetic protein to zzso in zzso By zzso analysis, we have observed that zzso is produced by zzso cells and transported to other zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso is absent both in the zzso cells and in the zzso of zzso but it can be released through the zzso surface to the external zzso where it binds to free zzso molecules zzso by the zzso after zzso zzso zzso that are close zzso of the zzso zzso are present in other zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we observed that synthetic zzso binds to zzso with zzso zzso and an apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrated that formation of synthetic zzso complexes inhibited zzso degradation by hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso activity in zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be involved in zzso zzso in zzso
