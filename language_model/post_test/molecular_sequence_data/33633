zzso cell division systems that include zzso are found throughout zzso zzso arose from an zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso However, how the zzso division system was established from bacterial division is not zzso Here, we have isolated intact zzso division zzso zzso from the primitive red zzso zzso zzso and identified a bacterial zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso structure of MD machinery with zzso zzso contains a predicted zzso transit signal and two zzso regions and has partial zzso with the bacterial division protein zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso accumulates to form a ring structure that zzso with zzso beneath the inner zzso zzso proteins are expressed just before zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso then appears at the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction analysis and transient expression of zzso against zzso showed that zzso interacts with zzso to constitute the zzso structure of the MD machinery and is required for zzso zzso We also demonstrate compelling functional similarity between bacterial zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the bacterial cell division system was incorporated into the MD machinery with zzso of bacterial division proteins during zzso
