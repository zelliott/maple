zzso are interesting candidates for the development of zzso zzso Most zzso are zzso by a comparatively broad zzso spectrum, yet highly specific zzso exist as zzso A specific zzso zzso has, zzso been described for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Isolation of zzso from their natural source instead of a zzso expression renders the isolation more challenging, as common tools such as affinity tags are no longer zzso In this contribution, we develop zzso procedures for such isolation zzso The previously described zzso zzso was isolated by two procedures, one based on affinity zzso the other on zzso Neither procedure yielded an active zzso In addition two zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso were found in the cell free zzso which had not been described zzso Both zzso could be isolated to near purity by a sequence of zzso and zzso exchange zzso The new zzso zzso requires zzso with calcium and zzso zzso in order to become zzso The zzso shows no zzso with zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso into formaldehyde, hence it could become a technical catalyst for the inverse zzso This zzso consists of two types of zzso and may be one of the rare zzso zzso
