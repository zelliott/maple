This study presents a design of a highly potent and competitive zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major regulatory zzso of cholesterol zzso and the target zzso of many investigations aimed at lowering the rate of cholesterol zzso In previous studies, the two zzso peptides zzso and zzso were isolated and identified from soy zzso Based on these zzso zzso a number of peptides were designed previously by using the correlation between the zzso flexibility and zzso The design method that was applied in previous studies was slightly modified for the purpose of the current research and 12 new peptides were designed and zzso Among all zzso zzso showed the highest ability to inhibit zzso A kinetic analysis revealed that this zzso is a competitive inhibitor of zzso with an equilibrium constant of inhibitor binding (K zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso This is an overall zzso increase in zzso activity compared to the first isolated zzso zzso from zzso zzso data support a zzso of the designed peptides close to the zzso zzso of the previously zzso active zzso
