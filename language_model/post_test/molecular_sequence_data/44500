zzso and zzso zzso genes are involved in the development and the maintenance of the nervous zzso They all zzso proteins that contain three zzso recognition motifs zzso and are thus expected to play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were reported to be exclusively distributed in zzso of zzso whereas known human Hu proteins display a zzso nuclear and zzso zzso We have previously isolated a member of this family in zzso zzso that is exclusively expressed in neural zzso from the early zzso stage zzso In the present study, we report on the zzso distribution of zzso protein using zzso zzso zzso a strategy allowing the study of a single member of the zzso zzso We show that the zzso distribution of zzso zzso protein in neural zzso depends on zzso zzso In the neural tube at the zzso stage, where zzso zzso is not zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is localized in both the nucleus and the zzso At the zzso stage, where zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is localized essentially in the zzso of neural tube zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to the nucleus at all stages in zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso proteins in different species may have functional zzso
