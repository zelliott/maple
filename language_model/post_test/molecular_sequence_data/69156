In zzso heat shock factor zzso is a zzso that binds DNA zzso but only supports high levels of zzso upon heat zzso The zzso regions of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso yet both contain strong zzso which are correctly regulated when zzso for each zzso We have performed high resolution mapping of these zzso zzso which shows that in zzso zzso zzso activity can be located to a confined short domain, while in zzso zzso zzso two separate regions are required for full zzso zzso of the zzso zzso reveals zzso as both overlap potential zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso with a distribution of zzso zzso similar to two highly zzso zzso zzso which mediate zzso zzso zzso A and zzso In higher zzso a zzso zzso zzso is required to maintain zzso in a zzso and non zzso state under normal conditions and we therefore address the regulatory roles of the three zzso zzso motifs in zzso zzso the longest and most zzso of the zzso region zzso A, is zzso for regulation, zzso of a single zzso in zzso B makes zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the situation in higher zzso disruption of zzso C has no zzso regulatory effect and therefore, although an zzso contact between zzso B and C cannot be ruled out, such contact is not required for restraining the zzso zzso zzso We zzso find that deletions which abolish zzso potential of the zzso render the host strain temperature zzso However, deletion of a double zzso motif in the zzso whilst leaving zzso unable to respond to heat zzso does not cause temperature zzso This result demonstrates that independent mechanisms control the transient and sustained activities of zzso
