We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to bind to and zzso the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso can inhibit the zzso and activity of the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is dependent on the prior zzso of zzso by zzso and occurs on zzso and zzso zzso adjacent to the basic region important for zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso both the zzso form of zzso zzso and the single zzso form zzso zzso indicates that the interaction between zzso and zzso requires the zzso region of zzso zzso competes with zzso initiation factor 2, a zzso zzso of zzso for zzso by activated zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso This zzso evidence of an intimate relationship between zzso an important regulator of zzso transcription, and zzso a zzso cellular regulator, may provide insights into zzso zzso and, more generally, zzso zzso
