The severe acute respiratory zzso zzso caused an outbreak of zzso pneumonia in zzso The zzso viral zzso encodes several proteins which have no zzso to proteins in any other zzso and a number of these proteins have been implicated in viral zzso One such protein is zzso which is also known as zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression is detected in both zzso infected cultured cells and zzso Among the different functions identified, zzso is a capable of inducing zzso We previously showed that zzso pathways are involved in zzso zzso In this study, we attempted to find out protein zzso on zzso that are essential for its zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis reveals that zzso possesses three major protein signatures, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We showed that zzso proteins carrying respective zzso in these protein zzso exhibit reduced zzso activities, indicating the importance of these zzso on zzso zzso zzso It was previously reported that zzso possesses zzso zzso channel zzso We further demonstrated that the blockade of zzso zzso channel activity abolished zzso zzso This report provides the first evidence that zzso channel activity of zzso is required for its zzso zzso As zzso channel activity has been reported to regulate zzso in different zzso conditions, finding ways to zzso the zzso channel activity may offer a new direction toward the zzso of zzso triggered by zzso
