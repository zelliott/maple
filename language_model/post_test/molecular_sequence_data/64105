zzso zzso is the closest known relative of the well-known zzso zzso and an attractive model zzso for population genetic and zzso zzso Here we characterize a set of 28 wild zzso from a zzso sampling area in southern zzso All 28 zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso and wild type with respect to zzso zzso Nine wild zzso and two lab strains of zzso zzso were surveyed for sequence variation at six zzso totaling 7 zzso and all 28 wild zzso were then zzso at seven zzso zzso These data were used to calculate zzso diversity and number of segregating sites in zzso zzso and to investigate geographic zzso population structure, and linkage zzso zzso site diversity is approximately zzso zzso zzso between gene zzso indicate frequent zzso between zzso zzso but there is no evidence of zzso within zzso Some localized zzso growth is zzso The frequency of zzso relative to zzso is estimated at zzso on the basis of zzso Thus, all three modes of reproduction known in the lab zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been important in molding genetic variation in this zzso
