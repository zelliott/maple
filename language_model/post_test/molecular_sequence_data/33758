The zzso zzso sex determination gene zzso is alternatively spliced in the male and female to produce the zzso and zzso zzso In an effort to better understand the mechanism of the alternative zzso regulation of zzso we conducted a zzso zzso followed by zzso analysis to identify the putative proteins bound to the zzso zzso in the zzso 4 of zzso A protein named as zzso which is zzso to the zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, was identified and expressed in zzso coli for testing zzso binding in zzso All of the results showed that zzso specifically bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso recognition motifs at the zzso and a zzso motif at the zzso It might be one of the factors involved in the zzso zzso of zzso
