The iron zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso includes four genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two genes for zzso zzso zzso and zzso This cluster plays an important role in the zzso mechanisms of this zzso Despite being part of the same zzso zzso the relative levels of zzso for the fat portion and for the whole zzso message differ zzso the levels of the fat transcript being about zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso studies, we were able to show that the differential gene expression within the zzso zzso is due to termination of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso although a few transcripts proceeded beyond the termination site to the end of this zzso This termination process requires a zzso zzso zzso that spans the zzso region and acts as a novel zzso zzso
