The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso on the stimulation of insulin release by zzso from isolated canine zzso were compared with that of zzso The stimulation of insulin release by 1 zzso zzso was reduced to zzso and zzso by the prior infusion of 1 zzso of zzso and 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso release by zzso was not affected by these peptides using the above zzso The results indicate that these peptides are zzso of zzso zzso receptors on pancreatic zzso although the zzso activities are lower than that of zzso
