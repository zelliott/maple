The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein containing a variety of binding sites for zzso zzso One of the most widely used of these drugs, ethanol, enhances the function of zzso receptors in certain circumstances but not zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that alternative zzso of the gamma zzso zzso zzso results in an ethanol sensitive and an zzso form, when combined with alpha and beta zzso We have used in zzso zzso and expression in zzso zzso to show that the consensus site for zzso by protein zzso C contained in the gamma zzso insert is critical for zzso by ethanol but not zzso and manipulation of the zzso zzso in zzso containing alpha 1 beta 1 gamma zzso can prevent ethanol zzso It is likely that zzso or zzso of a specific site on the zzso zzso protein can act as a control mechanism for zzso responses to alcohol zzso
