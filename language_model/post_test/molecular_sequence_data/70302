zzso and zzso zzso genes are assembled during zzso development by a novel, highly regulated series of gene zzso reactions known as zzso zzso All rearranging zzso are flanked by zzso zzso zzso signal zzso Gene zzso results in the imprecise fusion of coding sequences and the precise fusion of signal zzso DNA molecules with zzso breaks near signal sequences have been detected in cells undergoing zzso zzso of the zzso delta zzso We have devised a zzso zzso zzso that detects zzso molecules in zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso we found that DNA breaks occurring precisely at the signal zzso sequence junction are a general feature of zzso zzso appearing in association with each type of rearranging zzso gene zzso We show that a significant fraction of these broken ends are blunt and zzso In addition, detection of these zzso signal sequences is dependent on the activity of zzso and zzso and is restricted to the zzso phase of the cell zzso The pattern of zzso molecules detected in cells at various stages of development reflects the activity of the zzso zzso at different zzso during zzso and zzso zzso
