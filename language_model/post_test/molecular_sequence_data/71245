The related mouse proteins zzso and zzso which have predicted zinc finger zzso interact with the zzso factors zzso and zzso modulating the ability of zzso and zzso to regulate zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso zzso that encodes a protein with similarity to zzso and zzso The zzso gene appears to be zzso zzso as three alternatively spliced forms are detected in a zzso library screen and on an zzso zzso In addition, all three zzso transcripts are detected in embryonic zzso but only two of the transcripts are detected in adult zzso The three transcripts have the ability to zzso two zzso of zzso and 522 zzso zzso The two zzso zzso acid sequences share an zzso zzso region and differ in their zzso These proteins and related proteins in other organisms, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and plants, share a highly zzso region predicted to form a zinc zzso zzso of the zzso gene or zzso zzso in zzso is zzso thus, zzso is an essential gene in zzso These data underscore the potential importance of zzso proteins zzso and conservation of the putative zinc finger domain suggests that it is functionally zzso
