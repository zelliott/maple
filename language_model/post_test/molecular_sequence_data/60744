The zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso differs from most other zzso zzso by its ability to zzso zzso to zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The turnover of different zzso and the effects of various zzso on zzso were compared with those of another zzso zzso from the same strain zzso as well as with those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Cell extracts containing zzso or zzso converted the relevant zzso with an almost constant rate for at least 10 zzso whereas zzso was zzso significantly within the first minutes during the turnover of all zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was much more sensitive than the other two zzso to zzso by the zzso zzso compound zzso The reason for zzso of zzso appeared to be the loss of the zzso bound zzso zzso which is the zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso constructed by zzso zzso showed a higher stability to zzso by zzso and an increased zzso efficiency for the conversion of zzso and zzso but was still zzso during zzso zzso
