zzso isotope probing zzso is a novel technique to characterize structure and in zzso function of active microbial zzso which is based on the incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso Here, we have traced zzso members of a rice field soil microbial community, which became active upon continuous addition of zzso zzso 22 zzso as studied in zzso By combining zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso real-time zzso detection of templates in zzso of zzso zzso we were able to detect zzso bacterial zzso after 6 days of zzso zzso and comparative sequence analysis of zzso bacterial zzso showed that mostly members of the zzso and a novel zzso within the zzso formed part of the indigenous zzso zzso Over time, however, the zzso were zzso zzso zzso acids of zzso origin were zzso mostly in zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were identified as zzso mostly related to zzso and zzso zzso and also zzso known as predatory soil zzso The detection of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso suggests a possible involvement in either direct zzso of label by the zzso or a food zzso zzso that primary zzso consuming zzso were zzso by zzso and grazed by zzso
