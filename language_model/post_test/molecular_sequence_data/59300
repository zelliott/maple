A novel theory of primary zzso reception is zzso It proposes that zzso receptors respond not to the shape of the molecules but to their zzso It differs from previous zzso theories zzso zzso in providing a detailed and plausible mechanism for biological zzso of molecular zzso zzso electron zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are identified in putative zzso receptors and their associated zzso Means of calculating electron zzso zzso of zzso molecules are zzso Several examples are given of correlations between zzso spectrum and zzso in structurally unrelated zzso As predicted, molecules of very similar shape but differing in zzso smell zzso The most striking instance is that of pure zzso and its fully zzso analogue zzso which smell different despite being identical in zzso This fact zzso it seems, be explained by zzso theories of zzso The evidence presented here suggests instead that zzso like zzso vision and hearing, is a spectral zzso
