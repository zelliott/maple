Three DNA regions required for high levels of zzso were identified by transient gene expression analysis of the zzso zzso region of a 19 zzso zzso zzso For these zzso the zzso promoter region was fused to the zzso zzso gene and zzso by transient expression in carrot zzso A zzso sequence zzso containing the zzso box resulted in low levels of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 75 zzso zzso doubled the level of zzso zzso and a further increase in expression was obtained when additional upstream sequences zzso were placed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso upstream sequences enhanced zzso independently of the zzso zzso Although the zzso region was not essential for transcription, it was important to obtain maximum zzso zzso A 121 zzso upstream sequence zzso that contains the zzso zzso sequence gave high levels of zzso activity when placed in either orientation zzso of the zzso promoter zzso However, zzso zzso to zzso containing the zzso zzso could be deleted from this zzso without a significant change in zzso zzso zzso upstream sequences did not promote zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso The upstream zzso sequence from the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso promoter placed zzso of deletion zzso of the zzso promoter also failed to produce zzso activity above zzso
