zzso transformed T cells not only express a large number of zzso receptors zzso but also produce an zzso zzso named zzso factor zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso and found that zzso production in human zzso can be enhanced by cellular zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso coli was shown to have zzso activity in combination with zzso or zzso zzso stimuli on several zzso cells including human zzso besides the originally reported zzso inducing zzso zzso analysis revealed an unexpected structural relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso which had been characterized originally in zzso zzso zzso zzso also has a reducing activity, suggesting the presence of still unknown features of zzso action in zzso The requirement of zzso reduction in the biological activities of zzso together with the possible involvement of zzso production in the normal and abnormal zzso of human cells are zzso
