Signaling by the zzso zzso gene zzso is essential for zzso in organisms ranging from zzso to zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso from a zzso species, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined its expression by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The peak of zzso expression occurs during zzso zzso zzso No patterned expression was detected within the segmented portion of the zzso plate during the early stages of zzso In stage zzso zzso zzso is expressed in body wall, zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso and in a subset of zzso zzso Evidence that zzso regulates gut formation was obtained using the zzso zzso zzso which specifically blocks zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of both zzso and anterior zzso in zzso zzso and no zzso recognizable zzso were zzso In contrast, no gross abnormalities were observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso developed zzso as did body wall zzso and some other zzso zzso but the zzso cells that normally come to fill most of the zzso cavities failed to zzso Taken with data from zzso and zzso our data suggest that the role of zzso genes in gut formation and/or neural differentiation is ancestral to the zzso whereas their role in zzso evolved zzso within the zzso
