Two zzso zzso with a zzso that includes a tight colonial growth pattern, an inability to form zzso and an inability to form zzso have been isolated and zzso The relevant zzso were mapped to the same locus on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso responsible for the zzso zzso then were identified by examining likely candidate genes from the zzso zzso at the mapped locus with zzso amplification and a sequencing zzso The results demonstrate that a map and sequence strategy is a feasible way to identify zzso genes in zzso The gene responsible for the zzso is a putative zzso zzso The zzso cell wall has an altered composition demonstrating that the gene functions in cell wall zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso gene is required for normal cell wall zzso zzso and for the regulation of asexual zzso
