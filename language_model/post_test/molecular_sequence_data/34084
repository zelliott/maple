The heat shock proteins zzso are a family of proteins whose expression is enhanced in response to environmental zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were cloned using expressed sequence tag and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full-length zzso of zzso and zzso contains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 236 zzso zzso zzso Multiple alignments indicated that the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso shared a high level of identity with zzso and small zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso acorn zzso zzso and shared identical structural features with zzso and zzso The expression profiles of these two genes under heat treatment were investigated by real-time quantitative zzso It was found that the zzso zzso zzso transcripts of the two zzso zzso genes varied among different zzso under normal conditions and heat zzso and that the zzso expression of the two genes was higher in the zzso compared to other zzso Heat shock significantly elevated the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso played important roles in zzso the environmental stress in zzso zzso
