zzso zzso is a large zzso complex, including at least 10 zzso in the zzso zzso One of these zzso proteins is zzso e zzso zzso involved in the stable zzso of zzso zzso and required for the establishment of normal zzso membrane zzso As a step toward enabling zzso studies of the zzso the zzso e zzso region was structurally characterized in zzso Based on a series of zzso and CD zzso zzso studies, a structural model of the zzso zzso complex was constructed, indicating zzso e is largely zzso and emerges from the zzso with zzso near the zzso head zzso zzso e only adopts this folded zzso in the context of the zzso and is essentially zzso in zzso water or zzso Within the zzso the zzso zzso stretch is zzso while the region zzso may be zzso zzso based on negative zzso zzso shift zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso which has been proposed to play an important role in zzso formation with another protein from the zzso The zzso on the zzso end of this motif zzso is slightly more mobile than the more buried zzso based on zzso order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only one zzso e zzso zzso is bound per zzso and zzso are zzso A in diameter, composed of 51 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso Although there is no evidence for zzso e zzso via the zzso domain, potentially synergistic roles for zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain interactions may still zzso Furthermore, the presence of a buried charged zzso zzso suggests there may be interactions with other zzso zzso that stabilize this charge, and possibly drive the folding of the zzso 9 zzso of the zzso zzso
