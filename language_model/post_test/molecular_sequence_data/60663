Previously it was demonstrated using a model precursor that processing at the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso precedes processing at its C zzso We now show the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso reaction of a zzso precursor linked to 53 zzso acids of the native zzso zzso region zzso of zzso and containing its two native zzso zzso The zzso contains the two zzso zzso exchanged to zzso zzso that do not alter the zzso or the structural stability of the mature zzso zzso which encompasses the known zzso inhibitor sequence zzso within zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso sites in two consecutive steps to produce the mature zzso Both zzso and zzso exhibit low intrinsic zzso zzso The appearance of the mature zzso is accompanied by a large increase in zzso zzso It follows zzso zzso in protein concentration with a rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso M zzso at pH zzso The zzso profile for the observed zzso rate constant is zzso with two zzso groups of zzso zzso and zzso The rate constant also exhibits approximately zzso higher sensitivity to zzso zzso as compared with that of the mature zzso suggesting that the zzso at the N zzso of the zzso domain from the precursor leads to the stabilization of the zzso zzso
