zzso chemical zzso with zzso zzso zzso indicated an association of the zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso in zzso The mobility of the zzso product on zzso gels indicated the formation of a zzso complex between zzso and TM and the interaction was zzso zzso zzso zzso were raised against zzso and used to determine its cellular zzso in the zzso zzso cell line LLC zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso depended on the differentiation state of the cells, being absent from zzso stress fibers in sparsely seeded cultures, but present in the zzso zzso characteristic of differentiated zzso zzso of zzso extracts using zzso as well as zzso zzso failed to zzso TM and zzso indicating a transient association between these two molecules in zzso zzso zzso of cell extracts on immobilized zzso zzso however, confirmed the zzso interaction between zzso and both muscle zzso as well as with high and low molecular mass zzso zzso suggesting that the binding site resides in one of the zzso regions of zzso Our data demonstrate the possible interaction of zzso with TM that is not bound to the zzso and indicate a zzso function for zzso in LLC zzso zzso The possible functional implications of this interaction are zzso
