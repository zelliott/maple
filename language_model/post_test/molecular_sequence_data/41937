During a search for novel coding sequences within the human zzso class I region zzso zzso we found an zzso (named zzso coding for a zzso zzso which is very similar to the zzso domain of several coding zzso human zzso zzso syndrome nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso finger protein zzso zzso nuclear factor 7 zzso and bovine zzso The first three of these proteins share similarities over the whole length of the zzso whereas zzso is similar in the zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is similar to rat zzso zzso zzso and chicken B blood group system zzso zzso These zzso are components of a new zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is thus a mosaic protein composed of the zzso zzso domain and the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso and zzso map to the human zzso zzso region and are thus close to the zzso class I zzso It is therefore possible that the zzso gene is the product of an zzso zzso event which occurred between ancestors of the zzso and zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first example of the zzso of a zzso gene and its putative zzso Finally, regulatory protein zzso 1 zzso shares similarities with the zzso halves of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with the zzso zzso We show that the ancestral zzso gene evolved by zzso
