zzso repeat zzso proteins are required for numerous zzso processing events in plant zzso including zzso editing, zzso stabilization, and zzso Fifteen zzso proteins are known to be required for zzso editing at 21 sites in zzso zzso and belong to the zzso class of zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the zzso of four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their six editing targets in zzso zzso zzso genes are composed of approximately 10 to 20 tandem repeats and each repeat has two zzso regions, zzso A and zzso B, that are separated by short zzso zzso Each repeat and structural feature was examined to determine the selective pressures on these zzso 

All of the zzso genes examined are under strong negative zzso Multiple independent losses of editing site targets are observed for both zzso and zzso In several species lacking the known editing target for zzso zzso genes are truncated near the 17th zzso zzso The coding sequences of the truncated zzso genes are maintained under strong negative zzso however, the 3' zzso sequences beyond the zzso site have substantially zzso zzso analyses of four zzso genes show that sequences corresponding to zzso A are high compared to zzso B zzso zzso evolutionary selection of zzso A versus zzso B is observed in both plant and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso genes and their zzso editing sites are mutually constrained in zzso zzso sites are frequently lost by replacement of an edited C with a zzso zzso After the loss of an editing site, the zzso genes are observed with three zzso first, few changes are detected in some zzso second, the zzso gene is present as a zzso and third, the zzso gene is present but truncated in the zzso zzso The retention of truncated forms of zzso that are maintained under strong negative selection even in the absence of an editing site target suggests that zzso zzso might exist for this zzso zzso zzso gene sequences that zzso zzso A are under strong selection, and could be involved in zzso zzso zzso
