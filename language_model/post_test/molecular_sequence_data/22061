zzso protein zzso is important in the life cycles of most bacteria, in which it contributes to the formation of zzso and zzso and makes available zzso zzso to digest zzso for nutritional purposes and toxins to kill host cells in infections of humans, animals and zzso It is generally accepted that zzso laboratory strains of zzso coli, particularly zzso zzso do not zzso proteins into the zzso medium under routine growth zzso In this study, we report that commonly used laboratory strains zzso zzso a small zzso zzso in the native zzso soluble zzso protein into the zzso challenging the status quo view that laboratory strains do not zzso proteins to the zzso We further show that zzso proteins linked to the zzso end of zzso are efficiently zzso The function of zzso is unknown, but its use as a carrier for transgenic proteins provides a tool to circumvent toxicity and other contamination issues associated with protein production in zzso zzso
