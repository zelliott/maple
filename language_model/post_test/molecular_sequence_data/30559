By using a zzso for zzso N zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso family, extracts of canine small zzso were found to contain primarily zzso than zzso large molecular zzso of zzso whereas the zzso species in brain was zzso zzso Large zzso was highly basic zzso greater than 9) and during sodium zzso zzso gel zzso gave two components of approximately 17 zzso zzso and approximately 8 zzso zzso Large zzso like zzso was localized primarily to the zzso layer of the zzso It was also present in highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where it appeared to be concentrated within dense zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of a zzso acid zzso zzso from the zzso region of large zzso was identical to zzso zzso of the canine zzso precursor predicted from zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso processing of the zzso precursor occurs in the dog, giving rise to zzso in brain and large zzso in small zzso
