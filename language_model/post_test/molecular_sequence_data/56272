Many of the actions of zzso zzso zzso are zzso by the protein zzso including the zzso of various downstream zzso zzso and the stimulation of growth and zzso The human protein zzso binds to zzso growth factor receptors and downstream zzso proteins through its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and like its zzso from zzso zzso zzso apparently forms part of a highly zzso zzso by which these receptors can control Ras zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso of zzso bind to the zzso part of zzso the human zzso of the zzso zzso factor for zzso which is essential for control of Ras activity by zzso growth factor zzso and zzso Moreover, a synthetic zzso zzso containing the sequence zzso specifically blocks the zzso These results indicate that the zzso complex couples activated zzso zzso to Ras zzso
