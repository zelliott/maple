During the last decade, a great number of activities have been geared in identifying newer targets for zzso zzso infection as well as understanding the targets for already identified zzso zzso The success in converting a zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso from the zzso zzso repeat zzso region of the envelope zzso zzso of zzso to a drug named zzso was one of the phenomenal successes in zzso drug discovery research that has been made in recent zzso There were many reports of zzso peptides from the zzso zzso repeat and zzso regions with the objective of improving their zzso A few laboratories also reported the identification of zzso zzso that apparently bind to the zzso cavity identified in the zzso core structure and prevent the zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso repeat zzso thereby prevent the formation of the typical zzso zzso which has been thought to be necessary for the fusion between zzso and cell zzso
