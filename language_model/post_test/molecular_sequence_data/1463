The zzso vision zzso of New World monkeys results from zzso variations of the zzso zzso visual zzso On the basis of sequence comparison, spectral differences among the zzso have been ascribed to zzso acid zzso at sites 180, zzso zzso zzso and zzso While the significant spectral effects have been demonstrated for sites 180, zzso and 285 by zzso zzso for a large number of zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso effects at sites 229 and 233 remain zzso Here we measured zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso monkey zzso zzso and the zzso zzso monkey zzso zzso The peak zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso zzso being consistent with the prediction from the zzso zzso Our zzso zzso for sites 229 and 233 showed that their zzso effects for zzso values were zzso These results zzso the necessity of examining zzso 4, zzso the zzso at sites 229 and zzso of zzso zzso genes for zzso typing of New World zzso
