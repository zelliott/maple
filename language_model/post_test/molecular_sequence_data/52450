Previous analysis has emphasized the correlation between primary structures of class I zzso molecules and their patterns of zzso zzso Here we describe the structures of two zzso groups of zzso zzso for which this is not the zzso zzso an zzso associated with black zzso is zzso paired with zzso in the B12 zzso its structure, however, is divergent from that of zzso but closely related to zzso The zzso zzso zzso is associated with native Americans and is zzso grouped with zzso in the B21 zzso its structure, however, is more closely related to zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules differ at seven functional positions of the zzso recognition zzso the zzso and zzso molecules differ at four such zzso These differences are predicted to alter zzso presentation and be capable of zzso strong zzso T cell zzso For these pairs of B12 and B21 zzso zzso appears dominated by zzso formed by short sequences of the alpha 2 zzso which have been shuffled by zzso between zzso The implications of these results for zzso matching in transplantation are zzso
