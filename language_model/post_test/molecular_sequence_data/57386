zzso of zzso b zzso zzso at the zzso carbon bridge is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to form zzso IX zzso Currently, we have examined the requirement for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso expressed in zzso coli for zzso degradation activity and have assessed the importance of His 151 for this zzso His 151 is in the longest span of zzso acids (24 zzso which are present, with only a single conservative zzso in seven cloned zzso zzso including the apparent single zzso in zzso We show His 151 is essential for zzso of zzso as substitution of zzso for this zzso by zzso zzso resulted in expression of an inactive protein with zzso toward zzso to rat zzso A zzso construct in which zzso zzso the 33 zzso zzso acid zzso were deleted, when zzso produced a protein of predicted size and zzso with zzso to zzso but also devoid of zzso degrading zzso The presence of additional zzso at this zzso for the most part, accounts for the larger size of zzso compared to zzso zzso the zzso region at the zzso zzso did not appear to be essential for zzso zzso A construct in which the sequence zzso the primarily zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso was replaced by a sequence zzso predominantly zzso zzso expressed a protein which retained full capability to convert zzso to zzso Further, the construct with a zzso zzso zzso was not appreciably associated with bacterial zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso in the zzso protein serves as a membrane anchor for this zzso
