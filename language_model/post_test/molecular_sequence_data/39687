zzso zzso is an zzso zzso factor with several nuclear zzso signals, a zzso domain for DNA zzso and a very strong zzso zzso zzso Despite its very strong zzso domain, zzso is kept almost inactive by two different independent zzso zzso the zzso and the central zzso The zzso as a specific zzso domain directly binds to and thus zzso the zzso domain zzso However, it lacks any zzso zzso In contrast, the central domain functions as a strong zzso zzso domain and as an zzso zzso zzso The zzso alone is sufficient to eliminate zzso while the central domain alone zzso the zzso domain only zzso This hierarchy of the two zzso zzso offers the possibility to activate the almost inactive wild type in two steps in zzso deletion of the zzso results in a strong zzso while additional deletion of the central domain in a very strong zzso We suggest that the very high potential of the zzso domain has to be tightly controlled by these two zzso zzso because zzso stimulates proliferation by promoting zzso transition, as well as zzso transition, and because deregulation of such potent zzso of proliferation can result in zzso
