The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso regulator of the zzso protein zzso Five zzso DNA regions known to be bound by zzso provided the seed information for DNA binding site discovery by expectation zzso and Gibbs sampling zzso The detection of additional motifs in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso was performed with a position weight zzso and a profile hidden zzso model, both deduced from the initial motif zzso A combined zzso search for zzso binding sites revealed 201 potential operator zzso The interaction of zzso zzso protein with 51 selected binding sites was demonstrated in zzso by performing zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso zzso zzso Considering potential zzso structures and the zzso organization of zzso zzso the expression of 53 zzso units zzso 96 genes may be controlled directly by zzso The DNA binding site of zzso is apparently specified by the consensus sequence zzso zzso of the data into the zzso regulatory network model of zzso zzso revealed a high connectivity of the deduced regulatory interactions and suggested that zzso controls at least zzso sugar zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ethanol zzso zzso aromatic compound degradation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nitrogen zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the cellular stress response, and zzso zzso
