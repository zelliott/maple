zzso genes coding for zzso precursors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and cloned in a highly efficient zzso coli expression zzso The synthetic genes code for zzso with its zzso (at position 17) replaced by zzso and zzso at the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The synthetic genes fused to the zzso part of the zzso coli zzso gene were expressed to yield high amounts of fusion proteins reaching upon induction at least zzso of the total cellular zzso The fusion proteins of 314 and zzso zzso acids carrying in their zzso portion either the 29 or 31 zzso acids long zzso precursor zzso were shown to be zzso with zzso zzso and were further zzso and zzso by zzso The resulting zzso zzso precursors zzso and zzso were recognized by zzso receptors in rat liver plasma zzso and by zzso to zzso zzso in a zzso Both precursors activated zzso zzso in rat liver zzso and zzso pancreatic zzso in the zzso The affinity and potency of the cloned precursors is close to that of zzso zzso from zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso precursors may act even without being converted into the zzso zzso form of the zzso The zzso zzso precursors expressed in zzso coli may provide a cheap, large-scale source of experimental material for studies on zzso zzso
