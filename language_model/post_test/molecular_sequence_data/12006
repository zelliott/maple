zzso stress has been proposed as a common zzso of zzso zzso To investigate further the role of zzso in this process we have studied the effects of antioxidants on zzso virus zzso zzso in two cell lines, zzso (a prostate zzso line) and zzso (a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso above 30 zzso completely abrogates zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso cannot be attributed to zzso of viral entry or viral zzso changes in zzso zzso or to increases in cellular zzso levels, nor can they be zzso by zzso of trace metals, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, other zzso agents including zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso are zzso Because zzso and zzso are among the most effective zzso of the zzso factor zzso B, we examined zzso ability to activate zzso B before the onset of zzso or zzso evidence of zzso Within hours of infection, zzso induced a robust increase in nuclear zzso B activity in zzso and zzso zzso this zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, which has been shown to inhibit zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso B zzso To determine if zzso B zzso is necessary for zzso zzso in these cells, we used double stranded zzso with consensus zzso B sequences as zzso factor zzso zzso to inhibit zzso B binding to native DNA zzso zzso but not zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso B nuclear activity in zzso cells did not prevent zzso zzso Taken together, these observations define a cell zzso zzso factor signaling zzso necessary for zzso zzso zzso the precise mechanism by which zzso and zzso agents inhibit zzso nuclear zzso B activity in zzso cells may provide insights into the zzso zzso actions of these zzso
