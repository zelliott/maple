The article presents an overview of the latest advances in investigations of the zzso molecular properties, and associated biological activity of zzso The literature survey on the zzso zzso is intended to illustrate how the great variety of environmental conditions as well as zzso in strain characteristics influences the zzso pathways of the zzso formation and effects structural composition of the zzso zzso properties of zzso as zzso and zzso are discussed in terms of similarities with zzso and zzso structures, and an emphasis is made on the inherent biological activity of zzso zzso The author also attempts to zzso the concepts, options, and strategies in chemical modification of the zzso and to delineate future prospects in designing new biologically active zzso
