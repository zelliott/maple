zzso zzso regulators are common regulators in zzso Here we report the first crystal structure of a full-length zzso the zzso zzso regulator zzso from zzso pneumoniae, the zzso of its zzso zzso was found to be a zzso (which seems to be the biologically active zzso that is able to recognize its DNA zzso The zzso can be regarded as a zzso of zzso with each zzso being composed of two identical zzso in different zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso from the core of the zzso suggesting that zzso may bind its operator in two distinct zzso The zzso domain presents the same fold identified in members of the zzso family that shows some features identified as specific for sugar zzso An in zzso analysis shows that the zzso of the putative zzso site is close to the zzso zzso This supports the proposal of a new mechanism of zzso regulation that is in complete agreement with functional studies recently reported on a protein belonging to the same zzso
