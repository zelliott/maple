zzso peptides presented on major zzso complex zzso class I molecules to zzso T cells are generated in the zzso by the 20 S zzso Upon stimulation of zzso presenting cells with zzso two zzso zzso of the 20 S zzso are replaced by the zzso zzso low molecular mass zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso In addition the expression of the two zzso of the 11 S regulator of the 20 S zzso zzso are zzso As the function of zzso and zzso in zzso presentation is still controversial, we tested whether these zzso might operate by zzso zzso zzso through the 11 S zzso We strongly zzso the two zzso zzso separately or together by zzso in zzso zzso zzso 20 S zzso from zzso zzso were applied in zzso of a zzso zzso in the presence or absence of a zzso preparation of 11 S regulator from rabbit zzso Analysis of the zzso products by high performance liquid zzso and zzso mass zzso revealed marked differences in the zzso product profile in dependence on the zzso and zzso zzso While the 11 S regulator did not zzso activate zzso or 7 containing zzso the binding of the 11 S regulator to any of the zzso preparations markedly changed both the quality and quantity of peptides zzso These results suggest that the 11 S regulator increases the spectrum of peptides which can be generated in zzso presenting zzso
