We have cloned from a chicken zzso zzso library zzso the first avian zzso zzso is zzso and zzso identical to proteins zzso by the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in both mouse zzso zzso and zzso cells demonstrated that zzso represents the avian zzso of human zzso since it zzso resistance to several zzso drugs and the fluorescent dye zzso zzso Northern and zzso analysis showed that zzso is highly expressed throughout the zzso and in the liver, and to a considerable extent in zzso brain, zzso heart, eye and zzso In zzso zzso revealed a cell zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso with high levels in the zzso of the small and large zzso as well as zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso could play a role in zzso zzso Most interestingly, zzso showed that zzso is also expressed in zzso zzso particularly in zzso cells, the major site for zzso zzso production in zzso Indeed, competition experiments indicated that zzso interacts with zzso since zzso zzso zzso was efficiently blocked by zzso in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso was also blocked by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso from zzso zzso We propose that zzso in zzso cells could be involved in the cell zzso transport or release of zzso that is essential for avian zzso zzso
