We have constructed the physical map of the zzso zzso DNA zzso which contains the 3' 64 variable region zzso gene segments of the human zzso heavy chain zzso zzso The organization of the zzso locus showed several features that indicate dynamic zzso of this zzso The zzso 64 zzso segments include 31 zzso of which 24 are highly zzso except for a few point zzso zzso of the 64 zzso zzso sequences shows that each zzso family has zzso zzso suggesting that there might be some genetic or selection mechanisms involved in maintenance of each zzso The total number of the human zzso segments was estimated to be about zzso including at least 7 zzso
