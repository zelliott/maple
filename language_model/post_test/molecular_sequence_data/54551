zzso in zzso regions bear zzso modifications that distinguish them from zzso zzso Among those, zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso and are found in both zzso zzso and zzso model organisms such as zzso zzso In spite of numerous studies, the relative contributions of the various zzso zzso marks to the properties of zzso remain largely zzso Here, we report that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which are located in a zzso zzso region, is hardly affected in cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso We document the existence of a zzso parallel to zzso ensuring gene repression in the absence of zzso and identify a zzso factor central to this pathway, zzso We find that zzso controls gene expression at multiple zzso locations in addition to affecting the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acts in the same zzso as zzso at least for its effects in the zzso region, and on a subset of other targets, notably a region recently found to be prone to zzso zzso The zzso targets of zzso also include zzso a master regulator of sexual zzso Hence zzso like the zzso zzso zzso factor which also zzso zzso structure in the zzso region, controls sexual differentiation and zzso integrity at several zzso Globally, our results point to zzso zzso as prominent zzso of gene expression in zzso zzso zzso These zzso can act in concert with, or independently of, the widely studied zzso mark to influence gene zzso at zzso zzso
