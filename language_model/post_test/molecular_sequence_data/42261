Analysis of zzso solution data for eight short DNA duplexes has revealed pronounced differences between the sugar zzso of zzso and zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso distance is less than zzso zzso A in zzso zzso while in zzso zzso it is more than zzso zzso This difference has been analyzed by comparison with the sugar zzso of highly resolved zzso crystal structures and model sugar zzso The conclusion can be drawn that the zzso zzso is of the general zzso type but zzso zzso are characterized by smaller phase angles of zzso P (90 degrees zzso P zzso 150 zzso while zzso zzso have larger P values that are greater than zzso 140 degrees zzso degrees zzso P zzso 180 zzso There is no such clear base dependence of sugar zzso in highly resolved zzso crystal zzso however the similar trend can be seen as in the solution zzso Based on zzso DNA crystal structures, zzso zzso have been zzso and the zzso of experimental zzso zzso to the determination of sugar zzso is zzso
