The zzso zzso has been implicated as a central regulatory component of the nuclear response to zzso and other zzso zzso zzso stem cells targeted at the zzso locus have been used to generate zzso mice that have transmitted the zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso show reduced zzso and fetal weights and significant loss of viability at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso survive and grow at normal rates until severe zzso characterized by zzso of the long bones, zzso of the zzso space, and absence of tooth zzso begins to develop at approximately 11 zzso Among other zzso these mice show delayed or absent zzso zzso and altered zzso Despite these zzso many live as long as their zzso or zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso These data indicate that zzso is not required for the growth of most cell types but is involved in the development and function of several distinct zzso
