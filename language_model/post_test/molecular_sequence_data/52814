In higher plants, zzso zzso elements mediate zzso and salicylic zzso zzso Originally found in viral and zzso zzso they are also functional elements of plant promoters activated during the zzso response against zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was the first zzso protein shown to bind to zzso zzso for two novel tobacco zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso were zzso zzso a high degree of zzso acid identity in the zzso domain zzso and the zzso zzso the two zzso factors differ remarkably with respect to the length of the zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso versus 43 zzso acids in zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso with zzso repeat protein zzso a central zzso of the plant zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso but not zzso functioned as zzso zzso in zzso Apart from zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso led to reduced in zzso zzso activity and almost completely abolished binding to one half site of this zzso zzso When being part of a zzso with zzso zzso was efficiently recruited to a single half site, though double occupancy of the element was still zzso In contrast, zzso preferred to bind to only one zzso a feature that was also maintained in zzso between zzso and zzso or zzso
