The genes zzso the beta and alpha zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso and the zzso M, and zzso c zzso of the zzso reaction center from zzso zzso are organized in an zzso in zzso to other zzso purple bacteria, named the zzso zzso In zzso grown cells, two abundant zzso zzso zzso species of zzso and zzso bases were zzso The large transcript zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and reaction center zzso M, and zzso c zzso whereas the small transcript only coded for the zzso beta and alpha zzso Both transcripts share a common zzso end which is located 115 bases upstream from the initiation zzso of the zzso beta zzso Two additional low-level transcripts of zzso and zzso bases with zzso ends 254 zzso 3 bases upstream from the zzso beta gene were zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence preceding the different zzso ends revealed DNA elements of striking zzso The 3' ends of the small transcripts were mapped within the zzso zzso DNA region downstream from a sequence capable of forming a very stable zzso when transcribed into zzso The 3' zzso of the large transcripts are located immediately downstream from the region coding the zzso c zzso in two areas resembling zzso zzso zzso No open reading frames corresponding to zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in the zzso DNA regions of the zzso zzso In contrast, an open reading frame ending 191 base pairs upstream from the zzso beta gene showed 50% zzso at the zzso acid level to the available sequence of the zzso gene from zzso zzso The genes coding for the zzso zzso zzso had zzso extensions of 13 zzso and 10 zzso zzso acids which were not present in the proteins isolated from zzso zzso
