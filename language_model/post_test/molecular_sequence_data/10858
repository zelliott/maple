There exists a strong correlation between asthma and zzso to indoor zzso This study reports on the secondary structure of the major house dust zzso zzso zzso p 2, determined using zzso zzso zzso The DNA was zzso from the zzso expression zzso zzso into the high yield bacterial expression zzso zzso resulting in yields of 50 zzso The zzso protein was shown to have zzso comparable with that of the natural zzso protein using competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a modified zzso zzso test zzso The secondary structure was determined by examining chemical shifts, short and long range zzso zzso zzso constants, and zzso exchange zzso From these data, it is clear that zzso p 2 is composed of zzso and random zzso Based on long range distance constraints, a number of zzso were aligned into two zzso zzso zzso
