We compare the complexity and organization of the G protein alpha zzso zzso family in the zzso zzso of zzso and the Japanese zzso fish zzso zzso Fourteen zzso G alpha genes were identified of the 16 genes characterized previously in zzso including zzso genes from the four classes of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso G alpha coding sequences are highly zzso and the zzso structure of the fish and zzso zzso is identical throughout the coding zzso A novel G alpha zzso G alpha zzso was also identified in zzso zzso and two other species of zzso zzso The complete sequence of zzso and the zzso duplicated genes zzso and zzso were obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fish G alpha genes lacked repeat DNA zzso other than simple sequence length repeats, and most zzso were significantly shorter in zzso than in zzso zzso The compact zzso of zzso fish provides a unique zzso model for characterizing zzso families and identifying novel genes directly from zzso DNA by zzso amplification with zzso zzso The fact that zzso encodes most, if not all, of the G protein alpha zzso identified in zzso strongly supports zzso as a model zzso for zzso zzso zzso
