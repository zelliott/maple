zzso is a crystal protein produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso during its stationary phase, this zzso is active against zzso and has great potential for zzso zzso The theoretical model of the three-dimensional structure of zzso was predicted by zzso modeling on the structures of the zzso which is specific to zzso zzso The structure of the zzso resembles previously reported zzso toxin structures but shows the following zzso zzso has a long zzso in zzso of domain zzso Some zzso in the domain II and III of zzso are exposed to the zzso In this work we give a brief description of our model and zzso the zzso of the zzso that could be important in zzso recognition and pore zzso This model will be helpful for the design of zzso experiments aimed to the improvement of zzso and lead to a deep understanding of the mechanism of action of zzso zzso
