zzso zzso possess zzso zzso that are very similar in structure and function to the zzso of their bacterial zzso While most components of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are well zzso in the zzso zzso little is known about the factors zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Here, we have investigated a putative zzso of the bacterial zzso (for zzso factor zzso protein that was identified as a zzso protein and an auxiliary factor acting in the zzso maturation of the zzso zzso The zzso green zzso zzso zzso and the vascular plant zzso zzso zzso both zzso a single zzso protein in their nuclear zzso By generating specific zzso against this zzso we show that the plant zzso protein functions exclusively in the zzso where it is associated with zzso zzso Analysis of zzso for the corresponding gene zzso zzso reveals that the gene function is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display reduced levels of zzso zzso a specific depletion in zzso zzso zzso and reduced activity of zzso protein zzso Our data suggest that, while the function in zzso maturation and zzso zzso zzso end processing is zzso the zzso protein has assumed an additional role in 3' end zzso Together with the apparent absence of a zzso protein from plant zzso our findings illustrate that the assembly process of the zzso zzso is not strictly zzso and has undergone some modifications during zzso zzso
