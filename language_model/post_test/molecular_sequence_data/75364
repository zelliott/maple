zzso virus codes for at least three envelope zzso one of which, zzso has not yet been mapped to the viral zzso The publication and analysis of the entire zzso virus DNA sequence has allowed identification of open reading frames with potential for zzso membrane zzso To determine whether one of these candidate open reading zzso zzso codes for zzso an zzso was made to a zzso zzso derived from positions 518 to zzso of the predicted zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was then compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso which was originally used to define and characterize zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules with identical zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso proteins with zzso zzso generated comparable zzso and the zzso zzso reacted in Western zzso with the zzso zzso that had been zzso by zzso before transfer to zzso In addition, a zzso rabbit zzso made against native zzso reacted with the zzso used for zzso These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the zzso open reading frame codes for zzso
