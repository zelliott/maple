A zzso Chinese zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso resistant due to a low-level zzso altered target zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized on the molecular zzso The zzso and coding regions of all six zzso zzso were amplified in zzso using zzso zzso and directly zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso base transition at zzso 67 that results in the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso 22 and the loss of a zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso results in a decreased binding of zzso to the altered zzso zzso modeling of zzso supports the concept of the importance of zzso in the active site of the zzso and indicates that replacement with zzso will decrease the binding of zzso
