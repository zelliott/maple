The zzso zzso determining region, Y zzso open reading frame from mice representing four species of the zzso zzso was zzso in an effort to understand the conditional dysfunction of some zzso zzso zzso zzso when present on the zzso zzso strain genetic background and to zzso the functionally important protein zzso Twenty-two zzso zzso were zzso most from zzso Y zzso including 11 zzso zzso zzso seven zzso zzso zzso and two zzso each from the related species zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that the zzso domain zzso mobility group DNA binding zzso and the unique regions are well zzso while the zzso repeat cluster zzso region is quite zzso No correlation was found between the predicted protein zzso and the ability of a zzso zzso to allow differentiation of zzso tissue when on the zzso genetic background, strongly suggesting that the cause of this sex reversal is not the zzso protein itself, but rather the regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, our zzso sequence analysis provides compelling evidence that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso functional domain is contained in the first 143 zzso zzso which includes the zzso domain and adjacent unique region zzso
