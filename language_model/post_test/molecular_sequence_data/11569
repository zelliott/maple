Further improvements in technology for efficient monitoring of genetically engineered zzso zzso in the environment are zzso Technology for monitoring zzso is well established but has not generally been zzso to zzso because of the lack of unique zzso target zzso In the work described zzso it is demonstrated that a deletion zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene continues to accumulate to high levels in zzso coli although it is no longer incorporated into zzso zzso This deletion construct was subsequently modified by zzso to create a unique recognition site for the restriction zzso zzso into which new sequences could be readily zzso Finally, a novel zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso was embedded into the construct to create an zzso identification zzso The artificial zzso zzso expressed from this cassette in zzso accumulated in zzso coli to levels comparable to those of zzso zzso zzso without being seriously zzso to cell survival in laboratory experiments and without entering the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso stable zzso containing sequence segments remarkably different from those present in any known zzso can be designed and that neither the deleted sequence segment nor zzso incorporation is essential for zzso of an zzso zzso
