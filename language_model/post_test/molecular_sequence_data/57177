In an attempt to further assess the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso coli meningitis, the adherence of zzso coli strains with or without zzso were examined for this study to zzso zzso using thin layer zzso overlay zzso Only zzso zzso coli strains bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not to zzso including zzso zzso and other neutral zzso The binding of zzso zzso coli to zzso was temperature dependent zzso zzso at 37 degrees zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso coli zzso which lack the zzso gene from the zzso gene cluster showed no binding to the zzso while other zzso lacking the zzso gene zzso or zzso or H and zzso obtained by zzso zzso in the zzso gene exhibited a similar binding to the zzso compared to the parent zzso zzso A large amount of zzso zzso was demonstrated on brain zzso cells and the binding of zzso zzso coli to brain zzso cells was inhibited by these zzso These findings suggest that the binding of zzso zzso coli to brain zzso cells occurs in part via zzso containing terminal zzso zzso and in part by zzso protein zzso zzso was not involved in the binding of zzso to these zzso
