zzso cells possess a variety of zzso zzso systems with overlapping zzso zzso System L is one of the major zzso zzso systems of zzso zzso By expression cloning we have recently demonstrated that the surface zzso zzso zzso is a necessary component for expression of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso rat zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso cells, zzso cells, activated zzso isolated from mouse zzso and primary cultures of zzso In all these cell types, zzso zzso transport was zzso by system zzso No contribution of system zzso to zzso or zzso transport was detected in zzso zzso In zzso both zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso levels increased after treatment with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso caused modest zzso of zzso zzso transport in zzso cells and primary cultures of zzso cells, whereas zzso transport was zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso
