We have recently described the sequence of the zzso domain zzso zzso acid zzso of a newly detected zzso protein which zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the primary sequence of this protein based on a full-length zzso A sequence comparison reveals the identity of the zzso protein with a protein called zzso
