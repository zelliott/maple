The zzso acid at position zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso functions to discriminate base pairs at positions zzso and zzso in the zzso We have constructed a series of zzso zzso zzso having all possible zzso acid zzso at this zzso Surprisingly, most zzso zzso result in active zzso and many of these exhibit altered promoter zzso Identification of zzso zzso with altered zzso expands the repertoire of highly specific zzso zzso that are available for use in zzso zzso zzso systems and highlights the complexity of zzso DNA zzso
