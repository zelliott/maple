The patterns of zzso and evolution at 13 zzso zzso were studied in the zzso zzso zzso zzso First, a detailed investigation was performed on five zzso zzso by sequencing each zzso together with its zzso zzso regions, from a set of 147 individuals from eight species of zzso To zzso the zzso relationships among zzso zzso repeat number was mapped onto trees constructed from zzso zzso This approach allowed the potentially zzso zzso zzso to be placed in the evolutionary context of the less rapidly evolving zzso regions, revealing the complexities of the zzso processes that have generated the zzso diversity conventionally assessed in population genetic zzso In addition to changes in repeat number, frequent substitution zzso within the zzso were zzso as were zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso By comparing zzso and zzso zzso clear evidence of zzso zzso length zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed, suggesting that these zzso are not appropriate for zzso zzso relationships among zzso In contrast, little evidence of zzso zzso zzso was observed, confirming the utility of these zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso within species were generally consistent with the zzso zzso zzso By comparing variation within species at the zzso and the zzso estimated zzso zzso rates were approximately zzso times greater than zzso rates of zzso DNA and were consistent with estimates from zzso and fruit zzso A positive relationship between repeat number and zzso in repeat number was significant across three zzso zzso suggesting that longer zzso zzso are more zzso than shorter zzso To test if the observed patterns of zzso variation and zzso could be zzso an additional eight zzso zzso were characterized and zzso from a subset of the same zzso zzso
