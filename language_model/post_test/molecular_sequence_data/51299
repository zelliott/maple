We have previously shown that the expression of the gene zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is fundamentally different between zzso and male germ cells zzso et zzso zzso In zzso cells, two transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso In contrast, in zzso only the zzso zzso transcript is zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso is accompanied by reduced expression of the zzso zzso transcript to barely zzso zzso zzso differentiation to zzso round zzso is zzso with renewed expression in which the zzso zzso transcript is replaced by two truncated transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we report the characterization of a full-length beta zzso zzso clone from a zzso round zzso library that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso This transcript encodes the same open reading frame as the zzso zzso transcript, but zzso alternative zzso signals embedded within the long zzso region of the zzso zzso Based on sequence analysis, together with primer extension and zzso zzso protection experiments, both the zzso and the zzso zzso round zzso beta zzso transcripts are distinguished by the presence of an additional zzso sequence of approximately zzso zzso that is absent in zzso germ cells and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
