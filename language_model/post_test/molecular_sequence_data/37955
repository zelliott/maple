The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso Using zzso analysis on zzso sequence from human zzso zzso we identified novel zzso that shared significant zzso with the zzso zzso library screening and zzso produced the complete coding sequence of a novel human zzso family member, designated zzso The open reading frame zzso of zzso codes for a zzso zzso acid, zzso membrane protein that is zzso identical to the other zzso zzso zzso shares high zzso within the functional regions of the known zzso however, the zzso possesses a novel zzso substitution within a characteristic motif of the zzso zzso Northern analysis of multiple human tissue zzso demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso transcripts are widely zzso The zzso disorder zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso was previously mapped to the region of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso Using a zzso strategy for identifying the zzso zzso zzso was subjected to zzso analysis in DNA from zzso zzso We detected multiple zzso in the human zzso ORF, but did not find zzso zzso In zzso these studies identified the human zzso zzso as well as multiple zzso zzso that will be useful for further understanding the zzso relations of the zzso
