One major constraint in the clinical application of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the development of a human zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso can be minimized by replacing nonhuman regions with corresponding human zzso The studies reported in our article were undertaken to analyze the zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso an zzso construct comprised of mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a light chain shuffled zzso with human zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a humanized zzso assembled from zzso zzso and zzso zzso complementary determining regions zzso grafted onto a zzso framework of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso for an zzso binding site with zzso zzso in a similar fashion in a competition zzso and were able to inhibit the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was tested using zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso obtained from patients treated by zzso zzso in clinical zzso All tested zzso exhibited the highest zzso to the zzso zzso However, the zzso demonstrated differential zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Replacement of the mouse chain in zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased or completely averted serum zzso Our studies compared for the first time the zzso binding and zzso of different zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso grafted or human variable zzso These results indicate that the humanized zzso zzso is potentially an important agent for imaging and therapeutic applications with zzso zzso
