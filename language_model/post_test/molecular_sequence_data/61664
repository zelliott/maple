The zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso gene specifies recognition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains that express the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso cloning and is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso repeat zzso protein that is zzso to tobacco N and potato zzso resistance zzso zzso infection tests demonstrate that zzso zzso perception of zzso but not the zzso identical zzso zzso However, when delivered via zzso zzso transfer, both, zzso and zzso trigger a zzso hypersensitive response, indicating that naturally occurring zzso provide a unique experimental platform for molecular dissection of recognition zzso zzso studies revealed zzso retention in zzso zzso Yet, an zzso zzso zzso still mediates zzso zzso suggesting that the identified zzso zzso are not crucial to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso structure with exception of a zzso zzso in zzso 2 that causes zzso of the predicted zzso zzso To test if the zzso model is a valid molecular description of zzso zzso perception, we conducted zzso zzso zzso However, a direct interaction was not zzso Defense signaling of the zzso reaction was studied in zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso and showed that zzso resistance is zzso and zzso
