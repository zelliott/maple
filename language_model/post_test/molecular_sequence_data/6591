The zzso protein constituent of the zzso tuberculosis complex has been known mainly for its prominent zzso zzso and species specificity in zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the T cell immune repertoire in 27 zzso healthy subjects and 46 patients with active tuberculosis using 14 overlapping zzso peptides spanning the entire sequence of this zzso Four of the tested peptides individually zzso proliferation of blood zzso cells from more than 50% of healthy zzso zzso patients reacted to a zzso zzso range and with a zzso lower rate of responses to the four most zzso zzso but these differences do not distinguish in any simple way between the T cell repertoire of patients and zzso healthy zzso The most zzso zzso zzso was recognized by zzso of healthy subjects and by 50% of tuberculosis zzso zzso several zzso to this zzso were zzso with the other three most zzso peptides with sequences of zzso zzso and zzso resulting in an overall response rate to at least one of these four peptides of zzso in healthy controls and zzso in tuberculosis zzso In view of this additive effect between the most zzso zzso their combined use may achieve sufficient sensitivity in a test aimed at the specific discrimination between infected and zzso healthy zzso The major interest in testing with these peptides rests in their species zzso which is not achieved using zzso protein zzso zzso
