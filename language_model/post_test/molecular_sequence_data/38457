We have determined the zzso start points zzso for recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly designated zzso zzso and zzso respectively), zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the DNA upstream of these zzso and those from the literature has enabled us to identify consensus sequences that may represent a zzso zzso zzso There is a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on average at zzso zzso which is repeated at zzso zzso and an upstream consensus, zzso which is zzso at zzso zzso
