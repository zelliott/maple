The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso in zzso coli as the native form and as a zzso zzso zzso The latter form of the zzso was zzso by affinity zzso and shown to have the appropriate molecular weight by zzso mass zzso Both forms of the zzso reduced zzso zzso using zzso or zzso with zzso as the preferred zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso for zzso of zzso zzso The pH optimum for the zzso activity is zzso whereas that for rat zzso zzso is at pH zzso zzso zzso and high performance liquid zzso retention times of the reaction product reaction match those of authentic zzso the product of the reduction of zzso by the zzso zzso These results provide the first evidence for the formation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produce approximately zzso of the normal amount of zzso zzso containing zzso and other zzso core zzso but no zzso zzso Thus, surprisingly, the zzso of the conversion of zzso to zzso interferes with normal zzso zzso in zzso zzso interpretations of this finding are zzso
