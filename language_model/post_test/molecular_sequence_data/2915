The complete zzso acid sequence of chicken liver fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been determined from the corresponding zzso zzso A zzso zzso region of zzso coding for chicken fatty acid zzso has been cloned and zzso that is zzso to the zzso region previously zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 85, zzso The zzso codes for the remaining zzso zzso acids of the previously zzso region of the zzso The zzso acid sequence contains peptides known to be associated with the zzso binding site of the zzso active center, the zzso active site, the zzso site containing zzso and a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso binding site of the zzso active site and of the zzso active site are proposed on the basis of protein sequence zzso to zzso sites in other zzso The molecular weight of the complete zzso chain is zzso A linear functional map of the chicken fatty acid zzso derived from its primary sequence is zzso
