An Australian patient with zzso was found to be zzso for two zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in the protein zzso zzso and zzso The patient's mother carried only the zzso zzso The equivalent positions are 62 and 69 in zzso zzso zzso Although both human and zzso zzso zzso normally have zzso at position 87 (or zzso the zzso zzso zzso has zzso and zzso at 62 and 65, respectively, whereas human zzso has zzso and zzso at the equivalent zzso We have constructed, zzso and zzso the double zzso zzso as a zzso normal zzso zzso zzso to compare with zzso with a single zzso at position 62 zzso at position 69 zzso or at both positions zzso zzso for conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso is zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso for zzso is elevated in the zzso zzso and zzso is the least stable of these zzso at 37 degrees zzso The CD zzso of zzso and wild type zzso are zzso thus, there are no appreciable structural zzso Clearly the zzso causes the most drastic effect on zzso function, whereas the zzso zzso produces only modest zzso These results emphasize the importance of expanding tests for zzso zzso to individuals with zzso delay of any severity, including individuals with zzso spectrum zzso This study further demonstrates the usefulness of the zzso zzso zzso as a model to mimic the defective zzso in zzso zzso
