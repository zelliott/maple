The effects of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso on the dynamics and structure of microbial communities and zzso elimination rate were studied in soil zzso artificially contaminated with zzso The zzso managed to be established from the first zzso as it was evidenced by zzso zzso gel zzso analysis, increasing the number of zzso zzso and zzso cells and enhancing zzso zzso These effects were observed only during the zzso zzso Nevertheless, the soil biological activity zzso activity and zzso zzso showed a late zzso Whereas gradual and successive changes in bacterial community structures were caused by zzso contamination, the zzso provoked immediate, zzso and stable changes on soil bacterial zzso In spite of the long-term establishment of the zzso strain, at the end of the experiment, the zzso did not produce significant changes in the residual soil zzso concentration and did not improve the residual effects on the microbial soil zzso
