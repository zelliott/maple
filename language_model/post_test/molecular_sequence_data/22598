zzso correlations of zzso zzso are important in predicting how changes in the zzso zzso zzso repertoire will influence zzso immunity against invasive zzso zzso Using a unique panel of human zzso derived from memory B cells after zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso relationship of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso correlated with the zzso of donor immune serum (R, zzso P zzso zzso and this relationship was particularly strong for zzso A clones (R, 1; P zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso may represent important clones contributing to zzso zzso Common zzso chain combinations and zzso acid replacement zzso were seen for clones with the same zzso from different zzso The two zzso zzso used zzso and two zzso with the same zzso using the same V gene pairings zzso and zzso had similar zzso suggesting that zzso V gene use makes an important contribution to zzso Although all clones had zzso levels consistent with their being derived from memory B cells, low levels of replacement zzso were associated with high zzso This relationship was strongest for zzso genes (R, zzso P zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated for all zzso and there was a trend toward clones using zzso genes with low levels of zzso having high zzso activities (R, zzso These data suggest that the use of zzso genes in the zzso zzso response is associated with highly functional zzso and that most zzso zzso seen in these genes are not zzso zzso
