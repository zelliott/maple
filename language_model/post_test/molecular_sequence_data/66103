zzso zzso have been proposed to exhibit differing biological zzso due to differences in their relative occupancy of cellular zzso and zzso zzso The membrane binding and targeting motifs of zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso region zzso and the precise zzso depends upon interactions between the zzso and the host zzso Classic studies revealed that all zzso proteins rely on zzso and either zzso or a zzso stretch for stable binding to zzso We now show that, for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are not sufficient for specifying stable zzso zzso A third motif that is present within the zzso domain of all zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso to the plasma zzso This motif comprises zzso zzso that zzso zzso and basic zzso acids that are likely to interact zzso with zzso zzso enriched at the cell zzso zzso altered zzso is achieved without changes in zzso zzso Our data provide a mechanism for distinct zzso membrane interactions controlling zzso zzso In the context of the full-length zzso zzso this is likely to be of crucial importance for controlling zzso output and engagement with different pools of zzso
