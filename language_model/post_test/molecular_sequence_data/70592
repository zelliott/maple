zzso zzso sequences were obtained for 313 aligned bases of 41 individuals from 39 zzso zzso In contrast to previous molecular zzso the relationships suggested by these data show a high level of zzso with zzso defined orders and zzso Four main zzso lineages are zzso These are the zzso orders zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a grouping of the American orders zzso and zzso and the zzso species other than zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso there are again four main zzso zzso the zzso two zzso zzso lineages (one comprised of zzso zzso and the zzso This zzso is not greatly affected by the exclusion of zzso except that a zzso of zzso species zzso plus zzso is zzso Two other zzso zzso have zzso of about 1 zzso with high levels of similarity to LINE 1 zzso The zzso is notable for its relative lack of zzso variation in comparison to the zzso
