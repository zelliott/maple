We report the zzso functional expression and zzso zzso of the rat zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso utilizing multiple zzso zzso and their complementary sense controls, was performed to determine the detailed distribution of zzso zzso zzso in the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal zzso Within the brain, the zzso and zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso detected in the spinal zzso were localized to the sensory and motor zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, suggesting a role for the zzso zzso in the zzso of central nervous system zzso including pain zzso Within the gastrointestinal tract zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals were highly localized to the zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso These findings suggest a novel biological role for zzso zzso activity at the zzso zzso namely zzso zzso In addition, zzso binding zzso zzso analyses and equilibrium competition zzso and functional zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to characterize the zzso rat zzso zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso A single site of binding zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso 115 zzso zzso was measured for zzso zzso binding to the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be a potent zzso at the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso The rank order of efficacy for zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reflected the affinity with which the zzso bound to the zzso
