We have zzso the contribution of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to binding of zzso egg zzso We altered zzso at the contact interface by zzso zzso and determined the affinity of the zzso zzso fragments for zzso by zzso zzso zzso We found that a band of zzso at the zzso of the contact interface were much more important for binding affinity than those at the zzso We also subjected the zzso zzso to random zzso to simulate zzso zzso and affinity zzso By display of the zzso on the surface of zzso zzso and selection of the zzso with zzso zzso we were able to select zzso with modest improvements in binding affinity to zzso By combining the zzso we obtained a zzso zzso with a fivefold improved affinity zzso approximately zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, none of the altered zzso leading to improved affinity was located in the contact zzso This indicates that the interactions of a few zzso at the zzso of the contact interface are responsible for the binding affinity to zzso but that these interactions can be modulated by zzso of zzso outside the binding zzso This may represent a typical mechanism for the affinity maturation of zzso
