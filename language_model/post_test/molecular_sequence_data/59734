zzso B virus L protein is retained zzso and zzso zzso of the related S and M zzso as particulate zzso at high zzso zzso zzso of equivalent A and D strain zzso suggested that the retention mechanism does not vary with zzso zzso to an earlier zzso the zzso extension specific for zzso strains was found to be inactive as a retention zzso zzso L was more completely retained than any zzso zzso zzso zzso had either a critical zzso stretch, or zzso zzso Also, zzso of the latter class did not completely inhibit particulate zzso and could, in minor zzso reach the zzso We conclude that zzso the principal retention zzso can be traced to the same zzso segment in distinct strains and zzso zzso acid does reinforce retention in zzso zzso while acting in part as an zzso membrane anchor in zzso lacking the internal zzso
