zzso is an essential and toxic trace metal for bacteria and, therefore, must be tightly regulated in the zzso zzso zzso is a broadly studied model for copper zzso The zzso copper levels in zzso zzso are regulated by the cop zzso which is formed by four zzso zzso and zzso that zzso zzso for influx and zzso of copper, zzso zzso that encodes a copper zzso and zzso a copper responsive zzso Since the complete zzso sequence for zzso zzso is not available, it is possible that other genes may zzso proteins involved in copper zzso Here, we identified a zzso zzso in nine species of zzso order with a known zzso zzso All of them always zzso a zzso zzso and a copper zzso The alignment of the zzso zzso promoter region revealed two zzso binding sites, one of which was zzso in all zzso and the second was only present in species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional proteins associated to copper zzso zzso and zzso also were zzso This study allowed for the description of the structure and organization of the cop zzso and discussion of a zzso hypothesis based on the differences observed in this zzso organization and its regulation in zzso zzso
