A zzso study was carried out on strain zzso which was isolated from the zzso water of the Atlantic Ocean with zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Growth was observed at zzso from zzso to zzso and at temperatures from 4 to 37 zzso it was unable to zzso zzso 40, 80 or zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso represented a member of the zzso zzso with highest sequence similarity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso while the similarities to other species were all below zzso The zzso zzso estimate of the similarity between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso according to their zzso zzso The principal fatty acids were zzso zzso , zzso G, zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso and summed feature 9 zzso or zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso and five unknown lipids zzso were zzso The combined zzso and zzso data show that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
