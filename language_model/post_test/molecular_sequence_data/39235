The zzso zzso Factor zzso is a required protein complex for zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso downstream elements zzso through its zzso zzso zzso however, the exact nature of this interaction has remained zzso We used zzso alignments to identify and extract large sets of putative zzso sites for zzso from ten zzso species, including Homo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In order to further delineate the details of the zzso interaction, we obtained and multiply aligned zzso protein sequences from the same zzso 

We characterized the sequence content and specific positioning of putative zzso across the range of organisms zzso Our analysis characterized the downstream element zzso as two distinct parts - a zzso zzso element and a zzso zzso zzso We find that while the zzso element is largely zzso in all of the organisms zzso the zzso element is zzso Multiple alignment of the zzso zzso recognition motif revealed that, while it is highly zzso throughout zzso we can identify zzso acid changes that correlate with observed variation in the sequence content and positioning of the zzso 

Our analysis confirms the early reports of separate zzso and zzso zzso The correlated variations in protein sequence and zzso binding sequences provide novel insights into the interactions between the precursor zzso and the zzso zzso
