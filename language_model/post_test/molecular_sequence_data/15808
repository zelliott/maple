The isolation, primary structure and chemical synthesis of human zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso was zzso from human zzso extracts using a chemical method which detected the zzso zzso zzso structure of zzso Human zzso consists of 36 zzso acid zzso and the complete zzso acid sequence is: zzso zzso zzso The differences between the structures of zzso and human zzso are at positions 3 zzso zzso and 18 zzso zzso human zzso prepared using a zzso synthetic technique was found to be structurally identical to the natural zzso
