The zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and its zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso is made of two zzso an zzso zzso domain and a zzso domain that is necessary for zzso binding and for which it was not possible to determine the structure by X-ray zzso We determined the secondary structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso by nuclear magnetic resonance methods and found that it is of the zzso zzso Its arrangement differs from those of the other zzso binding zzso whose structure is zzso We also found that the isolated zzso domain behaves as a folded zzso zzso and we suggest the presence of a flexible zzso between the two zzso
