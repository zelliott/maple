zzso zzso are cosmopolitan zzso that zzso fishes, zzso zzso birds and zzso More than 20 species are recognized within this zzso zzso are a group of abundant and ubiquitous organisms that have been considered reservoirs of zzso for humans and zzso The aim of this study was to design specific zzso for the gene zzso zzso zzso potentially capable of amplifying any species or zzso of zzso zzso and evaluate the diagnostic attributes of the zzso based on such zzso The zzso were designed to amplify the shortest segment as possible to maximize the sensitivity of the test, but preserving the zzso potential of the amplified sequences for zzso zzso The zzso standardized in this study zzso was compared in terms of sensitivity with another similar zzso zzso that has been largely used for the detection and identification of zzso zzso zzso We also aimed to zzso characterize samples of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso using these zzso zzso zzso were captured in urban areas of the zzso of zzso zzso State, zzso zzso samples were submitted to three molecular tests zzso two of them targeted to the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso and the third targeted to the gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso was tested positive on samples of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Sixteen samples of zzso were positive by zzso six by zzso and five by zzso zzso of amplified fragments allowed the identification of zzso zzso in three samples of zzso zzso and two zzso of zzso the zzso mouse II and zzso zzso zzso mouse II was found in one sample of zzso zzso and zzso mouse III, in twelve samples, being five from zzso zzso and seven from zzso zzso The results of this study demonstrated that the zzso designed for detection of zzso zzso were more efficient than those used in the zzso zzso or species of zzso that can be usually transmitted for human beings and livestock were not found in zzso zzso suggesting that the importance of these animals in zzso transmission of zzso should be zzso
