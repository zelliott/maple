The zzso of a DNA zzso is characterized by several base pair and base step parameters such as twist, rise, roll, zzso twist, zzso in addition to zzso parameters such as the backbone and the zzso zzso zzso Among these only a few, which are independent of all others and of each other, may be used to precisely characterize the zzso The problem however is to identify these independent zzso We have used principal component analysis to identify a relatively small set of independent zzso with which to characterize each DNA zzso We show that these principal components clearly discriminate between A and B DNA zzso zzso The calculations further suggest that the zzso of a DNA zzso is better characterized using zzso
