The active site for the family zzso class II zzso is constituted in part by a zzso metal zzso mostly zzso as revealed in the crystal structures of zzso from both animal and bacterial zzso The metal zzso coordinates to the bound zzso and side chains of zzso zzso acid zzso Recently, evidence has accumulated that class II zzso is active in complex with a range of zzso metal zzso In the present work, with employment of the class II zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso we explored the influence of the zzso metal zzso on the associated zzso kinetic zzso zzso and zzso for various zzso With zzso as a zzso the zzso showed activity in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso was the preferred metal zzso with a zzso value of about 120 zzso zzso 6 times higher than that with zzso and zzso and 10 times higher than that with zzso With zzso zzso zzso or zzso as a zzso zzso was the only metal zzso promoting zzso of all zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso could substitute to a varying zzso A change in the zzso metal zzso generally affected the zzso for the zzso of zzso however, changes in both zzso and zzso for the zzso of zzso were observed, along with changing preferences for the zzso zzso Finally, it was found that the metal zzso and zzso bind in that order via a zzso ordered, sequential zzso
