zzso virus zzso forms large plaques zzso 3 zzso zzso on zzso cells whereas zzso forms only small plaques zzso 1 zzso zzso Fast growing zzso zzso isolated by mixed infection of zzso cells with these two virus strains in the presence of zzso zzso all carried the M gene from zzso On zzso cells, these zzso produced progeny viruses as rapidly as did zzso and the virus yield was as high as zzso The fast-growing zzso overcame the growth zzso effect of zzso zzso experiments at various times after virus infection showed that the zzso zzso started to zzso viral proteins earlier than zzso Taken together, we conclude that upon infecting zzso cells, the zzso viruses advance rapidly into the growth cycle, thereby leading to an elevated level of progeny viruses in the early period of zzso zzso mechanisms of the M gene involvement in the determination of virus growth rate are discussed, in connection with multiple functions of the M zzso
