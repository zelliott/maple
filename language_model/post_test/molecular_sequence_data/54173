The transient zzso potential channels zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly similar to zzso and shares many common properties with zzso zzso (and also its zzso zzso is a rather distinct member of the zzso zzso It is distant for being strictly zzso and features quite different properties from the rest of the zzso zzso It is known that zzso channels are regulated by zzso in a zzso zzso In our study we identified a zzso binding site on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to the consensus zzso binding motif zzso The zzso and zzso single zzso of zzso caused a 50% decrease in binding affinity and a double zzso of zzso of the same zzso lowered the binding affinity by up to zzso A double zzso of zzso and triple zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in the total loss of binding affinity to zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain zzso binding sites and that the basic zzso are strongly involved in zzso channel binding to zzso
