zzso at zzso is rearranged in a variety of zzso zzso and solid zzso with more than 20 different partners having been zzso These zzso result in either zzso proteins or zzso of the partner zzso However, there are a few examples of abnormalities resulting in truncated and, most zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso and/or the partner is zzso We present a novel zzso zzso identified in a zzso zzso acute zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso and molecular genetic analyses revealed a fusion of zzso and zzso (at zzso generated through a cryptic zzso between zzso and zzso consisting of zzso 1 and 2 of zzso and a sequence from zzso 1 of zzso This transcript is not expected to produce any zzso zzso but may zzso a truncated form of zzso containing the first 54 zzso acids zzso followed by 16 zzso from the 3' fusion zzso reminiscent of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso might also modify the regulation of zzso by either zzso a cryptic promoter or by coming under the control of the zzso zzso The present case zzso that zzso zzso zzso may play an important zzso role in zzso
