The zzso sequence zzso base zzso of the zzso region containing the structural genes for zzso 2 zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso The open reading frames present in this region are organized into two zzso zzso One contains zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and a zzso open reading frame zzso The second one includes zzso zzso the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a product similar to the delta zzso of zzso 2 from zzso zzso and zzso zzso the beta zzso of zzso zzso The zzso regions of zzso and zzso contain sequences similar to zzso zzso This gene arrangement allows independent expression of zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso carrying an zzso in zzso are still able to zzso the alpha and beta zzso of zzso 2 when grown in zzso zzso zzso zzso A strain zzso carrying a zzso zzso in the zzso region produced only zzso zzso zzso
