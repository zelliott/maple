The sponge zzso zzso produces a large diversity of zzso zzso zzso and hosts a complex microbial zzso Although zzso are located within sponge cells, the zzso that bind zzso elements to organic compounds have been exclusively described in algae, zzso and zzso zzso communities within zzso zzso could therefore be involved in the zzso of these zzso This study investigates whether changes in both the concentration of zzso and the bacterial zzso are correlated in zzso zzso To do so, we zzso major natural products using zzso liquid zzso and analyzed bacterial zzso using zzso zzso gel zzso on the zzso zzso zzso We identified multiple associations between bacteria and natural products, including a strong relationship between a zzso zzso and zzso and between an unidentified zzso and zzso and zzso Our results suggest that these bacteria could either be involved in the production of zzso or be directly affected by zzso To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports that find a significant correlation between natural products and bacterial populations in any zzso zzso Further investigating these associations will shed light on the organization and functioning of zzso systems such as zzso zzso
