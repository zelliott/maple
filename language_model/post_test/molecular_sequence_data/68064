Two zzso zzso A and C, of zzso A zzso from zzso zzso were expressed separately as truncated gene products from zzso zzso in zzso zzso The fusion products, referred to respectively as zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso at pH zzso and had a molecular mass of 30 zzso whereas zzso had a zzso of zzso and a molecular mass of 44 zzso The zzso activity shown by both zzso was optimal at 50 degrees C, but zzso was more sensitive than zzso to temperatures higher than the zzso zzso showed a higher sensitivity to pH than zzso The zzso activity of both zzso was completely zzso in the presence of copper or silver zzso and partially zzso by iron or zinc zzso Neither domain was active on zzso shorter than zzso the rate of degradation of longer zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased as the chain length zzso Analysis of the products of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that the two zzso differed in their modes of zzso zzso was the shortest product of the zzso With zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso activity was apparently restricted to regions where zzso zzso did not carry zzso zzso whereas zzso was able to release zzso carrying zzso zzso Neither domain was able to release zzso from zzso zzso zzso
