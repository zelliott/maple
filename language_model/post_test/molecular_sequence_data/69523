Genes for three novel zzso zzso have been identified and tested for zzso zzso sequence information was developed for zzso extracted from isolated zzso and the respective gene sequences were discovered by screening a DNA sequence zzso The three zzso contain zzso 188 and 183 zzso and are designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso is derived from a single copy zzso The zzso gene is adjacent to a gene for an unnamed protein associated with the zzso protein zzso The zzso gene is next to a gene for zzso protein zzso and the gene for zzso is on zzso III, between two open reading frames with no known zzso zzso disruption analyses showed that none of the three zzso is required for zzso The new zzso bring the number of zzso zzso characterized thus far in zzso zzso to 14, of which only three are zzso
