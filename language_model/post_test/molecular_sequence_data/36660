zzso zzso coli zzso produces visibly zzso colonies when grown on zzso or zzso zzso plates at room temperature, indicative of zzso zzso zzso zzso of 27 zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso produced enough zzso to be visually zzso Of five strains that showed no visible zzso production on these media, four zzso did produce zzso colonies on media containing higher salt zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso determination of zzso acid indicated that zzso production was affected by growth temperature, atmosphere, and zzso zzso zzso coli zzso strain zzso produced the greatest amounts of zzso when grown zzso at 37 degrees C, whereas its zzso zzso zzso produced large quantities of zzso when grown zzso at room zzso zzso zzso revealed thin, flexible fibers extending from the bacterial cell zzso zzso of strain zzso grown zzso at room temperature were completely encased in a thick zzso zzso Chemical analysis of zzso zzso revealed that it is very similar or identical to zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso better to zzso 407 cells when grown under conditions that favor high zzso production than when grown under conditions that repress zzso zzso
