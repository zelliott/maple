The zzso 63 zzso zzso gene is zzso regulated and is expressed only in the zzso Full zzso of the 63 zzso zzso gene requires two regulatory steps, the first independent and the second dependent on the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso clone of the 63 zzso zzso gene identified potential zzso and zzso binding sites upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso or enriched zzso as well as zzso nuclear extract in conjunction with zzso and zzso zzso have been used to demonstrate that human zzso and zzso bind elements upstream of the zzso initiation zzso In zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed several zzso within 350 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site, including those at the zzso and zzso sites, that are unique to zzso cells which express the zzso zzso These zzso were absent in blood cells and zzso cells which do not express the zzso zzso of zzso between cells which express the 63 zzso zzso gene at low or high levels showed that the same binding sites are occupied, indicating that these sites are required for zzso as well as zzso expression of the 63 zzso zzso zzso
