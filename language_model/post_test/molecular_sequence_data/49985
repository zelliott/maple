A novel zzso named zzso or zzso and involved in natural zzso was recently zzso This zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso which is located within the class III region of the human zzso zzso It is a member of the zzso gene zzso zzso and, zzso is expressed at the zzso level as six different zzso zzso in zzso Recent investigations have indicated that the zzso gene of the mouse is silenced by zzso stop zzso In this study, the molecular characterization of the rat zzso gene is zzso zzso derived from this gene zzso a protein of 192 zzso acid zzso predicted to contain a single zzso domain in the zzso region and a positively charged zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the gene was detected in freshly isolated rat Natural zzso zzso and T zzso zzso of rat zzso into the zzso cell line zzso induced zzso activity against zzso as well as zzso tumor zzso In addition, binding of a zzso fusion protein by a panel of target cells correlated with zzso to killing by zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso could function as an zzso zzso zzso as previously reported for the human zzso zzso zzso
