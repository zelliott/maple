zzso reconstructions may be hampered by multiple zzso in zzso positions obliterating zzso a phenomenon called zzso Traditionally, plotting zzso ratios against genetic distances has been used to reveal zzso by assessing when zzso zzso at zzso However, interpretation of results and assessment of zzso between different data sets or partitions are rather zzso zzso we present the new C factor, which zzso convergence of zzso ratios, thus allowing zzso Furthermore, we introduce a comparative value for zzso the zzso ratio, based on zzso of tree zzso zzso studies and an empirical example, based on zzso zzso zzso show that the C factor zzso with noise, tree length and genetic distance and therefore is a proxy for zzso The zzso ratio zzso with the C factor, which does not provide an intrinsic threshold of zzso and thus both together can zzso guide decisions to exclude saturated zzso zzso However, analyses also showed that, for reconstructing zzso zzso using zzso zzso an increase in numbers of positions improves tree reconstruction more than does the exclusion of saturated zzso
