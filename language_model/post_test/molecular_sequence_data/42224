zzso zzso zzso derived from a sequence of the zzso direct zzso zzso gene were used in a zzso chain reaction zzso amplification technique to detect this gene in strains of zzso zzso A total of 36 zzso and 89 zzso zzso zzso strains and 46 other zzso and enteric pathogens were zzso In all, 36 strains of zzso zzso from which the zzso gene could be successfully amplified by zzso were found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso No amplification products were obtained from zzso zzso strains that were zzso in the zzso zzso or from other zzso and enteric zzso with the exception of two zzso The zzso results were consistent with DNA zzso zzso The detection limit for the zzso gene by zzso amplification was 40 zzso of total DNA, or broth culture containing 1000 viable zzso zzso products were confirmed by restriction zzso zzso and Southern zzso zzso The zzso method could detect the zzso sequences in stool samples from patients with zzso caused by zzso zzso This zzso protocol clearly identified zzso strains of zzso zzso and provides an alternative to conventional methods for zzso detection by research laboratories, clinical laboratories, regulatory agencies, and the seafood zzso
