We have discovered a family of small zzso proteins in Homo sapiens and zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes zzso proteins of approximately 100 zzso acids that contain 11 zzso zzso zzso at fixed positions, including two zzso zzso In zzso zzso the family is composed of four genes and two zzso that are referred as zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso genes are clustered together on zzso 19 within a zzso zzso zzso zzso has a single zzso family member that is located on zzso zzso Further, evolutionary analysis shows a lack of direct zzso between any of the four human members and the mouse zzso This relationship between the mouse and the human family members suggests that the multiple members in the human complement have arisen from recent zzso events that appear limited to the zzso zzso zzso considerations and sequence comparisons would suggest that zzso proteins are zzso related to the zzso zzso of growth zzso zzso zzso display specific expression zzso they are expressed in fetal zzso breast, and zzso and in many zzso as well, and this pattern is consistent with that of the zzso family zzso
