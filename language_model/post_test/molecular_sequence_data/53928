zzso a zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of many zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have studied the structure of zzso in solution, using a combination of chemical and zzso zzso A model of the secondary structure was derived from experimental data with the help of computer simulation of zzso zzso The model contains 14 hairpin structures connected by zzso zzso The data also point to three zzso formed by distant zzso that close off structural zzso This model was generally compatible with the results of in zzso probing experiments with zzso in late zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso binding site of zzso which is zzso by zzso was accessible to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the in zzso structure represented a zzso form of zzso We also found that, within the 3' end of zzso the zzso hairpin 13 and the zzso form an intrinsic structural domain that exerts specific regulatory activity on protein A gene zzso
