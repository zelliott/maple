The gene zzso for zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a high degree of sequence identity zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso protein sequences suggested that the two zzso genes are distant zzso of zzso zzso The only known bacterial zzso zzso a strictly zzso zzso from zzso zzso is highly zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a true zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli generated a protein that both converted zzso to zzso and zzso with zzso raised against rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso yield to a specific activity of zzso zzso per zzso at 50 degrees C by a sequence of steps that included heat treatment, zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso and affinity zzso The final product was zzso as judged by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso was zzso not zzso the zzso was zzso not zzso The zzso values for zzso (17 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were similar in magnitude to those of other zzso zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso the zzso was stable at 90 degrees C and was zzso active at pH zzso and 85 degrees zzso
