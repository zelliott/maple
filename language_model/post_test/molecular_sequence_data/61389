The signal zzso zzso zzso by zzso protein zzso is an attractive target for the design of zzso effective zzso Two specific zzso small zzso zzso of this zzso have been zzso However, under certain circumstances, zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso We present here a novel approach for such zzso inhibitor zzso The procedure is based on the synthesis of a zzso zzso corresponding to a short zzso segment in the target zzso The results obtained so far show that a zzso designed in such a way is an effective inhibitor of the zzso The possible application of such peptides and zzso zzso as zzso for protein zzso regulation mechanisms is also zzso
