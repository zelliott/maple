We previously reported that the zzso zzso zzso syndrome is an zzso sugar chain transfer zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to confirm this hypothesis, we applied zzso zzso zzso analysis to zzso zzso zzso from patients with the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing 4, 2, and 0 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were separated by zzso Q zzso exchange column zzso from serum of a patient with the zzso zzso The molecular masses of zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso zzso 5, zzso zzso 6, and zzso zzso 6 Da by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso The differences between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso were both in accordance with the molecular mass of a zzso zzso sugar chain zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso is zzso and that zzso and zzso carry 2 and 1 zzso of zzso sugar zzso zzso The zzso zzso site of zzso was zzso to be random by high performance liquid zzso of a zzso zzso of reduced and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso through one step from serum is zzso for a zzso diagnosis of the zzso zzso
