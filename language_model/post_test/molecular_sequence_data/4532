We have identified the rat and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso We observed that the human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have zzso a stop zzso immediately zzso to the sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso This results in the functional equivalent of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Each zzso contains a zzso signal zzso demonstrates striking identity within the zzso zzso domain, and retains a similar zzso sequence zzso specific cluster zzso that is unique among zzso proteins and which zzso the zzso binding zzso In addition, we have identified an internal zzso region that is zzso to the minimal sequence of the zzso zzso zzso that is required for direct binding to the zzso domain of zzso zzso to this region, the rat and human zzso protein sequences diverge within a short internal zzso sequence that interrupts the zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that both human and rat zzso are zzso produced and are induced by the calcium zzso zzso but not by heat zzso The recognition that the truncated zzso zzso structure of the zzso zzso is zzso in human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests an important role for this unique member of the zzso zzso zzso
