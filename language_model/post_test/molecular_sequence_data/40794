zzso stimulates zzso in tumors through mechanisms that remain incompletely zzso Recent work indicates that zzso zzso the zzso zzso cluster and zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso along with other members of the zzso type 1 repeat zzso Here, we show that zzso of the zzso type 1 repeat protein zzso in cells zzso zzso and zzso promotes zzso and tumor zzso However, zzso zzso by zzso is zzso It occurs as a result of reduced transforming growth zzso zzso signaling caused by targeting of several regulatory components in this signaling zzso Specifically, zzso and zzso reduce the expression of the type II zzso zzso and zzso limits the expression of zzso Supporting these results, in human cancer cell lines, levels of the zzso primary transcript zzso zzso correlate with those of many zzso genes that are not direct targets of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, enforced expression of zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso results in impaired gene zzso by zzso Together, our results define a zzso in which zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso to shut down zzso zzso thereby stimulating zzso and tumor cell zzso
