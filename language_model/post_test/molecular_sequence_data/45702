zzso proteins play important roles in various cellular functions, including cell zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we identified a gene zzso a zinc finger protein named zzso which was isolated from human zzso zzso library and mapped to zzso by searching the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and has a zzso acids open reading zzso The predicted protein contains a zzso region zzso or zzso zzso at the zzso At the zzso of the zzso there are 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of zzso showed that it was zzso expressed in 18 human adult zzso zzso protein was located in the nucleus when zzso in cultured zzso These results indicate that zzso is a member of the zzso family and it may function as a zzso zzso
