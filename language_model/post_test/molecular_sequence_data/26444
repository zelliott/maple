The transformed zzso of rat zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso is suppressed by simultaneous or subsequent zzso with the normal zzso zzso The suppressed cells express both the normal and zzso forms of zzso zzso but the normal form zzso zzso transformed cells obtained after simultaneous zzso express mainly the zzso zzso Some suppressed cells induce zzso in nude mice after a long lag period and these zzso cell lines have much reduced expression of normal zzso The normal zzso gene also suppresses the transformed zzso induced by zzso zzso albeit less zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cell line, which contains only the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is also suppressed following zzso with the normal zzso zzso The results suggest that transforming zzso of zzso genes do not behave in a fully dominant manner and that expression of the normal zzso at elevated levels can lead to suppression of the transformed and zzso zzso
