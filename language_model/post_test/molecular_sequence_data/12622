We have examined the positive influence of human constant regions on the folding and bacterial expression of active soluble mouse zzso variable zzso derived from a number of zzso zzso zzso yields of eight zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments are compared in both shake zzso and high density zzso In addition the usefulness of this system for the generation of in zzso expression libraries is examined by constructing and expressing combinations of heavy and light chain variable regions that were not selected as a pair during an immune zzso A zzso study of one of the zzso zzso zzso fragments reveals that single zzso acid zzso can have dramatic effects on the expression zzso This system should be generally zzso to the production of zzso fragments of zzso and other zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso
