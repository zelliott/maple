The zzso zinc finger is the most prevalent protein motif in the zzso zzso Two zzso fingers in zzso are dedicated to zzso interactions between family zzso We show here that these fingers comprise a bona fide zzso zzso zzso is highly selective, however, as zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso Hunchback proteins support zzso but not zzso with zzso zzso selectivity is determined by 11 zzso concentrated within the zzso regions typically involved in base zzso zzso zzso of one zzso protein predicts a parallel zzso interface and establishes the feasibility of creating novel zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso motif provides a versatile platform for both zzso zzso acid interactions and highly specific zzso
