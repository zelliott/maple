zzso gas emissions represent a major problem associated with zzso management in the livestock zzso A prerequisite to mitigate methane emissions occurring during zzso storage is a clearer understanding of how the microbial zzso involved in zzso zzso Here, we have examined zzso stored in outdoor tanks from two different farms, at different locations and zzso zzso and zzso characterization of these samples indicated differences between each tank, as well as differences within each tank dependent on the depth of zzso The dynamics of both the bacterial and zzso communities within these samples were monitored over a zzso period of zzso incubation to identify and track emerging zzso which may be temporally important in the zzso zzso zzso based on DNA zzso of microbial communities identified trends common among all samples as well as trends specific to certain zzso All zzso communities became enriched with zzso zzso over time, indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Although the emerging species differed in samples obtained from shallow depths compared to deep samples, the zzso enrichment of zzso suggests that this zzso may represent a relevant indicator of zzso activity in zzso zzso storage zzso
