The zzso zzso heavy chain variable zzso gene family of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso distant zzso is unique in that zzso diversity zzso joining zzso and constant region zzso gene segments are linked closely, in multiple individual zzso The V regions of 12 zzso zzso and zzso DNA clones have been zzso completely and three organization patterns are evident: zzso zzso with unique zzso and zzso zzso in the respective D zzso signal sequences zzso zzso and zzso segments have 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an unusual zzso zzso with joined zzso and zzso segments and zzso zzso with all zzso elements being zzso The latter two zzso do not appear to be zzso Another zzso gene possesses a D1 segment that is flanked by zzso with 12 zzso zzso and a zzso segment with zzso zzso Based on the comparison of zzso zzso zzso sequences to a zzso consensus, it is evident that both zzso segments as well as zzso and zzso diversity account for zzso zzso In this early zzso the zzso genes share unique properties with higher zzso zzso zzso as well as with zzso and may reflect the structure of a common ancestral zzso binding zzso zzso
