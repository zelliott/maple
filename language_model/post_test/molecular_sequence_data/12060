We previously described the construction of novel hybrid proteins based on the zzso of zzso toxin zzso zzso et zzso Gene 149 zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso zzso from the third variable zzso loop in the envelope zzso zzso from human zzso virus type 1 zzso was inserted within a zzso region between zzso acids zzso 55 and zzso The resulting protein retained properties of native zzso and could induce strong zzso zzso zzso responses, but the inserted zzso zzso was only modestly zzso In this study, the potential use of this internal zzso site in zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso has been further zzso Six additional plasmids were constructed zzso zzso hybrid proteins with ten to zzso zzso from the zzso loop of zzso genetically inserted at different positions between zzso 52 and 65, with deletions of different zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins with peptides inserted between zzso 53 and 64 in zzso gave rise to stable proteins which reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso and bound to zzso zzso zzso indicating that insertions between these positions do not drastically alter the zzso or the zzso properties of native zzso zzso were also constructed zzso zzso hybrid proteins which had either an zzso zzso from zzso B virus zzso zzso or one of two peptides related to the zzso toxin zzso of zzso zzso coli inserted between zzso 55 and 64 of zzso This resulted in the production of zzso or zzso hybrid proteins and illustrated that the internal zzso site can be used for zzso of peptides of varying zzso zzso The zzso of the inserted zzso with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso varied greatly between hybrid proteins and depended on the position in zzso and the zzso composition of the inserted zzso Despite these differences, all the zzso zzso and zzso hybrid proteins could induce low, but zzso levels of serum zzso in mice against zzso zzso or zzso in addition to strong serum zzso responses against zzso The zzso response against the internally inserted zzso zzso was similar to that against the same zzso fused to the zzso of zzso indicating that internally placed peptides had similar zzso to the same peptides added zzso
