Two types of zzso structures were zzso from African zzso mosaic zzso zzso zzso zzso plants and analyzed by electron zzso and image zzso After cesium zzso density zzso zzso they were separated into lighter top zzso and heavier bottom zzso zzso T particles zzso with host zzso whereas B particles were concentrated in a cesium density typical for complete zzso Both particles were composed of two incomplete zzso of 11 zzso each, but T particles were slightly larger zzso zzso zzso and less dense in the interior than B particles zzso zzso zzso T particles were frequently associated with small zzso of approximately 14 zzso diameter of unknown zzso The overall structure of zzso a zzso transmitted by zzso was similar to that of zzso streak virus zzso a zzso transmitted by zzso although the zzso of the zzso were less zzso Models of zzso coat proteins based on Satellite tobacco necrosis virus support the exposure of parts of the zzso essential for transmission specificity by zzso and provide possible structural explanations for the smaller zzso of the zzso zzso relative to zzso The differences of zzso and zzso zzso shapes are discussed with reference to their different animal zzso
