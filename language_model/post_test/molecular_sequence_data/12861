The metabolism of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso is correlated to the production of zzso antibiotics in many zzso Despite its significance, this zzso zzso is poorly understood in zzso In order to develop a better understanding of zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso respectively, were cloned from zzso zzso a strain producing zzso potent zzso zzso The genes were isolated by applying a combination of zzso and zzso library zzso The deduced zzso sequences revealed significant zzso to the zzso and zzso proteins from other bacterial zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso by using the expression zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced high levels of zzso whose activity was feedback inhibited by zzso
