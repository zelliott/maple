zzso are zzso of bone which zzso each year from the heads of male zzso In addition to bone, support zzso such as nerves also zzso Nerves must grow at up to 1 zzso The control of this rapid growth of nerves is zzso We examined the relative expression of zzso zzso zzso in the different zzso of the growing antler tip and along the zzso layer of the antler zzso of the red deer zzso zzso using zzso reverse zzso chain zzso zzso in the tip was found to be highest in the zzso layer and lowest in the zzso layer in all zzso stages zzso These data correlate well with the density and pattern of zzso of these zzso Along the zzso layer of the antler zzso expression was highest in the segments zzso to the tip and lowest near the base, arguing for differences in the zzso expression of zzso in these zzso The expression of zzso in cells isolated from the different layers of zzso antlers did not mirror that observed when whole zzso were used and may suggest regional specificity of zzso expression within antler zzso
