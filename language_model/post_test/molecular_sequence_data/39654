We have developed methods for using DNA array technology to probe the entire zzso to determine the zzso specificity of zzso Two methods were zzso In the first method, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso linked to magnetic zzso The beads were bound to human liver zzso and washed, and specifically bound zzso was zzso zzso and analyzed with DNA array zzso A small number of genes were found to bind specifically to the zzso zzso In the second method, the zzso zzso was added directly to the array zzso reaction, and the signal was compared with a control experiment in the absence of zzso The zzso were found to interfere with a small percentage of all zzso zzso These methods differ from traditional DNA array experiments in that the zzso is a direct measure of the interaction between zzso and a zzso rather than an indirect measure of effect on zzso We expect that the results will lead to the discovery of new zzso zzso motifs and may also have relevance toward understanding and overcoming the side effects observed with these antibiotics in the zzso
