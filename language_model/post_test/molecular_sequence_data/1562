We screened for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso a typical zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso revealed a single zzso in zzso 9 of the zzso gene in zzso zzso among 66 patients with zzso No zzso were detected in 52 healthy individuals zzso zzso but the same zzso was detected in other zzso diseases zzso zzso DNA sequencing showed a T to C substitution at zzso 766 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which does not alter the zzso acid sequence of the zzso Further analysis using a zzso generated different melting zzso indicates that the pattern with this zzso is different from that of wild zzso The identified zzso of the zzso gene may represent a zzso associated with zzso
