The sequence of seven zzso genes zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strains including zzso species 14, 15, 16, and 17 and from zzso zzso strains zzso 640, and zzso was zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso DNA of these strains and of zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso with zzso followed by zzso with zzso and zzso specific zzso indicated that these genes were located in the zzso zzso analysis of the genes indicated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso 16 formed a cluster zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso 15, zzso 17, and zzso zzso strain zzso formed another cluster zzso to zzso zzso A third cluster was constituted by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso The zzso drawn from zzso sequences was consistent with that based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso genes were all species specific except for zzso located in a zzso non zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso genes may be suitable for identification at the species level and for analysis of the zzso relationships of zzso
