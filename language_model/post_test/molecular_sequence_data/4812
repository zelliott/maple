The zzso nerve growth factor zzso and zzso zzso support the survival of zzso of primary sensory zzso with defined and distinct zzso zzso Only a few genes have been identified as being zzso expressed in these zzso and not much is known about the nature of the molecules involved in the processing of sensory information in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso We devised a simple zzso root zzso zzso zzso culture system, allowing the selection of zzso populations zzso responsive to zzso or zzso The reliability of this zzso was first monitored by the differential expression of the zzso and zzso receptors zzso and zzso as well as that of zzso and zzso zzso We then identified four zzso expressed sodium channels, two enriched in the zzso population and two others in the zzso zzso Finally, using an zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified 20 additional zzso all zzso expressed in zzso zzso cultured with zzso or zzso This approach thus allows the identification of large number of genes expressed in zzso of primary sensory zzso and opens the possibility of studying the molecular mechanisms of zzso and zzso
