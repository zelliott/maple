The zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are expressed in the three major types of muscle zzso zzso and zzso and function as zzso zzso of zzso and growth zzso genes through binding to a zzso zzso zzso Although zzso proteins are also expressed in brain, zzso zzso gene products are not detected in this zzso To gain insight into the regulation of zzso function in zzso we have selected its optimal DNA targets from a library of zzso zzso using zzso zzso and cell extracts from skeletal muscle, heart, and zzso The consensus binding site in these three zzso contains an indistinguishable core zzso zzso However, the optimal target for zzso expressed in the brain shows additional sequence constraints zzso that are not observed in the sequences selected with skeletal and cardiac muscle zzso Thus, differences in DNA binding preferences of zzso proteins in muscle and brain may contribute to zzso gene expression during zzso and zzso
