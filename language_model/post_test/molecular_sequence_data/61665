zzso zzso zzso is the precursor for the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso A and zzso carrier zzso and is zzso in zzso coli by four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the first and last steps, zzso Two genes zzso zzso and one for zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso for all three genes were amplified by zzso The zzso were able to complement their respective zzso coli zzso demonstrating that they zzso functional zzso zzso zzso of the proteins was investigated using green fluorescent protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso fusion proteins were targeted exclusively to zzso whereas zzso was found in the zzso This implies that there must be zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity could be measured in zzso zzso from both pea leaves and zzso suspension zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso of the remaining two zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso of zzso could be identified using either conventional blast or searches with the program fugue in which the structure of the zzso coli zzso was compared to all the zzso proteins in zzso zzso also appears to be absent from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by the same zzso In contrast, a putative zzso zzso with some similarity to zzso was identified with zzso
