Using zzso zzso we have amplified and zzso the zzso acid zzso receptors from the brain of zzso chick zzso Both flip and flop zzso of each of these zzso receptors zzso were identified and zzso zzso comparisons showed that the two zzso for each chick zzso zzso were zzso zzso whereas zzso chick and rat zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso analysis were employed to identify regional variation in flip and flop levels of each zzso zzso Flip zzso of zzso 1-3 predominated in zzso while flop zzso of zzso zzso were more prevalent in the zzso This differential regional expression suggests that alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso contributes zzso to synaptic diversity in chick central nervous zzso
