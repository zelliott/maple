zzso zzso strains are well-known for their considerable zzso variations in terms of tolerance to harsh wine conditions and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between two zzso with differing enological zzso was used to zzso the genetic bases of this zzso diversity and identify novel genes involved in adaptation to zzso zzso revealed 182 zzso fragments corresponding to 126 open reading frames zzso A large proportion of the zzso zzso resembled genes involved in zzso transport and zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Six regions of zzso plasticity were identified, and their analysis suggested that both limited zzso and zzso events contributed to the vast zzso diversity observed in zzso zzso The association of selected sequences with adaptation to wine was further assessed by screening a large collection of strains using zzso No sequences were found to be specific to highly performing zzso strains zzso However, there was a statistically significant positive association between zzso strains and the presence of eight gene sequences located on regions 2, 4, and zzso Gene expression patterns were significantly modified in zzso zzso following exposure to one or more of the common stresses in zzso zzso 2 and 5 showed no traces of mobile elements and had normal zzso zzso In contrast, region 4 had the typical hallmarks of horizontal transfer, suggesting that the strategy of acquiring genes from other bacteria enhances the fitness of zzso zzso zzso
