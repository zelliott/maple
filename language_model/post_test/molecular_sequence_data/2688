In order to evaluate the structural identification of various zzso human zzso zzso the zzso proteins were produced in four different zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso cells, Chinese zzso zzso cells and mouse zzso zzso and zzso Each zzso zzso human zzso 1 represented a single band of 23 zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso the same molecular mass as zzso natural human zzso zzso zzso activities, zzso acid compositions, zzso zzso zzso maps on zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso and circular zzso zzso of zzso proteins were in good agreement with natural zzso On the other hand, the patterns of zzso focusing were different between zzso zzso human zzso zzso and natural human zzso zzso Sugar composition analysis revealed that the zzso protein from Chinese zzso zzso cells has a similar sugar composition to that of natural protein and the other zzso proteins have increased amounts of zzso and zzso in comparison to the natural zzso Furthermore, there is no zzso in the natural zzso while small amounts of zzso were detected in the zzso released from zzso and zzso zzso proteins by zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso human zzso zzso have identical zzso to those of natural human zzso 1 but their zzso zzso including unusual zzso zzso are individually different from natural ones and depend on the host zzso
