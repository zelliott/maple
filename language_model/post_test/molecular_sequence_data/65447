In this paper we characterize zzso the human zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate its role in prostate zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed the zzso of zzso to zzso plasma membrane and the early zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso studies showed zzso as a highly zzso zzso type I zzso zzso Analysis of expression of zzso in various human zzso revealed its presence in most human zzso with especially high expression in heart, kidney and zzso zzso controls the expression of the gene as a marked zzso increase is seen in the zzso prostate cancer cell line, zzso on zzso zzso This is further supported by its decrease in expression in zzso zzso upon zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso in zzso prostate cancer cells increased colony formation, suggesting a probable role in cell zzso These results suggest that zzso may have a role in normal biology of the prostate cell and in prostate zzso
