zzso screening of a zzso zzso library led to the detection of two distinct but zzso mouse zzso called zzso alpha and zzso zzso The corresponding transcripts have a tissue distribution restricted to T zzso where they are zzso upon zzso and to mast zzso The zzso regions of both zzso zzso proteins zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso however, only to the zzso of zzso The zzso alpha and zzso beta genes both map to the C1 band of mouse zzso zzso zzso comparisons suggest that the zzso of an zzso zzso gene evolved to the zzso genes by successive zzso first to zzso then to zzso These results raise the question of the possible role of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso themselves and of zzso zzso in activated T zzso from a different point of view, they also show that some zzso zzso may have evolved as autonomous zzso
