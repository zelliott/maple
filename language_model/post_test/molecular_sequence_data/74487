European chickens were introduced into the American zzso by the Spanish after their arrival in the 15th zzso However, there is ongoing debate as to the presence of pre-Columbian chickens among zzso in South America, particularly in relation to Chilean breeds such as the zzso and Passion zzso To understand the origin of these zzso we have generated partial zzso DNA control region sequences from 41 native Chilean specimens and compared them with a previously generated database of approximately 1,000 domestic chicken sequences from across the world as well as published Chilean and zzso ancient DNA zzso The modern Chilean sequences cluster closely with zzso predominantly distributed among European, Indian zzso and Southeast Asian zzso consistent with a European genetic zzso A published, apparently zzso Chilean zzso and six zzso zzso specimens also cluster with the same zzso zzso Asian zzso providing no support for a zzso introduction of chickens to South zzso In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on zzso Island group with an uncommon zzso from Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines zzso and may represent a genetic signature of an early zzso zzso Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological zzso casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian zzso and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and zzso and stable isotope data from archaeological zzso within both Chile and zzso
