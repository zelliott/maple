zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor composed of two zzso zzso and zzso which is activated under zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in a wide variety of cell types, whereas in some others zzso gene expression is zzso by zzso In this report, we show that in zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso expression level is the same in both zzso and zzso zzso analysis experiments of the zzso promoter showed that in zzso zzso gene expression is zzso through a short sequence located next to the zzso initiation zzso We also show that in zzso another sequence located upstream from the zzso initiation site plays an zzso role on zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso cells and brings back this expression level to that observed in zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso gene zzso is dependent on zzso binding sites and that the zzso sequence also contains other important zzso zzso
