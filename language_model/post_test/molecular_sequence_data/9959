The isolation of rearranged zzso zzso variable region zzso genes is usually performed by zzso with consensus zzso binding to zzso regions within the V zzso However, the isolation of zzso genes by this method is hampered in zzso by technical difficulties, mostly zzso of zzso zzso to V zzso In order to obtain DNA sequences from V heavy chain zzso genes which could not be amplified with consensus zzso we used a modified zzso technique, the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso in combination with new heavy chain constant region zzso for the isolation of human and zzso zzso zzso In comparison, consensus primer zzso with different sets of previously published zzso zzso was zzso Both methods were applied to isolate zzso genes from zzso B cell zzso zzso and zzso myeloma zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and from freshly isolated human chronic zzso leukemia and zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed the amplification and subsequent cloning of the complete zzso gene in all zzso In contrast, consensus primer zzso failed to isolate the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso cell line; this was explained by a mismatch of consensus zzso with zzso zzso When both zzso methods amplified zzso zzso the DNA sequences obtained were zzso Taken together, zzso zzso represents a reliable and versatile method for the isolation of zzso genes from human and zzso zzso cells, in particular if consensus primer zzso zzso
