zzso secondary structure occurs widely in zzso proteins and its formation is a key step in their zzso As a consequence, understanding the zzso of zzso formation is crucial to understanding protein folding and zzso We have measured the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acids for an zzso in an intact zzso zzso zzso and for a zzso zzso with a sequence identical to that of the zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso are in excellent zzso This shows that when compared in the same sequence context, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acids are identical in zzso peptides and intact zzso and that conclusions based on studies of the zzso transitions of peptides may, in favorable cases, be directly zzso to zzso Our zzso zzso based on zzso zzso are in good agreement with those from similar studies of zzso and T4 zzso In contrast, our zzso zzso differ substantially from those derived from studies of zzso or salt zzso model zzso zzso
