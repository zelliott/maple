zzso is a zzso zzso expressed on the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso zzso and plays an important role in zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms that mediate the regulation of zzso we have isolated and characterized the mouse zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and promoter region and determined zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a protein of 594 zzso acids with 13 putative zzso zzso inducing high affinity zzso transport of zzso in zzso zzso Three different zzso transcripts derived from alternative zzso and zzso were identified in kidney and zzso The zzso gene is a single copy gene zzso 15 zzso spread over 75 zzso pairs that maps to mouse zzso zzso zzso initiation occurs from a single site, 29 base pairs downstream to a zzso zzso zzso The promoter is zzso zzso contains a number of well characterized zzso zzso and can drive zzso zzso activity in zzso kidney cells but not in zzso or zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso This study represents the first characterization of the zzso organization of a zzso zzso zzso It also provides the basis for a detailed analysis of zzso gene regulation and the tools required for assessing zzso role in zzso zzso using targeted gene manipulation in zzso
