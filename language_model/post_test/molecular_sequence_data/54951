Complete zzso sequences of Sweet potato virus G zzso and Sweet potato virus 2 zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso respectively, excluding the zzso zzso Their zzso organizations are typical of zzso zzso a zzso which is likely zzso into 10 mature proteins by three viral zzso zzso motifs of zzso proteins of viruses in the zzso zzso are found in corresponding positions of both zzso zzso comparisons of individual protein sequences of the two viruses with those of 78 other zzso show that zzso protein and coat protein zzso of both viruses are significantly large, with the zzso zzso as the largest among the all the known species of the zzso zzso The extended zzso region of the zzso protein is zzso in the zzso and zzso infecting sweet zzso A novel ORF, zzso is identified within the zzso region of zzso zzso Sweet potato zzso zzso virus zzso and Sweet potato virus C zzso The zzso half of zzso is highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso and Sweet potato zzso zzso analysis based on the deduced zzso zzso acid sequences supports the view that these five viruses are grouped together in a zzso zzso The analysis also reveals that Sweet potato virus Y and zzso vein mosaic virus are grouped with zzso as one species, and these two viruses should be consolidated with zzso
