The solitary zzso zzso zzso possesses three types of zzso the zzso tail zzso muscle, the adult heart zzso muscle, and the adult body wall smooth zzso The zzso complex is observed in all types of muscle, and the zzso sequences and expression patterns of two of the three zzso zzso zzso C and zzso have been zzso In this study, we have determined zzso sequences of the three zzso zzso from zzso zzso One of the three zzso zzso zzso expressed in adult body wall smooth muscle and heart muscle, was composed of 173 zzso zzso being similar to zzso fast and slow skeletal zzso in zzso The other two zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso were isolated from a zzso library of zzso Both zzso zzso were composed of 142 zzso zzso with zzso amounting to zzso 30 zzso acid zzso at the zzso These zzso zzso are the smallest known zzso The position of the last zzso of these zzso was also zzso When compared with zzso zzso zzso the last zzso of the zzso adult zzso gene is located at 6 zzso zzso and the zzso of the two zzso zzso are positioned at 9 zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by at least three zzso
