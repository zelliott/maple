Go alpha is a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso similar in structure and function to zzso alpha and zzso alpha of the zzso zzso complex and to zzso zzso zzso of the retinal zzso zzso zzso Although expression of Go alpha protein has been reported to be zzso other workers have found Go alpha zzso in all rat zzso zzso In order to clarify this contradiction, studies to verify the distribution of Go alpha zzso and protein in bovine and rat zzso were zzso zzso were screened for the presence of Go alpha zzso by use of a series of restriction fragments of a bovine retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complementary to sequences specific among G alpha zzso for the zzso untranslated and coding regions of Go zzso These zzso zzso predominantly with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in bovine brain and zzso A zzso zzso in zzso also zzso strongly with the zzso but zzso with the zzso zzso In bovine zzso two zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso while only the zzso species zzso with the zzso zzso In bovine heart, only a zzso zzso was detected and in amounts much less than those in the other zzso A similar distribution of Go alpha zzso was seen in rat zzso In bovine zzso Go alpha protein was identified with rabbit zzso zzso directed against zzso bovine brain Go zzso An zzso zzso membrane protein was found principally in zzso and brain, and in a lesser amount in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
