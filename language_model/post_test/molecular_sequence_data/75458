Four of the genes for the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been cloned into zzso Previous studies have shown that two of these zzso for the alpha and beta zzso can complement zzso coli zzso defective in the genes for those zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here a restriction map of the cloned region and the complete zzso sequence of the genes for the beta and zzso zzso as well as the deduced zzso acid sequences and molecular weights of those zzso
