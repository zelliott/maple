zzso of the literature has revealed that regarding the zzso acid zzso zzso constitute a family of homogeneous zzso In contrast, zzso appear zzso as far as their biological and zzso properties are zzso As a result, comparison between these molecules with a view to establishing zzso correlations is zzso We have therefore reviewed recent works aiming at identifying the functional site of a defined zzso zzso toxin gamma from the zzso of the spitting zzso zzso zzso The biological and structural properties of toxin gamma are first zzso In particular, a model depicting the zzso structure of the toxin studied by zzso zzso is zzso The toxin zzso chain is folded into 3 adjacent zzso rich in zzso structure connected to a small zzso core containing the 4 zzso zzso A number of derivatives chemically modified at a single aromatic or zzso group have been zzso The structure of each zzso was zzso by zzso fluorescence, circular zzso and zzso zzso Also tested was the ability of the derivatives to kill mice, zzso excitable cell zzso and lyse zzso zzso zzso of some zzso in the first loop, in particular zzso and at the base of the second loop substantially affected biological properties, with no sign of zzso structural modifications other than local zzso zzso in other regions much less affected the biological properties of the zzso A plausible functional site for toxin gamma involving loop I and the base of loop II is zzso It is stressed that the functional site of other zzso may be zzso
