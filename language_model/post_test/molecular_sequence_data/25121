A zzso library was prepared from zzso zzso from mouse zzso cells carrying a zzso human zzso zzso zzso with zzso gene zzso identified a zzso zzso clone zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso cells, showing it is of mouse rather than zzso gene zzso Its zzso sequence was zzso zzso long and zzso starting from the first zzso an open reading frame of 588 zzso followed by a 3' zzso region and 26 A zzso at the 3' zzso zzso with the zzso data base revealed zzso zzso with zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso deduced from 11-5 was of the same length and contained only one zzso acid difference compared with the rat zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso gene probe showed stretches of zzso that were, however, too short to be taken into zzso We conclude that the 11-5 sequence encodes the mouse zzso zzso zzso
