The zzso carrier family zzso is a group of structurally zzso proteins that mediate the transport of a wide range of zzso zzso across the zzso inner zzso In this paper, an overview of the zzso carrier proteins zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso analysis and zzso reconstruction gave insight into the evolution and conservation of the 24 identified zzso for most of these, putative transport functions could be zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inventory to those previously reported for other zzso revealed remarkable zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks genes zzso some zzso zzso members, such as the zzso carrier and zzso zzso The in zzso expression of the identified zzso in the two replicating zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso was zzso assessed at the zzso level by Northern zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that majority of the 24 identified zzso is found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
