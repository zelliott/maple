Experimental infections of zzso zzso zzso were performed with a zzso zzso strain zzso isolated in New zzso from zzso 93 diseased zzso zzso zzso resulting from intramuscular injection or immersion of shrimp in bacterial suspensions demonstrated high zzso for this bacterial strain and suggested that zzso zzso could be the zzso agent of zzso zzso The median lethal dose zzso for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forming zzso zzso by immersion and less than 5 zzso zzso by intramuscular challenge, with mortality outbreaks at 48 and 22 h after challenge, zzso A zzso chain reaction zzso detection zzso using a primer set designed from the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso was zzso It gave an expected zzso of approximately 310 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The specificity of these zzso was assessed with different zzso zzso Furthermore, DNA extracted by the zzso method could be used to detect fewer than 20 cultured zzso cells in zzso or shrimp zzso by this zzso It appears to be a reliable screening method for detecting zzso zzso in shrimp and from the aquatic zzso
