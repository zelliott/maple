A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso from zzso zzso was identified using zzso The presence of both zzso and zzso extensions in zzso protein suggested its zzso zzso The transient expression of zzso using green fluorescent protein fusion in tobacco zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso was a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli caused division site zzso and zzso formation, suggesting evolutionary functional conservation of zzso during plant zzso According to the zzso tree, zzso protein has a close relationship with the zzso plants, which suggests that the transfer events of zzso gene from zzso to nucleus might have occurred before the origin of the land zzso
