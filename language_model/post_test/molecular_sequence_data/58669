zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear factor I) zzso region using a set of DNA duplexes containing zzso or zzso zzso zzso groups at different positions of the zzso recognition sequence was zzso The zzso zzso DNA binding domain and nuclear extract from rat liver were zzso We showed that zzso from these species specifically binds to modified DNA zzso A correlation in binding affinity of both types of duplexes was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain and zzso in nuclear liver extract to DNA duplexes carrying zzso zzso groups was zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso in liver extract to zzso zzso DNA duplex, containing a zzso zzso group between zzso G and T of the zzso zzso immediately zzso to the zzso recognition zzso amounts to zzso of the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA duplexes to other components of nuclear extract was not zzso These results indicate that DNA duplexes carrying zzso zzso zzso groups can specifically bind and zzso with zzso zzso especially zzso factors in crude preparations and could constitute a potential tool to control the expression of zzso zzso
