We have characterized a zzso in the type II collagen gene zzso that produces a form of zzso zzso The zzso is an internal tandem zzso of 45 base pairs within zzso 48 and results in the addition of 15 zzso acids to the zzso domain of the alpha 1 chains of type II collagen derived from the abnormal zzso Although the repeating zzso motif that characterizes the zzso domain is zzso type II collagen derived from cartilage of the affected individual contains a population with excessive zzso zzso consistent with a disruption in zzso zzso The zzso is not carried by either parent, indicating that the zzso in the affected individual is due to a new dominant zzso DNA sequence zzso in the area of the zzso suggests that the zzso may have arisen by unequal crossover between related zzso a proposed mechanism in the evolution and diversification of the collagen gene zzso
