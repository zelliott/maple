The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is predicted to contain 12 zzso zzso regions, divided into two partially duplicated parts of 6 TM zzso The three-dimensional zzso organization of the zzso protein has not yet been zzso However, the zzso crystal structure of the zzso coli MFS zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has recently been zzso On the basis of extensive prediction and fold recognition analyses (at the zzso zzso was proposed as the best structural template on which the arrangement of TM segments of the zzso zzso was fit, using the comparative structural modeling program zzso To initiate an evaluation of the appropriateness of the zzso model, we have performed two direct tests by targeting spin labels to putative TM segments 8 and zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso was then applied on zzso and spin labeled zzso The line shape from labels located at both positions is consistent with the structural environment predicted by the zzso model, thus supporting the zzso
