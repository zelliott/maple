zzso and zzso are zzso zzso containing several important plant zzso zzso These zzso are zzso similar, and recent molecular studies performed to unravel their zzso have resulted in the establishment of several new zzso within the newly erected zzso zzso An analysis of the structure of zzso zzso genes can contribute to a better understanding of the zzso relationships of these plant zzso and may shed some light on their evolution and on differences in sexual strategy and zzso We zzso the zzso zzso of zzso closely related zzso and zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso on the same zzso either on zzso or zzso The results confirm that the zzso genes provide the information to distinguish between the zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso and indicate the close zzso relationship between these two species that are part of the disease complex responsible for zzso blight on zzso Furthermore, our analysis of the zzso genes of the zzso species responsible for causing zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is more closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than to the zzso zzso zzso Finally, our results indicate that zzso in zzso zzso resulted from a single crossover between zzso and zzso sequences of zzso ancestors, whereas a single crossover event followed by an inversion of a fused zzso locus resulted in zzso in zzso zzso
