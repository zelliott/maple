zzso is a major neurotransmitter of both zzso and zzso Earlier studies have shown that zzso stimulates zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso but its mode of action is zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the first of its kind to be identified in a zzso zzso zzso belongs to the G zzso zzso zzso zzso and is zzso related to zzso zzso receptors from other zzso The full-length zzso zzso was zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells and shown to be activated by zzso whereas zzso and the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso had no significant zzso Among the classical zzso zzso and zzso tested, only zzso was able to interact with the zzso zzso suggesting that the pharmacological profile of zzso is substantially different from that of receptors in the zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso was verified by zzso and Western zzso zzso using a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso is strongly expressed in the nervous system of adult worms and zzso In the adults, the zzso was detected in the zzso nerve cords and cerebral zzso as well as the peripheral nerve fibers and zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso Outside the nervous system, zzso was detected along the length of the female zzso system, including the zzso zzso and the zzso A comparative expression analysis at the zzso level revealed that zzso is expressed at about the same level in zzso and adult zzso as determined by quantitative zzso zzso The results identify zzso as an important zzso zzso and provide the first molecular evidence for a zzso signaling system in zzso
