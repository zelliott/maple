zzso is a zzso hormone product of the obese zzso gene that functions in the regulation of zzso energy expenditure and reproduction in animals and zzso We have developed a technique using zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection zzso for the analysis of chicken zzso zzso base pairs, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA products from reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso were separated using a zzso coated zzso (27 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso at a field strength of 300 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89 zzso zzso acid, 2 zzso zzso pH zzso buffer with zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso samples zzso zzso were diluted zzso with zzso water and introduced into the zzso by zzso zzso zzso were completed in less than 6 zzso and the total time required per sample, including zzso zzso was 8 zzso We have applied zzso to determine the effects of insulin and zzso treatment on zzso gene expression relative to that of zzso in chicken liver and zzso zzso In addition, we have constructed a chicken zzso zzso competitor zzso zzso zzso and evaluated it for use as an internal standard in the development of a zzso zzso zzso Our findings represent the first reported application of zzso zzso to the analysis of zzso gene expression by zzso
