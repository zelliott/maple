A novel zzso was isolated and characterized from the zzso of the zzso marine snail zzso zzso The zzso was identified by screening zzso zzso of the crude zzso that produced a marked contraction and extension of the zzso and zzso fins in fish, and noticeable spontaneous zzso of isolated zzso zzso zzso The zzso named zzso had 30 zzso acids and the following zzso zzso At the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso selectively increased nerve terminal zzso so that a single nerve stimulation triggered trains of repetitive or spontaneous synaptic zzso and action zzso In contrast, zzso had no noticeable effect on muscle zzso even at zzso 100 zzso higher than those that affected motor nerve zzso as revealed by direct muscle zzso In addition, zzso increased miniature zzso potential zzso frequency in a zzso medium supplemented with zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso sodium channels with zzso zzso either prevented or suppressed the increase of zzso frequency induced by the zzso zzso also produced a zzso zzso of the zzso membrane in single zzso zzso giving rise, in some cases, to repetitive and/or spontaneous action potential zzso In addition, zzso increased the zzso volume of zzso zzso as determined using zzso laser scanning zzso This increase was reversed by external zzso solutions and was prevented by zzso of zzso with zzso It is suggested that zzso by specifically zzso zzso zzso sodium channels at the resting membrane potential, produced zzso entry into nerve terminals and zzso without directly affecting skeletal muscle zzso zzso belongs to a novel family of zzso that targets zzso zzso sodium zzso
