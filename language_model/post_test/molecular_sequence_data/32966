Wheat zzso zzso zzso is the major cause of zzso reactions that zzso Asian noodles and other wheat zzso It has been hypothesized that genes zzso wheat zzso may have evolved by gene zzso into a zzso zzso Here we characterized zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subspecies zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso wheat species to gain a better understanding of the structure and organization of zzso zzso DNA fragments were amplified from a highly zzso and zzso zzso region of the zzso As a result, we obtained highly zzso zzso Three distinct zzso obtained from the A zzso of zzso zzso provided evidence for gene zzso events zzso zzso Furthermore, the number of sequences obtained for bread and zzso wheat was higher than the expected number of zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed zzso and structural diversity, and detected five sequence zzso types, all with a common zzso zzso This was hypothesized to be zzso to that of zzso 2 of previously reported wheat zzso A zzso of the zzso family accounted for the major difference between the five intervening zzso and was unique to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural diversity, together with zzso zzso trees, provided molecular evidence to support the hypothesis of a zzso zzso family structure and zzso
