zzso zzso responses are thought to be crucial for control of zzso in human zzso virus zzso infection but ultimately fail to control zzso in most infected zzso Studies in acute infection have demonstrated strong zzso selection pressure and evolution of zzso zzso escape from recognition, but the ability of zzso zzso responses that persist in late-stage infection to recognize viruses present in zzso has not been zzso zzso we studied 24 subjects with advanced zzso disease zzso viral load zzso zzso zzso median zzso count zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined zzso zzso zzso responses to all expressed viral proteins using overlapping peptides by gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso virus was zzso to evaluate zzso sequences within zzso zzso and functional zzso of detected responses was zzso In these subjects, the median number of zzso regions targeted was 13 zzso 2 to zzso and the median cumulative magnitude of zzso zzso responses was zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso 185 to zzso On average six zzso one to 8) proteins were zzso For zzso of evaluated zzso zzso responses, the zzso viral sequence was predicted to be well recognized by these responses and the majority of analyzed optimal zzso were recognized with medium to high functional zzso by the contemporary zzso T zzso zzso of zzso by highly active zzso therapy led to a significant decline both in breadth zzso zzso zzso and magnitude zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso responses, providing further evidence that these responses had been driven by recognition of zzso zzso These results indicate that strong, broadly directed, and zzso zzso zzso zzso directed at zzso virus persist in late disease zzso and the absence of zzso within viral zzso indicates a lack of strong selection pressure zzso by these zzso These data imply functional impairment of zzso zzso responses in late-stage infection that may not be reflected by gamma zzso screening zzso
