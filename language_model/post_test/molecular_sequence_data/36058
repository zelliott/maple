The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso protein required for zzso late gene zzso This gene was defined originally by a class of zzso zzso which overcome the block to zzso late zzso imposed by a host zzso zzso in the gene zzso the alpha zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substitute a zzso for a zzso zzso at zzso acid 42 in the zzso zzso Using suppression of an zzso amber zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have studied the effect of zzso acid zzso at this position in zzso zzso of charged zzso at this site renders zzso protein zzso in zzso and zzso zzso While 11 different zzso acids are capable of replacing the zzso zzso to allow zzso growth to varying degrees in a zzso zzso coli strain, only three of these allow zzso growth in strains carrying the zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso or Ala in place of zzso gave burst sizes at least as high as zzso zzso in a zzso zzso a zzso substitution also allowed zzso to grow in either a zzso or zzso background, but markedly reduced the burst zzso These results are consistent with a direct interaction between zzso and the alpha zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso in positive control of zzso late transcription, and indicate that the block imposed by the zzso zzso is due to zzso zzso
