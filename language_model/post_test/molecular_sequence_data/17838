Eight zzso paired zzso zzso genes have been isolated so zzso The gene described here, zzso contains not only a paired box, but also an zzso and a zzso zzso As shown by Northern and in zzso analysis, zzso is expressed from day 8 to 17 zzso during zzso At early stages zzso transcripts are present in a subset of cells throughout the entire brain, but later in development expression is limited to the zzso In the developing neural tube zzso is restricted to the zzso zzso zone along the entire zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the formation of certain parts of the zzso zzso zzso expression can be followed during zzso from the zzso of the zzso to the skeletal muscle zzso
