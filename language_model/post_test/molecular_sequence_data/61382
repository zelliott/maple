We have cloned and zzso a zzso of the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso which is indispensable for zzso function in zzso The human zzso protein has a typical zzso leader zzso Northern zzso data and analysis of zzso in the data banks indicate that this human gene zzso is expressed in practically all zzso though at different zzso zzso zzso analysis has shown a strong conservation of the protein in a number of zzso organisms -- plants, zzso and zzso but no close zzso exist in bacteria with the exception of the purple zzso zzso zzso This gene is thus zzso present in all zzso zzso
