The protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso different components of the zzso zzso I zzso I) zzso machinery and exerts a positive effect on zzso gene zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso the zzso initiation factor zzso at zzso 170 and zzso zzso and this zzso triggers the release of zzso from Pol I after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso of Pol I zzso zzso transcription, leading to zzso of zzso structure and cell cycle zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso and zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso of zzso from Pol I is a prerequisite for proper zzso zzso In support of zzso of zzso switching from the initiation into the zzso phase, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of zzso with Pol I, allowing a new round of zzso zzso The results reveal a mechanism by which the functional interplay between zzso and zzso sustains multiple rounds of Pol I zzso
