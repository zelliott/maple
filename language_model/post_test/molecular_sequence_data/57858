In the course of studying proteins involved in long-term zzso in zzso we found that zzso and zzso a second zzso activated by zzso lead to the removal of a set of zzso cell zzso molecules zzso from the surface membrane of sensory zzso by means of zzso zzso Here we describe that, as part of this coordinated program for zzso zzso and zzso also induce in the sensory zzso an increase in the density of coated pits and coated zzso and an increase in the expression of the light chain of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso seems designed to zzso and zzso zzso and other surface membrane proteins in the sensory zzso and thus it appears to constitute one of the initial steps in the growth of new synaptic connections that accompanies long-term zzso
