zzso deafness is clinically and genetically zzso We recently mapped zzso a locus associated with zzso deafness, to zzso zzso In this study, zzso sequencing was performed with zzso DNA from affected individuals from three large zzso families in which markers linked to zzso segregate with profound zzso zzso of these data revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso as the underlying cause of deafness in the three zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso in an additional large family in which deafness zzso with zzso identified the zzso zzso zzso These zzso affect zzso zzso acid zzso that are zzso in zzso ranging from fruit fly to zzso Neither zzso was observed in databases of zzso zzso or in zzso zzso from ethnically matched control zzso zzso in the mouse inner ear was zzso predominantly to spiral zzso zzso indicating that zzso deafness might be an auditory zzso spectrum zzso Previously, six zzso zzso in zzso were reported to cause zzso (hearing loss was not zzso ranging in severity from zzso with otherwise normal development to zzso zzso resulting in childhood zzso Two of our four families in which deafness zzso with zzso zzso of zzso were available for neurological zzso zzso of zzso and deafness was not observed in these two zzso Although the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso is not presently zzso our findings, combined with published data, indicate that zzso zzso of zzso can cause either zzso or zzso zzso
