zzso c zzso is a respiratory zzso zzso the zzso reduction of molecular oxygen to zzso The crystal structure of the zzso c zzso from zzso zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution using multiple anomalous zzso zzso phasing and led to the discovery of a novel zzso zzso A zzso sequence alignment of this zzso very distant zzso with the other structurally known zzso zzso leads to the identification of sequence motifs and zzso that seem to be indispensable for the function of the zzso copper zzso zzso a new electron transfer zzso leading directly from zzso to zzso zzso features of the zzso include an extended oxygen input channel, which leads directly to the active site, the presence of only one oxygen atom zzso zzso or zzso as bridging zzso at the active site and the mainly zzso character of the interactions that stabilize the electron transfer complex between this zzso and its zzso zzso zzso New aspects of the zzso pumping mechanism could be zzso
