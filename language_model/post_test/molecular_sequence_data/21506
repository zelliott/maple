zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a premature aging syndrome caused by the expression and zzso of a zzso form of zzso A, zzso zzso zzso As a component of the cell's zzso zzso A plays an important role in the mechanical stabilization of the nuclear envelope and in other nuclear zzso It is largely unknown how the characteristic 50 zzso acid deletion affects the zzso of the mostly zzso zzso tail domain of zzso zzso Here we perform replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of the tail domain and determine an ensemble of zzso zzso Based on these structures we show that the zzso 24 zzso site on the precursor form of the zzso A tail domain zzso itself in such a way as to facilitate zzso during the maturation zzso We confirm our simulated structures by comparing the zzso properties of the ensemble structures to in zzso stability zzso Using this combination of experimental and zzso techniques, we compare the size, zzso of size, zzso stability of the zzso as well as the mechanisms of zzso zzso Our data shows that the zzso zzso A tail domain is more compact and displays less zzso than the mature zzso A tail zzso zzso these results suggest that the altered structure and stability of the tail domain can explain changed zzso and zzso interactions and may represent an zzso of the zzso Also, this study provides the first molecular zzso of the zzso A tail domain, which is confirmed by zzso tests in zzso
