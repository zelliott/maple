Mass correlated acceleration zzso has now been integrated into a 4 in zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso to achieve high resolving power across a broader mass range, without sacrificing detection of higher mass zzso The goal was to combine zzso with a zzso zzso instrument such as those that might be used for zzso zzso Unlike other zzso extraction methods, zzso is not mass dependent and mass zzso can be achieved with a single tuning of instrument zzso Additionally, the zzso recording advantage is better realized because zzso of all masses can be brought into focus zzso The zzso zzso zzso source compensates zzso for the mass dependence by incorporating an extraction pulse region followed by an acceleration region that contains a zzso zzso correlated with zzso The technique was validated with applications in zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso studies for the instrument include zzso range and limits of zzso
