zzso expression of the zzso gene suppressed the zzso of rat zzso tumor cells in nude mice, as reported zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis indicated that zzso cells established from a tumor of the peripheral nervous system contain an activated zzso gene with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of a protein of 60 zzso zzso in zzso cells was specifically inhibited by expression of the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso suppresses the transforming activity of rat neural cells transformed by expression of the activated zzso zzso and plays an important role in regulating expression of a cellular gene contributing to cell zzso such as the gene that encodes the zzso zzso
