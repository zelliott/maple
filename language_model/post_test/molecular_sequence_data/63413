zzso infection is initiated by fusion of the virus with the target cell through binding of the viral zzso protein with the zzso cell surface zzso protein and the zzso or zzso zzso There is currently considerable interest in developing novel zzso that can zzso the zzso of these zzso and, zzso ultimately block zzso zzso This article describes a detailed comparison of the performance of zzso and zzso virtual screening approaches to find zzso and zzso zzso that could potentially serve as zzso entry zzso Because no crystal structures for these proteins are available, zzso models of zzso and zzso have been built, using bovine zzso as the zzso For zzso virtual zzso several zzso and zzso molecular comparison approaches have been zzso using zzso zzso as query zzso These methods were compared by virtually screening a library assembled by us, consisting of zzso known zzso and zzso zzso and some zzso similar presumed inactive zzso For each zzso the library was zzso using known zzso and the enrichment factors and diversity of the resulting virtual hit lists were zzso Overall, zzso zzso searches yielded higher zzso than zzso zzso especially for zzso The results obtained for zzso suggest the possibility that different active scaffolds bind in different ways within the zzso zzso
