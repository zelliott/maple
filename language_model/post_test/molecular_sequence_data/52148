zzso evidence has previously suggested that a zinc zzso is involved in the invasive mechanism of the fish pathogen zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso gene was cloned and zzso The sequence encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains a putative signal sequence followed by a large leader sequence and the mature protein zzso zzso Since the zzso protein has a molecular mass of 36 zzso instead of the predicted zzso zzso the mature protein is most likely processed a third zzso Comparative analyses of the protein sequence showed high zzso to other bacterial zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were exceptions in that the zzso extended throughout the entire putative zzso A zzso zzso zzso was made via the integration of foreign DNA into the zzso zzso This zzso did not zzso the zzso as determined by sodium zzso zzso zzso protein analysis and by growth on gelatin zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revived the zzso of the zzso and its activity on gelatin zzso Interestingly, when zzso proteins were analyzed by zzso zzso two different zzso (75 and 30 zzso were detected in the zzso strain but not in the zzso strain or the zzso zzso Moreover, fish infection studies were done, and implications for the role of the zzso in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso are zzso
