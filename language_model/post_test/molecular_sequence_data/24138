The zzso gene transcript is alternatively processed to produce functionally different zzso zzso Previously, we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required for zzso inclusion in zzso zzso In the present study, we found that this sequence is composed of three independent zzso two smaller zzso sequences zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified zzso binding of the zzso regulator zzso A zzso zzso decrease in zzso confirmed the significance of this zzso There was a 6- to zzso decrease in zzso inclusion on zzso of zzso In zzso zzso cells, which normally skip this zzso zzso was also demonstrated to play a role in zzso inclusion after the removal of zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso plays a major role in maintaining normal zzso zzso zzso which is subject to dominant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
