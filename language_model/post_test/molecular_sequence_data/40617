During infection of zzso coli, zzso T4 zzso the host zzso machinery, zzso it to the expression of early, middle, and late zzso zzso Middle zzso whose expression begins about 1 zzso zzso are transcribed both from the extension of early zzso into middle genes and by the zzso of T4 middle zzso zzso zzso requires the T4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are known to interact with zzso the specificity zzso of zzso zzso T4 zzso amber zzso or zzso zzso grows poorly in zzso zzso zzso However, previous work has found that T4 zzso not grow in the zzso coli zzso strain zzso We show here that the zzso zzso in zzso contains two zzso within its zzso zzso zzso and zzso We find that the zzso zzso is responsible for restricting the growth of either T4 zzso zzso and for zzso zzso from zzso middle promoters in zzso With one exception, zzso from tested T4 early promoters is either unaffected or, in some cases, even increases, and there is no significant growth zzso for the zzso zzso strain in the absence of T4 zzso In reported structures of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is located immediately adjacent to a zzso pocket, called the switch 3 zzso This loop is thought to aid in the separation of the zzso from the zzso hybrid as zzso enters the zzso exit zzso Our results suggest that the presence of zzso and zzso may impair the function of this loop or that this portion of the zzso zzso may influence interactions among zzso zzso and zzso zzso
