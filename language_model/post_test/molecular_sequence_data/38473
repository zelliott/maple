Evolution of the zzso system has yielded three clans of zzso region genes that are represented in almost every known higher species with an zzso immune zzso These clans are defined by sequence zzso primarily in highly zzso framework zzso zzso which serve a scaffolding function maintaining the zzso of zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso composite exposed surface, which has been implicated in interactions with B cell zzso To directly investigate the expression of zzso zzso sets, we exploited the evolutionary distance of the chicken immune system and the selection power of zzso display, to derive zzso diagnostic for clan III zzso Using a specially tailored zzso and selection strategy, we created zzso avian single chain zzso zzso specific for the clan III products, including those from the human zzso family, and the analogous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso families, and binding was competitive with natural B cell zzso The zzso zzso was demonstrated to recognize a zzso surface expressed in diverse zzso and also the zzso and chicken, immune zzso In zzso studies with zzso we found that treatment of zzso zzso transgenic mice with a model B cell zzso induced a clan zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrate the utility of a novel zzso zzso zzso to study the composition of the B cell compartment and also the consequences of B cell zzso zzso
