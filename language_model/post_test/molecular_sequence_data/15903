A fraction of the zzso zzso genes in some insects are interrupted at specific sites by zzso elements zzso and zzso (also called Type I and zzso These elements contain long zzso frames with zzso to reverse zzso We have identified in the zzso zzso zzso copies of these elements which have inserted into sites outside the zzso DNA zzso zzso The 3' ends of all zzso elements are identical to the elements within the zzso zzso however their zzso ends are often zzso Each zzso copy has inserted into sequences that exhibit similarity to their target sites in the zzso zzso We also demonstrate by zzso zzso analysis of different strains of zzso zzso that insertions of zzso and zzso outside the zzso units have been zzso while considerable turnover of elements has occurred within the zzso zzso One race of zzso zzso has lost all copies of zzso from its zzso units, while retaining normal levels of zzso The level of both zzso and zzso have significantly increased in a tissue culture zzso These findings add considerable support to the model that zzso and zzso are zzso elements that zzso sequence specific zzso in their integration into the zzso
