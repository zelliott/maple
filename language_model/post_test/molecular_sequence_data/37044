The zzso protein zzso is a central element of the zzso zzso complex, which is involved in the zzso of many forms of muscular zzso zzso is a zzso for multiple zzso zzso zzso molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso and plays a role in linking the zzso to the zzso zzso however, how these interactions are regulated and their basic cellular functions are poorly zzso Using mosaic analysis and zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is required zzso for cellular polarity in two different cell types, the zzso cells zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso function in zzso and disc zzso results in expansion of zzso markers to the zzso side of cells and zzso results in a reduced zzso zzso of these same zzso In zzso zzso clones early zzso polarity markers fail to be localized to the zzso and zzso cortical zzso organization is zzso zzso is also required zzso to organize the zzso polarity of zzso zzso in zzso cells, possibly by organizing the zzso zzso These data suggest that the primary function of zzso in zzso is to organize cellular zzso and this study sets the stage for analyzing the zzso complex by using the power of zzso molecular zzso
