The growth of zzso zzso zzso on zzso compounds has been zzso but little is known about how this zzso grows on zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso procedure was performed to identify genes involved in the growth of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso Of the zzso zzso colonies screened, 71 zzso were found that grew on methanol but either grew slowly or were unable to grow on one or both of the zzso zzso For each of these zzso the zzso region adjacent to the zzso site was zzso and 55 different genes were identified and assigned putative zzso These genes fell into a number of predicted categories, including central carbon zzso zzso zzso regulation, transport and zzso zzso zzso This study focused on genes predicted to zzso zzso of central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso In each case, the zzso showed normal growth on methanol and impaired growth on zzso and zzso consistent with a role specific to zzso zzso For the first two cases, no zzso activity of the corresponding zzso was found in the zzso zzso the zzso The results of this study were used to reconstruct zzso metabolism of zzso zzso zzso during growth on zzso zzso and zzso
