The recent rise in systemic zzso infections has created a need for the development of new zzso zzso As part of an effort to provide zzso effective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso we have zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by zzso affinity and zzso exchange zzso was zzso identical to human zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were grown as the zzso complex and as a zzso complex containing a zzso zzso Both complexes zzso with two molecules in the zzso unit in space group zzso The final structures had zzso of zzso at zzso resolution and zzso at zzso resolution, zzso The zzso fold was similar to that of bacterial and zzso zzso and the binding of a zzso zzso inhibitor and the interactions of zzso with protein were typical of zzso binding to other zzso However, the zzso of the active site zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly larger than that of the human zzso providing a basis for the design of potentially selective zzso
