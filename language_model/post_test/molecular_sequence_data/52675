According to zzso network hypothesis, the binding site of an zzso zzso also represents the internal image of an zzso present on a foreign, or even a self zzso In recent years, zzso mimicry has been defined at the molecular level for some zzso However, until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human zzso zzso and a self zzso To address this question, we used human zzso as the self structure and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We describe the isolation of two zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso from a zzso human zzso zzso display zzso Interestingly, these two zzso zzso mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described zzso zzso zzso isolated by panning on zzso but they cover a much larger zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso of rabbits with the two zzso zzso induced zzso zzso with the same characteristics as zzso Thus, our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate zzso zzso derived from the human zzso without the need for zzso and confirm zzso hypothesis that both foreign zzso and self structures can be zzso by our own zzso
