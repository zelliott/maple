In a previous study, we have shown that the zzso hormone, zzso zzso reduces insect food consumption resulting in fat body zzso during the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and assumed that the zzso factor zzso is involved in this zzso To verify this hypothesis, we cloned zzso from the zzso zzso zzso During zzso and zzso zzso is highly expressed and predominantly zzso in the zzso of fat body zzso zzso induced zzso zzso expression and zzso nuclear zzso resulting in an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso prior to the 4th zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso insect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an acid zzso acid zzso in the fat zzso zzso of the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso and acid zzso in both the fat body and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso elements zzso are present in the promoter regions of zzso and acid zzso and zzso of the zzso attenuated their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso binds directly to those zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso doubled zzso concentration in the zzso increased total zzso activity, and slightly but significantly reduced zzso content in the fat zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso increases the zzso activity of zzso which, in turn, zzso zzso and acid zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso fat body during zzso and zzso
