The effects of dietary zzso zzso on growth and liver zzso were investigated in the yellow perch zzso zzso After a zzso treatment, zzso significantly zzso an increase in length and weight of juvenile male and female perch relative to control zzso The increase was significantly greater in females compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed from equal quantities of zzso from 6 male and 6 female zzso of zzso and control perch, and zzso and zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were zzso zzso To characterize zzso zzso zzso zzso between libraries were calculated within zzso sequences that were assembled from the combined zzso of both zzso zzso were also determined in zzso transcript groupings produced by aligning all of the zzso from both libraries at the zzso zzso From these zzso there were 28 zzso transcripts that were regulated by zzso between libraries and for which there were at least 5 zzso of the same transcript between zzso zzso of a subset zzso of these transcripts was confirmed by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso that were zzso by zzso included zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso and zzso zzso While not part of the transcript frequency analysis, zzso showed significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso growth factor I zzso in zzso zzso zzso transcripts represented a variety of functional categories including components of the respiratory chain, zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso acid and nitrogen zzso binding zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso In perch it appears that zzso zzso drastically shifts liver metabolism toward the production of zzso and zzso binding zzso and that the zzso action may involve an increase in zzso zzso zzso
