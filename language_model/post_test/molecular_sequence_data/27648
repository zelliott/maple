zzso B is an zzso zzso bleeding disorder resulting from a zzso of the zzso factor IX zzso protein activity, a vitamin zzso zzso zzso active in both the intrinsic and zzso zzso zzso DNA analyses of the factor IX gene in two unrelated patients with severe zzso B, with a IX zzso activity less than zzso and zzso zzso zzso detected the loss of the second zzso site in zzso h zzso in both zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso base pairs of zzso h zzso with cloning and zzso sequencing of cloned DNA from one zzso revealed a single zzso transition in zzso 338 that changes an zzso zzso zzso zzso to a nonsense zzso zzso zzso zzso probe zzso with a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso confirmed the same zzso in amplified zzso DNA of the second zzso zzso The zzso transition represents another example of zzso at a zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis of the zzso gene in both individuals revealed each to be on a separate zzso zzso therefore, predicting each to be a separate zzso zzso
