In this paper we describe the assembly and restriction map of a zzso zzso zzso spanning the candidate region for familial Mediterranean fever zzso a zzso inherited disorder of inflammation localized to zzso Using a combination of zzso walking and screening for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have generated a zzso of zzso clones spanning approximately zzso zzso that contains the zzso critical zzso The map consists of 179 zzso 15 zzso 10 zzso 3 zzso and 17 zzso zzso anchored by 27 zzso zzso Eight additional zzso have been developed from the approximately 700 zzso immediately zzso to this zzso zzso Five of the 35 zzso are zzso that have not been previously zzso zzso and zzso mapping of the overlapping zzso zzso of restriction fragments from zzso to one another, and zzso analyses have been used to validate the assembly of the zzso Our zzso totally zzso the zzso zzso recently reported, by founder zzso analysis, to contain the zzso zzso Thus, our high-resolution clone map provides an ideal resource for zzso mapping toward the eventual identification of this disease zzso
