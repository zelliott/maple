Two zzso clones for the barley zzso I zzso which zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso on zzso gels have been isolated using zzso and an zzso zzso The determined zzso zzso acid sequence for the mature zzso confirms the identification of the zzso The zzso zzso sequence of one of the clones contains one large open reading frame coding for a zzso Da precursor zzso The molecular mass of the mature zzso is 10 193 zzso The zzso plot of the zzso shows one zzso region with a predicted zzso secondary zzso The gene for the zzso zzso zzso has been designated zzso
