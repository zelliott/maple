A highly zzso zzso region with unknown function was recognized in the large zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence occurs in most zzso zzso but only two of these zzso are present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disclosed that the zzso activity was significantly affected only by the replacement of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the hydrogen bond network in the large zzso indicated that the second zzso of this motif might be a component of a zzso transfer zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acids of the presumed transfer route impaired the activity of the zzso zzso Western zzso was applied to demonstrate that the cellular level of the zzso zzso was similar to that of the wild zzso Mostly based on theoretical zzso few zzso transfer pathways have already been suggested for zzso zzso Our results propose an alternative route for zzso transfer between the zzso active center and the surface of the zzso A novel feature of this model is that this zzso zzso is located on the opposite side of the large zzso relative to the position of the small zzso This is the first study presenting a systematic analysis of an in zzso predicted zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso
