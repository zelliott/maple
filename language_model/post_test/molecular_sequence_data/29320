zzso zzso comprise one of the largest zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Many species are described based on differences in male breeding zzso Few zzso zzso have been proposed for the zzso and their relatives, making it difficult to delineate zzso zzso The zzso relationships of the 20 zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso and 11 members of its proposed sister zzso zzso were investigated with partial zzso DNA sequences including zzso zzso encompassing the entire zzso control region, the zzso zzso and part of the zzso zzso zzso Two hypotheses on the relationship and zzso of the two zzso were zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses supported zzso of the zzso zzso and resolved some zzso zzso The banded zzso zzso zzso and its sister zzso zzso zzso were not closely related to the zzso zzso and appear to be zzso from the other members of the zzso zzso fitting their former distinction as the recognized zzso zzso The sister group to zzso appears to be a restricted species zzso within the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso species zzso The placement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is problematic, and it may represent a zzso member of zzso or of the restricted zzso zzso Despite recent estimates of divergence times between nominal zzso zzso each species exhibits its own unique set of zzso zzso providing no direct evidence for current genetic exchange between zzso The nominal zzso of zzso zzso thus appear to be evolving independently from each other and therefore constitute valid species under the zzso Species zzso
