Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso as zzso proteins in zzso coli and zzso by affinity and gel zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins had molecular masses of 31 zzso and 120 zzso (a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso not only zzso zzso but also zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso as well as zzso When both zzso were included in the same zzso reaction system with zzso zzso sequential reactions occurred, suggesting that zzso and zzso play an important role in the zzso degradation of zzso When the zzso gene was disrupted in zzso zzso by zzso zzso the zzso strain lost zzso zzso When the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso activity was zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso carries a single zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso affected the degradation rate of zzso
