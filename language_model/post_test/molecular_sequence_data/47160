zzso zzso play a key role in signal zzso pathways in both zzso and zzso zzso Using in zzso expression technology, we have identified several promoters in zzso zzso which are zzso activated during infection of zzso zzso One of these promoters directs the zzso of a gene zzso a putative protein zzso similar to the zzso found in zzso zzso The full characterization of this zzso termed zzso is presented in this zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso domain showing all of the zzso zzso of protein zzso with the zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain is linked to the rest of the protein by a short zzso zzso The zzso showed anomalous migration behavior when analyzed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso which could be attributed to zzso zzso The full-length zzso was expressed as an zzso fusion protein and was shown to zzso several artificial protein zzso Both zzso and zzso of added zzso were strongly reduced by a zzso substitution in the zzso domain of zzso Although zzso appears to be zzso zzso by zzso the levels of zzso have minimal effect on its overall zzso zzso Our results, therefore, indicate the operation of a novel protein zzso mechanism during zzso of signals in zzso zzso and this zzso may be important in regulating the expression of zzso factors by this pathogen during certain zzso of zzso
