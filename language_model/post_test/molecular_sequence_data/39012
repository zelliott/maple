The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by a zzso procedure from cells grown zzso with zzso The molecular mass of native zzso zzso was 190 zzso as determined by native zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso to comprise two zzso with molecular masses of 47 zzso and 50 zzso suggesting an zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso analysis using zzso zzso identified the zzso protein as the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso protein as zzso Based on the molecular masses deduced from the zzso sequence for mature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The iron content was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso These data are consistent with the two zzso zzso zzso characteristic for zzso zzso deduced from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed two masses for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The difference in molecular mass was attributed to the zzso zzso of zzso For zzso a mass of zzso Da was zzso this accounted for the zzso and two zzso bound zzso zzso of the zzso activity of zzso zzso required additional zzso these zzso from Q zzso at zzso zzso and zzso M zzso The zzso of zzso zzso for zzso was zzso zzso and for zzso c 19 zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso and zzso The structural and zzso properties make zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso distinct from zzso zzso of other zzso or zzso zzso
