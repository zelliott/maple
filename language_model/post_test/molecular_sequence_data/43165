A clone map consisting of zzso zzso and zzso has been constructed covering low copy repeat regions of human zzso zzso A combination of clone restriction digest analysis, zzso landmark content analysis, zzso zzso and sequencing of zzso products derived from clones was required to resolve the map in this zzso Seven zzso zzso were placed in zzso five containing zzso zzso zzso sequences described zzso In one case, a single zzso at the resolution of the zzso map was shown to contain at least three zzso sequences after higher resolution zzso The sequence information was used to design a rapid zzso digest technique that zzso the zzso zzso placed in the zzso zzso This approach has allowed us to resolve the previous zzso and mapping information relating to zzso and link it to the physical map of zzso
