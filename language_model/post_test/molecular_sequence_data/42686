We have shown by zzso analyses that the zzso zzso zzso is present on rat zzso zzso zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso amplification of zzso copied from the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was absent and its zzso was not zzso even at the level of sensitivity afforded by zzso zzso The zzso receptors present on zzso zzso cells were functional as measured by zzso enhancement of zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso could mimic the action of zzso to stimulate bone zzso in zzso mouse zzso in organ zzso zzso induced a large increase in zzso while zzso and zzso induced a small but significant zzso In the presence of a zzso inhibitor and an zzso zzso consistently zzso bone zzso In order to determine whether functional zzso receptors were unique to zzso zzso cells, human zzso zzso cells were also examined for enhancement of zzso production by zzso and essentially the same results were zzso Thus, zzso zzso efficiently activate zzso on two zzso cells and can stimulate bone zzso in intact mouse zzso
