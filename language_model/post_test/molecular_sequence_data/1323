The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the initial zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli resulted in active, soluble zzso and in inclusion bodies from which active zzso could be zzso as long as zzso zzso were present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso possessed indistinguishable zzso zzso stability studies showed that the apparent unfolding free energy in water is zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso at pH zzso The analysis of the zzso structures showed a zzso assembly with a central hollow core probably consisting of 24 zzso in a 432 zzso The zzso form zzso as the building blocks of the zzso Iron was found in the zzso zzso at a zzso of one iron zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in a single zzso signal at zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso The signal disappeared upon reduction with zzso or incubation with zzso at elevated zzso Thus both zzso and chemical analysis indicate the presence of a zzso iron zzso which has a reduction potential of zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso database inspection identified four zzso protein zzso but no other significant zzso The zzso data and the sequence comparison led to the proposal that the zzso zzso zzso typifies a new type of zzso iron zzso containing a zzso iron zzso zzso by zzso and/or zzso zzso
