Human liver zzso B4 zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso and degradation of zzso a potent zzso of zzso The regulatory mechanism for the zzso of zzso has not yet been zzso Here, we report that zzso is zzso expressed in a human zzso cell line, zzso and is not induced by zzso We isolated the gene zzso zzso and determined its zzso organization and the functional activity of its zzso The zzso gene contains at least 13 zzso with its open reading frame being zzso from zzso II to zzso zzso zzso I includes 49 zzso of a zzso untranslated zzso The structure of this gene is very similar to that of the zzso gene earlier reported by zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence downstream from zzso of the zzso gene has zzso similarity to the corresponding region of the zzso zzso However, common putative regulating elements in the two human zzso genes were not detected except for the zzso zzso The elements recognized by nuclear receptors were not observed within its zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regions containing putative regulating elements recognized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso in the zzso zzso The region from zzso to zzso was necessary for transcription, but the zzso sequence was zzso Our results indicate that the human two zzso genes evolved by zzso and zzso of the zzso regulation region and the site of zzso zzso
