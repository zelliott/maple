zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major cause of zzso adrenal zzso a common genetic disease due to steroid zzso The main cause for the zzso of the zzso zzso gene is conversion of its zzso sequence to the neighboring zzso but zzso zzso zzso In this report the zzso activities of the zzso and zzso genes have been zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso derived from the zzso gene was about zzso lower in strength than that of the zzso zzso although both sequences responded to zzso normally in two zzso cell zzso The normal response to zzso could probably be attributed to equal zzso of both genes by a zzso factor zzso The lower zzso activity of the zzso gene was attributed to sequence changes within 167 base pairs of the zzso region, which differs from the zzso gene by only four zzso at positions around zzso These four zzso changes render the zzso sequence to bind proteins less tightly than the zzso region of the zzso zzso which binds proteins such as zzso factor zzso in zzso mobility shift zzso The reduced zzso due to zzso changes at the regulatory region of the zzso zzso in combination with other zzso in the coding region, could play important roles in zzso zzso
