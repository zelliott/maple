The crystal structure of zzso a potential novel zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso Despite all zzso being zzso zzso an accurate structural model with an R value of zzso has been obtained at atomic zzso With six molecules in the zzso unit and no atom heavier than zzso the structure zzso to a protein of 120 zzso acids and is the largest approximately zzso unknown structure solved by direct zzso In the zzso the zzso assumes a compact fold different from that found by zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso molecules reveals regions of variable zzso The region highly zzso to the related zzso zzso is very rigid and possibly defines an essential building block of this class of new zzso zzso
