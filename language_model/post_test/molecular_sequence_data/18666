The highly diversified repertoire of zzso receptors in the zzso immune system is generated via proteins zzso by the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso by a process known as zzso diversity, and joining zzso gene zzso Based on the study of zzso zzso zzso many hypotheses have been proposed regarding the origin and evolution of zzso This issue remains zzso leaving a significant gap in our understanding of the evolution of zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso contains an ancient zzso DNA zzso zzso that encodes a zzso protein that is much shorter than zzso zzso and harbors a region zzso to the central domain of core zzso zzso zzso also contains an unexpected zzso type II zzso active site zzso zzso and is capable of degrading both DNA and zzso Moreover, zzso shares important functional properties with the central domain of zzso including interaction with zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso into a zzso protein yielded an zzso capable of recognizing zzso signal sequences and performing zzso zzso in the presence of mouse zzso Moreover, this zzso zzso protein could mediate the assembly of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso encodes a protein that is functionally equivalent to the central domain of zzso and is well prepared for further evolution to mediate zzso zzso Thus, our findings provide unique insights into the evolutionary origin of zzso
