To evaluate the possibility of generating novel proteins binding to highly zzso viral zzso zzso zzso were selected by zzso display technology to the zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso protein library based on the zzso zzso zzso A zzso The zzso zzso from the zzso selection was produced in zzso coli and characterized by zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso molecules were shown to bind selectively to the zzso target zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso equilibrium zzso zzso were determined to be zzso 100 zzso for the zzso zzso and 10 zzso for the zzso zzso confirming the stronger zzso binding of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were further introduced into the zzso zzso type 5) zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were shown to bind selectively to zzso in a zzso analysis and to zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso Neither the zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso showed any virus zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso bound to a zzso site on zzso To investigate the binding site for the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of differentiation 4) and a panel of zzso zzso zzso known to bind to zzso were allowed to compete with the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were found to compete with zzso for overlapping binding zzso Although zzso effects were not achieved in this initial investigation, the successful selection of a zzso zzso zzso indicates that future zzso strategies might evolve to complement zzso efforts for zzso zzso Strategies for directed selection of zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso and the potential of using zzso for zzso efforts are zzso
