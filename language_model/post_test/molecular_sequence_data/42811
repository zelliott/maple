Several lines of evidence zzso protein zzso C zzso in the development of zzso cell and zzso cell zzso tumors which originate from zzso zzso To examine zzso in a model relevant to human skin, we exposed normal human zzso zzso zzso in zzso media to a variety of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity increased up to zzso within the 1st hour of exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso and gradually returned to control values within 72 zzso zzso zzso activity was enhanced by zzso of cultures with protein and zzso synthesis zzso zzso growth arrest and differentiation was antagonized by zzso zzso by zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso Our overall conclusion is that zzso of zzso in cultured human zzso is required for zzso These results are crucial to the analysis of compounds suspected of promoting or zzso zzso zzso
