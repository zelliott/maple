zzso stimulation of zzso zzso results in a dramatic increase in zzso zzso that zzso by 15 zzso and is then rapidly zzso to zzso levels within 60 zzso Using a nuclear zzso zzso to follow directly the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the serum response element zzso is the site of regulation of both the induction and repression zzso This is indicated by the ability of the zzso to mediate zzso zzso of induced zzso when fused to a zzso gene and in the absence of a recognizable zzso zzso zzso of the inner core and the outer zzso arms of the zzso have been determined by zzso The zzso inner core binds the serum response factor zzso and is, itself, sufficient to mediate both the induction and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and any other factors that regulate the transient zzso of zzso zzso require no more than these 14 zzso to zzso The zzso outer arms of the zzso stabilize the binding of zzso and thereby enhance the zzso response to zzso zzso by the zzso gene product is not affected by the direct interaction of zzso complexes with the zzso promoter and is likely to be zzso by either a novel function of the zzso protein or by an effect of zzso on the expression of another zzso
