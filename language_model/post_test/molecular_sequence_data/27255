zzso X mental zzso is caused by zzso of a single gene zzso zzso an zzso protein that harbors three zzso zzso zzso two zzso and one zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are similar to zzso in their overall structure, including the presence of putative zzso zzso but to what extent they provide functional zzso with zzso is zzso Although zzso has been characterized as a zzso regulator of translation, less is known about the functions of zzso and zzso For example, zzso binds zzso zzso and kissing complex zzso zzso zzso via the zzso box and zzso domain, respectively, although the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind zzso zzso with the same affinity as the zzso zzso domain although other zzso zzso do zzso zzso zzso recognition by this family is highly zzso as the zzso domain of the single zzso zzso zzso also binds zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso and zzso from zzso as it does for zzso and this displacement was zzso This suggests that all three family members recognize the same binding site on zzso zzso their zzso association, and that they may be functionally redundant with regard to this aspect of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is unique in its ability to recognize zzso suggesting the zzso zzso domain may play a zzso role in the zzso of the zzso
