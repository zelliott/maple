zzso zzso has been proposed to have played a major role in generating the extensive zzso that zzso the genes of the major zzso complex zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso represents a unique segment of DNA encompassing at least four hotspots for zzso zzso One of these hotspots lies within the second zzso of the class II zzso gene and has been defined at the zzso level for a number of simple zzso zzso In this report we studied two crosses in which one or both parents in themselves were zzso zzso and three zzso were present within the hotspots of each pair of the parental zzso zzso analysis indicated that the break points in these secondary zzso like those in the primary zzso were also discrete and clustered within the zzso second zzso Thus, in one instance two and in the other instance three zzso were present within the hotspots of these zzso These observations strongly suggest that zzso zzso could be an important mechanism contributing to zzso zzso
