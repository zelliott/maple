zzso binding proteins of the zzso family play a central role in many zzso and zzso processes and abnormal expression was observed in various tumors and human zzso We have identified a unique new member of this gene family: zzso which is the zzso protein zzso distributed in human and which is highly zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was found in many tumors zzso a central cellular function related to zzso zzso The gene was composed of four zzso two of which alternatively initiated zzso Three different transcripts suggested a complex regulation of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso repeats were identified in the transcribed region which might be associated with diseases of the nervous zzso All human transcripts zzso the same, typically small zzso protein of 103 zzso acids containing the zzso motif of two distinct zzso zzso was mapped within the zzso gene cluster on human zzso zzso a region that is frequently rearranged in zzso
