zzso studies require species level analyses for the accurate assessment of community zzso However, while specialized zzso knowledge is only rarely available for routine zzso DNA zzso and DNA zzso could provide the zzso basis for ecological zzso In this study, we assessed the community structure of zzso zzso zzso cryptic zzso larvae in the zzso zzso comparing zzso type zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso While zzso type zzso performed poorly, zzso and zzso methods yielded comparable zzso zzso correspondence analysis and zzso analyses indicated that the zzso are not randomly but competitively zzso However, DNA zzso identified an additional species that could not be resolved by the traditional zzso We argue that zzso identification methods such as DNA zzso can be a valuable tool to increase zzso objectivity and zzso of the zzso assessment in zzso and community ecology zzso
