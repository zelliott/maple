zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an X zzso disorder of zzso zzso characterized by zzso with zzso acid overproduction and, in some families, zzso zzso Two highly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso each zzso by a distinct X zzso zzso have been identified, and zzso and 2 zzso have been zzso The entire zzso pair translated regions of zzso and 2 zzso derived from cultured zzso and zzso from two patients in whom zzso zzso feedback resistance of zzso is associated with zzso zzso and zzso defects were examined by direct sequencing after zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso from the patients and normal individuals were zzso In contrast, zzso zzso from the patients differ from normal zzso zzso each by a single base zzso zzso zzso from patient zzso zzso showed an A to G transition at zzso zzso corresponding to an zzso to zzso change at zzso acid zzso 113 of mature zzso A G to C zzso at zzso zzso indicating an zzso acid to zzso change at zzso acid zzso was found for zzso zzso from patient zzso zzso Point zzso at the sites identified in the zzso zzso of the two patients were confirmed by the results of zzso mapping zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were introduced into zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso zzso feedback resistance zzso characteristic of zzso from patients' zzso
