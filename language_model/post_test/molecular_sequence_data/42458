It was previously reported zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso chains are essential for zzso of soybean zzso from zzso zzso To obtain more detailed information on the role of the zzso zzso chains in the folding and assembly of soybean zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso of soybean zzso from zzso zzso were examined by comparison with the zzso features of the zzso with varying zzso of zzso zzso The combined use of zzso and zzso by gel zzso revealed that both the folding and assembly of zzso zzso zzso were completely prevented in the presence of 300 zzso zzso whereas the same concentration of zzso only zzso with the zzso zzso exhibiting no significant effect on the zzso zzso These results, considered together with those in the previous report, indicate that the sugar branch Man alpha zzso zzso linked to the 3 position of the zzso zzso of the zzso chains functions in the folding of the zzso zzso and that other branches participate in the zzso zzso
