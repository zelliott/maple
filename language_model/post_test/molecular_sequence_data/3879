The zzso content of plant zzso genes is a useful marker in molecular zzso and zzso We have tested representatives of a wide range of zzso plant families for the presence of an zzso zzso zzso 1) in one of the most conservative zzso zzso the zzso zzso Almost all species analyzed were found to harbor a group II zzso at a zzso zzso zzso The only exceptions were members of a single zzso family, the zzso representatives of all zzso in this family were found to lack zzso zzso 1, but instead harbor an zzso in the 3' portion of the zzso coding region zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso 1 in families of zzso plants that are closely related to the zzso suggests that loss of the zzso is specific to this family and may have accompanied the evolutionary appearance of the zzso Interestingly, sequences that are highly zzso to zzso zzso 2 are found in a nuclear zzso in a lineage of zzso plants, suggesting that the originally zzso group II zzso sequence was transferred to the nuclear zzso and zzso there to build a zzso zzso
