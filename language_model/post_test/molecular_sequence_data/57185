We have recently shown that a zzso protein zzso which zzso the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso II, is a zzso zzso We describe here the zzso of these two components to apparent zzso from human zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso component A has a zzso native molecular mass, consists of a single large zzso and contains the zzso active zzso zzso component B, which is identical to the zzso zzso has a zzso native molecular mass, and consists of apparently zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso B stimulates the activity of component A, and under some conditions, zzso DNA dependence on the zzso The zzso zzso converts the zzso to the multiply zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs zzso and this zzso is an inherent property of component zzso The in zzso zzso zzso form contains approximately zzso zzso and zzso but no zzso zzso
