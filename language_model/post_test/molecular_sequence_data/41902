zzso A comparison of the effects of various zzso peptides on the heart rates of zzso right zzso was made, as taken from spontaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rats at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso slightly decreased the spontaneously beating rate of all rat strains and ages, at zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso increased the spontaneous beating rate of zzso zzso but not that of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were somewhat more sensitive than zzso zzso to zzso zzso positive zzso but the differences were not statistically zzso zzso In the presence of zzso delta or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso was enhanced at all ages zzso By contrast, zzso zzso was not significantly altered by the zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso Based on the above results, all the three major zzso zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso appear to be present in rat zzso but the function of these receptors appears to be greater in zzso than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results suggest a possible involvement of altered zzso responsiveness in zzso during hypertension development in zzso but the nature of this involvement appears to be complex and is not readily understandable on the basis of the present zzso
