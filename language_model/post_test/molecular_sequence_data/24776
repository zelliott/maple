A zzso DNA zzso zzso crane zzso DNA on W zzso was cloned from female zzso cranes zzso zzso From the zzso sequence of zzso a set of zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was identified which amplify a zzso zzso zzso zzso from all existing crane species and some other zzso zzso A duplicated versions of the DNA segment, which is found to have a larger size zzso zzso than zzso in both zzso was also identified, and was designated zzso zzso zzso DNA on zzso zzso The zzso similarity between the sequences of zzso and zzso from zzso cranes was zzso The zzso zzso do not amplify any sequence from zzso DNA, limiting the potential for contamination from human zzso Using the zzso zzso in combination with a quick DNA extraction method allows the zzso identification of crane gender in less than 10 zzso A test of the methodology was carried out on fully developed body feathers from 18 captive cranes and resulted in zzso successful zzso
