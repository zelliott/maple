zzso is a major structural zzso of zzso and zzso cell walls and is zzso from zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous work has shown that the zzso gene encodes a zzso integral membrane protein zzso which mediates sensitivity to the zzso class of zzso zzso zzso zzso and is a zzso of this zzso We have cloned and zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso a zzso integral membrane protein zzso which is zzso identical to zzso The residual zzso zzso activity present in strains with deletions of zzso is zzso zzso by zzso prepared against zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso is also a component of the zzso and zzso more sensitive to the zzso zzso explaining the increased sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso to this zzso zzso disruption of zzso and zzso is zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are alternative zzso with essential overlapping zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso expression reveals that zzso of zzso is regulated in the cell cycle and zzso during growth on zzso while zzso is expressed in the absence of zzso zzso is essential for zzso a process which occurs during nutritional zzso zzso is induced by the addition of zzso to the growth zzso and this induction is completely dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that growth of zzso zzso zzso is highly sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso promoter results in zzso zzso Thus, the sensitivity of zzso zzso to these drugs can be explained by the zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso is also highly induced in response to zzso in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso may also play a role in the zzso of the cell wall during the mating zzso
