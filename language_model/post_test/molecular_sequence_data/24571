The zzso zzso diversity was determined for a sample associated with an in zzso growth chamber deployed for 5 days on a Mid-Atlantic Ridge zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso 44 degrees zzso The DNA was extracted from the sample and the zzso zzso amplified by zzso No zzso were detected in the zzso zzso clones containing bacterial zzso zzso zzso were zzso Based on restriction zzso length zzso analysis, 47 clones were unique, however, based on comparative sequence analysis some of these were very similar, and thus only 22 clones were selected for full sequence and zzso zzso The zzso were dominated by zzso zzso The remainder formed a novel lineage within the zzso zzso One clone formed a distinct deeply branching zzso and was a distant relative of the zzso This report further expands the growing evidence that zzso are important members in zzso cycling at zzso zzso zzso participating as zzso and free living zzso
