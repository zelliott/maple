zzso protein family plays a key role in many biological processes both in zzso and zzso through regulating the zzso activities of some downstream zzso Here, we obtained a novel member of human zzso protein family, named as zzso zzso finger and zzso domain containing zzso which encodes 504 zzso acid zzso with a zzso domain at its zzso that is similar to the same domain of other known zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was expressed zzso in most adult human zzso and whilst zzso zzso showed that zzso was mainly localized to zzso Interestingly, the reporter zzso in zzso cells suggested that zzso might function as a zzso zzso This present work as the first report about the functional exploration of the novel zzso gene would be contributed to profound understanding of the zzso regulation via zzso protein zzso
