Recently our laboratory described an efficient method for generating zzso zzso insertions in the zzso germ line, and we showed that zzso insertions induce embryonic zzso at a frequency of roughly one zzso per 70 zzso To date we have isolated four zzso zzso and, using the zzso as a molecular tag, have cloned the genes disrupted in three of zzso The zzso in all three zzso lie within or just zzso of the first coding zzso point in the opposite zzso orientation from the zzso and disrupt zzso Here we present a molecular characterization of two genes identified by this method and describe the associated zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is predicted to zzso a protein of 582 zzso acids with no recognizable functional zzso which is highly zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso is expressed widely and zzso during the first 3 days of zzso zzso sites of expression are the eyes and zzso zzso on day 1, the fin zzso liver zzso and gut on day 2, and the zzso arches on day zzso Beginning at day 3 of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit small eyes, a reduced brain and visceral zzso shortened zzso and a lack of expansion of the liver and gut, and then die on the sixth day of zzso The dead eye zzso gene encodes a protein of 820 zzso acids that is zzso to genes of unknown function in human, zzso and zzso and that has weak zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dye zzso can be recognized on day 2 of zzso by the presence of zzso cells in the zzso and zzso dye zzso die on day 5 of zzso These results demonstrate the power of zzso zzso in zzso for rapidly finding and characterizing novel genes essential for embryonic zzso Using our current methodology, we estimate that our laboratory could screen approximately 25,000 insertions in 2-3 years, identifying perhaps zzso embryonic lethal zzso Assuming that all genes are accessible to zzso zzso the wider application of this approach could lead to the rapid identification of the majority of genes that are required for embryonic development of this zzso
