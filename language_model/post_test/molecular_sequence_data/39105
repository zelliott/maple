A set of novel zzso peptides has been isolated from zzso brain and zzso These compounds, zzso A zzso zzso B zzso and zzso C zzso were named for their source, zzso zzso and their zzso to the zzso zzso zzso We present the first report of the zzso structures and pharmacological actions of the zzso Generation of three-dimensional structures of the zzso in a zzso environment using zzso zzso chemical shift assignments, two-dimensional zzso techniques, and molecular dynamics and simulated zzso procedures allowed for the determination of possible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with a large degree of flexibility in the zzso and minor dynamic fraying at the end of the zzso The pharmacological effects of the zzso were studied by measuring the zzso of zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso substance P zzso zzso All of the zzso tested zzso zzso zzso with a rank order of zzso effect of zzso zzso SP zzso zzso zzso zzso A high concentration (1 zzso of the zzso produced varying degrees of zzso to a subsequent challenge with the same or different zzso while a low concentration (1 zzso produced zzso at the zzso Our data suggest differences in zzso acid side chains and their charged states at the zzso sequence or differences in secondary structure at the zzso which do not overlap according to the findings in this paper, may explain the differing degree and type of zzso zzso seen at the zzso
