In response to growth factor zzso many zzso cells zzso generate zzso oxygen species zzso that lead to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso While investigating zzso zzso in zzso cells, paradoxically we found zzso of a major zzso protein identified as zzso Mass zzso analysis revealed that the zzso site is zzso zzso of the zzso leads to about a zzso increase in the rate of zzso In zzso studies revealed a zzso increase in zzso content 15 zzso after zzso treatment, and zzso was found in the cell periphery suggesting that in response to growth factor, zzso zzso in zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso is most likely zzso by zzso zzso because zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 2 zzso comparable with its zzso in zzso Moreover, mass spectral analysis showed efficient transfer of zzso from immobilized zzso zzso to zzso Overall, this study revealed a novel zzso relevance of zzso zzso regulated by zzso zzso of the penultimate zzso zzso by growth factor zzso
