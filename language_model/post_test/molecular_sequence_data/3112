A heavy metal tolerant strain of the zzso zzso species zzso zzso isolated from soil heavily contaminated with zzso was previously shown to tolerate high zzso of zinc and cadmium zzso in the growth zzso We have investigated some of the specific molecular responses of this zzso strain to the presence of increasing zzso of zinc zzso in the growth zzso In particular, we show that zinc zzso induce a general change in the array of zzso zzso with a shift towards the production of more zzso low molecular weight zzso Some of these proteins were zzso and identified through zzso search in zzso Among them are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso The latter are zzso zzso known to play a role in heavy metal response in plants, animals and zzso
