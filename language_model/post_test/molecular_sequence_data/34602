Two forms of zzso zzso zzso were zzso from rat zzso zzso The first form, zzso zzso weight 38 zzso contained zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso activity and did not bind to the zzso orange A or zzso P columns used in the zzso zzso The second form, zzso zzso weight 27 zzso contained only zzso of the zzso zzso activity, had a zzso zzso zzso and exhibited a high zzso zzso zzso activity towards zzso zzso The zzso proteins were identified from zzso mass data and best matched with rat zzso zzso zzso (short zzso although pure sheep liver zzso zzso did not possess zzso activity when subsequently zzso The zzso protein was identified from zzso mass data and best matched with the zzso acid sequence of mouse and human zzso 1 of zzso zzso zzso and showed a high zzso specific zzso This study suggests that the major zzso component zzso represents a new and unique zzso or zzso zzso present in rat liver zzso The minor zzso component zzso is due to the zzso present in rat liver zzso However, it is not yet clear that zzso is indeed zzso and zzso is indeed zzso due to sequence zzso being less than 60 and zzso zzso
