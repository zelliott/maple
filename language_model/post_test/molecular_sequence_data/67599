In plants, signaling leading to resistance against zzso pathogens is zzso zzso of zzso microbes by resistance zzso proteins is relayed though successive activities of downstream zzso in a network that is not well zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso other proteins are members of the zzso complex zzso a regulatory zzso in defense zzso Of all characterized MAC members, zzso in zzso cause the most severe zzso towards both virulent and zzso microbial zzso zzso zzso of zzso represent new signaling elements and may aid in further unraveling of defense zzso Our identification and characterization of a dominant zzso of zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso a close zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso do not exhibit altered zzso however, zzso zzso double zzso exhibit enhanced zzso defects consistent with unequal genetic zzso between the zzso zzso gene expression zzso by the dominant zzso zzso completely suppresses disease zzso in the zzso zzso background and also restores zzso appearance, further supporting functional zzso between the two zzso zzso
