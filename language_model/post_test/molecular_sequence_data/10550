zzso fixation by zzso zzso follows the equation zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso and exhibits features which are not obvious in the zzso bacteria studied so zzso The reaction is coupled to the zzso of carbon monoxide zzso by a zzso CO zzso that transfers the electrons derived from CO zzso to zzso thereby producing zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso and transfers the electrons to a zzso for the reduction of zzso to zzso Among the most striking properties of the zzso zzso zzso system are the dependence on zzso and zzso the complete zzso of all components involved toward zzso and zzso the inability to reduce zzso or zzso and a low zzso zzso In addition, the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso components and the zzso involved seem to be dissimilar from the known zzso
