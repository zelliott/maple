zzso is important for zzso integrity and stabilization of zzso zzso We have identified the zzso factors zzso and zzso as redundant regulators of mouse zzso as they repress zzso output from major satellite repeats by zzso with DNA within zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso and zzso resulted in dramatic zzso of major satellite zzso persistent impairment of zzso marks and defects in zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso at zzso showed enrichment at zzso major satellite repeats only when these sequences retained intact binding sites for zzso and other zzso zzso Additionally, zzso interrogation of all zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat regions in the mouse zzso revealed a high zzso with the presence of zzso factor binding zzso These data define a general model in which reiterated arrangement of zzso factor binding sites within repeat sequences is an intrinsic mechanism of the formation of zzso
