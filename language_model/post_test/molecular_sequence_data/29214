The zzso zzso general stress protein zzso was zzso using two-dimensional gel zzso and its 25 zzso zzso acid sequence zzso Analysis of the corresponding gene revealed that the zzso product is a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso gave evidence for a zzso zzso the synthesis of which was induced at the onset of stationary phase and in response to heat zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso ethanol, zzso zzso sodium zzso and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen zzso zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends by zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso Although zzso expression was induced in response to various zzso its disruption had no significant effect on the cell survival after each individual zzso zzso protein gels from zzso and zzso cells revealed no zzso effect of the zzso on protein zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso genes showed that an zzso repeat located upstream of the promoter is required for zzso induction by environmental stresses but not by entrance into stationary zzso Two distinct mechanisms responding to different signals are thus involved in zzso zzso
