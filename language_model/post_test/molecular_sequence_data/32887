zzso zzso not only works as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system, but also as a zzso factor during early zzso In zzso a previous report showed that zzso that lack the zzso zzso zzso display abnormal zzso zzso In this work, we screened for point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We identified one point zzso that generates a gain of zzso affinity for the zzso and affects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for this point zzso display a fourfold increase in the zzso speed of zzso cell movements during the rapid phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present a zzso zzso including a total lack of zzso zzso Identification of this gain of function zzso shows the participation of zzso in the regulation of the cell speed movements during the zzso extension and suggests a role of zzso in the regulation of zzso formation during early zzso
