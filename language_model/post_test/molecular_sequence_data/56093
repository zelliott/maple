We studied the effect of zzso on alcohol zzso activity, zzso protein levels and zzso zzso levels in the zzso of zzso and zzso male zzso zzso on kidney alcohol zzso activity were also zzso zzso rats injected with 100 zzso zzso which induced zzso showed a zzso decrease in liver and a zzso decrease in kidney alcohol zzso activity compared with zzso rats injected with zzso zzso rats exhibited a zzso increase in alcohol zzso activity in liver and kidney compared with zzso rats injected with a replacement dose of 20 zzso zzso We saw a twofold and a zzso higher level of alcohol zzso activity in liver and zzso respectively, of zzso rats compared with zzso zzso These effects were not accounted for by nutritional zzso daily food intake did not differ between zzso zzso protein levels as seen on Western blots varied in the same direction as zzso zzso zzso analysis showed higher levels of liver alcohol zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats compared with zzso zzso These studies show that liver alcohol zzso activity and protein levels are modulated by zzso at zzso relevant levels and that this effect is not due to changes in food zzso kidney alcohol zzso activity is regulated in zzso The change in alcohol zzso activity appears to be controlled in part by zzso mechanisms in zzso animals and by zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso
