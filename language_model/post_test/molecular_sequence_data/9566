The tick zzso for outer surface protein A zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease in North zzso The blockade of zzso has been shown to reduce zzso zzso adherence to the zzso zzso gut in zzso Thus, zzso is one of the potential targets for the development of zzso vaccines to prevent the transmission of zzso zzso The aim of this study is to identify the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso for human zzso zzso in zzso The zzso clone zzso the zzso sequence with zzso zzso was obtained from zzso zzso of fed zzso of zzso zzso The putative zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso identical to that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding will facilitate investigations on the role of zzso zzso zzso and its interaction with zzso zzso and will have important implications on endeavors to develop a tick zzso
