The components for the zzso function of a zzso DNA during zzso include a zzso sequence (the origin of transfer, zzso and a zzso sequence coding for zzso zzso zzso By genetic and deletion analysis, we have located the zzso region of zzso a cryptic zzso previously isolated from a zzso zzso zzso Within a zzso zzso zzso region, several open reading frames zzso were zzso two of the zzso are zzso transcribed and they zzso proteins of calculated molecular masses, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, these protein sequences are substantially similar to two of the previously characterized zzso proteins of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso (now designated zzso sequence is also found to be similar to a presumed zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso of sequence identity of plasmids zzso zzso and zzso include their zzso zzso By alkaline zzso gel zzso and DNA sequencing, we have established the location of the relaxation complex zzso site within the zzso of zzso An identical zzso site, which is adjacent to a characteristic 10 zzso zzso repeat zzso is also found for zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing a 42 zzso synthetic piece of DNA encompassing the zzso zzso repeat and zzso sequence was shown to be zzso
