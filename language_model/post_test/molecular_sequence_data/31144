Two zzso zzso zzso derived from regions of pol zzso among zzso have been zzso zzso chain reactions utilizing these zzso amplify a zzso pol zzso in every zzso DNA tested to zzso The zzso chain reaction has been linked to a reverse zzso step so that a zzso DNA zzso can be obtained from a moderate amount of a zzso zzso or viral zzso The identity of an unknown zzso can be determined by sequencing of the amplified zzso following molecular zzso This procedure was tested on an unidentified zzso zzso expressed by a zzso zzso line obtained from an AIDS zzso Our zzso zzso identified the zzso as being highly similar to zzso monkey virus zzso and zzso zzso 1, which are closely related zzso type D viruses that cause zzso zzso
