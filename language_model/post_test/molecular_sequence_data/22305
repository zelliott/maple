Although cellular receptors for zzso were first identified nearly 40 years ago, their central role in the immune response was discovered only in the last zzso They are key players in both the zzso and zzso phase of an immune response, setting thresholds for B cell zzso regulating the maturation of zzso cells, and zzso the exquisite specificity of the zzso response to innate zzso zzso such as zzso zzso cellular zzso and the recruitment and zzso of inflammatory zzso Moreover, because of their general presence as zzso pairs consisting of zzso and zzso molecules on the same cell, they have become a paradigm for studying the balance of positive and negative signals that ultimately determine the outcome of an immune zzso This review will zzso recent results in zzso biology with an emphasis on data obtained in in zzso model zzso
