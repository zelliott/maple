When the female plant of zzso zzso is infected with the zzso fungus zzso zzso its zzso zzso develop into zzso which contain fungus zzso instead of zzso To identify genes required for maturation of zzso in zzso zzso we performed a zzso zzso approach with healthy male buds and female buds infected with zzso zzso We isolated five zzso zzso which were zzso expressed in healthy male buds during stages associated with a burst in zzso zzso These five zzso are predicted to zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso 17 protein zzso a zzso protein zzso precursor zzso and a zzso protein zzso All five genes showed expression in both healthy and zzso male zzso but not expressed in either healthy or infected female zzso The first three genes were highly expressed in both zzso and zzso grains while the last two genes were expressed only inside the zzso of male flower zzso zzso analysis results showed that zzso and zzso belong to zzso zzso of zzso genes and zzso zzso 17 family zzso zzso Our results suggest that the isolated five genes are related to the fertility of the zzso leading to the development of fertile zzso The zzso fungus was not able to induce the expression of the five genes in the infected female zzso This raises the possibility that these genes are under the control of master zzso on the Y zzso
