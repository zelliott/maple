Because the presence of a native zzso zzso exchange zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso remains controversial, its possible functional role in these cells is poorly zzso Here, in experiments on control zzso and zzso zzso a cloned zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso techniques reveal that these cells express an zzso zzso protein forming a functional zzso with zzso zzso receptors zzso that controls zzso zzso in a restricted zzso zzso The following data obtained in control zzso zzso are consistent with this view: zzso reverse zzso revealed that the zzso expresses two transcripts for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that native zzso and zzso are largely zzso in discrete areas of the plasma membrane in close zzso to the cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso by rabbit serum, which zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso display a large and transient inward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a result of the zzso rise at the inner surface zzso zzso this current is significantly enhanced by zzso and by an zzso zzso zzso two maneuvers that prevent zzso zzso via zzso and zzso blocking zzso enhanced the zzso zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso in zzso injected with the respective zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of cardiac zzso confirmed by zzso zzso has functional consequences for the zzso zzso but not for the zzso zzso zzso mode of zzso exchange activity and does not alter the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that native zzso because of its strategic position, may regulate zzso zzso signaling during the early zzso of zzso maturation and/or zzso and zzso foreign cardiac protein is excluded from the zzso zzso surrounding the native zzso complex in the zzso
