In immune cells, generation of sustained zzso levels is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso key players in this process comprise the zzso interaction zzso 1 zzso that functions as a zzso sensor in the zzso zzso and zzso located in the plasma zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso stores leads to zzso zzso into discrete zzso which zzso with zzso to couple to and activate zzso zzso The zzso C zzso of zzso is sufficient to activate zzso currents independent of store zzso Here we identified an zzso small zzso zzso zzso acids zzso within zzso C zzso zzso the two zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso acids that exhibited enhanced interaction with zzso resulting in zzso increased zzso zzso This zzso similar to the complete zzso C zzso displayed the ability to zzso by a novel assembly domain that occurred subsequent to the zzso zzso A smaller zzso zzso acids zzso generated by a further deletion of 30 zzso acids substantially reduced the ability to zzso zzso to a loss of zzso to as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso by 35 zzso acids zzso did not alter zzso but substantially decreased efficiency in zzso to and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso leukemia zzso mast cells demonstrated its enhanced plasma membrane targeting associated with zzso larger zzso currents in comparison with the complete zzso C zzso In aggregate, we have identified two zzso key regions within zzso C zzso that control zzso zzso a zzso domain indispensable for zzso to zzso and a zzso domain that controls the extent of zzso to zzso
