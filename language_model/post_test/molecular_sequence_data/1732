zzso zzso is an important mechanism of zzso of tumor zzso genes in cancer zzso zzso tumors are zzso in their zzso zzso and clinical zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso zzso of tumor zzso and cancer genes in kidney zzso we determined a zzso profile of kidney zzso 

We examined the promoter zzso status of 10 biologically significant tumor zzso and cancer genes in 100 kidney tumors zzso clear cell, 20 zzso 6 zzso 5 collecting zzso 5 zzso cell zzso 7 zzso 6 transitional cell zzso of the zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso profile was examined with regard to zzso characteristics of the kidney cancer zzso 

zzso of one or more genes was found in 93 zzso of 100 zzso A total of zzso of kidney tumors had one zzso zzso two zzso zzso three zzso and zzso four or more genes zzso The frequency of zzso of the 10 genes in the 100 tumor zzso was zzso zzso (all clear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed in all of the zzso cell types and grades and stages zzso No zzso was observed in specimens of normal kidney or zzso tissue from 15 zzso zzso of zzso was specific to clear cell zzso zzso zzso was detected at a significantly higher frequency in zzso zzso cell tumors and in high-grade tumors of all cell zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in zzso zzso zzso of five or more genes was observed in 3 zzso of 100 tumors and may indicate a zzso zzso in kidney zzso In addition, the zzso island in the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso gene was zzso zzso and was found to be zzso in 15 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is common, can occur relatively early, may disrupt critical zzso and, thus, likely plays an important role in kidney zzso A zzso profile may be useful in predicting a patient's clinical outcome and provide molecular markers for diagnostic and zzso approaches to kidney zzso
