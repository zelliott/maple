Although previous studies of acquired loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso have suggested that a zzso zzso gene may lie within the short arm of zzso 8, its precise zzso remains to be zzso To obtain a more accurate zzso map 120 zzso zzso were examined with eight zzso 8 zzso markers zzso both restriction zzso length zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso 91 cases were zzso and zzso was detected in 47 zzso The markers most commonly zzso within the lost region mapped to the zzso zzso gene zzso at zzso zzso From study of zzso showing zzso within zzso a common region of deletion was established extending zzso from zzso to the zzso 1 gene zzso which is mapped to zzso This zzso with common deleted regions observed in other studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results in zzso cancer delineate a region in zzso where the putative zzso zzso gene must zzso The zzso zzso deletions appear to be independent of those involving zzso and zzso in the same zzso No relationship was found between the presence of zzso deletion and site or stage of the zzso or the sex or age of the patient at zzso
