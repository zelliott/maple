We have recently identified an zzso site on zzso + zzso and found that binding of zzso zzso to this specific site of the zzso markedly zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso of whether zzso of zzso + zzso affects heart function in animal in zzso was the object of this zzso 

Male zzso zzso mouse and specific zzso zzso were used for the zzso A zzso zzso zzso in zzso mouse assessed in zzso cardiac zzso 

zzso zzso zzso infusion in mouse shifted zzso loop zzso with increased stroke volume and enhanced zzso zzso Global zzso parameters such as ejection fraction and cardiac zzso and load independent zzso parameters including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all increased without any effect on relaxation following administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso did not zzso suggesting that zzso zzso performance is a direct cardiac effect caused by the zzso of zzso + zzso 

Our study provides the first in zzso zzso evidence to demonstrate that zzso of zzso + zzso zzso significant positive zzso effect in intact animal zzso The finding may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of heart zzso
