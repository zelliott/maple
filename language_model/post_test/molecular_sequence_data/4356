The internal transcribed zzso zzso region of nuclear zzso DNA from 22 zzso and zzso annual zzso species of section zzso zzso and three species belonging to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated by zzso amplification and direct zzso The length of the zzso region varied from 215 to 218 zzso and that of the zzso region from 215 to 216 zzso in the species zzso zzso was more variable and provided more zzso sites zzso than zzso zzso No variation was encountered within zzso In zzso comparison among species of section zzso sequence divergence ranged from zzso to zzso for the combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso resulted in zzso zzso trees and showed that section zzso is zzso according to the species analyzed outside of the zzso The analysis clarified the zzso relationships among zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso species did not change the general zzso of the trees obtained using only the zzso zzso Although some zzso species relationships will have to be clarified with faster evolving zzso the ITS sequences are shown to be useful for assessing evolutionary relationships among closely related zzso species, as well as for clarifying zzso problems in previously controversial cases zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso New hypotheses are proposed concerning the origin of several zzso zzso For example, it is shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso earlier than all other species of section zzso excluding the zzso zzso zzso which is found to be zzso in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso which was considered a hybrid between sections zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are sister zzso within section zzso they belong in a zzso differentiated zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
