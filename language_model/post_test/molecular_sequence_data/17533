A human zzso zzso zzso covering approximately 8 zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library, by zzso with a C zzso probe and with a zzso zzso This gene was identified as zzso It belongs to the human zzso cluster which is composed of three genes zzso zzso and F zzso 1) that do not zzso zzso data indicate that zzso is organized similarly to the mouse zzso 5 zzso It contains three zzso with lengths of 69, 38, and 106 zzso as compared with 65, 38, and 106 for zzso 1, 2, and 3 of mouse zzso 5, zzso The corresponding zzso values were 61, 66 and zzso Using a zzso specific probe containing zzso 1, we showed that this gene was selectively expressed in human zzso cell zzso It is likely to zzso a zzso acid zzso light chain that would associate with zzso chains and play an important role in the early steps of B cell zzso
