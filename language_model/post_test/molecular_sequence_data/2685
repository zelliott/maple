The zzso are a family of zzso zzso Data from protein and zzso sequencing have shown that at least five distinct but closely related zzso zzso exist each of which possesses four or eight zzso internal repeats which may be zzso zzso zzso The proteins are present within a wide range of zzso and cell types, with each cell type having all or a subset of the zzso The proteins are zzso on the inner surface of the plasma membrane associated with the zzso and in some cases also with zzso zzso Some members of the family are major zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The precise functions of the proteins are unknown but they are likely to play important roles in cellular zzso Previously suggested functions are zzso of zzso zzso zzso linkage and control of membrane fusion events in zzso It is also suggested that they may be involved in the regulation of cell surface zzso
