zzso juvenile zzso zzso is an zzso zzso genetically zzso disorder, representing the most frequent inherited cause of chronic zzso failure in zzso One of the responsible zzso zzso , has been mapped to zzso The presence of large zzso deletions of approximately 250 zzso in the majority of affected patients allowed us to define a minimal deletion zzso for zzso zzso A zzso zzso covering this zzso was zzso Combination of large scale zzso sequencing, zzso selection and zzso analysis led to the characterization of two zzso zzso One encodes the already known zzso zzso and the other encodes a novel protein of at least zzso zzso acids containing a putative zzso zzso 3 zzso In two patients carrying the large deletion of the zzso region on only one zzso two zzso were detected in two independent zzso of the novel zzso One consists of a single base zzso causing a zzso and the other is a zzso substitution in the consensus zzso zzso donor zzso Both zzso thus potentially generate zzso zzso One of these zzso was found to segregate with the disease in the family, and the second appeared to be a de zzso zzso We therefore conclude that this novel gene is a strong candidate for zzso
