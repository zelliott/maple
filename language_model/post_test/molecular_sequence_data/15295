zzso zzso uncommon in US cases zzso occur in zzso of cases reported from Latin zzso Although these differences may reflect reporting bias, delayed diagnosis, or differences in host immune response among different ethnic groups, they also could result from genetic differences changing the zzso of the zzso It is possible that genetic differences among strains of zzso zzso may influence the zzso and clinical manifestations of zzso 

We examined the clinical features of patients with zzso manifestations of zzso and performed genetic analysis based on zzso sequence variations in the internal transcribed zzso regions of zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso of zzso Two pairs of zzso zzso were designed to develop and amplify the ITS regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were based on the ITS sequence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso deposited in the zzso zzso number zzso Eight patients attending a zzso hospital in southern Brazil were enrolled into the zzso All case patients had skin cultures growing zzso zzso at the zzso zzso 

Six of eight zzso patients were zzso and presented involvement of multiples zzso by zzso zzso Two zzso patients did not present evidence of involvement of other zzso besides zzso and zzso ITS sequencing of a DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso of 8 patients revealed two distinct zzso The 2 distinct fragments zzso zzso differed from each other at 7 positions in the ITS zzso They were identical to strains of zzso zzso isolated in patients from Colombia and Argentina, but different from strains isolated in zzso zzso and zzso were isolated in 5 patients and 3 patients, respectively, with zzso manifestations of zzso Both zzso and zzso strains were isolated in zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso manifestations of zzso which are frequently seen in Brazilian patients were caused by 2 specific strains in our zzso Those strains have been isolated in patients with these particular clinical features of zzso in Latin zzso Our study suggests that unique zzso characteristics among the Latin American species of zzso zzso might explain its increased zzso
