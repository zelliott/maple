Analysis of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso revealed three zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso gene disruption showed that the zzso zzso or -C disruption zzso were zzso indistinguishable from the parent isolate on potato zzso zzso zzso which indicates that none of these genes is essential for zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso deletion zzso to seven zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso increased significantly compared to the parent strain, while sensitivity of zzso deletion zzso increased to some but not all zzso No change in zzso sensitivity was observed for zzso deletion zzso The parental zzso of zzso and zzso deletion zzso were completely restored by genetic zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso increased significantly when subjected in zzso to a mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as compared to the individual zzso These results indicate that different zzso zzso target different zzso proteins in zzso zzso and that a mixture of zzso zzso can result in synergistic zzso Our findings have directly implications on chemical management strategies of plant diseases caused by zzso zzso
