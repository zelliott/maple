A strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from microbial mats colonizing a zzso channel formed by free-flowing zzso waters of a bore well (New zzso zzso registered number zzso in the Great zzso Basin, zzso zzso of strain zzso were curved rods zzso zzso and stained zzso The strain grew zzso in zzso zzso medium at 55 degrees C zzso for growth between 45 and 60 degrees zzso and pH zzso zzso for growth between pH zzso and zzso zzso and zzso but no other organic zzso carbohydrates or zzso acids could be used in the presence of up to zzso % zzso zzso Although zzso extract and/or zzso were required for growth on zzso they did not support growth as sole carbon zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrate or zzso Growth was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso was a member of the family zzso class zzso zzso zzso and was most closely related to members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity value to type strains was zzso zzso Based on these results, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species in a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
