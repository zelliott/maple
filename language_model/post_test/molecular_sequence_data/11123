In most zzso the zzso zzso zzso are zzso by gene families, and are used to zzso zzso We describe the structure of zzso zzso coding for the zzso in the housefly that have been zzso by both genetic and zzso means, in zzso zzso zzso In earlier work, we showed that one of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in resistant flies and degrades certain zzso We used a zzso from a zzso clone of zzso as a probe to screen a housefly zzso DNA bank in zzso zzso This probe detected multiple zzso zzso Genes for zzso were found in five different, zzso zzso zzso three of which carry zzso closely linked zzso Multiple genes for both zzso and zzso were zzso some of which have zzso in their zzso untranslated zzso In adults, the only zzso zzso that are expressed are zzso by the zzso zzso A new zzso zzso (called zzso was also zzso Fusion genes zzso zzso zzso sequences and either zzso or zzso sequences in their 3' halves were encountered at three separate zzso The genes described here are found in both the ancestral sensitive strain and the zzso zzso
