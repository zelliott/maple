Potential pathogens from shower water and zzso shower mist zzso shower zzso have been suggested as an environmental source of infection for zzso zzso To zzso the microbial load in shower water and zzso samples, we used culture, zzso and quantitative zzso methods to investigate four shower zzso in a stem cell transplant unit at zzso Hospital in zzso Louis, zzso We also tested zzso zzso as a possible zzso zzso In addition to zzso a zzso zzso gene sequencing survey was used to characterize the abundant bacterial populations within shower water and zzso The average total bacterial counts were zzso zzso zzso zzso in shower water and zzso zzso zzso zzso in shower zzso and these counts were reduced to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, after zzso zzso were zzso Potentially zzso organisms were found in both water and zzso samples from the conventional zzso Most notable was the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the water and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso may protect zzso patients from zzso infections in a stem cell transplant unit because of efficient capture of vast numbers of potentially zzso bacteria from hospital zzso However, an in-depth zzso study is necessary to investigate whether zzso zzso reduce zzso zzso The microbial load in shower zzso with conventional zzso was elevated compared to the load in zzso background air in the stem cell unit, but it was considerably lower than typical indoor zzso Thus, in shower environments without zzso zzso the increase in microbial load due to shower water zzso would not have been distinguishable from anticipated variations in background zzso
