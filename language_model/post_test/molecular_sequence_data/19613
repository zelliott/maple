zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the sixth zzso in the zzso zzso which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic zzso acids and many secondary zzso The zzso is widely involved in zzso tolerant transgenic plants because it is the primary target of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned by zzso zzso It contains an open reading frame zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence showed high zzso with other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso were identified by functional zzso zzso
