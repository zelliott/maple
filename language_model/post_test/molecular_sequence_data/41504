Recent molecular analyses suggest that bacteria related to strains zzso and zzso previously reported to be zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso represent one of the ten most abundant zzso detected in adult human zzso zzso These two strains were isolated as zzso bacteria from zzso samples of a healthy zzso We show here that they share zzso similarity in zzso zzso gene sequence with a new zzso isolate recovered from a zzso biopsy of a Crohn's disease patient, and also with the sequence reported recently for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling using zzso Rapid ID zzso and zzso zzso test systems confirmed a close zzso similarity to zzso zzso zzso but also indicated that the description of this species should be expanded to include the ability to produce zzso from zzso and zzso zzso analysis confirmed an affinity between zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso belonging to the family zzso (formerly zzso cluster zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso evidence it is proposed that zzso be transferred to the zzso zzso with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
