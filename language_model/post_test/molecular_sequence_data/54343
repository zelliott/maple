A full-length zzso zzso zzso was cloned and characterized from zzso zzso zzso developing zzso Based on its sequence and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The predicted structural model resembles known zzso structures, folding into two zzso of unequal size: a large and a small one separated by a deep zzso containing the zzso involved in the zzso active zzso A truncated version, without the 24 zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso coli, zzso to zzso zzso using immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso behaved as a zzso on size exclusion zzso and had a specific activity of zzso zzso zzso the highest specific activity ever reported for a plant zzso The zzso had higher affinity for zzso and zzso relative to zzso but the zzso efficiency was higher with zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and was insensitive either to zzso or to zzso Its expression profile showed higher levels in zzso zzso developing seeds and roots, than in zzso zzso A time course of zzso activity and expression in seeds showed that the highest zzso levels are found at the early stages of reserve compounds, lipids and proteins zzso
