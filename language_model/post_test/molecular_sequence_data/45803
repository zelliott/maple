The peptides of the zzso Y zzso family exert their functions, including regulation of appetite and zzso rhythm, by binding to zzso coupled zzso zzso have five zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and recently zzso has been discovered in fish and zzso In chicken we have previously characterized the first four zzso and here we describe zzso and zzso The genes for zzso and zzso are located 1 zzso apart on zzso 13, which displays zzso zzso with human zzso 5 that zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso bound the chicken zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso No functional zzso was zzso The zzso zzso is expressed in zzso gastrointestinal tract and zzso zzso zzso zzso bound chicken zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas chicken zzso surprisingly had a much lower zzso with a Ki of 41 zzso perhaps as a result of its additional zzso acid at the N zzso zzso zzso fragments had greatly reduced affinity for zzso in agreement with its closest relative, zzso in chicken and fish, but in contrast to zzso in zzso This suggests that in zzso zzso has only recently acquired the ability to bind truncated zzso Chicken zzso has a much more restricted tissue distribution than other zzso and was only detected in adrenal zzso zzso seems to have been lost in zzso The zzso roles of zzso and zzso remain to be identified, but our zzso and zzso analyses support the ancient origin of these Y zzso genes by zzso zzso in an early zzso zzso zzso
