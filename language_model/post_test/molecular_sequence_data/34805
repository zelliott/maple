zzso of zzso modifications is expected to be one of the major future experimental challenges for zzso We describe zzso a mass zzso procedure to screen for protein modifications by zzso mass zzso that is based on zzso acquisition improvement of the mass accuracy by exporting the zzso mass values into zzso software for zzso zzso on recognized zzso zzso the zzso peak mass data set is used in searching for modified zzso zzso peptides possessing specific mass zzso In order to identify the location of zzso and zzso available for zzso zzso bond formation, zzso small heat shock proteins zzso were screened for labeling with the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in presence of zzso zzso modification due to zzso of the zzso zzso probe was detected for zzso zzso zzso Novel zzso zzso sites were identified in two zzso zzso in zzso and zzso respectively), by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso was also zzso as well an zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso bond zzso We conclude that zzso mass zzso can be an efficient way of screening for various zzso zzso zzso any zzso for zzso mass zzso can be used, provided that zzso acquisition zzso is zzso
