In the zzso coli zzso zzso two partially overlapping zzso with zzso zzso sites zzso The essential components of the zzso zzso are the alpha and zzso genes and the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso is composed of the alpha zzso with the internal zzso site, and the zzso zzso The zzso alpha protein has zzso and zzso activities and specifically binds type I zzso present in zzso and zzso Using a zzso test for zzso zzso we demonstrated that the two zzso depend on both the zzso and zzso activities of the alpha zzso Moreover, neither zzso requires the host zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso origins of the two zzso share the zzso site and differ for zzso and zzso zzso By deletion zzso we defined the minimal zzso and zzso regions sufficient for zzso The zzso site was limited to a zzso region, which contains six type I zzso spaced regularly close to the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of one or more type I zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of 6 or 10 zzso within the zzso region also abolished replication ability, suggesting that the relative arrangement of the zzso is zzso The zzso site was limited to a zzso zzso region that does not contain type I zzso In zzso the alpha protein did not bind zzso Thus, the alpha protein appears to act differently at the two origins of zzso
