Five alternatively spliced zzso zzso of human zzso have been identified previously and we report here the cloning of a new zzso named zzso zzso zzso from human zzso surface zzso cell zzso The new zzso zzso is identical to the alpha zzso but missing 79 zzso in the coding region of the zzso of zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso revealed an zzso of a shorter protein missing the 39 zzso acids at the zzso terminal of zzso which comprises the important zzso zzso recruitment domain zzso which is required for interactions between zzso and other zzso Secondary structure analysis of zzso zzso predicted the zzso of the zzso the zzso and part of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in comparison to the full-length alpha zzso The new zzso zzso was expressed in many, but not all, adult human zzso by zzso In zzso cells, transient zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso to levels similar to those of zzso However, zzso change at the zzso active center of the zzso 246 of zzso as well as zzso 285 of zzso completely abolished their zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a zzso new zzso zzso of zzso They also demonstrate that the first 39 zzso acids of the zzso of the zzso in zzso are not required for its zzso zzso
