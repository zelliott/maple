zzso is removed from DNA via the transfer of the zzso group to a zzso zzso site present in the DNA repair protein zzso zzso The human zzso is zzso by the free base zzso raising the possibility that substantially larger zzso groups could also be accepted as zzso However, the zzso coli zzso zzso is not zzso by zzso The zzso protein was rendered capable of reaction by the incorporation of two zzso zzso converting zzso to a zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso These changes increase the space at the active site of the protein where zzso is buried and thus permit access of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso was greatly zzso by the presence of DNA, providing strong support for the concept that binding of DNA to the zzso protein activates the zzso The zzso protein was able to repair zzso in a zzso zzso However, the rate of repair was very slow, whereas the zzso coli zzso the human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso reacted very rapidly with this zzso zzso and zzso repaired it when incubated with a mixture of the zzso and zzso zzso These results show that zzso groups are better zzso than zzso groups for zzso provided that zzso factors do not prevent binding of the zzso in the correct orientation for zzso group zzso
