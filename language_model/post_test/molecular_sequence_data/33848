zzso factor zzso VIII zzso develop in approximately zzso of individuals with zzso A and show specificity to multiple sites in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso to an immobilized zzso fraction prepared from a zzso zzso inhibitor plasma were determined after zzso zzso of zzso and zzso peptides derived from zzso of the A1 and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso light zzso zzso were detected and identified using highly sensitive liquid zzso zzso zzso 

zzso maps of the A1 zzso zzso zzso and light chain represented zzso zzso and zzso respectively, of the protein zzso zzso blots indicated that the inhibitor zzso reacted with zzso contained within each zzso of zzso zzso coupled with zzso identified 19 peptides representing zzso from all zzso A and C zzso The majority of peptides (10) were derived from the zzso zzso Three peptides mapped to the C2 domain, while two mapped to the A1 and A3 zzso and single peptides mapped to the zzso segment and C1 zzso zzso were typically defined by zzso sequences of zzso 12 zzso 

zzso coupled with zzso identified extensive zzso zzso at high resolution over the entire functional zzso zzso and yielded sequence lengths of zzso 15 zzso A number of the peptides identified mapped to known sequences involved in functionally important zzso and zzso zzso
