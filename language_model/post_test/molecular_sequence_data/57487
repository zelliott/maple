Higher plant zzso zzso contain several novel protein components whose zzso are not present in the zzso zzso coli zzso indicating a complex evolution of the zzso zzso apparatus following the zzso zzso Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a new small protein from spinach zzso zzso which has, based on the zzso acid sequence and zzso data, no counterpart in the zzso coli zzso We suggest a nomenclature suitable for this protein and other novel proteins in the zzso zzso
