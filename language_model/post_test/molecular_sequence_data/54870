Cohen syndrome is a rare zzso zzso disorder with a complex zzso including zzso zzso zzso obesity with slender zzso joint zzso progressive zzso zzso intermittent isolated zzso a cheerful zzso and characteristic facial zzso The zzso zzso which contains 62 zzso is so far the only gene known to be associated with Cohen zzso Point zzso deletions and zzso have been described in this zzso zzso zzso have reached a resolution which allows the detection of zzso deletions and zzso especially in large genes such as zzso 

High density zzso array data from patients with unexplained mental zzso zzso and normal controls zzso were zzso for copy number variation zzso zzso zzso zzso deletions in the zzso gene were detected in three patients but no such changes were detected in the zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene revealed point zzso in the second zzso in all three patients zzso 

zzso zzso screening with high density zzso provides a tool to detect zzso deletions in the zzso zzso This report presents an example of how zzso can be used to identify zzso zzso syndromes and to extend the zzso and zzso spectrum of zzso zzso
