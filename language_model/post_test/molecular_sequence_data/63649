zzso development in zzso zzso depends entirely on nutritional reserves that are predominantly derived from zzso proteins and stored in egg zzso zzso have evolved new resources, such as zzso and zzso to nourish their developing and early zzso However, the evolutionary timing and molecular events associated with this major zzso transition are not zzso By means of sensitive comparative zzso analyses and evolutionary simulations, we here show that the three ancestral zzso genes were progressively lost during zzso evolution (until around zzso million years ago, zzso in all but the zzso zzso which have retained a functional zzso zzso Our analyses also provide evidence that the major milk resource zzso zzso which have similar functional properties as zzso appeared in the common zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso Together, our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the emergence of zzso in the common zzso zzso and the development of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso allowed for the gradual loss of zzso zzso during zzso zzso
