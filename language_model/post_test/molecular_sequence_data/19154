zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso was detected in a mixed breeding group of zzso and zzso mice with no outward evidence of morbidity or zzso zzso revealed the presence of an attenuated zzso zzso that did not cause zzso effects in zzso cells or death in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso mice revealed a surprising spectrum of zzso An infectious molecular clone was derived directly from zzso zzso and the sequence analysis confirmed it was a member of zzso zzso zzso Experimental infection with zzso induced a zzso infection with no weight loss in zzso or zzso mice, and zzso the clinical and pathological picture of the naturally infected zzso zzso by day 54 zzso 50 % of zzso mice had cleared zzso In contrast, all zzso mice remained infected zzso Most significantly, this was associated with liver zzso in all the zzso infected zzso zzso These data confirmed that long-term persistence in zzso mice is established with specific zzso of zzso and that despite a zzso zzso active zzso of acute inflammation persist within the zzso The data also showed that zzso responses are not required to protect mice from lethal infection with all strains of zzso
