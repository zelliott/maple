zzso genes are zzso in cancer by zzso expression or zzso Here, we analyzed zzso sites in the zzso promoter as potential contributors to zzso expression in breast zzso This study comprised zzso breast cancer zzso for which DNA from normal surrounding tissue was available for 111, and 65 healthy breast zzso The zzso site in position zzso of the promoter was associated with tumor zzso As expected, there was no association between promoter single zzso zzso zzso and tumor stage or in zzso zzso versus cancer, as stage and early transformation are determined by the sampling time more than by tumor zzso In a subset of samples, zzso zzso expression levels had previously been zzso The zzso distribution in positions zzso and zzso was distinct between high and low zzso confirming the importance of promoter zzso These two sites also form a zzso zzso expression has been associated with breast cancer zzso regardless of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso site at zzso but not zzso or zzso showed differences between zzso and zzso breast zzso and between zzso and zzso breast zzso but there was no association with zzso zzso In five cases, the zzso of the tumor was different from the zzso of the host, zzso the possibility of zzso zzso in the zzso promoter that may affect zzso Our results corroborate that the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important for gene expression and breast cancer zzso
