We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso with about zzso similarity to the chicken zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso This mouse zzso lacks 88 zzso acids in the zzso portion, leaving only two zzso zzso compared to three in the chicken zzso zzso The zzso was cloned into an expression zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso We show that cells expressing the zzso can bind both basic zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso binds basic zzso with a zzso to zzso higher zzso zzso zzso is able to induce zzso of the zzso to the same extent as basic zzso The zzso is zzso upon stimulation with both zzso DNA synthesis is zzso and a zzso response is produced in cells expressing the zzso whereas cells expressing the zzso in the zzso orientation show none of these responses to basic zzso or zzso zzso Thus this zzso can functionally interact with two growth factors of the zzso zzso
