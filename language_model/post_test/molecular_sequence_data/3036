zzso related factor 2 zzso is a zzso protein that regulates zzso response element zzso zzso and zzso zzso of detoxifying zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso A comparison of zzso from different species, and with other zzso zzso revealed the presence of a highly zzso zzso zzso at position zzso in the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso zzso was used to mutate this zzso to zzso zzso expression experiments in human zzso zzso cells demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso was significantly less efficient in zzso zzso gene zzso and induction in response to zzso zzso zzso as zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibited zzso but not zzso expression of zzso This further implicated the zzso at position zzso in zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso Nuclear zzso experiments revealed that zzso zzso did not affect the retention of zzso by zzso in the zzso or its release in response to zzso However, band and zzso zzso showed a significant reduction in the binding of zzso to the zzso gene ARE as compared with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso lowered its affinity for the zzso leading to decreased zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
