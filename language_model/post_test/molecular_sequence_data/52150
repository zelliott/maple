Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were previously mapped to a zzso region of a zzso zzso DNA zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Simon, zzso zzso Winter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of a DNA region in the zzso zzso whose expression enhances the zzso activity determined by the zzso gene zzso This region was mapped immediately downstream of the putative zzso termination sequence previously located at the end of the zzso gene cluster zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso and was found to stimulate zzso activity two- to zzso when expressed in zzso coli or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of this region revealed an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso resulted in the synthesis of an approximately zzso zzso whose zzso zzso acid sequence completely matched that of the product predicted from the zzso The zzso thus defines a zzso which has now been designated zzso The zzso protein shares zzso acid sequence zzso with the zzso of several zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso component of the zzso zzso system, zzso by the zzso gene of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso could largely replace the zzso protein in stimulating zzso activity, and zzso could partially replace the zzso protein in forming active zzso zzso The overall properties of zzso suggest that it is a member of the zzso gene cluster and encodes the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
