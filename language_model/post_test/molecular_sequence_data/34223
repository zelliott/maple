Apart from the zzso the crystal structure of the bacterial zzso P in complex with a zzso reported by Reiter and colleagues recently, constitutes the first example of a multiple turnover zzso zzso Except in rare exceptions, zzso P is ubiquitous and, like the zzso is older than the initial branch point of the zzso zzso zzso the structure shows how the zzso and the protein zzso cooperate to process the zzso zzso The zzso site comprises some critical zzso zzso spread over the secondary structure but gathered in a compact volume next to the zzso which helps recognize and orient the zzso The discussion here outlines some important aspects of that crystal structure, some of which could apply to zzso molecules in zzso
