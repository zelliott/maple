The family zzso is one of the most diverse zzso of zzso from both a zzso and ecological point of zzso The family includes some of the very few cases of zzso reported in zzso in addition to bizarre zzso behaviors such as zzso and zzso and highly diverse web zzso zzso are one of the seven largest families in the zzso with about zzso species zzso However, this species diversity is currently grouped in half the number of zzso described for other zzso families of similar species zzso Recent zzso analyses of zzso data have provided an undeniable advance in identifying the closest relatives of the zzso as well as establishing the family's zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso remain an zzso of poorly defined zzso among which hypothesized relationships have yet to be examined zzso Providing a robust zzso structure for the zzso is an essential step towards the clarification of the zzso of the group and the interpretation of the evolution of the diverse traits found in the zzso Here we present results of a molecular zzso analysis of a broad zzso sample of the family (40 zzso in 33 of the 79 currently recognized zzso and representatives of nine additional zzso families, using approximately zzso corresponding to fragments of three nuclear genes zzso 3, zzso and zzso and two zzso genes zzso and zzso Several methods for incorporating zzso information into the zzso analysis are zzso and partition support for the different zzso and sensitivity of the results to different assumptions of the analysis are examined as zzso Our results marginally support zzso zzso although the zzso structure of the zzso is unstable and largely contradicts current zzso hypotheses based on zzso zzso Several groups of zzso receive strong support in most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a revised version of zzso and two zzso including all zzso without trace of a zzso and those without zzso zzso However, the zzso of these zzso are sensitive to data zzso and changes in the analysis zzso
