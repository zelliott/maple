The crystal structure of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso virus nuclear zzso 1 zzso which binds to and activates DNA replication from the zzso origin of replication in zzso virus, was solved at zzso A zzso zzso appears to bind DNA via two independent regions termed the core and the zzso zzso zzso The core zzso domain, which comprises both the zzso domain and a zzso predicted to bind the inner portion of the zzso DNA recognition element, was remarkably similar to the structure of the zzso zzso zzso despite a complete lack of sequence zzso The zzso zzso domain, only a portion of which is contained in the current structure, consists in part of an alpha zzso whose zzso contacts the outer regions of the zzso DNA recognition zzso
