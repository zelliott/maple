zzso modification of zzso in particular zzso is an important mechanism in the regulation of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso are zzso that remove zzso groups from the core zzso and play a key role in the repression of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which shows no sequence zzso to the zzso zzso identified from other zzso We have identified two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso by screening the expressed sequence tag zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative proteins of 246 and zzso zzso zzso and share zzso and zzso zzso acid identity to the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso was highly expressed in flowers and young zzso of zzso plants, whereas zzso was widely expressed in zzso leaves, flowers and young zzso zzso zzso zzso when directed to a promoter containing zzso sites as a zzso fusion zzso zzso of the extended zzso domain or the domain containing predicted zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the loss of gene repression activity, revealing the importance of both zzso to zzso zzso zzso plants were transformed with a gene construct zzso an zzso zzso in the zzso orientation driven by a strong zzso promoter, zzso zzso of zzso expression resulted in aborted seed development in transgenic zzso plants, suggesting that the zzso gene product was important in the zzso development of zzso zzso
