In the rust fungus zzso zzso the transition from the early stages of host plant invasion toward zzso growth is accompanied by the zzso of many genes zzso zzso in zzso induced zzso Two of them, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be highly transcribed in zzso and are zzso to genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Their functional identity was confirmed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso genes of other zzso that are completely suppressed by zzso zzso and zzso expression was not affected by the addition of zzso to rust zzso grown either in zzso or in zzso zzso analysis revealed decreasing amounts of zzso in extracts from spores, zzso and in zzso infection structures with increasing time after zzso zzso zzso of zzso leaves detected high zzso of zzso in zzso and only low amounts in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso of the zzso but not in the zzso and only at very low levels in zzso These data indicate that the zzso is an essential structure of the zzso rust zzso not only for zzso zzso but also for the zzso of zzso such as zzso
