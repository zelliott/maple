zzso sodium channels are critical for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in most excitable zzso zzso of zzso channels zzso an action potential, and fast zzso zzso zzso of the membrane by the outward zzso zzso Fast zzso is also the main zzso of the zzso period between successive electrical zzso Although the zzso sensor of domain IV zzso has been implicated in fast zzso it remains unclear whether the zzso of zzso alone is sufficient for fast zzso to zzso Here, we functionally neutralize each specific zzso sensor by mutating several critical zzso in the zzso segment to zzso We assess the individual role of each zzso domain in the zzso dependence and zzso of fast zzso upon its specific zzso We show that movement of the zzso zzso sensor is the zzso step for both development and recovery from fast zzso Our data suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso sensor alone is sufficient for fast zzso to occur, and that zzso of zzso before channel opening is the molecular mechanism for zzso zzso We propose a kinetic model of sodium channel gating that can account for our major findings over a wide zzso range by zzso that zzso movement is both necessary and sufficient for fast zzso
