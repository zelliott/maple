Using peptides to achieve the functional and structural mimicry of zzso especially those with biological activity or clear zzso applications, has great potential in overcoming difficulties associated with zzso or zzso physical zzso zzso techniques like zzso display can aid in the discovery of these peptides even if their mechanism of mimicry is not rationally zzso major focus of this field has been limited to developing zzso and sugar zzso However, the full zzso of these peptides has not yet been fully established as some bind to the target with a different mechanism than that of the natural zzso and some do not share all of the natural zzso binding zzso In this article, mimicry of zzso by zzso zzso peptides is reviewed and their potential in zzso and medical applications is zzso
