A zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains an open reading frame zzso with strong zzso to other known zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso has lower zzso to the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso than would be expected within the same zzso We have conducted a series of zzso expression studies evaluating the in zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporated the highest percentage of zzso zzso in the zzso when fermented in medium supplemented with zzso zzso as the sole carbon zzso When the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in the zzso host zzso a greater percentage of zzso zzso was observed in the zzso as compared to the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso when the zzso were fermented in medium supplemented with zzso zzso zzso for preference of zzso zzso demonstrated the flexibility of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes to zzso a zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso when the respective zzso were fermented in medium supplemented with zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are able to zzso a zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso zzso from zzso zzso lacks this ability and only produces a zzso zzso These observations suggest that the composition of the zzso from the zzso organisms does not necessarily reflect the inherent specificity of the zzso zzso
