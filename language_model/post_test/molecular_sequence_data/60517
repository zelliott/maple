zzso proteins are molecular zzso that regulate zzso zzso activity both in protein zzso assembly and zzso of protein zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso an alfalfa gene zzso a protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced under zzso treatment in both leaves and stems of adult zzso In the absence of heat shock zzso expression was zzso with the highest levels of zzso in roots and in zzso zzso High levels of transcript were also detected in zzso where active degradation of storage protein zzso In synchronized alfalfa zzso cells the zzso transcript was actively expressed and showed a zzso zzso during cell cycle with a zzso induction in zzso These findings suggest that zzso proteins play an active role in regulating normal cellular events like protein degradation, zzso and cell cycle zzso
