A zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso carrying zzso unable to grow with ammonium as the sole nitrogen source was isolated and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is inserted into a zzso zzso zzso zzso When tested on the roots of zzso zzso strain zzso was able to induce only small, slightly pink, ineffective zzso zzso However, under zzso conditions, strain zzso was unable to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unless zzso was added to the growth zzso These data and zzso observations indicate that the lack of zzso zzso affects the symbiotic behavior of zzso zzso
