Two novel zzso derivatives of zzso zzso growth zzso factor, zzso zzso have been zzso by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to a zzso chain zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso has been zzso linked at the zzso group of a zzso zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be slightly less active in zzso than both the unmodified zzso and zzso To assess whether the differences in the biological activity of the zzso zzso could be related to zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso the structure of these zzso derivatives has been worked out zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso and molecular zzso Secondary structure shifts, zzso exchange zzso temperature zzso of zzso zzso and zzso molecular models point out that zzso zzso and zzso share a remarkably similar pattern of secondary zzso All three compounds adopt an zzso zzso which spans the whole length of the zzso and which becomes increasingly rigid on going from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are enclosed in all the compounds considered into zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso either at zzso or zzso does not alter the tendency of the zzso to adopt a stable zzso zzso nor does it induce appreciable zzso mobility in the proximity of the zzso zzso No significant variation of the zzso organization of the zzso is observed among the three zzso zzso the different biological activities observed for the zzso zzso are not due to zzso effects, but are rather due to zzso hindrance zzso The relationship between the biological zzso of the zzso derivatives and zzso hindrance is discussed in terms of the zzso of interaction between zzso and its zzso
