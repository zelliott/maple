zzso is a common tumor of the central nervous system which displays zzso zzso In order to determine whether this zzso zzso is associated with distinct or overlapping genetic zzso we compared zzso at several zzso defined by zzso length zzso in tumor and normal zzso from patients with zzso In particular, we concentrated on zzso on zzso 22 and 10 because these zzso regions have previously been shown to be altered in the former in sporadic and familial zzso and in the latter as a late stage event in progression of another common brain zzso zzso We examined 38 tumors which were classified as benign, zzso or zzso by zzso criteria, invasive zzso or zzso We found that loss of zzso zzso for zzso on zzso 22 occurred in 5 of 15 benign, 2 of 2 zzso and 5 of 10 zzso zzso Similar zzso of zzso 10 were found in 0 of 20 benign, 1 of 2 zzso and 4 of 13 zzso zzso Among the zzso tumors, zzso for zzso on zzso 10 occurred in 2 of 4 zzso zzso tumors and in 2 of 4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was not observed for any of the 5 zzso tumors classified as zzso by invasive characteristics zzso zzso for zzso on zzso 22 accompanied (but was not restricted to) zzso loss of zzso on zzso zzso These data suggest that the progression of zzso from zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso may, in part, entail the loss of a tumor zzso zzso on zzso 22 early in the process and that this may be compounded by zzso of zzso 10, the zzso of which is associated with zzso signs of zzso
