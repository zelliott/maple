Four major proteins designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and characterized from the yam zzso zzso zzso The ratios of their yields were zzso zzso was a zzso zzso (20 zzso consisting of zzso zzso and was classified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accounting for 50% of the total zzso was the storage zzso commonly called zzso consisting of a zzso zzso On the basis of zzso acid zzso zzso was classified to be zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso having an apparent molecular mass of 120 zzso and composed of a zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was further composed of two zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso with each other with zzso sequence zzso They showed a sequence zzso to zzso B and zzso A from zzso zzso with 90 and zzso identity, respectively, and to zzso zzso from zzso zzso with about zzso zzso zzso had one zzso zzso bond located at zzso whereas zzso had one zzso zzso bond zzso in addition to the zzso zzso bond zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rabbit zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite the structural zzso between zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso zzso The zzso zzso itself revealed the full zzso activity of zzso indicating that zzso but not zzso was responsible for the zzso The zzso activity of zzso required zzso zzso and was exclusively inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso could not be classified into any known plant zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso to an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show any activity of zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso These results show that two of the four major proteins isolated from the yam zzso zzso zzso have unique zzso zzso
