We studied the DNA sequence of the entire coding region of zzso zzso in five cell lines established from human zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 human zzso cancer tumor tissue zzso one human zzso cell line zzso and zzso human zzso tissue zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and DNA sequence zzso A silent zzso at zzso 118 zzso for restriction zzso zzso in zzso 4 of the gene was detected in zzso zzso and zzso cells, and zzso This zzso was a zzso transition, that codes for the same zzso zzso zzso This transition converts a common zzso usage zzso to an zzso zzso usage zzso whereas frequency of use is reduced zzso This base change was associated with a zzso band shift on zzso zzso For the 29 zzso cancer zzso the same base change was observed in 15 tumor samples and was associated with the same band shift in zzso zzso zzso and tumor tissue specimens that did not contain the zzso transition, did not show the band shift in zzso zzso Our data suggest that this zzso at zzso 118 within the zzso zzso may exist in zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso
