The zzso database zzso zzso provides structural zzso for proteins from zzso zzso In August 2003 the database included data for 93 zzso The zzso stored in the database include zzso sequences from various sequence databases, zzso from zzso and zzso patterns from zzso and other predicted sequence features such as zzso regions and coiled zzso In addition to zzso at the sequence level, several zzso zzso zzso comparative analyses are available based on zzso domain zzso zzso zzso are available to the user via a web interface to the zzso Multiple points of entry are available so that a user is able to: zzso directly access zzso for a single protein sequence via zzso or zzso codes, zzso examine a sequence of interest chosen from a summary of zzso for a particular zzso or zzso access zzso zzso zzso comparative zzso
