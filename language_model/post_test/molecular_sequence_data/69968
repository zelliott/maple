zzso Two zzso and three zzso peptides were newly isolated from the anterior zzso zzso muscles zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by using the muscle as the zzso zzso zzso The structures of the two zzso peptides were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso response of the zzso to the first-time application of zzso or zzso was of considerable zzso The threshold zzso of the peptides were around zzso zzso However, the zzso response to the zzso application was far smaller than that to the first-time application in both zzso zzso the muscle showed zzso to the zzso zzso Two of the three zzso peptides were members of the zzso zzso zzso Their structures were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso as well as the other zzso previously identified, showed a potent zzso effect on zzso contraction of the zzso in response to repetitive electrical zzso The remaining one was an zzso zzso zzso having the sequence of zzso The zzso was less potent than the two zzso in zzso the contraction of the zzso
