zzso in a cell are universally zzso by zzso zzso contain their own zzso which specialize in the synthesis of a handful of proteins required for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and factors involved are poorly zzso An example is the DEAD box zzso widely known to participate in the zzso of bacterial and zzso zzso zzso as either zzso zzso or zzso zzso whose zzso counterparts remain completely zzso Here, we have identified the zzso zzso zzso DEAD box protein zzso as essential for large zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and fully assembled zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso zzso is matured and forms part of a large zzso assembly intermediate missing proteins zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso plays an essential role during the late stages of zzso assembly by promoting zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
