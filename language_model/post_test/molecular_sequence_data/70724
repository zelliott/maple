The zzso zzso zzso zzso found in the zzso of the common death zzso zzso zzso as with other snake zzso zzso displays zzso zzso It is unclear whether this zzso activity particular to some snake zzso zzso is a result of structural differences solely within the zzso sites or at a distant location upon the zzso We have predicted the three-dimensional structure of one of the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso using comparative protein modeling zzso Given the high degree of zzso and the availability of a high quality zzso structure, zzso was used as a molecular template to construct an all atom model of zzso The model was made using the program zzso and then refined with zzso zzso between the predicted structure of zzso and several X-ray structures of toxic and nontoxic zzso zzso has led to a testable zzso proposal of zzso zzso zzso involving the favorable binding to zzso molecules followed by zzso intrusion upon the target zzso The zzso zzso across the molecular surfaces of toxic and nontoxic zzso zzso were calculated zzso and it was found that the toxic zzso zzso possessed a charge distribution on the zzso surface not identified in the nontoxic zzso zzso Thus we have identified zzso potentially involved in the interaction of the zzso zzso with their zzso zzso Furthermore, the proposed zzso zzso recognition site is distant from the zzso site which upon binding of the zzso to the zzso zzso may enhance the zzso ability of the toxic zzso zzso on particular cell zzso
