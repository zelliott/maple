A newly described bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso has been obtained from zzso sea turtle zzso zzso The implication is that the zzso was infected during development in the egg, which is substantiated by other studies to be reported by us in the zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the greatest similarity to the identified species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and are zzso to human and sea turtle red blood cells zzso zzso is not the result of any zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sheep zzso while zzso zzso zzso does not, and unlike zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is not supported by zzso Many zzso species, especially zzso ones, are zzso to zzso compromised humans and it is possible that, in addition to sea zzso this zzso might also be a danger to susceptible humans who handle infected zzso The bacteria are available from zzso zzso Collection, University zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso Research Service Culture Collection, Peoria, zzso
