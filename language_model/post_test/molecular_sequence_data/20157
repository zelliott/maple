We report the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso sodium channel zzso zzso isolated from mature adult zzso The zzso DNA contains 35 deduced zzso with a predicted translation of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso of the gene is, however, complex, alternate zzso being evident for at least five optional zzso (or zzso zzso and two sets of mutually exclusive zzso zzso gene organization was also compared with that of other zzso within the zzso Several zzso used in zzso control (including zzso and synthetic zzso target the zzso Isolation of the sodium channel zzso for zzso zzso zzso allows prediction of likely single zzso zzso that may arise at zzso zzso to cause resistance to zzso zzso defines zzso zzso zzso usage in key areas of the zzso protein that are known (from previous studies in a range of different zzso zzso to have roles in altering zzso zzso and in generating zzso and zzso is a critical first step towards development of refined zzso control strategies and of new zzso for resistance zzso
