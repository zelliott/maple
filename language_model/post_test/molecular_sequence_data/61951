Six synthetic zzso zzso have been used to investigate the effect of the zzso zzso pattern on the stimulation of zzso zzso growth factor zzso induced zzso signaling and the biological significance of zzso trans zzso in the zzso zzso zzso It has been found that some molecules with a zzso pattern that does not contain the internal zzso zzso which has been proposed for high affinity for zzso stimulate zzso more efficiently than those with the structure of the regular region of zzso In contrast to regular region zzso in which the zzso groups are distributed on both sides of their zzso three-dimensional structures, the molecules containing this particular zzso pattern display the zzso groups only on one side of the zzso These results and the fact that these zzso do not promote zzso zzso according to zzso analysis, confirm the importance of zzso distribution in the zzso process and strongly suggest that zzso zzso is not a general and absolute requirement for biological zzso
