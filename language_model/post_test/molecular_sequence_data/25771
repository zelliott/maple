zzso were isolated and characterized respectively from the cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Pt A, and Pt zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each grown in zzso zzso Their structures were established by using zzso zzso and CD zzso These zzso are zzso and all but one zzso zzso possess at the zzso end of their zzso chain the same zzso that has been reported in zzso Pa from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dell, zzso Meyer, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso 24, zzso and zzso B 10 from zzso B10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Barnes, zzso zzso zzso zzso & Van der Helm, zzso (1981) zzso 20, zzso which is derived from zzso In zzso Pt this zzso is bound to a linear zzso chain zzso zzso which has its zzso end blocked by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso chain is also zzso zzso zzso and contains an unusual natural zzso acid which is the result of the zzso of 1 zzso of zzso and 1 zzso of zzso acid, forming a zzso zzso The zzso Pt differ only in zzso bound to the nitrogen on zzso of the zzso which is zzso acid in zzso Pt A, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso acid bound to the zzso by its zzso carbon atom in zzso Pt zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (the major zzso and zzso zzso are zzso respectively by zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has the same zzso as zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These zzso are very similar to zzso B 10, the zzso of zzso zzso they are linear peptides containing three zzso groups strongly zzso zzso and blocked at their zzso end by the zzso zzso and at their zzso end by zzso N zzso They differ therefore from other zzso such as those from zzso zzso zzso zzso which contain a partly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso
