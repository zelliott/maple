The zzso initiation factor zzso zzso a factor essential for zzso cell zzso is the only cellular protein containing the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is formed in a zzso modification that involves two sequential zzso steps zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By screening a zzso zzso zzso library for expression of zzso activity, we have cloned zzso as the gene zzso zzso and identified the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso effectively zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso along with zzso precursor and zzso zzso was required for overproduction of mature, zzso zzso in zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain with deletion of zzso contained only zzso but no zzso indicating that zzso was the single zzso gene in this zzso One highly zzso zzso zzso gene is found in a variety of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and structural analyses reveal that zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso consisting of eight tandem repeats of an zzso pair zzso zzso organized in a symmetrical zzso The predicted structure is unrelated to the zzso zzso type structures of the zzso and zzso zzso such as collagen zzso or zzso zzso However, metal coordination sites composed of four strictly zzso zzso sequences were identified, suggesting that zzso zzso have zzso evolved an zzso zzso zzso
