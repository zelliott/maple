DNA 1 components are zzso zzso DNA molecules associated with zzso zzso zzso that require the satellite zzso DNA beta to induce authentic disease symptoms in some zzso They have been shown to be present in the zzso beta complexes causing cotton leaf zzso disease zzso and zzso leaf zzso disease zzso in Pakistan as well as zzso yellow vein disease zzso in zzso We have cloned and zzso a further 17 DNA 1 molecules from a diverse range of plant species and geographical zzso The analysis shows that DNA 1 components are associated with the majority of zzso beta complexes, being absent from only two of the complexes zzso both of which have their origins in Far East zzso The sequences showed a high level of conservation as well as a common organization consisting of a single open reading frame zzso in the zzso sense, a region of sequence rich in zzso and a predicted hairpin zzso In zzso zzso there was some evidence of grouping of DNA 1 molecules according to geographic origin, but less evidence for grouping according to host plant zzso The possible origin and function of DNA 1 components are discussed in light of these zzso
