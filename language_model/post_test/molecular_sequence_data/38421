We have identified a new zzso transforming growth factor beta zzso member, zzso factor 15 zzso that is expressed at highest levels in adult zzso As determined by Northern analysis, the expression of zzso in liver was rapidly and dramatically zzso following various surgical and chemical treatments that cause acute liver injury and zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed distinct patterns of zzso zzso zzso that appeared to reflect the known patterns of zzso injury in each experimental zzso In addition, treatment of two zzso cell lines with either carbon zzso or heat shock induced zzso zzso zzso indicating that direct cellular injury can induce zzso expression in the absence of other cell types, such as inflammatory zzso In order to investigate the potential functions of zzso we created zzso zzso mice by gene zzso zzso zzso mice were viable and zzso Despite the dramatic regulation of zzso expression observed in the zzso and carbon zzso injury models, we found no differences in the injury responses between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest either that zzso does not have a regulatory role in liver injury and zzso or that zzso function within the liver is redundant with that of other signaling zzso
