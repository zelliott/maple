We have used zzso zzso zzso and X-ray zzso to zzso single zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain of the integral membrane protein zzso the zzso zzso of retinal zzso rod zzso zzso zzso zzso of the space group zzso zzso A and zzso zzso were produced from zzso partially zzso zzso To obtain zzso amounts of two-dimensional zzso which are required for X-ray zzso the yield of the zzso material was significantly increased by zzso of zzso in the presence of cholesterol zzso to 1:10 zzso and by adding polar organic zzso to the dialysis zzso The native zzso zzso zzso and zzso were then selectively zzso with mercury using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso The zzso did not affect the unit cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and native two-dimensional zzso zzso showed the characteristic zzso peak at zzso zzso which zzso to the dark state of zzso The zzso position of the mercury label was calculated at zzso A resolution from the intensity differences in the X-ray zzso patterns of zzso and native zzso using zzso difference methods and the phase information from electron zzso The label positions were in excellent agreement with the positions of zzso at the zzso end of zzso 3 and of zzso in the zzso zzso 8 recently obtained from three-dimensional zzso zzso Whereas these high-resolution zzso studies were performed under zzso conditions zzso zzso our results were obtained at room temperature with fully hydrated zzso and in the absence of zzso crystal zzso To study the structural changes of the zzso zzso involved in zzso and signal zzso our more zzso conditions offer important zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso is the first direct proof that the electron density on top of zzso 1 observed by zzso zzso is a part of the zzso zzso Our approach is of particular interest for investigations of other membrane zzso for which zzso zzso are not zzso zzso constraints from zzso labels at strategic sites enable the assignment of a position in the zzso acid sequence to features visible in a zzso density map and the study of zzso changes associated with different functional states of the membrane zzso
