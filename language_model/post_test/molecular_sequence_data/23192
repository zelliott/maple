zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cell fates are prominent effects of transforming growth zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso and zzso zzso leads to a loss of zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity is zzso by embryonic liver zzso zzso a zzso In mouse zzso zzso and in liver zzso cultures, loss of zzso function results in T zzso proliferation and absent zzso zzso zzso A similar zzso is seen in a number of zzso diseases with progressive loss of zzso zzso ducts and zzso However, the expression patterns of zzso or role of zzso in zzso and zzso liver diseases are not yet zzso 

We investigated the role of zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, chronic viral zzso and in zzso from mice deficient in zzso We generated zzso zzso mice and analyzed for chronic liver disease and zzso cancer zzso from 6 to 12 zzso zzso in zzso expression were consistently seen only in zzso zzso zzso expression was similarly zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso Further studies indicated that zzso zzso is correlated with zzso zzso of zzso in some zzso zzso Thirteen of 17 zzso zzso mice developed zzso fibrosis, zzso zzso with zzso in two zzso 

These results suggest that a compromised zzso and polarized trafficking of zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso as well as zzso
