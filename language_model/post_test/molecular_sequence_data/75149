zzso is a zzso zzso membrane zzso Analysis of zzso zzso demonstrates that this zzso plays a critical role in zzso cell zzso We have deduced zzso primary structure from the zzso sequence and examined its membrane zzso zzso is largely composed of 41 potentially zzso zzso Remarkably zzso repeats have been reported in both zzso and human, suggesting their general importance as a structural and/or functional zzso zzso zzso in zzso is associated with rough zzso zzso zzso membrane in an integral fashion, consistent with its extraction characteristics in zzso The resistance to zzso zzso of in zzso zzso and processed zzso suggests that it is primarily localized to the zzso leaflet of the zzso zzso These data are consistent with the proposal that zzso is involved in the zzso between zzso cell zzso
