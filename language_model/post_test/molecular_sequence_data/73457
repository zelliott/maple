The condition of a zzso zzso infected with three different zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso for over 10 years progressed to zzso Disease development in this animal was characterized by zzso a decline in zzso cells over the last 3 years; zzso an increase in viral loads in zzso zzso the presence of a virus, termed zzso which is zzso for zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso and zzso the presence of an opportunistic infection and blood zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of the envelope gene of zzso showed that the virus present in zzso was significantly divergent from all zzso viruses zzso or zzso zzso divergent at the zzso acid zzso and was suggestive of a large zzso Blood from zzso zzso into an zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid and sustained zzso decline in the latter animal, zzso with high plasma viral zzso These results show that zzso can induce AIDS in chimpanzees and suggest that long-term passage of zzso in chimpanzees can result in the development of a more zzso zzso
