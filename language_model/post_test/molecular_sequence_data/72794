The gene zzso the structural protein zzso of African zzso fever virus zzso has been mapped and zzso This zzso designated zzso is located in the zzso zzso E restriction zzso of the zzso zzso and is predicted to zzso a protein of 120 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is transcribed at late times during the viral replication zzso The zzso gene product has been expressed in zzso coli, zzso and used as an zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso recognized a protein in infected cell extracts with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso named zzso This zzso also detected protein zzso in zzso virus zzso zzso zzso is zzso late in infection and is located in viral zzso zzso analysis and zzso experiments have shown that protein zzso interacts with a protein that could zzso to the major structural protein zzso zzso protein zzso interacts with DNA in a zzso zzso It binds to both zzso and zzso zzso A possible role of protein zzso in the zzso of zzso DNA is zzso
