We have characterized a panel of 6 zzso zzso raised against human zzso zzso by Western zzso immune zzso and zzso and shown that zzso zzso and zzso disrupt zzso stress fibers and focal zzso and inhibit cell zzso when zzso into human zzso Using a series of chick zzso fusion proteins spanning the entire length of the zzso we have mapped the zzso recognized by these zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso bound to an zzso contained within zzso zzso a region which zzso an zzso binding site, and which shows zzso with the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso recognized by zzso was located within the zzso region of the protein zzso zzso which also contains an zzso binding site zzso to that in the zzso zzso protein zzso To investigate the possibility that zzso zzso zzso stress fibers by binding directly to the zzso zzso binding site, additional zzso fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso Fusion proteins containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso all zzso with zzso whereas zzso did not recognize the latter fusion zzso These results show that the zzso zzso site is distinct from the region recognized by the zzso zzso zzso raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important zzso site in the zzso zzso
