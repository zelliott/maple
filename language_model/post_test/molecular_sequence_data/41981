We report the characterization of the zzso gene which is a gene related to the zzso family but with a somewhat different structure than the zzso zzso Based on DNA sequence analysis of zzso zzso we have discovered that the zzso gene has 10 predicted zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso In a zzso search using zzso zzso we discovered that the zzso gene has a significant zzso with the zzso gene in zzso The zzso zzso gene is involved in cadmium resistance and is hypothesized to transport cadmium containing complexes from the zzso We have further characterized the zzso gene expression by northern analysis and discovered that it is expressed in a zzso manner, only at the zzso stage and not in ring zzso We have prepared a rabbit zzso to a zzso fusion protein expressing a portion of the zzso coding zzso In zzso analysis, this zzso zzso zzso and not ring zzso Western analysis reveals a protein of approximately 110 zzso which is consistent with the size of the predicted open reading frame based on DNA sequence zzso Based on this analysis and previous work, there is no evidence for a change in zzso expression in drug-resistant versus zzso zzso
