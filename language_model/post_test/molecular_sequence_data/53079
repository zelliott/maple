Experimental infection of cattle with bovine zzso virus zzso is characterized by persistent, low levels of virus replication in the absence of clinical zzso A virus zzso zzso zzso was developed to examine the role of zzso zzso in controlling virus replication in cattle zzso infected with the zzso isolate of zzso All animals developed zzso zzso but there was no correlation between zzso zzso and restriction of virus replication in zzso zzso infection did not induce zzso zzso zzso and there was no evidence for zzso variation through more than 4 years in zzso zzso comparisons among the zzso zzso virus and viruses isolated from infected animals identified only limited genetic variation during 4 years in zzso Moreover, there was no evidence that the observed variation was due to zzso zzso of genetic diversity in the virus stock used for zzso indicated a fairly homogeneous zzso In the absence of high levels of virus replication and overt clinical disease, there appeared to be little selection of virus zzso resulting in zzso and genetic stability of zzso during zzso persistent zzso
