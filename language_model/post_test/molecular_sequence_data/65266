zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso that donates electrons to all zzso zzso zzso which catalyze the zzso of steroids, fatty zzso and zzso zzso as well as metabolism of more than zzso of prescription zzso Although zzso in zzso have been identified in several disease states with zzso zzso effects of zzso on drug metabolism in the general population are zzso In this report, we performed a comprehensive study to correlate zzso zzso with zzso gene zzso zzso activity, and zzso drug zzso 

A set of human liver samples zzso were used in this zzso zzso zzso were identified by sequencing the zzso and surrounding zzso of the zzso gene and zzso levels were zzso by zzso DNA zzso zzso activity was zzso by measuring zzso c reduction in liver zzso and activities of 10 zzso zzso zzso were zzso by high performance liquid zzso methods with drugs known to be specific for each zzso 

Of the 34 zzso identified in this zzso four zzso changed an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso likely resulted in an alpha zzso change, possible disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction, and decreased zzso activity zzso and several zzso zzso zzso We also found an zzso zzso zzso which was associated with altered zzso but not zzso zzso 

zzso in the zzso gene can affect zzso and zzso drug zzso These results suggest that zzso has the potential to serve as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso
