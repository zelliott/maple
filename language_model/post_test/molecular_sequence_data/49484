zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was structurally modified by linking zzso and zzso fragments with several different zzso zzso of the middle region of zzso by a flexible zzso zzso resulted in greatly reduced binding affinity and reduction or complete loss of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso or zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso with approximately zzso increased zzso as compared to zzso zzso analysis by CD zzso of zzso fragments and zzso suggests a zzso region in the zzso zzso portion of zzso It was demonstrated that stabilization of this zzso zzso region by the introduction of zzso zzso favored binding and zzso of the zzso zzso Our results suggest an important contribution of a direct interaction of the first 14 zzso acids with the zzso zzso an appropriate relative orientation of zzso and zzso parts of zzso and the presence of zzso zzso to be essential for zzso
