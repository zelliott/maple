A zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso black smoker chimney zzso 760 zzso at the zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso The strain, designated zzso was a zzso shaped zzso about zzso to zzso zzso in zzso The cells were surrounded by a cell zzso The temperature for growth was between 55 degrees C and 93 degrees C with an optimum 80 degrees zzso The growth occurred from pH zzso to zzso and the optimum pH was zzso zzso required zzso to zzso zzso for growth and cell zzso was observed below zzso zzso zzso The strain was an zzso zzso requiring zzso sulfur zzso Organic zzso used included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Under the optimal conditions, zzso had a generation time of 50 zzso and could reach zzso of about zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was one of the common characteristics of zzso The zzso content of zzso was zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene by restriction zzso coincided with those of zzso zzso indicating that this strain belonged to the zzso zzso
