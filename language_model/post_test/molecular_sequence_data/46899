Crude zzso of the zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso activity under zzso pH zzso About zzso of this activity is inhibited by the zzso zzso which specifically zzso the activity of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso D and E or zzso We have zzso zzso responsible for this zzso activity by a zzso affinity zzso on zzso Analysis of the zzso fraction by zzso zzso gel zzso revealed six bands ranging from 35 to 52 zzso After zzso to zzso zzso zzso all bands were successfully subjected to zzso zzso On zzso gels, the zzso protein bands split into 19 spots which, after renewed zzso were identified as zzso zzso of the six proteins already zzso The zzso obtained for these proteins could be correlated to zzso DNA sequences determined in the course of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing zzso All these sequences were predicted to code for expressed proteins as collected in the zzso zzso Five of the six coding sequences identified in this study were found to contain the typical zzso consensus sequence of zzso zzso and displayed an overall zzso acid identity between 25 and zzso as compared to zzso zzso from other zzso In addition to the five zzso zzso detected at the protein level, we have identified the coding sequences for seven other zzso of this zzso family by a similarity search in the zzso DNA of zzso zzso which has recently been completely zzso
