Development of genetic varieties with improved zzso efficiency zzso is essential for sustainable zzso In this study, we developed a growth system for rice wherein N was the zzso factor, and identified zzso genes by a whole zzso zzso profiling zzso Some genes were selected to test their functionality in zzso by a transgenic zzso One such example with positive effects on zzso is an early zzso gene zzso This zzso gene responded significantly to both N induction and N zzso zzso rice plants zzso the zzso gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed zzso This zzso gene was expressed at high levels in roots of zzso zzso plants, and its protein product was localized in zzso zzso plants accumulated higher zzso of total zzso acids and total N in zzso A higher concentration of zzso acids in zzso sap was detected in transgenic plants, especially under N zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso is expressed in vascular zzso as well as in zzso and zzso This work demonstrates that zzso zzso coupled with a transgenic validation approach, is an effective strategy for gene zzso The knowledge gained from this study could be applied to other important zzso
