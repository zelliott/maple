zzso provide large surface areas and controlled surface functionality and structure, making them excellent scaffolds for zzso zzso A family of zzso has been zzso by zzso acid zzso to afford tailored zzso These particles are complementary to a zzso zzso zzso featuring zzso zzso functionality when in the zzso zzso The functional groups present on these zzso surfaces provide a tool to investigate the contribution of various zzso interactions at the zzso zzso The ability of these particles to enforce the folding of the zzso into an zzso was zzso demonstrating high zzso induction with particles featuring zzso zzso acids such as zzso or zzso and little or no zzso stabilization with zzso zzso acid zzso
