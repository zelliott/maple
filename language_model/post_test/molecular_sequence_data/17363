The zzso protein zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso against which a high frequency of T zzso has been detected in many melanoma zzso In this study we show that the in zzso degradation of a zzso encompassing zzso by zzso produces both the final zzso zzso and zzso extended zzso When human melanoma cells expressing the corresponding fragments were exposed to specific zzso those expressing the minimal zzso sequence were recognized more efficiently than those expressing the zzso extended zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we confirmed that the recognition of melanoma cells expressing an zzso extended intermediate of zzso is zzso We demonstrated that the inefficient zzso trimming of zzso extended zzso could offer a selective advantage for the preferred presentation of zzso peptides directly produced by the zzso These results imply that both the zzso and zzso zzso limit the availability of zzso peptides and that the efficiency of presentation may be affected by conditions that alter the ratio between fully and partially processed zzso zzso
