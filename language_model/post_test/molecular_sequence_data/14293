The role of the zzso accessory zzso protein in the zzso of zzso infection is currently poorly zzso Here, we performed comprehensive functional analyses of 50 zzso genes from 21 zzso zzso viral load, zzso zzso and 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso On average, zzso zzso from both groups were equally active in modulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell surface expression and in enhancing zzso zzso Thus, many zzso individuals efficiently control the virus in spite of efficient zzso zzso However, the potency of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso to suppress the zzso and zzso of T cells correlated with high numbers of zzso T cells in zzso zzso No such correlations were observed in zzso individuals with zzso viral zzso Further functional analyses showed that the zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell surface expression as well as the zzso of gamma zzso zzso by primary zzso T zzso Moreover, we identified a single naturally occurring zzso acid variation zzso in the core domain of zzso zzso that selectively zzso its ability to zzso zzso and results in functional properties highly reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the efficient zzso zzso of zzso and zzso help zzso zzso individuals to maintain normal zzso T cell zzso by preventing T cell zzso and by suppressing the induction of death receptors that may affect the functionality and survival of both zzso infected and zzso bystander zzso
