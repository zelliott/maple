zzso zzso zzso the zzso type 2 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from liver and kidney zzso zzso Nine clones were isolated containing identical coding and 3' untranslated zzso However, six of the clones contained a zzso stretch in the zzso untranslated region that was missing in the other three zzso zzso were designed to flank this region and the zzso chain reaction zzso was performed on zzso liver and adrenal zzso Two zzso products were amplified of the predicted molecular sizes and with the expected zzso zzso were then designed to amplify sequences encompassing this region from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso products demonstrated that the zzso stretch missing in some transcripts corresponded exactly to the second of three zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso untranslated region of this zzso is transcribed from at least three zzso and that the sequence of the second of these zzso is spliced out of some of the zzso zzso
