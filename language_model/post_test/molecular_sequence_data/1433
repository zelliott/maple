We previously reported a zzso approach to zzso alternative zzso patterns from zzso zzso full-length zzso clones and zzso zzso Although we predicted a large number of zzso zzso zzso the general mechanisms regulating alternative zzso were yet zzso In the present study, we compared alternative zzso and zzso zzso in terms of zzso strength and frequency of potential regulatory zzso These regulatory features were further compared among five different zzso Homo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Solid statistical zzso of our comparative analyses indicated that alternative zzso have zzso weaker zzso sites and zzso more potential regulatory sequences than zzso zzso Based on our zzso we propose a zzso model of alternative zzso mechanisms, which suggests that alternative zzso contain weak zzso sites regulated alternatively by potential regulatory sequences on the zzso
