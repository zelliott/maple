zzso zzso are crucial for general zzso function and for the zzso mechanisms of many zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso are currently defined by the presence of the zzso zzso motif and have been best characterized from humans and their zzso Though related to a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso are themselves zzso While studying this cell biologically zzso zzso zzso we identified 11 different zzso B zzso These were found to be zzso at comparable levels to common zzso zzso such as zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso structure examination of the zzso B zzso identified putative signal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and mature zzso of the zzso However, the zzso loop motif was either partially or entirely zzso Comparative zzso sequence zzso and zzso of zzso sequences from across the diversity of zzso demonstrated that absence of the zzso loop is not a feature exclusive to zzso but is relatively common, suggesting that the zzso zzso should no longer be used as the defining feature of the zzso B zzso Overall, this report identifies an abundant protein family in zzso and provides insight both into the evolution and zzso of zzso B zzso zzso
