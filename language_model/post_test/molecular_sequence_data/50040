Several members of the zzso growth factor zzso family lack signal zzso zzso sequences and are present only in trace amounts outside the zzso However, these proteins contain nuclear zzso signals zzso and accumulate in the cell zzso Our studies have shown that full length zzso zzso 1 zzso accumulates within the nuclear interior in parallel with zzso We tested the hypothesis that an zzso zzso domain zzso plays a role in zzso trafficking into the nuclear zzso With zzso destined for zzso fusion with the plasma membrane due to its SP, how the zzso may enter the nucleus is zzso zzso analysis identified that zzso has an zzso TM containing short stretches of zzso zzso acids zzso interrupted by polar zzso The zzso is the predicted zzso of the zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso of other single TM zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso trafficking in live cells was studied by zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso to enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso and Western zzso Nuclear entry of zzso was independent of zzso and was observed in rapidly zzso human zzso cells, in slower zzso zzso zzso and zzso bovine adrenal zzso cells zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso where the TM of zzso was replaced with that of zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso but was absent from the nucleus and zzso zzso zzso with zzso TM zzso replaced with polar zzso showed reduced association with zzso and increased zzso zzso with an increase in TM zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso thus demonstrating that the zzso TM does not function as a zzso To test whether zzso zzso provides a source of nuclear zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso was zzso resulting in zzso zzso protein zzso in the zzso and the cell zzso Our results indicate that an unstable association with cellular zzso is responsible for the release of zzso into the zzso and zzso zzso constitutes the source of the nuclear zzso
