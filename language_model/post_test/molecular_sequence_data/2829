zzso deletion zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus very late zzso gene promoter have been prepared and subjected to a transient expression zzso in infected zzso zzso zzso The control zzso contained the zzso zzso zzso reporter gene under the control of the zzso promoter, which was included in a 230 zzso sequence upstream from the zzso translation initiation zzso The control zzso also contained a segment of the zzso zzso downstream from the zzso zzso zzso activity was unaffected by zzso deletion to position zzso which lies about 11 zzso upstream from the zzso cap zzso However, deletion of 12 more zzso completely eliminated zzso promoter zzso Thus, the zzso border of the zzso promoter lies downstream from position zzso and the region between positions zzso and zzso contains an element that is important to promoter zzso This is the region that is zzso near the cap sites of late zzso zzso Our studies also show that transient expression of zzso under the control of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso is higher when zzso occurs prior to infection by zzso
