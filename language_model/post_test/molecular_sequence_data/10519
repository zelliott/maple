zzso and genetic evidence suggests that the zzso zzso activity of zzso is tightly regulated in zzso by a cellular factor binding to the zzso zzso 3 zzso domain of zzso We used the zzso zzso system to identify a zzso zzso whose protein product zzso interacts specifically with the zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso stress protein zzso is a member of a novel family of proteins with zzso activity implicated in the cellular response to zzso stress and in control of cell proliferation and zzso In a zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso of zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is not observed with other zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also zzso the in zzso zzso activity of zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso When zzso in zzso cells, zzso is localized to nucleus and zzso and zzso the zzso effect induced by zzso These observations suggest zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso in zzso
