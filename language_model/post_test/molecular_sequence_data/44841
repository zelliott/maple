In this report, we report the first expression of human vitamin zzso protein zzso a serum protein with several functions and a zzso structure, in zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso was expressed as a fusion partner of zzso zzso in order to facilitate proper folding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be fully functional with respect to vitamin D zzso zzso interaction with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, both natural zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso in a similar zzso zzso of an expression system for zzso in functional form provides opportunity to develop zzso and truncated zzso to study multiple zzso properties of this protein in relationship with its zzso
