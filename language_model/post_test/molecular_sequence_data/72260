zzso are complex zzso which share characteristics of zzso zzso zzso extra pair of zzso surrounding the zzso and zzso zzso Unlike zzso however, they contain a small zzso zzso the zzso in the zzso space between the inner and outer zzso membrane zzso These cellular characteristics led to the suggestion that zzso may have originated via a zzso zzso between a zzso host cell and a zzso red zzso a hypothesis supported by zzso zzso Here we characterized zzso of the nuclear genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that in zzso the classic Calvin cycle zzso zzso of zzso origin, zzso is absent and functionally replaced by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The derived zzso precursor contains a typical zzso zzso of complex structure and sequence signatures diagnostic for dual zzso specificity with zzso and zzso In addition to this novel zzso gene a zzso zzso gene of zzso function has been found in both zzso showing conspicuous sequence similarities to animal zzso The present findings support the hypothesis that the host cell component of zzso may be derived from a zzso rather than a zzso cell which lost its primary zzso after receiving a secondary zzso zzso cellular compartments of zzso origin may have been lost or replaced several times in zzso cell evolution, while the corresponding zzso genes zzso zzso were zzso thereby increasing the zzso potential of the nuclear zzso
