We have previously reported that zzso L zzso is present in zzso eggs of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a maternal zzso which suggests that zzso L is required for zzso Now we have identified an egg zzso with a molecular mass of 100 zzso that is extremely susceptible to zzso L zzso and which disappears rapidly as the zzso zzso We zzso this protein to zzso cloned its zzso and found that it contained a consensus sequence for the active site of zzso zzso In fact this protein showed zzso zzso activity, indicating that it is a novel zzso zzso The expression and subsequent disappearance of this zzso which we have named zzso zzso zzso zzso may be indispensable for zzso of zzso
