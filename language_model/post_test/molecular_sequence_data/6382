Since day to day sodium and water intake is more or less constant, the output by urinary sodium zzso is the key to maintain zzso fluid volume within zzso zzso To achieve this goal, the zzso ensure that most of the large quantities of filtered sodium are zzso a function that takes place in the zzso zzso the loop of zzso and the zzso zzso and then the zzso adjust the small amount of sodium that is zzso in urine in such a way that sodium balance is zzso This adjustment occurs in the collecting zzso Three groups of zzso sodium transport mechanisms have been identified in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso based on their different sensitivities to zzso and requirements for zzso and zzso 1) the zzso (or zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the thick ascending loop of zzso 2) the zzso (or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and 3) the zzso zzso channel in the collecting zzso The zzso of any one of these proteins by zzso results in increased sodium urinary zzso Recently, the use of molecular biology techniques, specially the functional expression cloning in zzso zzso zzso has led to the identification of zzso zzso members of the three groups of zzso transport zzso The present paper reviews the primary structure and some aspects of the relationship between structure and function of these zzso as well as the new protein families emerging from these zzso It also discusses the future implications of these discoveries on the physiology and zzso of kidney disease and sodium retaining zzso
