We investigate the folding behavior of protein sequences by zzso studying all sequences with a zzso compact lattice model through exhaustive zzso We get the zzso behavior of protein zzso Individual proteins remaining stable in the isolated native state may change their zzso when they zzso We observe the folding properties as the zzso interaction strength changes and find that the strength must be strong enough before the propagation of the most stable structures zzso
