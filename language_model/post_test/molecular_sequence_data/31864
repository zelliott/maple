In the current study, the relationship between the structure of the zzso human bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and its attachment activity toward zzso zzso cells was zzso This goal was accomplished by examining the comparative zzso activities of several truncated forms of zzso zzso Computer modeling of the various peptides was also performed to assess the role of secondary structure in zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso resulted in a more dramatic loss of zzso activity compared with the removal of either zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Although replacement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic loss of zzso activity, a zzso containing zzso zzso in place of zzso retained zzso of the parental zzso attachment zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso in particular the zzso zzso represents a second zzso site that zzso the zzso zzso zzso Computer modeling also suggested that a zzso encompassing zzso or zzso in some of the zzso peptides may facilitate its binding to zzso by increasing the exposure of the zzso This knowledge may be useful in the future design of zzso peptides which are more effective in promoting the attachment of zzso cells to implant surfaces in zzso
