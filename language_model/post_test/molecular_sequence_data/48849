A novel zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso chimney sample collected from the East Pacific Rise at zzso m depth in the zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and divided by zzso Growth was observed at temperatures between 60 zzso and 95 zzso with an optimum at 80 zzso The pH range for growth was between pH zzso and pH zzso with an optimum around pH zzso zzso zzso grew at salt zzso of zzso % zzso zzso with an optimum at 2 zzso The novel isolate grew by zzso or zzso zzso on a variety of organic zzso It was a zzso zzso growing zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso as carbon and energy sources and zzso and organic compounds as electron zzso it also grew on zzso and zzso Sulphur or zzso were required for growth and were reduced to hydrogen zzso The strain was resistant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso (all at 100 zzso zzso but was sensitive to zzso The zzso content of its zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis of the almost complete zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso of strain zzso showed that the novel isolate belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso values with the two closest relatives zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were below the threshold value of zzso On the basis of the zzso and zzso zzso we propose a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
