We demonstrate the efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso in finding multiple distinct global zzso and low-energy local zzso in the zzso zzso lattice protein zzso zzso the idea of zzso energy space in the zzso algorithm, our approach introduces an additional zzso scheme to divide the protein zzso space into local zzso of zzso This zzso design is very powerful in guiding the zzso to visit the zzso of unexplored local zzso An zzso zzso distance is used to merge the zzso of similar local zzso into one domain, which increases the diversity among identified zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso factor is introduced for long protein chains to facilitate jumps between zzso zzso on three benchmark protein sequences reveal that our approach is capable of finding multiple global zzso and hundreds of low-energy local zzso of great zzso
