Two newly identified human zzso zzso zzso and zzso are closely related zzso as are members of the other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso have been mapped to zzso zzso The present study shows that zzso was mapped to zzso zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso Moreover, two zzso complexes zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, it is possible that these zzso genes were linked to each other on an ancestral zzso and that the ancestral zzso segment was duplicated during zzso
