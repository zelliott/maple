The family of zzso zzso G zzso receptors zzso shows members in both zzso and zzso including the most ancestral zzso Although this suggests an early evolutionary origin of this family of zzso little is known about their diversity in zzso a major zzso of zzso zzso Based on sequences of zzso and insect zzso we have cloned and characterized a new typical zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso named zzso exhibits high degree of zzso acid sequence identity with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso belongs to the cluster of type B orphan zzso and suggests that zzso likely express the three zzso zzso identified previously in other zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is expressed mainly in the zzso zzso and only at moderate levels in other zzso and zzso zzso A possible involvement in the control of zzso changes occurring in zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
