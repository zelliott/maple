Members of the human zzso family regulate a diverse array of zzso and zzso zzso associated with essential biological processes such as zzso zzso zzso cell mobility, cellular zzso and zzso Most zzso are zzso and attain zzso zzso in the blood and zzso zzso However, a subset of the zzso zzso the zzso also resides zzso Using high zzso zzso zzso we identified a novel member of the human zzso gene family, zzso The gene mapped to the zzso cluster at zzso and resided between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso in zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso was expressed in many zzso including brain, bone zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on the presence of zzso and zzso at the zzso center of the zzso zzso appeared to be an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was confirmed because zzso zzso inhibited human zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate zzso for the zzso reactions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso encodes for a new functional member of the human zzso zzso
