The zzso gene codes for a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso derived from human zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso library was zzso Five zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso 1 zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso has an alternative zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso has an alternative 3' zzso Two additional zzso were identified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso 5 zzso appear to lack an zzso resulting in a shift in the open reading zzso Presumably, the 5 zzso originate from the same gene and result from alternative promoters and alternative zzso Each of the putative proteins zzso by these zzso messages has a leader sequence characteristic for a zzso zzso After removal of the leader zzso each of these proteins is predicted to consist of 1 or 2 out of 4 possible zzso zzso Two of these zzso have no recognizable zzso to known zzso The other 2 zzso have a distribution of zzso zzso characteristic for zzso a family of proteins with zzso zzso
