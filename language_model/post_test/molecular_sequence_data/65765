The zzso complex, composed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso is involved in zzso zzso of membrane zzso such as zzso precursor protein or zzso zzso occurs in multiple cellular zzso Here, zzso zzso containing targeting signals to the zzso zzso zzso network, zzso or plasma membrane have been shown to yield active zzso complexes with different activities and zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso complexes yielded the highest amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly zzso whereas zzso targeted zzso produced zzso zzso with a comparatively higher amount of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso play a role in zzso activity and zzso
