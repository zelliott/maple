Two types of genes zzso salmon zzso hormone zzso which is thought to act on both sexual maturation and zzso behavior, in zzso We characterized the two zzso genes zzso and zzso and their upstream regions in zzso zzso zzso zzso since such information is a prerequisite for molecular approaches to salmon zzso The two genes have similar zzso structures composed of four zzso and three zzso zzso analyses of the two genes showed that coding regions are highly zzso but upstream regions are zzso zzso In the upstream regions, only the zzso gene has a large zzso zzso which has been proposed to be involved in control of zzso via zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso gene is missing the large zzso zzso but has three distinct zzso in the upstream zzso These results may suggest divergent zzso regulatory mechanisms between the two zzso genes in zzso zzso The differences in the upstream regions of zzso genes in Atlantic salmon zzso zzso zzso salmon zzso zzso and zzso salmon are discussed with respect to the evolution of zzso genes in zzso zzso
