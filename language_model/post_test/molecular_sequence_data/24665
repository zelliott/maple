The folding free energy landscape of the zzso beta hairpin of protein G has been explored in this study with explicit zzso under periodic boundary condition and zzso force zzso A highly parallel replica exchange method that combines molecular dynamics zzso with a temperature exchange zzso Carlo process is used for sampling with the help of a new efficient zzso zzso The simulation results show that the zzso core and the beta strand hydrogen bond form at roughly the same zzso The free energy landscape with respect to various reaction coordinates is found to be rugged at low temperatures and becomes a smooth zzso landscape at about 360 zzso In contrast to some very recent studies, no significant zzso content has been found in our simulation at all temperatures zzso The beta hairpin population and zzso probability are in reasonable agreement with the experiment at biological temperature, but both zzso more slowly than the experiment with zzso
