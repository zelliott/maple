We have recently shown by deletion zzso analysis that the zzso first 18 zzso zzso acid zzso of rat liver zzso zzso I zzso are essential for zzso zzso and binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso To identify specific zzso involved in zzso binding and zzso of zzso we constructed two more deletion zzso zzso and zzso and three substitution zzso within the zzso first six zzso acid zzso zzso zzso lacking either the first six zzso zzso acid zzso or with a change of zzso acid 3 to zzso was expressed at zzso levels similar to wild type and had near wild type zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of these zzso zzso was reduced zzso and high affinity zzso binding was zzso A zzso zzso with a change of zzso 5 to zzso caused only partial loss of zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso with a change of zzso 6 to zzso had wild type zzso These results demonstrate that zzso acid 3 and zzso 5 are necessary for zzso binding and zzso of zzso by zzso but are not required for zzso
