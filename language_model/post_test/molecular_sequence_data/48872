The zzso properties of strain zzso a zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso were zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences identified this isolate as a member of the zzso zzso and closest to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarities between this isolate and any of the type strains of species of the zzso zzso were less than 95 zzso In addition, the absence of a single zzso and the zzso zzso zzso supported the differentiation of this isolate from the zzso zzso Here, we propose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to accommodate the zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
