zzso zzso of zzso zzso and particularly zzso from China and the Philippines, were examined at the molecular level for genetic zzso zzso from both nuclear and zzso zzso were selected as markers of evolutionary divergence and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were included in the study for comparison zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso repeat unit and sequence analysis of the second internal transcribed zzso region zzso within the zzso repeat and the zzso c zzso I zzso gene of the zzso zzso were zzso No zzso variation in zzso zzso was found in the zzso repeat and only very slight variation was detected within the zzso zzso A survey of the entire zzso using random amplified zzso DNA zzso analysis, again showed that Chinese and zzso zzso zzso are remarkably similar at the DNA sequence zzso We were thus unable to obtain direct molecular evidence in support of previous findings, particularly those based on zzso analysis, that a very high level of zzso variation exists in zzso zzso
