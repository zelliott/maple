zzso is a zzso protein occurring in zzso cardiac muscle, and zzso This zzso was found to be capable of enhancing cell junction formation and thought to play a key role in reorganization and stabilization of the zzso filament complex in zzso cells zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently a zzso claimed to be localized exclusively in the nucleus, however, with zzso acid sequence identical to zzso was reported zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso 75, zzso Here I present evidence that zzso exists simultaneously at the zzso and within the nucleus by generating zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso share identical zzso acid sequences as demonstrated by zzso library screening and DNA sequencing, they exhibit remarkably different zzso properties, reflecting the apparent different zzso nature of their differential cellular zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is characterized by a dynamic transport process which involves the gradual diminishing of nuclear materials relative to enhanced zzso of zzso to the zzso upon mature zzso Finally I demonstrate that zzso exists in two forms of different gene product: zzso and zzso These data argue strongly against the statement that zzso is an exclusive nuclear protein and support the notion that zzso is a zzso protein with more than one function as a consequence of its dual cellular zzso
