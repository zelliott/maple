We have isolated and zzso a novel human gene zzso of the zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso A zzso sequence of the gene coding for a zzso zzso acid protein was identified, representing a member of a putative new class zzso of the zzso zzso The gene is transcribed at least at low level in several different zzso with the highest levels being detected in adult heart and zzso Alternative zzso of zzso transcripts isolated from different zzso was observed at multiple positions of the zzso yielding an unusually complex variety of zzso zzso The structure of the zzso region of most zzso is compatible with expression of protein sequence zzso only in adult brain, whereas in other zzso the majority of transcripts code for truncated protein zzso The zzso gene extends over 14 zzso and is clustered together with the alpha 3 and the putative beta 4 zzso zzso zzso genes in an approximately zzso zzso in zzso band zzso located in the candidate regions of two different zzso zzso Based on features of conservation of protein zzso gene structure, and zzso organization of zzso zzso gene zzso we propose that the zzso and gamma zzso genes have a common zzso and that zzso zzso gene clusters in the human zzso have zzso by multiple zzso events of an ancestral gene cluster containing one each zzso zzso and zzso precursor zzso
