zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso through specific zzso of the zzso bonds over a temperature range up to 52 degrees zzso In order to identify and functionally analyze the zzso zzso the gene cluster containing zzso zzso and zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso acid sequences of zzso show zzso to those of the other known zzso genes and zzso zzso a zzso sequence zzso of zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso revealed that the gene products of zzso zzso and zzso oxidized zzso to zzso zzso zzso converted zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of a zzso zzso coli zzso harboring zzso converted zzso to zzso over a temperature range of zzso degrees C, indicating that the gene products of zzso were functional in the zzso The activities of zzso degradation at 50 degrees C and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 40 degrees C in resting cells of the zzso were approximately five times and twice, respectively, as high as those in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso coli cells also zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding genes from zzso zzso zzso were found to be completely identical to each other although the strains are genetically zzso
