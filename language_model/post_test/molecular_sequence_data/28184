We have isolated and zzso zzso clones zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was raised against a fusion protein zzso 185 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso the zzso protein to zzso sites associated with protein zzso in the zzso zzso protein is detected in the zzso active inner segment of the zzso but not in the zzso outer zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein are present in zzso although no protein is detected on protein zzso In contrast, the levels of both transcripts and protein increase in development, which zzso with the observed increase in total zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
