The availability of zzso acids in the brain is regulated by the zzso barrier zzso large neutral zzso acid zzso type 1 zzso zzso which is characterized by a high affinity zzso zzso for zzso large neutral zzso zzso The hypothesis that brain zzso acid transport activity can be altered with single zzso zzso was tested in the present studies with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The rabbit has a high zzso zzso large neutral zzso acid zzso as compared to the low zzso neutral zzso acid zzso at the human or rat zzso The rabbit zzso was cloned from a rabbit brain zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso human, and rat zzso revealed two radical zzso acid zzso that differ in the rabbit relative to the rat or human zzso The zzso zzso had a modest effect on the zzso and zzso of zzso transport via cloned rabbit zzso in zzso zzso but the zzso zzso reduced the zzso by zzso and the zzso by zzso zzso zzso transport of either zzso or zzso was nearly zzso when the double zzso zzso zzso was zzso These studies show that marked changes in the affinity and capacity of the zzso are caused by single zzso zzso and that zzso can be restored with a double zzso
