In recent years, the recognition sequence of the zzso zzso zzso protein has been identified for several bacterial zzso such as the zzso green zzso bacteria and zzso zzso or the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, the evolutionary relationship among these sequences and the proteins that recognize them has not been zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that zzso from a common bacterial zzso immediately before the zzso zzso Taking advantage of its intermediate position in the zzso tree, and in an effort to reconstruct the evolutionary history of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene has been isolated and its product zzso to identify its DNA recognition motif through zzso mobility zzso and zzso zzso After comparing the available zzso zzso sequences with the zzso zzso one, reported here, directed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sequence and zzso analyses of zzso proteins have revealed the existence of two independent evolutionary lanes for the zzso recognition motif that emerged from the zzso zzso one generating the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the other giving rise to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso ones, in a transitional step towards the current zzso zzso zzso The contrast between the results reported here and the zzso data available in the literature suggests that, some time after its emergence as a distinct bacterial class, the zzso lost its vertically received zzso zzso but received later through lateral gene transfer a new zzso gene belonging to either a zzso or a bacterial species closely related to this zzso This constitutes the first report based on experimental evidence of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of a gene governing such a complex regulatory network as the bacterial zzso zzso
