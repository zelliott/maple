zzso zzso in the prune gene of zzso zzso result in prune eye color due to reductions in red zzso zzso When one copy of the zzso of zzso zzso gene is present in a prune background, the animals zzso The cause of zzso of prune zzso remains zzso The zzso region characterized for the prune locus is zzso active and complex, with multiple and overlapping zzso Despite the zzso complexity of the zzso region of zzso accumulated evidence suggests that the prune locus is small and consists of a single zzso unit, since every prune zzso to date exhibits both prune eye color and zzso of prune zzso A functional prune product from a single, full-length zzso was identified in this study that can rescue both the eye zzso and zzso of prune zzso The DNA sequences of several zzso prune zzso along with Western zzso analysis of zzso proteins provide convincing evidence that prune zzso are zzso and that the zzso identified in this study encodes the only product of the prune zzso
