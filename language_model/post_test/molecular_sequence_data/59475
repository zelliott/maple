zzso coli contains at least two zzso proteins in its outer zzso One, termed zzso 43 zzso is the product of the zzso flu gene located at zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso and is responsible for colony form variation and for zzso in liquid zzso zzso is composed of two zzso zzso alpha 43 and beta 43 in zzso zzso alpha 43 zzso zzso zzso is surface zzso extends beyond the zzso chains of smooth zzso and is bound to the cell surface through an interaction with beta 43 zzso zzso zzso itself an zzso zzso outer membrane zzso alpha 43 shows limited zzso sequence zzso with certain zzso zzso and notable sequence zzso with zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, alpha 43 contains an zzso motif and a consensus sequence for an zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso of zzso is subject to zzso phase zzso liquid minimal zzso the rates of variation from zzso to zzso states and from zzso to zzso states being approximately zzso zzso zzso and approximately 1 zzso zzso zzso Phase switching of zzso is regulated by DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso being zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso acts as a zzso of zzso zzso by binding to zzso zzso sites in the regulatory region of the zzso In some zzso zzso may also undergo zzso zzso A 94 zzso zzso outer membrane zzso showing similar rates of phase variation, has additionally been detected for some zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso This 94 zzso protein can be zzso zzso in zzso with zzso to yield two zzso products with zzso and properties similar to those of alpha 43 and beta zzso zzso suggest that zzso may represent one of a family of zzso zzso zzso which are zzso as zzso zzso Some members may be processed and presented on the cell surface as zzso protein complexes (as zzso Others can remain zzso
