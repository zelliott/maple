In zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso including the genes involved in natural competence for DNA zzso are governed by the orphan zzso system zzso sensor zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso controls the expression of these genes is currently zzso Here, we report the involvement of a novel zzso factor termed zzso in this zzso zzso is a zzso protein that contains a large zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso domain, but lacks zzso signature zzso zzso of zzso abolished natural competence as well as zzso of the zzso gene zzso a zzso small zzso essential for competence gene zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso domain specifically bound to and activated zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were unaffected by disruption of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso coli recovered zzso of the zzso integrated zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso modulated by zzso during zzso zzso however, this regulation persisted when the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso The results presented here suggest that zzso operates a zzso zzso signal zzso cascade through zzso leading to zzso zzso of zzso
