To better understand the molecular genetic basis and genetic epidemiology of zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso genes of seven unrelated affected individuals from the United States, South America, Europe, and zzso We amplified all nine zzso gene zzso and zzso junctions from these individuals by zzso and screened the products for zzso by using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso We identified a single zzso gene zzso with abnormal zzso results for each affected individual, zzso this fragment, and, in each case, identified a zzso likely to cause zzso syndrome, including two nonsense zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso G to T and 71 + 1 G to zzso and two zzso zzso zzso del zzso and 230 del zzso or zzso Only one of these zzso zzso has been previously zzso Using zzso analysis, we determined that this zzso which involves a zzso zzso hot spot, likely arose as a separate event in this case, relative to the two prior reports of zzso Aside from zzso the zzso we identified are unique to patients from particular geographic zzso Ten zzso gene zzso have now been described in this zzso We conclude that zzso syndrome is caused by diverse zzso gene zzso including zzso zzso processing zzso zzso stop zzso and zzso zzso All the identified zzso involve the zzso domain of the zzso and most are unique to particular families or geographic zzso
