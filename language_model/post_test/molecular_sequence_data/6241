Eight zzso of zzso human tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced by another zzso acid, were prepared and their zzso effects in zzso mice bearing zzso A zzso were zzso The therapeutic zzso which mark the extent of the zzso effective dose, of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, whereas that of zzso was zzso Clearly, the zzso effective range of these zzso was extended along with a decrease in lethal zzso zzso did not produce zzso in the rat system, but zzso zzso In addition, zzso showed potent zzso activity zzso Volume zzso Rate zzso zzso on day 15 after zzso in 3 consecutive injection schedules despite the decreases in toxicity compared with zzso The relative zzso binding constant was determined using zzso cells zzso mainly zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso mainly zzso zzso zzso and revealed that the reduced toxicity of zzso in mice was due to the reduced binding to zzso zzso of zzso On the other hand, the ratio of the zzso zzso of zzso was 11 in comparison with the value of zzso for zzso suggesting that this zzso binds zzso to zzso The biological activities in human cell lines zzso and zzso zzso correlated well with the binding activities to each zzso in zzso zzso the much lower toxicity and the potent zzso activity of this zzso suggest that zzso merits further investigation in zzso and clinical zzso
