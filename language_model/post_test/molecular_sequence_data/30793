The mechanism by which zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and nuclear envelope breakdown during zzso was studied in a zzso egg extract in which the transition from zzso to zzso can be induced by the addition of zzso zzso expressed human nuclear zzso C, assembled in zzso into zzso showed increased zzso on specific sites in the extract in response to zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso of the zzso zzso We determined the sequences of the sites zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso The sequence data suggest that multiple protein zzso act on the zzso and zzso zzso II was identified as one potentially important zzso zzso
