In this review, the current understanding of zzso relationships of human zzso and of the zzso domain of its zzso is zzso Comprehensive zzso of human zzso combined with the three-dimensional structure of human zzso has ushered in a new era of understanding of how this complex hormone binds to and activates its zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso structures has proved invaluable in understanding how these human zzso hormones have zzso primary sequence that enables high affinity binding while zzso in zzso acids that provide zzso Moreover, by comparison of the structures of zzso and zzso human zzso and zzso human zzso there appears to be no influence of zzso upon backbone zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships of human zzso zzso have been zzso and new insights gained here as zzso These studies indicate that zzso binds to the central module of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso domain further revealed zzso changes affected by hormone binding and by the zzso zzso Further, secondary structure analysis of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso favors the zzso repeat motif model of the zzso hormone zzso Together, the studies indicate that there are only a few zzso that contribute to the overall energy of zzso zzso of a weak zzso complex between zzso and its zzso likely involves zzso of compatible surfaces and zzso hindrance by zzso followed by zzso change and formation of active site zzso salt zzso In this regard and in light of these new data, current models of the zzso hormone receptors may need to be zzso
