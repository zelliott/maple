We have developed and zzso tested a novel zzso approach for the de zzso design of zzso zzso A pair of computer programs has been written, the first of which creates a zzso zzso library for potential zzso zzso based on the backbone structure of the protein of zzso The second program uses a genetic zzso to globally zzso for a low energy core sequence and structure, using the custom zzso library as zzso Success of the programs in predicting the sequences of native proteins indicates that they should be effective tools for protein zzso Using these programs, we have designed and engineered several zzso of the zzso 434 zzso zzso containing five, seven, or eight sequence changes in the zzso zzso As controls, we have produced a zzso consisting of a randomly generated core with six sequence changes but equal volume relative to the native core and a zzso with a zzso core containing predominantly zzso zzso Two of the designs, including one with eight core sequence changes, have zzso zzso comparable to the native zzso whereas the third design and the minimalist protein are significantly zzso The randomly designed control is completely unfolded under equivalent zzso These results suggest that rational de zzso design of zzso zzso is zzso and stress the importance of specific packing interactions for the stability of zzso A surprising aspect of the results is that all of the zzso display highly cooperative zzso zzso zzso and reasonably dispersed zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso of a protein play a significant role in determining the uniqueness of the folded zzso
