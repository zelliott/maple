The objective of this work is to identify the elements of the human zzso zzso that are involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have found that an aromatic side chain at position 20 on the zzso portion of the human zzso zzso is required for efficient zzso The zzso human zzso zzso has a zzso at this zzso Replacement of the zzso with an aromatic zzso acid does not alter the rate constant of zzso whereas substitution with the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso or zzso reduces the zzso rate constant approximately zzso These results are consistent with similar studies of other zzso systems that have also documented the requirement for a zzso in rapid zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso 41 zzso acids from the zzso These two features distinguish the zzso zzso from the other membrane proteins for which the role of zzso in zzso has been zzso because these proteins have the opposite polarity with respect to the membrane and because the zzso are located closer to the membrane zzso 25 zzso zzso The zzso rate for the recycling of the zzso zzso is not altered by any of these zzso demonstrating that the aromatic zzso acid zzso signal is not required for the efficient zzso of zzso zzso
