We have recently described the production of large amounts zzso or zzso 65 grams per zzso of zzso active human alpha 1 zzso in the milk of transgenic sheep zzso et zzso zzso Here, we describe in more detail the expression of the human protein in the milk of these animals throughout the zzso zzso Human alpha 1 zzso is also found at much lower levels in the plasma of transgenic zzso before, during and after zzso It is also detected in male plasma at very low zzso We have previously shown human alpha 1 zzso zzso from transgenic sheep milk to be indistinguishable from commercially available human plasma derived alpha 1 zzso in terms of gross sugar content and in zzso zzso Here we extend this comparison to more detailed analyses of zzso state, zzso zzso zzso value, and molecular weight determination by mass zzso
