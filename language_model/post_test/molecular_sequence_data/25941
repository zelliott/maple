The zzso acid sequence of rat zzso protein zzso which has been reported to form part of the binding site for initiation factors, was deduced from the sequence of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso contains 243 zzso acids and has a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso are zzso There are 62 identities in 63 consecutive zzso in the zzso zzso acid acid sequence of rat zzso and in a partial sequence of zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso to zzso of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 8-10 copies of the zzso zzso The zzso for the protein is about 950 zzso in zzso
