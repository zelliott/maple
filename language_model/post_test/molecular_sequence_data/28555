The zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso of the signal recognition zzso is the last known class III gene of zzso zzso that remains to be characterized with respect to its mode of zzso and promoter zzso We show here that zzso represents a unique case of a zzso class III gene in which zzso promoter elements (the zzso A- and zzso corresponding to the D and zzso arms of mature zzso have been adapted to a structurally different small zzso without losing their zzso zzso In fact, despite the presence of an upstream zzso zzso box, zzso zzso strictly depends on the presence of functional, albeit quite unusual, A- and zzso and requires all the zzso components of the zzso zzso III zzso apparatus, including zzso zzso zzso was found to protect from zzso I zzso an zzso region zzso the A- and zzso zzso zzso completely compromised zzso binding and zzso capacity in zzso and in zzso An zzso zzso in the zzso selectively affected zzso binding to this promoter element but resulted in much more dramatic impairment of in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso competition and zzso disruption experiments showed that this stronger in zzso zzso is due to a reduced ability of zzso zzso to compete with other genes for zzso binding and to counteract the assembly of repressive zzso structures through zzso zzso A kinetic analysis further revealed that facilitated zzso zzso III recycling, far from being restricted to typical small sized class III templates, also takes place on the zzso zzso zzso the longest known class III zzso zzso
