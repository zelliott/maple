zzso cloning has revealed the primary structure of a number of zzso zzso The organization and topography of these proteins predicted to have seven zzso zzso zzso in contrast, have not been zzso zzso were prepared against 11 peptides corresponding to each of the zzso sequences of the zzso beta zzso zzso Each of the zzso zzso displayed zzso for its synthetic zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso (Mr zzso on blots of cell zzso and of zzso zzso All but three zzso zzso also displayed zzso toward human zzso and rat fat cell beta zzso zzso reflecting the level of sequence identity that exists between the two zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with an expression zzso harboring the zzso zzso the zzso beta zzso zzso provided a cell type with 2 million zzso suitable for in zzso zzso of the sequences used as zzso zzso zzso of intact and zzso cells performed with these zzso zzso zzso permitted the assignment of the general topography of each of the zzso sequences of this zzso zzso The results support the zzso value of zzso analysis for one class of membrane proteins with multiple zzso zzso
