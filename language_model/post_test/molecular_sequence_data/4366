The previous study of the 25 zzso zzso zzso genes of influenza C viruses identified four discrete lineages represented by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we compared the M gene sequence among the 24 viruses isolated between 1964 and zzso A zzso analysis showed that these genes have evolved into three distinct zzso zzso I included most of viruses with the HE genes of zzso zzso The zzso members of lineage II were viruses having the HE genes of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso III contained only zzso zzso positions of several strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso were different between the M and HE gene trees, suggesting that they are zzso Furthermore, zzso relationships between zzso and zzso viruses were much closer for the M gene than the HE zzso raising the possibility that these two virus groups are genetically related by a zzso zzso zzso changes in the M genes occurred at about zzso positions with a uniform distribution throughout the zzso However, the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein zzso was zzso almost completely among the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the second protein zzso zzso by M gene was also highly zzso but was more divergent than the zzso protein zzso suggesting that the two M gene products are evolving differently in response to selective pressures or structural and functional zzso
