zzso collagen zzso which are characterized by their thin, uniform zzso are formed of a zzso system of three collagen types zzso IX, and zzso and interacting zzso We have used a genetic approach to test whether the proper assembly of this zzso structure was altered by zzso of one of its normal zzso Here we show that in transgenic mice in which the normal mouse alpha zzso collagen is zzso thick abnormal collagen zzso are zzso Mice that showed the highest expression of the zzso also displayed a larger proportion of abnormal zzso and died at zzso We propose that an imbalance among the constituents of the cartilage collagen zzso zzso the mechanism that controls their zzso The results show the zzso of the transgenic mice system to studies of complex zzso protein zzso in intact zzso
