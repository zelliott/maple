We have cloned and determined the entire zzso sequence of zzso corresponding to the putative alpha zzso of the human and rat mast cell zzso zzso zzso Both human and rat zzso zzso an zzso signal zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso by discrete zzso a zzso zzso region, and a positively charged zzso zzso The human and rat alpha zzso share an overall zzso with one another and the zzso gene family, suggesting that they arose from a common ancestral gene and continue to share structural zzso with their zzso In addition, the rat gene is transcribed into at least three distinct forms, each of which yields a somewhat different coding zzso
