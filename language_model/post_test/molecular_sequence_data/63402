zzso recover their zzso faster than rods after zzso It has been suggested that a higher rate zzso of zzso the zzso for visual zzso is required for cones to continuously function under bright light zzso zzso is the zzso catalyzing a key step in zzso of zzso The present study investigated whether zzso in a zzso species is more efficient in its zzso activity than that from zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity zzso showed that zzso activity in the chicken retinal zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher than in the bovine zzso after zzso by zzso protein zzso Similar to that of human and zzso the zzso activity in chicken zzso was blocked by two specific zzso of zzso retinal zzso indicating that chicken zzso also uses zzso zzso as the direct zzso To exclude the possibility that the higher zzso activity in the chicken zzso could arise from another unknown zzso we expressed chicken and human zzso using the zzso system in a stable cell line expressing zzso retinal zzso Under the same conditions, zzso activity of zzso chicken zzso was zzso higher than that of zzso human zzso after zzso by zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso from the zzso chicken zzso possesses significantly higher specific zzso zzso activity, when compared with zzso from zzso species, consistent with the faster zzso rates of visual zzso in zzso zzso
