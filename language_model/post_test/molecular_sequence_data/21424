Controlling cell zzso gene expression is key to stem cell zzso tissue zzso and cancer zzso To date, zzso zzso factors recognize the information zzso in specific DNA zzso zzso proteins undergo zzso modifications and form complexes that zzso a second layer of information that determines zzso gene zzso Here, we employ a novel zzso approach that exploits a specific zzso modification to reactivate silenced zzso in human zzso We used the human zzso zzso protein and zzso from other species to construct modular synthetic zzso factors, called zzso that recognize the repressive zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso signal and switch silenced genes to an active zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells leads to increased zzso of the zzso locus zzso zzso and other zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso manner, a switch to a zzso zzso and reduced cell zzso These results indicate that silenced zzso regulators can be zzso by a synthetic zzso factor that interacts with zzso rather than DNA, resulting in an altered cell zzso As such, our work extends the flexibility of zzso factor engineering and is the first example of zzso synthetic zzso factor zzso
