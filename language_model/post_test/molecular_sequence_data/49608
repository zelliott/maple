Compared to rice, wheat exhibits characteristic growth habits and contains complex zzso zzso To assess global changes in gene expression patterns in the wheat life cycle, we conducted large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags zzso in common zzso Ten wheat zzso were used to construct zzso zzso crown and root from zzso zzso zzso from early and late flowering zzso spike at the zzso stage, heading date and flowering date; zzso at the heading date; and seeds at 10 and 30 days zzso Several thousand colonies were randomly selected from each of these 10 zzso libraries and zzso from both zzso and 3' zzso zzso a total of 116 232 sequences were accumulated and classified into 25 zzso zzso based on sequence zzso By computing abundantly expressed zzso correlated expression patterns of genes across the zzso were zzso Furthermore, relationships of gene expression profiles among the 10 wheat zzso were zzso from global gene expression zzso Genes with similar functions were grouped with one another by zzso gene expression zzso This technique might enable zzso of the functions of anonymous zzso zzso analysis of zzso data that is analogous to the zzso experiments may offer new approaches to functional zzso of zzso
