zzso in the mouse is embryonic lethal partly because of imprinted genes that are expressed only from the paternal zzso In a systematic screen using zzso zzso between zzso from normal and zzso zzso we initially identified two apparently novel imprinted zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed gene 1) or zzso the first imprinted gene found on the mouse zzso 6, may contribute to the zzso of zzso and of zzso with a maternal zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in zzso zzso and belongs to the zzso zzso fold zzso A similar approach with zzso can be used to identify imprinted genes that are expressed from the maternal zzso zzso
