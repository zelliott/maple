zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso of zzso complexes that are targeted to specific promoters through their interaction with different zzso zzso causing zzso of the corresponding zzso This study describes the isolation of zzso a novel, zzso active class II zzso zzso zzso and the analysis of its role in embryonic zzso In early zzso zzso is expressed in several zzso zzso ubiquitous expression becomes localized to an anterior domain, then zzso into a zzso and finally into a zzso zzso zzso of zzso during early zzso by zzso zzso interference led to zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression in gap and zzso gene zzso demonstrated that hunchback, zzso and giant zzso while zzso suppresses zzso zzso These data revealed zzso involvement in the zzso regulatory zzso and suggested complex zzso regulation as a potential mechanism that controls its zzso
