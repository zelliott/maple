zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that zzso to the outer segments zzso of rods and zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso 16 zzso acids of zzso zzso membrane association as well as cone and rod zzso targeting on a linked green fluorescent zzso zzso association in zzso zzso cells and in transgenic zzso zzso is zzso by fatty zzso at one or more zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso In bovine zzso native zzso is similarly zzso and zzso of this linkage releases the protein from the zzso zzso zzso zzso requires both membrane association and the zzso zzso zzso at the extreme C zzso which closely resembles the zzso sequence that targets zzso to the zzso Taken together, these data imply that the zzso zzso sequence is a general zzso zzso signal that can function in the context of both integral and peripheral membrane zzso This strategy for zzso zzso resembles those used for protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in each case, a short zzso or zzso sequence is shared among structurally diverse proteins that are targeted to the same zzso zzso
