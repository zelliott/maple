A continuing theme of our laboratory has been the understanding of human DNA zzso at the structural zzso We have zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and alpha from human zzso zzso zzso to these zzso were isolated and used as tools to study their zzso zzso These studies have shown that while DNA zzso zzso zzso and alpha are discrete zzso they must share common structural features by virtue of the ability of several of our zzso zzso to exhibit zzso A second approach we have taken is the molecular cloning of human DNA zzso delta and zzso We have cloned the DNA zzso delta zzso and this has allowed us to compare its primary structure to those of human zzso alpha and other members of this zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignments have revealed that human DNA zzso delta is also closely related to the zzso virus family of DNA zzso In zzso zzso has shown that the human DNA zzso delta gene is localized to zzso 19 zzso In order to further determine the functional regions of the DNA zzso delta structure we are currently expressing human pol delta in zzso coli and zzso zzso Other work in our laboratory is directed toward examining the expression of DNA zzso delta during the cell zzso
