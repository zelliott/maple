zzso constrained zzso acid zzso that strongly zzso specific backbone zzso may be used to zzso and stabilize specific secondary structures in designed zzso An overview of the use of zzso zzso acids in stabilizing zzso structures in synthetic peptides is zzso with an emphasis on work carried out in the authors zzso zzso acid zzso and related zzso zzso facilitate stable zzso formation in zzso as exemplified by a large number of crystal structure zzso in the solid zzso The ability to design zzso rigid zzso zzso has been exploited in attempts to design structurally well characterized zzso zzso using potential zzso linking zzso zzso design has been approached by exploiting the tendency of zzso zzso to zzso hairpin zzso The use of zzso zzso segments has resulted in the generation of several well characterized zzso structures, including the zzso observation of zzso in a synthetic zzso zzso zzso of this approach to three stranded zzso and larger structures containing multiple zzso segments appear readily zzso
