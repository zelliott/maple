zzso of zzso to cell surfaces has been shown to mediate a number of biological activities including enhancement of zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso Several zzso binding proteins have been proposed as candidate receptors for these zzso The zzso human zzso membrane zzso termed zzso has recently been zzso This zzso is believed to play a role in the enhancement of zzso in zzso and zzso and its expression has been shown to be restricted to cells of the zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso Here we report the isolation and zzso characterization of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the published human sequence were used to amplify a region of the zzso zzso spanning from the zzso recognition domain to the fourth zzso growth factor zzso zzso This zzso was used as a probe to isolate the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted primary protein sequence displayed zzso identity with the human zzso All the major structural zzso were zzso between the two zzso The coding sequence of the zzso gene was contained within two zzso separated by a small zzso of approximately 250 zzso The structure of the human gene was found to be similar, with the position of the zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso will facilitate further investigation of the zzso function of this zzso
