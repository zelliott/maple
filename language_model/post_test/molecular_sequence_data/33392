zzso diseases are often defined zzso by the presence of protein zzso These zzso including zzso plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso result from the abnormal zzso and processing of zzso and may ultimately lead to zzso dysfunction and cell zzso To date, conventional zzso studies have revealed abundant core components in protein zzso However, rapidly improving zzso technologies offer opportunities to revisit zzso zzso zzso and to identify less abundant but potentially important functional molecules that participate in zzso The purpose of this study was to establish a zzso strategy for the profiling of neurodegenerative disease zzso for zzso changes in protein zzso Using high resolution liquid zzso coupled with tandem mass zzso zzso we analyzed zzso frontal zzso samples from zzso and unaffected control zzso In addition, we analyzed samples from zzso zzso zzso zzso cases to identify zzso changes not present in other neurodegenerative zzso We used a zzso zzso technique to compare the abundance of identified peptides in the samples based on extracted zzso current zzso of their corresponding zzso Of the 512 identified zzso zzso demonstrated significant changes in 81 zzso zzso Following additional manual zzso 11 proteins were accepted with high confidence as increased in zzso compared to control and zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso all well-established zzso zzso In addition, we identified and validated the presence of zzso zzso 15, zzso B, and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Our results provide further evidence for the capacity of zzso applications to identify zzso sets of zzso proteins in zzso to enhance our understanding of disease zzso and to deliver new candidates for the development of effective therapies for this, and other, devastating neurodegenerative zzso
