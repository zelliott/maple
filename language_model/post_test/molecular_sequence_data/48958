The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso tumors, including zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso is zzso in both zzso cells and zzso zzso Introduction of zzso small interfering zzso zzso into zzso cells eliminated zzso zzso zzso itself zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by binding to the negative regulator zzso causing a cell zzso nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso C zzso contains sequences similar to the zzso domain of zzso zzso of this region resulted in a zzso zzso that failed to zzso zzso or stabilize zzso The importance of this zzso to zzso cell proliferation was highlighted by the observation that zzso but not zzso zzso stimulates entry into S zzso zzso of zzso can therefore be a source of zzso zzso in human zzso
