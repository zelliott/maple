A clone zzso coding for an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso from a zzso library in zzso zzso using a pool of 23 zzso from zzso zzso The clone contained an insert of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of 133 zzso acids zzso and a putative signal zzso of 31 zzso giving a deduced mature processed protein of 102 zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The expressed zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso was a major zzso since it reacted with zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso subjects zzso It was shown to be a new zzso since zzso the zzso acid sequence zzso with the already reported zzso zzso Par zzso zzso was zzso and zzso there was no zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of the specific zzso for 10-14 zzso native zzso and zzso of zzso from zzso patients with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fully abolished the zzso recognition of the 10-14 zzso native zzso region, suggesting that these two zzso contributed to the zzso
