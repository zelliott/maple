The major zzso complex zzso contains genes which zzso zzso to numerous diseases and must be important in zzso zzso In some instances, genes have been mapped to the region between human zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso but precise zzso has proven difficult especially since this region is subject to zzso zzso and zzso zzso computer similarity searches and coding prediction programs, we have identified several potential coding sequences between zzso and zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso 18, are similar to members of zzso gene families that are located in other regions of the zzso The identification of numerous fragmented and intact zzso zzso zzso zzso and THE zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes suggests that these zzso are involved in the zzso zzso The evaluation of candidate genes for disease zzso within the zzso is complicated by their similarity to other members of zzso gene zzso The determination of sequence differences within and between species provides a strategy with which to investigate the candidate genes between zzso and zzso
