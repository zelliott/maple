zzso zzso recognition is thought to make possible the diverse set of functional outcomes associated with zzso Thus far, zzso insight into this selectivity has been largely limited to single zzso that zzso bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here, we propose a zzso zzso zzso in which multiple zzso zzso are arranged in space so that simultaneous, zzso interactions are optimum with one zzso linkage but zzso or impossible with other zzso zzso and zzso Our model is human zzso which contains tandem zzso interacting motifs zzso that bind to zzso at DNA zzso zzso We show how the sequence between the zzso zzso positions the zzso for efficient avid binding across a single zzso linkage, thus defining zzso We also demonstrate zzso zzso in a different zzso zzso Using tandem zzso we establish the general principles governing zzso linkage selectivity and affinity in zzso zzso zzso
