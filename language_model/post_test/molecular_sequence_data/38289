In this report we describe a zzso element within the core promoter of the zzso gene specifying the polio virus zzso that is bound by the nuclear respiratory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I footprint analysis identified a nuclear protein binding site from zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso of the zzso zzso which we have called foot print IV zzso zzso scanning zzso revealed that a tandem repeat zzso zzso located within zzso was essential for the zzso activity of the zzso core zzso The results of the zzso mobility shift zzso experiments suggested that identical zzso binding activities were present in a variety of nuclear extracts and that the tandem repeat was essential for zzso A zzso screen was then carried out using zzso as bait to clone the zzso of the zzso binding zzso The sequences of the zzso that were cloned from the screen were identical to zzso a result that was confirmed by further zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso of full-length zzso and a zzso form of zzso modulated reporter gene expression driven by the core zzso zzso zzso is the first gene shown to be regulated by zzso that possesses an expression profile during zzso zzso with this zzso proposed role in the development of the zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso which has been shown by others to be expressed during zzso in animal systems, may be involved in regulating the expression of zzso at specific stages of central nervous system zzso
