Previous studies zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso 38, zzso using split receptors and zzso zzso have shown that native zzso 140 and 222 on the zzso side of zzso segments zzso 3 and 5 of zzso respectively, can zzso to each other upon treatment with the zzso zzso In this paper we show that although the zzso zzso does not affect the spectral properties of zzso it completely and zzso zzso the ability of the zzso to activate zzso Following on this lead we further investigate the zzso region of zzso and zzso and identify three additional pairs of zzso that when changed to zzso are capable of forming zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are able to form without addition of the zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso none of the additional zzso affect the spectral properties of zzso Also like the zzso bond, the zzso zzso completely and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso have no effect on the ability of zzso to activate zzso The pattern of zzso observed in zzso and zzso scans of the protein is consistent with zzso secondary structure in zzso from 130 to 142 and in zzso from 218 to zzso
