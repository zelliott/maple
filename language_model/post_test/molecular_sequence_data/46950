Many nuclear receptors are capable of recognizing similar DNA zzso The molecular zzso underlying the functional zzso of these receptors (in regulating the expression of their native target zzso is a very important issue that remains poorly zzso Here we report the cloning and analysis of a novel nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibits a distinct zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso shows that zzso zzso to the cell zzso The zzso zzso and/or in zzso binding zzso indicated that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso in a zzso fashion but does not bind to the zzso acid zzso vitamin D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso but has little effect on other examined nuclear zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that a novel zzso domain in zzso plays an essential role in its specific interaction with zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso zzso motif plays a minor role in allowing optimum zzso Computer modeling and subsequent experimental analysis suggested that the zzso domain of zzso directly mediates interaction with zzso receptors through an zzso (a zzso of the zzso zzso module while the other part of the zzso protein may still play a role in zzso its zzso zzso Identification of a zzso with such a unique zzso specificity may provide new insight into the molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as the functional zzso of nuclear zzso
