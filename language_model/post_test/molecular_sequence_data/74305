The enteric nervous system zzso derives from migratory neural crest cells that colonize the developing gut tube, giving rise to an integrated network of zzso and zzso cells, which together regulate important aspects of gut function, including zzso the smooth muscle zzso of the gut zzso The absence of enteric zzso in portions of the gut zzso is the defining feature of zzso disease zzso and has been zzso in a number of mouse zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso account for over half of familial cases of zzso and mice zzso for zzso exhibit zzso zzso exists in two main zzso zzso and zzso and studies in mouse have shown that zzso is sufficient to allow normal development of the zzso In the last several years, zzso has emerged as a model of zzso zzso development, having been supported by a number of demonstrations of conservation of gene function between zzso mouse and zzso In this study we further zzso the potential similarities and differences between zzso development in zzso mouse and zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is required in a zzso manner to regulate colonization of the gut by neural crest zzso as in zzso Additionally, we show that as in mouse and human, zzso zzso is produced as two zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, we show that, as in zzso the zzso zzso is sufficient to support colonization of the gut by enteric zzso Finally, we identify zzso zzso of genes previously identified to be expressed in the mouse zzso and demonstrate that these genes are expressed in the developing zzso zzso thereby identifying useful zzso markers in this model zzso These studies reveal that the similarities between gene expression and gene function across zzso species is more extensive than previously zzso thus supporting the use of zzso as a general model for zzso zzso development and the use of zzso genetic screens as a way to identify candidate genes zzso in zzso zzso
