zzso zzso zzso predominantly to zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the role of this zzso we generated knockout and zzso zzso zzso cells displayed 50% reduced zzso zzso and a moderate zzso zzso but zzso was zzso zzso examination of the zzso zzso revealed defective zzso of early zzso and reduced zzso of acid zzso in the presence of zzso The distribution of the zzso marker zzso was altered, with a high proportion of cells showing a diffuse zzso pattern in contrast to the zzso strain, where few intensely stained zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and development appeared largely zzso In a zzso system, zzso stimulates zzso zzso suggesting that this protein is involved in zzso trafficking of zzso zzso We also investigated the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by expression of zzso zzso in which the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso were exchanged, the insert region was deleted or the net positive charge of the zzso region was zzso We show that several regions of the zzso not only the zzso region, determine targeting of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso of a strain zzso zzso zzso indicating that the function of this protein is in great part related to its zzso zzso
