zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis has been adapted to the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso A protecting group strategy has been devised in which all of the masking groups are removed with mild zzso This allows for the synthesis of zzso materials and zzso concerns about the zzso at sulfur by zzso known to be present in the zzso acid zzso usually employed for zzso of peptides made by the zzso zzso A series of structurally varied zzso zzso were prepared by zzso the zzso in two zzso The first involved zzso substitution for zzso by one of several different zzso zzso The second involved substitution of one of five zzso or zzso groups onto the zzso zzso The complete set of all combinations would yield 48 zzso of which 25 have actually been zzso Following confirmation of the structures by zzso mass zzso the peptides were zzso by zzso to zzso zzso at pH zzso The amount and identity of immobilized zzso was zzso by zzso acid analysis of zzso zzso One of the zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso
