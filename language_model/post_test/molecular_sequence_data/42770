With this fast and simple zzso protocol we show simultaneous mapping of multiple repetitive sequences by sequential cycles of primed in zzso zzso zzso with various zzso and reporter zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences zzso in zzso were zzso by directly incorporated zzso by zzso zzso and zzso using digital imaging zzso This further development of the zzso method enhances its potential as an alternative to traditional in zzso zzso
