We have previously shown that detection of zzso zzso activity to zzso cell zzso of the head and neck may be zzso by zzso of immune zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso has identified a 60 zzso zzso cell zzso of the head and zzso zzso in spent media and immune zzso serum zzso not recognized by normal human zzso zzso zzso of spent media were zzso from zzso exchange columns immediately after serum zzso indicating that the zzso has an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell zzso zzso was accomplished by zzso exchange of concentrated spent media zzso concentration 300 zzso followed by zzso affinity zzso with a zzso zzso zzso A single 60 zzso band was detected by silver stain and Western zzso in zzso zzso zzso following zzso affinity zzso and zzso Final concentration of the zzso was determined to be 1 zzso of protein with relative activity increased 1600 zzso over zzso spent zzso We conclude that a zzso cell zzso of the head and zzso zzso detected by zzso zzso is an zzso 60 zzso zzso
