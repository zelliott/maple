The zzso zzso explosive zzso zzso zzso zzso is a relatively new energetic compound which could be a persistent organic zzso To follow its zzso zzso zzso was added to soil alone or together with organic zzso and zzso and incubated under zzso and zzso zzso Without zzso the zzso degradation was zzso only under zzso zzso The highest degradation rate was found under zzso conditions and with the addition of zzso zzso and zzso being more efficient than zzso zzso starch or zzso zzso When added to intact soil, zzso degradation was not affected by the N content, but in soil serially diluted with zzso zzso zzso the process became zzso About zzso of randomly selected bacterial colonies grown on zzso zzso medium were able to decompose zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence and cell zzso they were affiliated to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the pure culture of zzso zzso zzso grown on the zzso zzso zzso the degradation zzso were first order with the same apparent kinetic constant throughout growth and decline zzso of the batch zzso The observed zzso agreed with the model that supposes zzso transformation of zzso zzso from cell growth, which can be carried out by several zzso cellular zzso with wide zzso zzso
