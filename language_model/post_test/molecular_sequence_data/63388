In the present study, we analyzed differential composition of blood serum from zzso zzso and healthy male zzso mice by zzso complexes of zzso and other serum proteins by a zzso approach zzso zzso gel zzso and mass zzso The zzso zzso isolated from the serum of zzso bearing tumors contained several proteins with molecular weights of 15, 65, 68, and 100 zzso while zzso zzso isolated from the serum of healthy mice did not contain additional protein zzso These bands were identified by zzso as zzso serum zzso a zzso of zzso and zzso Ion exchange zzso indicated complex formation of these zzso zzso of zzso blood serum proteins zzso isolated from zzso animals, leads to tumor zzso zzso injected zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells but not normal zzso cells and led to a complete zzso of the zzso or solid zzso zzso A one-year follow up of the animals did not reveal any signs of tumor zzso In conclusion, zzso might be a novel principle of tumor zzso The clinical relevance of these findings with zzso zzso should be investigated in the zzso
