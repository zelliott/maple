The recognition of zzso zzso by T cells through the zzso has exquisite zzso zzso T cell responses have been zzso however, the structural basis for these responses is not zzso We show that two peptides derived from the same protein can exhibit sufficient structural zzso despite minimal structural identity, to elicit zzso T cell zzso In addition, we explore the structural basis for zzso T cell zzso recognizing zzso and zzso zzso forms of human alpha zzso zzso each recognized both zzso zzso and zzso zzso These two peptides possessed primary sequence identity at only two of 16 zzso acid zzso zzso peptides also exhibited zzso at the bulk T cell level because zzso zzso T cells primed with one zzso proliferated to the other zzso in zzso Critical zzso acids for the responding T cells were determined, and the core was transferred into the less zzso zzso in an attempt to increase zzso by increasing sequence zzso Interestingly, as identity increased, zzso zzso peptides with the least primary sequence identity appeared most zzso to the T zzso These results have important implications for understanding the development of zzso diseases, and imply that minimal obvious primary sequence identity may be sufficient to initiate zzso T cell zzso The ability of structurally dissimilar peptides to mimic each other when bound to a class II zzso zzso may also be important to the understanding of T development and zzso
