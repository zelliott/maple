A second zzso binding type 2 zzso protein zzso called zzso has been isolated from elderberry zzso zzso zzso zzso is a minor bark protein which closely resembles the previously described major zzso binding type 2 zzso called zzso with respect to its zzso specificity and zzso activity but has a different molecular zzso zzso cloning revealed that the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is highly similar to that of zzso and that the difference in molecular structure between both proteins relies on a single zzso zzso present in the B chain of zzso but absent from zzso The isolation of zzso not only identifies a minor bark protein as a type 2 zzso but also further emphasizes the complexity of the type 2 zzso mixture present in the bark of zzso
