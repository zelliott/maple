zzso transcripts of the zzso gene in peripheral zzso and Epstein zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso using reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Two DNA fragments, corresponding to the alternative first zzso transcribed from either zzso or zzso zzso were both amplified from zzso prepared from normal zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the amplified products were zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso was amplified from the zzso cells of a patient with zzso muscular dystrophy, who has a partial deletion involving the zzso and zzso promoters in the zzso zzso These findings showed that the zzso as well as the zzso promoter of the zzso gene was active in zzso and zzso zzso
