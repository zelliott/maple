In zzso zzso Northern zzso and zzso techniques were used to study the expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso beta 1) in the zzso of the zzso during the first 150 days of pregnancy zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso using an zzso zzso probe, based on a zzso region within all known zzso zzso beta 1 DNA zzso demonstrated zzso beta 1 zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso cells of the zzso from day 33 zzso which zzso to the time of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso remained at a high level to the end of the sampling period zzso zzso There was also marked expression of zzso beta 1 in the zzso cells accumulated around the periphery of the specialized zzso cells of the zzso cup within the zzso and in the zzso cells accumulated in the zzso zzso of zzso carrying failing zzso zzso created by zzso zzso The sense zzso zzso probe exhibited no zzso to any tissue at any zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso probe and a zzso zzso beta 1 zzso clone zzso to a single zzso zzso transcript in horse zzso and zzso zzso thus zzso the zzso probe for detection of horse zzso beta 1 zzso Furthermore, both zzso demonstrated an increased signal in the pregnant zzso from day 33 zzso thereby confirming the in zzso zzso zzso zzso with a specific zzso zzso beta 1 serum also showed increasing zzso beta 1 zzso in zzso zzso during pregnancy, and zzso of the protein in zzso zzso and in the zzso layer of the zzso after day 60 of zzso These results show that zzso beta 1 expression increases in the maternal zzso of the zzso at the time of zzso and that it may play a role in regulating zzso and/or zzso growth and differentiation during zzso in this zzso It may also influence fetal development (via zzso zzso at a later stage of zzso
