A new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seed, designated zzso The zzso zzso is longer than the zzso and the zzso forms, all the other zzso acid zzso being zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso site bond (where zzso forming the zzso site have been identified as zzso and zzso where zzso is the inhibitor zzso zzso has been identified at position zzso The inhibitor zzso bridges pattern has been determined as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso bridge arrangement observed in the zzso zzso is reminiscent of that found in a number of toxins zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the organization of the three zzso bridges subset zzso zzso and zzso is reminiscent of that found in zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso data indicates the presence of zzso and zzso zzso constants, typical of the zzso These data suggest that the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso may be reminiscent of that of toxins and zzso growth factor zzso consisting of zzso shaped zzso extending from the crossover zzso zzso of the apparent association equilibrium constant for zzso zzso binding to bovine zzso and bovine zzso are zzso zzso 109 zzso and zzso zzso 106 zzso respectively, at pH zzso and zzso degrees zzso The zzso zzso : inhibitor complex formation is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso do not show any similarity to other zzso zzso zzso except the low molecular mass white mustard zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso seed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be members of a new class of plant zzso zzso zzso
