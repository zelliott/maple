zzso complementary zzso zzso that zzso a zzso acid human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated by zzso techniques from two zzso libraries which had been constructed from human kidney and human zzso zzso cells zzso Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from human zzso and zzso tissue revealed one single major zzso zzso species of about zzso zzso in both zzso The human zzso zzso has zzso and zzso identity, respectively, with the previously cloned rat and zzso zzso indicating a high degree of conservation among zzso Despite this striking degree of zzso zzso the human zzso zzso has several unique biological properties when zzso expressed in zzso zzso The apparent zzso zzso for zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso are similar for the human and the rat zzso zzso 8 zzso approximately 15 zzso whereas zzso zzso has a slightly lower affinity for the human zzso zzso than for the rat zzso zzso 15 zzso Both zzso stimulate efficiently and with similar efficacy the zzso of zzso zzso The affinities for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in particular for zzso zzso zzso zzso are considerably higher for the human zzso zzso approximately 8 zzso zzso 30 zzso for zzso and approximately 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Similar biological findings were previously attributed to differences in zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso highly zzso rat and human receptors in a uniform environment indicate that the moderate differences in the primary zzso structure have profound consequences for the zzso binding affinity of zzso truncated zzso zzso Furthermore, the molecular cloning of identical zzso zzso a human zzso zzso from the two major target zzso for zzso bone and zzso provides strong evidence for one single zzso zzso in both zzso although additional and/or alternatively spliced receptors cannot be zzso
