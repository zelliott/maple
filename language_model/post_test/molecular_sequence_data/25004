Expansion of zzso repeat DNA of the classes zzso zzso and zzso are found to be associated with several neurodegenerative zzso Different mechanisms have been attributed to the expansion of zzso mainly involving the formation of alternate secondary structures by such zzso This paper reports the molecular dynamics simulation of zzso repeat DNA sequences to study the basic structural features of DNA that are responsible for the formation of structures such as zzso and zzso DNA leading to zzso All the zzso repeat sequences studied were found to be more flexible compared to the control sequence zzso with zzso Moreover, flexibility was found to be in the order zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso the highly flexible zzso repeat being the most common cause of neurodegenerative zzso In another zzso a single zzso to zzso zzso at the 9th position of the zzso repeat exhibited a reduction in zzso compared to the pure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat associated with the zzso of progressive zzso zzso was also simulated and showed flexible nature suggesting a similar expansion zzso
