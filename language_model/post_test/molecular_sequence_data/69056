A zzso clone corresponding to a transcript that was induced by zzso in tomato zzso roots encodes a 223 zzso acid protein belonging to the zzso inhibitor II family of tomato and zzso The zzso open reading frame has an zzso region with characteristics of a signal zzso and three copies of a 64 zzso acid segment that is also present in multiple copies in other zzso family zzso zzso to other zzso zzso zzso indicates that all three zzso are zzso zzso zzso to zzso increased in abundance within 24 h of zzso treatment and continued to increase through 72 zzso at which point the induction was approximately zzso zzso induction was observed in roots and zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso may therefore be correlated with lateral and zzso root zzso which occurs over a similar time frame in the same zzso zzso detected with the zzso probe were mapped to the long arm of zzso zzso
