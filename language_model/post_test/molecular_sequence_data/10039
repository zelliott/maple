zzso (or zzso is a clinically important zzso that is found in zzso of patients with systemic lupus zzso as well as an even greater proportion of patients with zzso syndrome or zzso zzso zzso We have studied the binding of zzso zzso to multiple zzso peptides constructed from the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso bind these peptides in zzso zzso Surprisingly, some of these peptides also form a zzso line in double zzso with zzso zzso zzso of lines of identity in double zzso as well as zzso studies indicate that peptides distant in the primary zzso acid sequence and without shared sequence are bound by the same zzso In addition, data from surface zzso resonance demonstrate that peptides identified in this manner have zzso zzso Thus, these techniques may identify the components of zzso zzso
