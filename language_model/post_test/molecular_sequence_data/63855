Based on the representation of the DNA sequence as a two-dimensional zzso plane walk, we consider the problem of identification and comparison of functional and structural organizations of zzso of different zzso According to the characteristic design of zzso walks we identify zzso sites, zzso of various sizes and complexity, areas of zzso zzso zzso as well as diverse satellite zzso As an interesting result of the application of the zzso walk method, a new duplicated gigantic zzso in the X human zzso is zzso A zzso mechanism leading to the formation of such a duplicated zzso is zzso Analysis of a large number of the different zzso shows that some zzso (or their zzso of various species appear as imperfect gigantic zzso which are disintegrated by many zzso and the zzso drift on different zzso A spread occurrence of these types of sequences in the numerous zzso allows us to develop a new insight of some accepted points of the zzso evolution in the zzso zzso
