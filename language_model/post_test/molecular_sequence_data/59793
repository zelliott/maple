We have previously shown that a 30,000 Mr protein extracted from guinea pig inner ear tissue is recognized by zzso present in the serum of patients suffering from zzso inner ear zzso This protein was localized in the zzso and in the organ of zzso We have now identified this protein by a combination of zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso of its zzso zzso A partial sequence of the protein was thereby zzso These data and zzso gel zzso followed by zzso experiments showed that the 30,000 Mr inner ear zzso is the major peripheral zzso protein zzso This suggests that protein zzso may be an important zzso in zzso inner ear zzso
