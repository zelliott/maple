The transition from zzso initiation to zzso involves zzso of the large zzso zzso of zzso zzso II on the repetitive zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is subject to zzso particularly in response to zzso radiation and zzso zzso By using computer zzso we identified regions of zzso and the adjacent zzso 6 of zzso zzso II zzso that share sequence and structural similarity with the domain of zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso that binds von zzso tumor zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity to the zzso zzso complex, which zzso zzso and targets it for zzso zzso In agreement with the zzso model, we show zzso evidence that zzso specifically binds the zzso zzso in a zzso manner, targeting it for zzso This interaction is regulated by zzso zzso
