The zzso zzso region of a zzso gene was analyzed for interactions with nuclear proteins from immature rice zzso The specific region between positions zzso and zzso was shown to interact with nuclear proteins from immature seeds, but not with those of leaves and zzso zzso interference experiments revealed that one factor zzso with a specific sequence element between positions zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start zzso The sequence specificity of this zzso interaction was confirmed by competition experiments using synthetic zzso By using a synthetic zzso as a probe it was also shown that the binding activity was closely correlated with the zzso levels of this gene during seed zzso
