The structure of a zzso of human zzso containing two zzso zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso and refined at zzso A zzso The structure determination involved zzso building and zzso zzso beginning with a partial zzso zzso of domain 1 with an zzso variable domain shows that zzso has a long and prominent zzso loop (the zzso zzso and shortened zzso and zzso zzso (which mediate zzso in zzso zzso zzso of domain 2 with zzso zzso and domain 1 shows that it can be described as a truncated zzso V domain, in which strands zzso and D are zzso The zzso zzso in domain 2 is zzso and there is an altered packing of the two zzso together with a zzso of the zzso zzso The interface between zzso 1 and 2 is a lap joint with an extensive zzso zzso The key features of domain 1 that contribute to the interface are found at corresponding positions in domain 2, leading us to propose that the contact between zzso 2 and 3 will resemble the one between zzso 1 and zzso
