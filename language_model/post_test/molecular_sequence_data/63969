Failure of passive transfer zzso is a condition in which zzso do not acquire protective serum levels of maternal zzso A principal component of zzso transport is the zzso zzso for the zzso portion of zzso a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso Previously, two zzso zzso were associated with differences in zzso G zzso passive transfer in cattle zzso et zzso (2002) zzso Genome 13, zzso The present study had two zzso first, to characterize the zzso zzso structure in a diverse group of zzso beef zzso and second, to evaluate those zzso for association with either high or low serum zzso levels in newborn zzso Twelve single zzso zzso zzso assorted into eight zzso were identified by sequencing regions of zzso zzso II and IV in a zzso panel of 96 beef zzso zzso zzso for one of the eight zzso ( zzso zzso were at increased risk of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso These results indicate that this zzso is in linkage zzso with genetic risk factors affecting passive transfer of zzso in beef calves, an important zzso of zzso calf morbidity and zzso
