zzso zzso zzso has been recently shown to be generated in pancreatic zzso by zzso zzso serving as a second zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in the process of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso In the present study, we isolated a zzso for zzso which has been reported to be a human zzso zzso from a human zzso and expressed the zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso When we incubated the plasma membrane fraction with zzso and analyzed the reaction products by high pressure liquid zzso the formation of zzso was observed in addition to the zzso zzso zzso When the plasma membrane fraction was incubated with zzso zzso was converted to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso zzso generated in the zzso metabolism in zzso inhibited the zzso activity, resulting in the increased formation of zzso These findings indicate a role for zzso in the synthesis and zzso of zzso in the process of insulin zzso in pancreatic zzso
