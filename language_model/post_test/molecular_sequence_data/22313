We described a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underlying zzso transmission in the central nervous system zzso of the zzso zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso we identified 12 zzso that display a high sequence similarity to zzso zzso of which 10 are of the zzso 1 is of the zzso and 1 was not classified because of insufficient sequence zzso zzso expression of identified zzso confirms their capacity to form functional receptors responding to zzso The zzso zzso can be divided into groups that appear to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso channels involved in synaptic zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso assessed by real time quantitative zzso and in zzso zzso indicates that it is localized to zzso and widespread in the zzso with the number and zzso of expressing zzso differing considerably between zzso zzso At least zzso of the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso as indicated by the expression of the zzso zzso zzso comprise approximately zzso of the zzso in all zzso Together, our data suggested a prominent role for fast zzso transmission in the zzso zzso by using a number of zzso zzso zzso comparable with zzso species but with a functional complexity that may be much zzso
