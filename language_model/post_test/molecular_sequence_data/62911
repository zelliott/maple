The second envelope zzso zzso of zzso C virus has been shown to bind human target cells and has become a major target for the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been suggested to be of clinical significance in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of zzso zzso However, large-scale expression and zzso of zzso proteins in zzso cells is zzso As an alternative, zzso zzso zzso 385 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was expressed as zzso full length protein zzso in zzso coli and zzso to over zzso zzso zzso zzso was specifically recognized by zzso zzso C patient serum in Western zzso suggesting that it displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso recognized zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells in Western zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso zzso in human zzso and showed better specificity and sensitivity than previously reported zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso 385 zzso Association between zzso zzso in patient zzso and zzso zzso status was also demonstrated using this zzso zzso zzso zzso might serve as an inexpensive alternative to zzso zzso zzso proteins in clinical and research zzso
