zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences were analyzed in four species belonging to different zzso of the fish family zzso Several zzso zzso zzso differing in their zzso zzso zzso were found and were grouped into two main zzso Two species showed both types of zzso zzso whereas the other two species showed only one zzso One type of zzso of zzso zzso showed a high zzso due to several deletions and zzso and zzso analysis showed a zzso zzso of this type of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest a clear differentiation in the model of zzso zzso evolution of these four species of zzso which appear to have been subject to processes of concerted evolution and zzso evolution with zzso zzso
