The zzso immune system zzso is characterized by the zzso molecules and the rearranging zzso zzso and was established in a common zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is important for normal development and function of T zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, as the result of an alternative zzso of a distinct zzso 7, zzso encodes for two zzso zzso in T zzso and zzso in the zzso How this alternative zzso of zzso transcripts has emerged and evolved in relation to the setting of the zzso remains to be zzso In this study, we show that zzso capture in a zzso zzso by the zzso gene has yielded a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso the newly established zzso recruited the ancestral zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso expresses the most recent one, zzso These results shed new light on the emergence of the zzso
