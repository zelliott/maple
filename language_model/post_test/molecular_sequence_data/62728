The zzso expressed zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso domain factors, is involved in the regulation of expression of many zzso and zzso zzso Multiple alternatively spliced zzso of zzso have been identified in human and mouse zzso The expression patterns of these zzso and the analysis of their zzso organization and structure have suggested that the structural variation of zzso zzso may be important in zzso target and tissue specificity to its zzso zzso In this study, we have cloned and zzso a new mouse zzso zzso named zzso This novel zzso differs markedly at the zzso from the previously identified zzso zzso A, B, and zzso It is generated by alternative zzso from the zzso gene and its transcript exhibits a zzso followed by an early stop zzso thus, its predicted protein has a zzso much shorter zzso zzso However, this truncated zzso could still effectively bind to a consensus zzso motif zzso and, like zzso activated the zzso promoter activity of the mouse zzso zzso zzso is another zzso expressed zzso zzso its transcript being detected in all mouse zzso zzso including the zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso and zzso
