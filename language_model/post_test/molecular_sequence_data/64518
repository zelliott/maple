The zzso zzso system is involved in zzso processes such as zzso energy zzso and the control of sleep and zzso The zzso system may drive the zzso and zzso activities that control sleep and zzso states because of the zzso fiber projections to the zzso and zzso cell zzso The biological mechanisms and relevance of the interactions between these neurotransmitter systems are poorly zzso We studied these systems in zzso a model zzso in which it is possible to simultaneously study these systems and their zzso We cloned a zzso zzso gene that encodes for the two functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene of the zzso consisted of one zzso in contrast to zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso was less zzso than the zzso zzso compared with other zzso By using in zzso zzso and zzso we found that the organization of the zzso system of zzso was similar to the zzso system in zzso including a zzso cell cluster and widespread fiber zzso The zzso system of the zzso showed a unique characteristic with an additional zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso system zzso several zzso zzso zzso locus zzso the zzso area, zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso relationship was found between the zzso system and several zzso zzso Our results suggest that the architecture of these neurotransmitter systems is zzso in zzso and that these neurotransmitter systems in zzso may be involved in regulation of states of zzso and energy zzso by similar mechanisms as those in zzso
