zzso a zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso zzso to screen a human zzso DNA library, we have obtained a clone that contains the zzso zzso The zzso clone was restriction mapped and the zzso gene and its zzso and 3' zzso regions were zzso A single zzso is found in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso while the coding region is uninterrupted by an zzso This placement of a single zzso in the zzso gene is identical to that of the gene for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which, along with zzso belongs to a family of proteins sharing two distinct structural zzso an zzso zzso domain and an adjacent domain of tandem zzso zzso zzso it is possible that this family of proteins is not only related in terms of primary structure, but also through similar gene zzso zzso comparison of the zzso and 3' zzso regions did not reveal striking similarities to other DNA zzso and no obvious promoter elements were zzso By zzso of the zzso clone to zzso cells, we have localized the human zzso gene to zzso 17 bands zzso a region to which the zzso type 1 gene has been previously zzso
