A clone coding for the entire gene for the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was used to produce a series of overlapping zzso by making a series of deletions from the 3' end of the zzso The zzso expressed incomplete zzso proteins as zzso with zzso The insert DNA was zzso to determine the extent of the deletion and the proteins expressed by the clones were examined for the presence of T cell and B cell zzso T cell zzso were mapped by measuring the ability of zzso zzso to stimulate gamma zzso zzso production in a whole blood culture zzso zzso production was measured using a sandwich zzso zzso specific for bovine zzso B cell zzso were mapped with a series of zzso zzso zzso using an indirect zzso zzso
