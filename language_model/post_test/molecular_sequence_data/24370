The zzso zzso which was discovered as a zzso target of the zzso zzso zzso is an essential regulator of the polarization of the zzso zzso zzso proteins are highly zzso between species and belong to the family of zzso zzso region 2 zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso encodes a zinc finger structure highly zzso to zzso zzso A region with high zzso between the zzso family proteins is located adjacent zzso to the modified zzso domain and is designated as zzso The zzso has sequence similarity to a region of zzso which mediates interaction with the small zzso zzso zzso of zzso and green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells revealed that the zzso protein zzso specifically with the zzso zzso which is localized at the zzso network zzso zzso zzso and the recycling zzso The distinct zzso zzso pattern was dependent on the integrity of the modified zzso finger motif and the zzso zzso of a mouse zzso dominant interfering zzso strongly inhibited the transport of the zzso zzso virus G zzso zzso protein to the plasma zzso The viral protein was arrested in membrane structures, largely zzso with the zzso marker zzso Our findings that the zzso zzso organizer is targeted to zzso membrane structures by its modified zzso zinc finger and is involved in zzso transport processes provide a novel link between zzso organization and zzso zzso
