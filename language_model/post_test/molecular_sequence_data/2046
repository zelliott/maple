The zzso acid and derived zzso acid sequences of a chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso acid sequence shares zzso identity with that of a previously characterized chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso represent two distinct zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and appear to be transcribed from separate zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons with zzso from zzso species indicate that the chicken zzso are most closely related to the zzso zzso According to the zzso zzso nomenclature zzso et zzso zzso the chicken zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso is termed zzso and the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso is designated zzso When chick zzso were treated with zzso the levels of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in liver were elevated zzso by about zzso while zzso treatment resulted in a zzso increase of about zzso These increases in zzso levels were accompanied by a less than zzso increase in the corresponding gene zzso zzso The results indicate that the increase in the amount of these two zzso is due to both zzso zzso of the zzso genes and to a marked zzso zzso By contrast, the drug-induced zzso zzso levels for zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, could be accounted for predominantly by zzso of gene zzso A close correlation was observed between the time courses of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso following drug treatment of chick zzso In adult zzso it was demonstrated that a zzso drug induction of zzso zzso zzso occurred with levels being substantially elevated in the liver, zzso and small zzso The zzso for zzso zzso was also drug-induced in the same zzso zzso The results are compatible with the gene for zzso zzso being activated in response to an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso
