In the adult zzso signaling through zzso zzso zzso zzso links exposure to acute stress to various zzso zzso zzso zzso brain injury and zzso zzso or exposure to psychological acute zzso induce zzso of zzso zzso Here we report that exposure to acute stress caused zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and impaired contextual fear zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso or zzso (8 zzso reduced activity of zzso zzso and rescued zzso deficits in contextual zzso In addition, zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso effects of stress on contextual zzso This zzso zzso was abolished after zzso with zzso selective inhibitor zzso without affecting zzso ability to effectively inhibit protein synthesis as measured by zzso zzso We also demonstrated milder and transient zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso during contextual fear conditioning and an enhancement of contextual fear after pharmacological zzso of zzso under baseline zzso Finally, using combined zzso and transgenic approaches with zzso mice lacking different members of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso we provided evidence that zzso and zzso are critically involved in zzso deficit of contextual fear, while zzso mainly regulates baseline learning in this behavioral zzso Together, these results support the possibility that zzso zzso serve as a critical molecular regulator in the formation of contextual zzso
