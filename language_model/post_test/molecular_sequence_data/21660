zzso gene transfer zzso is a major evolutionary mechanism in zzso zzso about zzso zzso has only recently started to zzso A widespread assumption sees the gene as the unit of zzso largely because little is yet known about how zzso chances are affected by zzso features at the zzso zzso Here we trace the evolutionary trajectory of zzso zzso 1, a novel gene family known to be essential for plant development and zzso At the zzso level zzso encodes a zzso zzso domain, in common with members of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We zzso zzso zzso likely originated in an zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was zzso zzso through nets of ecological zzso including multiple zzso between zzso distant green zzso bacteria, and five independent zzso to zzso Of these latest five zzso three are ancient zzso implicating an ancestral zzso the last common zzso of land plants and an ancestral zzso green zzso and two are recent zzso to modern zzso zzso zzso rampant zzso behavior was enabled by the zzso and broad utility of the zzso zzso which provided a platform for the evolution of two unprecedented departures from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The fate of zzso in zzso has been different in different zzso being ubiquitous and highly zzso in land plants, whereas zzso underwent multiple zzso And zzso zzso bacteria include zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso distributed with respect to the type of zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may have been instrumental for the evolutionary transition of green plants to land, and point to a zzso zzso zzso mechanism for the evolution of bacterial zzso against zzso zzso may serve as tool for revealing microbial interactions in zzso zzso
