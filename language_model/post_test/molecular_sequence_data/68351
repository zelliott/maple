We have obtained five zzso clones which are complementary to transcripts that accumulate specifically during the early stage of zzso formation in zzso zzso Based on the zzso of transcript zzso of their corresponding zzso these clones were classified into two groups: an early expression group (three zzso zzso zzso zzso and a late expression group zzso zzso zzso and zzso The levels of transcripts in the former group reached a maximum 30 zzso after the onset of zzso whereas those in the latter group peaked at 3 zzso The addition of 10 zzso of zzso reduced the decline in the levels of zzso except in the transcript corresponding to zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso contained zzso predicted zzso zzso and were judged to be zzso for two members of a novel gene zzso These genes were referred to as zzso and zzso zzso
