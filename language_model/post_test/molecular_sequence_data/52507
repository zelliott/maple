Feeding experiments with a mixture of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of others have proved that the zzso of the zzso ring occurred via an zzso process for formation of the left part zzso zzso of the zzso skeleton and demonstrated that the zzso bond from C2 of the zzso ring to C2 of the side chain was completely retained for formation of the right part zzso zzso during the entire zzso zzso Due to the involvement of zzso it has remained unresolved whether zzso acid is the zzso intermediate and/or from where the nitrogen atom of the zzso ring zzso An incorporation experiment with a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso verified that the nitrogen atom in the central ring was exclusively derived from the zzso zzso Thus, all the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the right part of the zzso skeleton were constructed by intact incorporation of the zzso zzso with zzso probably occurring at a later zzso zzso
