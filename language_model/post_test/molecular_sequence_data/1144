Despite the prominence of zzso zzso as a major zzso and genetic model system, its zzso relationship to its closest relatives has not been zzso Resolution of these relationships is necessary for studying the steps that zzso life history, zzso and zzso evolution of this important zzso By using data from five different nuclear genes from 10 zzso species currently in culture, we find a well resolved zzso that reveals three striking patterns in the evolution of this animal group: zzso zzso has evolved independently in zzso zzso and its close relative zzso zzso zzso there is a large degree of zzso turnover within zzso and zzso losses are much more frequent than zzso zzso and zzso despite the lack of marked zzso diversity, more genetic disparity is present within this one zzso than has occurred within all zzso
