A group of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strains isolated from native oak trees displaying symptoms of acute oak decline zzso in the UK were investigated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing and zzso analysis revealed that these zzso form a distinct lineage within the zzso zzso family zzso and are most closely related to zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity to the type zzso zzso sequence analysis based on four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed their position within the zzso zzso while zzso zzso indicated that the zzso belong to a single zzso The zzso can be differentiated zzso from their closest zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data demonstrate that these zzso from oak with symptoms of zzso represent a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
