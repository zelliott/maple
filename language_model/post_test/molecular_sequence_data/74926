Factor H is a major regulatory protein of the complement zzso The complete zzso coding sequence has been derived from overlapping zzso and a zzso at base zzso has been zzso In four clones there is a T at zzso zzso and in two others there is a zzso This zzso change represents a zzso zzso at position zzso in the derived zzso acid zzso zzso sequence studies on peptides generated by zzso zzso of factor zzso zzso from pooled plasma from 12 donors, confirmed the presence of both zzso and zzso at this zzso zzso and zzso were observed in a ratio of zzso respectively, and therefore this zzso is likely to represent a sequence difference between the two most abundant charge zzso zzso and zzso of factor zzso
