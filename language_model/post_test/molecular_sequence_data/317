An enhanced zzso detection platform was developed by zzso a surface acoustic wave zzso of the zzso type with protein identification by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso The system was applied to characterize the interaction of zzso with their zzso zzso zzso The zzso which target two proteins of zzso were identified using an automated in zzso selection zzso For zzso zzso and zzso which target the zzso loop of the zzso envelope protein zzso zzso values of zzso and 791 zzso respectively, were zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso with a zzso value of zzso zzso when immobilized on the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified with high significance using zzso zzso even in crude protein zzso The zzso of zzso could be directly identified when using zzso zzso protein zzso From crude protein zzso it could be identified indirectly with high significance via its zzso zzso zzso Our data show that the combination of the selectivity of zzso with a sensitive detection by zzso enables the reliable and quantitative analysis of kinetic binding events of protein solutions in real zzso
