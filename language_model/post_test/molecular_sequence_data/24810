We have characterized 43 zzso sequences from zzso C zzso South Africans and compared deduced zzso acid sequences with other zzso to identify areas of zzso Our zzso zzso acid sequences were aligned with a consensus zzso B, zzso reference strain and a consensus zzso C zzso All were found to be highly zzso to zzso B in the central region of zzso but more variable at the N and C zzso of the zzso zzso of a consensus zzso acid sequence generated from South African zzso C zzso with zzso A, B, and D underscores zzso conservation in the central domain of the zzso This domain is also rich in previously described zzso T zzso zzso zzso that are restricted by commonly found zzso molecules in the South African zzso
