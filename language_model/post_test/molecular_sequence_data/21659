Gene transfer using zzso viral zzso zzso has been successfully applied in the zzso for the treatment of inherited retinal zzso Recently, zzso have been exploited to fine-tune zzso expression improving therapeutic zzso Here we evaluated the ability of zzso zzso to restrict zzso zzso expression to specific retinal cell types that represent the main targets of common inherited blinding zzso 

To this end, we generated zzso zzso expressing zzso and containing four tandem copies of zzso or zzso complementary sequences in the zzso of the zzso expression zzso These zzso were administered zzso to adult zzso mice and Large White zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso target sequences can efficiently restrict zzso zzso expression to retinal zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in mice and zzso Interestingly, zzso restriction was observed at low zzso doses relevant to zzso 

We conclude that zzso regulation of zzso expression can be applied in the zzso to either restrict to a specific cell type the robust expression obtained using ubiquitous promoters or to provide an additional layer of gene expression regulation when using zzso zzso
