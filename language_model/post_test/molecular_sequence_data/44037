The cell surface zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as part of a regulatory loop to control local zzso of zzso zzso and associated zzso signal zzso The zzso role of the zzso depends on available zzso in specific zzso and cell zzso Although zzso is expressed on a restricted subset of normal and zzso zzso zzso the zzso is also expressed by a variety of zzso zzso To explore the mechanism of zzso expression of this regulatory zzso we characterized the major zzso 2) zzso promoter and identified three functionally active zzso factor binding sites zzso I to zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso box in region I, whereas a second positive and a third negative factor bind to regions II and III, zzso Although region I is required for zzso zzso zzso activity in the examined zzso cell lines, this region is not required for zzso activity in the evaluated zzso cell zzso The apparent zzso differences in requirements for region I (and zzso are of particular interest because zzso and zzso cells express alternatively spliced versions of zzso that differ in zzso zzso
