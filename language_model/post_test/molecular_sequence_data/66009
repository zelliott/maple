This review discusses the state-of-the-art in molecular research on the most prominent and widely applied zzso zzso zzso The developments in understanding its complex zzso and mode of action are zzso Moreover, novel applications arising from engineering either zzso itself, or from the construction of totally novel dehydrated and/or zzso peptides with desired zzso are zzso Several challenges still exist in understanding the immunity system and the unique multiple reactions occurring on a single zzso zzso carried out by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The recent zzso of the 3-D structure of zzso forms the exciting beginning of further zzso zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso and immunity zzso Advances in achieving in zzso activities of zzso zzso will greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular characteristics of the zzso process, opening up new avenues for developing unique and novel zzso zzso
