The solution structure of the 33 zzso complex between the zzso zzso core domain of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and a zzso DNA zzso zzso the consensus sequence zzso has been solved by zzso The protein comprises two zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and specificity are achieved by interactions between the zzso and both the major and minor grooves of the zzso A number of critical differences in zzso contacts observed in the zzso complex and the DNA complexes of the related zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso provide a molecular explanation for zzso of sequence specificity and extent of DNA zzso ( approximately 15 versus approximately 70 degrees zzso The structure of the zzso domain is entirely different from that of the equivalent SAM domain in zzso and zzso accounting for the absence of zzso with other proteins that interact with these zzso zzso
