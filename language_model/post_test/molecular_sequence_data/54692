zzso of the DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso are major players in processes known to generate genetic diversity, such as zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso that causes zzso disease has a highly zzso population, composed of a pool of strains with distinct zzso Studies with a number of molecular markers identified up to six groups in the zzso zzso population, which showed distinct levels of genetic zzso To investigate the molecular basis for such differences, we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a key component of zzso and showed the existence of distinct zzso of this zzso Here we compared cell survival rates after exposure to zzso agents and levels of zzso zzso DNA in different zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also used to investigate the role of zzso in the response to various DNA damaging zzso The results suggest that the distinct zzso zzso have differences in their zzso More importantly, they also indicate that, in addition to its role in zzso zzso acts in the zzso response to zzso stress through a novel zzso function that may be zzso in zzso zzso
