zzso a zzso zzso zzso infection system, has previously been shown to arrest zzso zzso DNA replication around 10 zzso after infection and to inhibit the switch off of zzso early zzso We report here the functional characterization and implication in the zzso infection zzso of two zzso identified in the zzso zzso We show that zzso is a protein anchored to the membrane by an zzso zzso zzso Our results further suggest that membrane zzso may be required for the zzso activity of zzso The remainder of the zzso which contains a putative zzso acid binding domain, is shown to be located on the zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to bind zzso acids with an approximately zzso preference for zzso relative to zzso zzso interaction with both zzso and zzso molecules occurs in a zzso zzso We have analyzed the effect of zzso of aromatic and basic zzso on the surface of the putative binding zzso In zzso and in zzso studies of these zzso derivatives indicate that the previously reported effects on zzso development might be dependent on the zzso acid binding activity displayed by the zzso zzso
