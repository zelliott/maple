The zzso gene product of zzso zzso excludes zzso zzso infection by blocking the expression of genes downstream from the zzso nut zzso The zzso protein functions both by competing with zzso N zzso protein and by actively inducing zzso termination on the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso binds directly to a zzso structure within nut zzso zzso which is also the target for the N zzso The two proteins show comparable affinities for zzso and they compete with each zzso Their interactions with zzso are similar, as shown by zzso protection experiments, zzso zzso and analysis of zzso zzso Each protein binds the zzso strand of the zzso stem and the adjacent zzso The stem does not melt upon the binding of zzso or zzso as the 3' strand remains sensitive to a zzso zzso The binding of zzso partially protects zzso from zzso and changes its zzso zzso zzso although zzso and N bind to the same surface of zzso zzso their respective complexes interact differently with zzso zzso inducing zzso termination or zzso zzso
