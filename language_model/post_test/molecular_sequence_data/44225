The adaptation of zzso zzso bacteria to host zzso involves regulation of the synthesis of bacterial zzso We analyzed the protein synthesis of zzso zzso zzso growing zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso in culture zzso After zzso with zzso zzso and separation by one- and two-dimensional zzso gel zzso induction of a few proteins during zzso growth was zzso One of them, a zzso zzso was prominently induced in the zzso and also when zzso growing zzso zzso was exposed to hydrogen zzso After isolation of the zzso protein from a zzso two-dimensional zzso a zzso zzso zzso and two peptides obtained by zzso zzso were zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso were constructed for use as zzso in a zzso zzso of amplified DNA to zzso zzso DNA identified the gene of the zzso protein in a zzso DNA zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso a putative protein of a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The open reading frame was preceded by a sequence typical of zzso sites in zzso zzso The amplified gene was successfully expressed by the zzso zzso in zzso coli under control of the zzso zzso The gene product showed the same mobility and zzso as the zzso protein of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed no significant zzso with protein sequences in current data zzso Thus, zzso growth of zzso zzso in zzso was associated with prominent zzso of a novel zzso zzso
