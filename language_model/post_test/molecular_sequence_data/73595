zzso or zzso triple zzso could be recognized by specific proteins that stabilize triplex structures and might play a role in gene zzso In order to identify such zzso we designed a 55 zzso DNA zzso that could fold on itself to form an zzso triple zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The stability of this triplex under zzso conditions was demonstrated by gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have identified a protein from zzso cell nuclear extracts that binds to this synthetic zzso The protein has an apparent molecular mass of 55 zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that the protein did not have any affinity for the zzso and zzso zzso corresponding respectively to the third strand and the zzso duplex of the triple zzso This protein also binds to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso triplex but with a lower affinity than to a zzso zzso zzso zzso triple zzso
