zzso of clock proteins represents an important mechanism regulating zzso zzso In zzso clock protein zzso zzso is progressively zzso over time, and its level decreases when it is extensively zzso To identify the zzso zzso zzso and to understand the function of zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso and identified as zzso zzso II zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene of zzso in zzso resulted in zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso rhythms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are abolished in the zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso of zzso by zzso may have at least three zzso it decreases the stability of zzso reduces the protein complex formation between zzso and the WHITE zzso zzso and is important for the closing of the zzso zzso negative feedback zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso is an important component of the zzso zzso zzso
