A zzso search of the zzso of the red flour zzso zzso zzso resulted in the identification of two genes zzso proteins closely related to zzso zzso zzso which provide the activated zzso zzso for the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso anchors of some membrane proteins as well as for the modification of other zzso This is in contrast to other zzso whose zzso have been completely zzso all of which have only a single copy of this zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso share both zzso and zzso acid sequence identities of about zzso zzso analysis revealed that the two genes differ in their zzso and zzso patterns of zzso zzso interference zzso indicated roles for zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso resulted in specific arrest at the zzso zzso or zzso zzso depending on time of injection of zzso zzso whereas zzso for zzso prevented zzso growth or resulted in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso indicated loss of structural integrity and zzso zzso after zzso for zzso but not after zzso for zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed following zzso for zzso but not after zzso for zzso zzso of transcripts for either zzso gene at the mature adult stage resulted in zzso of zzso in zzso as well as fat body depletion and eventual death in both zzso These results demonstrate that both zzso genes are critical for zzso development and survival, but that only zzso is clearly associated with synthesis of zzso or PM zzso However, both of these genes appear to have additional critical zzso unrelated to zzso zzso presumably in the zzso of proteins and/or secondary zzso
