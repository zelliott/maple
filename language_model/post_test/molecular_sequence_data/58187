Host cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso We have shown previously that the human zzso protein zzso a general zzso factor required for zzso of all zzso zzso II zzso is directly zzso both in zzso and in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso bonds in the viral zzso Cellular zzso factor zzso contains three zzso sites, at zzso acids 12, 18, and zzso By using zzso zzso we determined that the zzso bond at zzso acid 18, but not that at zzso acid 12 or zzso is zzso by the viral zzso Both the zzso and the zzso appear to be important for the zzso Further zzso around the zzso site at position 18 suggest that zzso other than the zzso bond in zzso are also required for zzso zzso An zzso at position zzso and a zzso at position zzso zzso to the zzso zzso pair, appear to be important for zzso zzso of zzso Our results suggest that the zzso specificity of zzso for a cellular zzso factor is very similar to its mode of zzso of viral zzso
