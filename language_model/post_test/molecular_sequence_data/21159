An zzso zzso zzso with a specific activity of zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from a culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso in three steps and then zzso The zzso is composed of one large zzso of 40 zzso and one small zzso of 21 zzso that was determined by zzso and a molecular mass of 62 zzso that was determined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso had an optimal pH and temperature of 10 and 37 zzso respectively, and it was stable at pH zzso or zzso zzso The zzso exhibited the highest affinity to zzso acids zzso and then decreasing affinities for aromatic zzso zzso zzso and basic zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso and of zzso for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, suggesting that the zzso likely zzso valuable zzso peptides using zzso as zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the zzso suggested that the zzso zzso and zzso groups of zzso or zzso are essential to zzso zzso Based on the zzso characteristics of the zzso and lack of zzso to previously identified zzso it can be concluded that the zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso
