The major zzso complex zzso zzso genes are described as the genes that zzso the zzso zzso In particular, functional zzso of zzso zzso genes in nonhuman primates have been analyzed as part of the study of infectious and zzso diseases in animal models and as part of efforts to understand the molecular evolution of human zzso zzso The zzso and sequence analysis of zzso zzso genes in a large number of subjects is necessary for the group management of nonhuman zzso In the present study, we attempted to analyze the zzso zzso in the common zzso zzso zzso by zzso 2 zzso For exact typing of zzso zzso we carried out zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso and sequence zzso In the zzso DNA of 25 zzso 6 zzso zzso including 2 new zzso were zzso Identification and analysis of zzso zzso using this method may contribute to our understanding of zzso zzso diversity in individual chimpanzees and should be useful in zzso colony management of zzso groups in zzso
