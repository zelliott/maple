Due to their high zzso it is a challenge to obtain high yields of zzso peptides for structural and functional zzso In the present work, a robust method is developed for the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso especially for those containing zzso zzso By using a truncated and zzso zzso construct as the carrier protein and zzso (which specifically zzso the zzso bond between zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso 10 zzso of the first zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso can be zzso obtained with high purity from 1 L of zzso minimal media under zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso were studied by circular zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and the results show that this zzso zzso is well folded in zzso zzso and the secondary structure is very similar to that in recent crystal zzso In addition, this zzso construct is zzso in zzso acid zzso The zzso with the zzso peptides containing zzso zzso the high yield and the simple process make the present method competitive with other commonly used methods to produce such peptides for structural and functional zzso
