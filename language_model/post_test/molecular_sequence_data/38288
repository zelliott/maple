zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that zzso the first step in degradation of the zzso zzso The active site structures of a small number of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso have been characterized and shown to have a similar zzso arrangement of zzso that make up the binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso does not have obvious zzso to the zzso containing the above motif but is related in sequence to eight other zzso in the zzso that form a distinct consensus sequence zzso zzso zzso of zzso were created to examine the roles of putative zzso zzso and the functions of the other seven zzso in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso formed inclusion bodies when zzso in zzso coli zzso however, these proteins were soluble when fused to the zzso protein zzso zzso exhibited kinetic parameters similar to the native zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have elevated zzso values for zzso and the former showed a decreased zzso suggesting these zzso may affect zzso binding or zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the latter two proteins were highly zzso The remaining four inactive zzso were examined in their zzso forms by zzso and electron zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso upon addition of zzso indicated that copper was present at the active site in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that two zzso are bound zzso to the copper in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The experimental data and sequence analysis lead us to conclude that zzso zzso and zzso are likely metal zzso in zzso and that zzso may aid in zzso or binding of zzso
