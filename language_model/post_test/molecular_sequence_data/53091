zzso domain protein zzso zzso represent a new class of zzso zzso zzso that are not activated by zzso or zzso zzso They have been found exclusively in plant and zzso zzso zzso are typified by four distinct zzso an zzso leader zzso a protein zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain zzso and a junction domain zzso between the zzso domain and zzso zzso characterization of the zzso of zzso from soybean was undertaken based on the zzso acid sequence zzso of zzso to the structurally zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso models of zzso zzso complex, and zzso bound zzso complexes were obtained via automated and zzso zzso building zzso The resulting structures were compared and validated based on energy differences, zzso angle distribution, zzso accessibility, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso studies of the zzso and peptides encompassing the zzso provide experimental support to the zzso The results suggest that there is a possible interaction between the zzso and zzso domain similar to that of the zzso protein zzso II zzso At low zzso levels, the zzso may act as an zzso domain for zzso activity, and during calcium zzso an zzso zzso complex may form, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and the C zzso of the zzso appear to be particularly zzso The outcome of this study supports an zzso binding model for calcium zzso of zzso although not zzso
