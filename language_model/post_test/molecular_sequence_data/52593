Previous studies have shown that the zzso type 5 zzso zzso gene product displays features of a viral zzso It zzso focal transformation of primary rat cells in cooperation with zzso E1 genes and zzso multiple additional transformed properties on zzso cells, including profound zzso zzso and dramatically accelerated tumor growth in nude zzso It has been reported that zzso binds to zzso and, in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stability by targeting the tumor zzso protein for active zzso In the present study, we performed a comprehensive zzso analysis to assign transforming functions of zzso to distinct regions within the viral zzso and to analyze a possible correlation between zzso zzso degradation and zzso Our results show that zzso zzso maps to multiple regions within both zzso and zzso parts of the viral protein and widely zzso with zzso acceleration of tumor growth, indicating that both effects are zzso In contrast, promotion of focus formation and zzso transformation require only a zzso segment of the zzso zzso Thus, these effects are completely independent of zzso stability, but may involve other interactions with the tumor zzso Our results demonstrate that at least two distinct activities contribute to the zzso potential of zzso zzso Although genetically zzso both activities are largely zzso through a novel highly zzso zzso motif and a recently described zzso zzso alpha zzso which resides within a zzso zzso of the viral zzso
