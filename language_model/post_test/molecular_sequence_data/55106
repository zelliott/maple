Members of the zzso zzso protein family possess zzso clusters and are implicated in the regulation of zzso processes in zzso zzso tuberculosis possesses seven zzso zzso The zzso cluster of zzso tuberculosis zzso is relatively insensitive to zzso but very sensitive to zzso oxide zzso zzso oxide zzso the zzso zzso cluster and promotes zzso the zzso of zzso also bind zzso However, the molecular requirements for zzso cluster acquisition and for zzso by zzso are poorly zzso 

zzso zzso were created by zzso zzso and the abilities of the corresponding proteins to acquire an zzso cluster and/or bind to zzso promoter DNA were zzso All four zzso zzso zzso 37, 40, and zzso in the zzso region of zzso were required for incorporation of a zzso zzso whereas a possible alternative cluster zzso zzso (by zzso with zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso region of zzso is predicted to house the zzso domain of the protein consisting of a predicted zzso zzso followed by two zzso acid motifs zzso and zzso that are zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 61 and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the downstream zzso regions were required for binding of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso and characterization of the corresponding proteins has been used to explore zzso relationships of the zzso zzso factor zzso This showed that all four zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region are required for incorporation of zzso clusters but not for zzso Analysis of zzso with zzso acid zzso in the zzso region revealed the crucial roles played by a predicted zzso and two zzso zzso motifs in zzso zzso but not zzso cluster zzso by zzso
