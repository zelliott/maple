Here we report a human intellectual disability disease locus on zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso We identify zzso zzso transcripts in the human central nervous system, and we find that zzso zzso protein is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso model of this disease created by zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso which also binds zzso zzso reveals that zzso is essential for development and required in zzso for normal locomotion and zzso zzso and genetic data indicate that zzso restricts bulk zzso tail length in zzso suggesting that this function may zzso its role in development and zzso These studies reveal a zzso requirement for zzso in the zzso nervous system and identify a zzso zzso binding protein associated with a human brain zzso
