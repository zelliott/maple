zzso 3, a member of the zzso family of zzso is the defective gene in the zzso overgrowth zzso zzso expression is zzso regulated in the zzso zzso and the mechanism of its regulation was studied in the rat zzso zzso cell line zzso A large induction of zzso transcript and protein was observed at high cell zzso Among other zzso family members, zzso also exhibited a zzso induction in select cell zzso Nuclear zzso analysis indicated that zzso regulation of zzso occurs at the level of zzso The rat and mouse zzso promoters were cloned and found to be highly zzso located within zzso islands and contain regions of alternating zzso and zzso zzso No zzso or recognizable zzso element was zzso Consensus binding sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso across human, mouse and rat zzso zzso deletion mapping of the rat promoter identified regions which enhance and repress promoter activity, with no apparent zzso or zzso Nuclear zzso analysis probing different regions of the gene suggests that zzso control plays a role in the induction of zzso by zzso
