In this study we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso bond located in the zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso a bond immediately upstream of the zzso bond, shown previously to be the site of action by zzso zzso zzso We have also shown that human zzso injected into the tail vein of control mice zzso degradation as reflected by the appearance of zzso fragments in the plasma and in the urine of these zzso To define whether either or both of these zzso may be responsible for the in zzso zzso zzso we injected zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and litter zzso all of the same strain, with either zzso zzso full-length free zzso or its zzso fragment, zzso obtained by the in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso In the plasma of zzso mice, F1 was detected in control and zzso zzso mice but was virtually absent in the zzso zzso Moreover, fragments of the F1 type were present in the urine of the animals except for the zzso zzso These fragments were significantly smaller in size than those observed in the zzso All of the animals injected with F1 exhibited small sized fragments in their zzso These observations provide evidence that, in the mouse strain used, zzso plays an important role in the generation of F1 from injected human zzso and that this zzso zzso further zzso during zzso transit via a mechanism that is neither zzso nor zzso Thus, factors influencing the expression of zzso may have a modulating action on the biology of zzso
