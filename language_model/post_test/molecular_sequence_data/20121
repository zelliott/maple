The development of zzso with high affinity and specificity to the zzso of zzso C virus zzso is important for the early stage diagnosis of its zzso zzso are short, zzso zzso with the ability to specifically recognize target molecules with high zzso zzso we report the selection of zzso zzso that bind to the core zzso of zzso High affinity zzso were isolated from a zzso random library of 60 zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso the selected zzso specifically bound to the core zzso but not to another zzso zzso zzso in a protein zzso zzso Using these zzso we developed an zzso zzso for zzso diagnosis and detected the core zzso from zzso infected patients' zzso with good zzso This novel zzso zzso detection sensor could be applied to the early diagnosis of zzso zzso
