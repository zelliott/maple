The type III zzso system zzso is a complex zzso machinery employed by a number of zzso species to initiate zzso zzso zzso through the system are zzso in the bacterial zzso and zzso the zzso to pass through both bacterial zzso and the zzso thus being introduced directly into the zzso zzso A key element of the zzso of all bacterial pathogens is the zzso which comprises a pore that is inserted into the membrane of the target cell, allowing toxin zzso Three zzso partners associate to form the zzso two are zzso and one is zzso and the latter also associates with the zzso zzso In this review, we discuss recent advances on the zzso and structural characterization of the proteins involved in zzso formation, as well as their participation in the modification of zzso zzso pathways upon zzso Models of zzso assembly and regulation are also zzso
