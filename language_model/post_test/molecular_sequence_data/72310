zzso and zzso neuroendocrine cells within the zzso nucleus display distinctive zzso properties and differential responses to selected zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine if these differences might be due to zzso zzso zzso we compared the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso identified zzso and zzso neuroendocrine zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso which was equally expressed in both zzso and zzso cells, zzso and zzso displayed very different expression zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso comprised the majority zzso of the total zzso expression with zzso and zzso contributing zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso higher zzso zzso approximately half as much zzso zzso zzso and equivalent zzso zzso In zzso expression studies have shown that the zzso zzso combination exhibits weaker zzso block and higher affinity for zzso than zzso Thus, the high expression of zzso in zzso cells relative to zzso cells may make these cells more susceptible to zzso zzso These observations in zzso and zzso cells provide the basis for a working model to investigate how differential zzso zzso composition may shape the zzso properties of zzso
