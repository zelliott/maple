The effects of zzso zzso B zzso a zzso zzso bacterial zzso on expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined in cultured normal and transformed zzso zzso human zzso by flow zzso zzso zzso digital image processing, and reverse zzso chain zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso normal zzso and zzso cells in a zzso manner, but not in the zzso zzso zzso Other toxins such as diphtheria and zzso toxins did not have the zzso The distribution of zzso and zzso molecules was identical on the zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso Digital image processing analysis demonstrated that zzso induced a transient increase of zzso calcium concentration only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso complex class II zzso zzso completely blocked the effect of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso normal zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso presumably via major zzso complex class II molecules such as zzso triggers calcium zzso and zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso We speculate that, in various zzso disorders, zzso zzso the zzso and interacts with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso thus modulating the course of the inflammatory zzso
