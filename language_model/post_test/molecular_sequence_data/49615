We used zzso zzso analysis zzso to identify zzso markers associated with zzso tolerance in zzso Two DNA pools zzso and zzso were established from the selected zzso individuals of crosses between zzso and zzso wheat parental zzso on the basis of the zzso zzso zzso leaf size, and relative water zzso All three traits were previously shown to be associated with zzso tolerance on segregating zzso progeny of the wheat crosses used in this zzso zzso analysis was then performed on the established DNA pools, using 35 primer pairs that included all of the zzso group 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso fragments that were present, zzso or both in the DNA pools and their parental zzso We identified one zzso zzso that was present in tolerant parent wheat and the tolerant bulk but absent in the sensitive parent wheat and sensitive zzso We then followed the segregation of this marker in the tolerant zzso zzso Use of this marker may significantly enhance the success of selection for zzso and zzso zzso in wheat breeding zzso
