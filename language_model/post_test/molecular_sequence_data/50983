zzso locus zzso element zzso zzso altering eye development, and zzso affecting wing and zzso development, are modified by zzso at zzso It is shown that two zzso zzso of zzso involve single zzso acid zzso in the 4th zzso and 9th zzso zzso elements of the Delta zzso zzso cells producing zzso or zzso zzso with cells producing zzso Delta or zzso zzso and zzso cells adhere to cells producing zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso are each defective in promoting these cell zzso as none of the zzso proteins can compete with the corresponding zzso proteins for formation of cell zzso Thus, widely separated zzso elements of zzso and Delta appear to participate in functional molecular interactions between the zzso zzso does not improve zzso of zzso in zzso so suppression in zzso may involve altered zzso signaling by zzso complexes, rather than modified cell zzso
