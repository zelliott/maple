We have examined the cell zzso regulation of the human BK virus zzso zzso This zzso functions efficiently in zzso to activate expression from the zzso major late promoter in the human kidney cell line, zzso and in a monkey kidney cell line, zzso but not in the zzso cell zzso In gel zzso migration zzso specific zzso zzso complexes could be observed by using nuclear extracts prepared from each cell zzso Moreover, a unique zzso complex was observed by using the zzso cell nuclear zzso By zzso footprint analysis, four binding regions for zzso cell nuclear proteins were defined within the zzso zzso repeat zzso Two of the protected regions zzso nuclear factor 1 or zzso zzso factor binding zzso These nuclear factor 1 sites also were protected by nuclear proteins from the zzso and zzso cell zzso The other two protected sites zzso a region of symmetry which included a sequence similar to the zzso virus 40 zzso zzso motif and to a zzso sequence present upstream or within the zzso of several cellular zzso These two sites were not protected by either the zzso or zzso nuclear zzso Competition studies in zzso cells indicated that the reduced activity of the zzso zzso in the zzso cell line was due to negative zzso Further, we have demonstrated that binding of a nuclear zzso to the zzso zzso site is involved in the repression of zzso zzso
