Rate variation in genes from all three zzso has been observed frequently in plant lineages with a zzso and zzso mode of zzso While the loss of zzso ability leads to a relaxation of evolutionary constraints in genes involved in the zzso apparatus, it remains to be determined how prevalent increased substitution rates are in nuclear DNA of zzso zzso In this study we zzso rates of molecular evolution of zzso zzso of all zzso and zzso plant families (except zzso and zzso using relative rate zzso In several zzso and zzso plant lineages extremely high substitution rates are observed compared to other zzso zzso The position and frequency of these zzso have been identified to understand the zzso dynamics of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Despite the presence of significantly elevated substitution rates, very few zzso occur in major functional and structural regions of the small zzso zzso providing evidence that the efficiency of the zzso apparatus in zzso plants has not been zzso
