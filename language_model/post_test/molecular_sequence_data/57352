The zzso sequence of an isolate of zzso zzso virus zzso from the serum of a zzso trapped in New York state zzso was compared with the sequences of previously published zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was closest to that of an isolate originating from New Jersey: the two zzso shared a 15 zzso zzso deletion in the region where the zzso and zzso genes overlap zzso zzso and differed by 54 point zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid differences ranged from zzso in the surface gene to zzso in the X zzso Three zzso from zzso that originated in Pennsylvania and Maryland did not contain the deletion and differed from zzso by 102 to 106 point zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso acid changes ranged from zzso in the core gene to zzso in the zzso Thus, zzso differed little from previous zzso Next, the zzso from 102 independent clones of zzso were compared to ascertain the extent of sequence variation among zzso zzso in a chronically infected zzso A total of 98 clones had zzso of unit length while 2 clones had zzso shorter than unit length and 2 clones had zzso longer than unit zzso The clones not of unit length possessed deletions or zzso zzso of zzso The rate of zzso in the viral genes was zzso zzso per 10,000 zzso in the zzso domain, zzso per 10,000 in the zzso zzso per 10,000 in the zzso zzso and zzso per 10,000 at the zzso end of the core zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
