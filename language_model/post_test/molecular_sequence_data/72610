The zzso of zzso represents the final step of zzso zzso in bacteria and zzso It is zzso by the sequential action of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which form a zzso zzso zzso complex in zzso SAT and zzso from zzso zzso have previously been zzso and now the first evidence is presented for the zzso complex and SAT zzso in zzso employing the zzso zzso zzso Application of this method proved to be an efficient tool for the analysis of zzso interactions within a plant zzso protein zzso zzso of SAT domain structure revealed two new, independent zzso with specific functions in zzso zzso Analysis using truncated proteins proved the zzso of SAT to be sufficient for association with zzso and to correlate with the putative zzso activity zzso zzso interaction was localized in the central region of the protein and occurred also between SAT zzso Both protein interaction zzso coincided with distinct zzso and zzso clusters and together correlated with the minimal protein structure required for SAT zzso as shown by functional zzso of an zzso coli zzso The zzso and zzso properties are discussed with respect to the assumed function of the zzso complex in zzso channeling and zzso of SAT by interaction with zzso
