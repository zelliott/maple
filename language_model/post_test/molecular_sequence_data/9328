Nine types of zzso bacterial strains were isolated from 3 zzso soil samples taken from zzso plants in the zzso National zzso Nature Reserve of zzso Most zzso belonged to zzso zzso showing that these environments constituted favorable niches for such abundant zzso zzso New members of the zzso were also zzso Using a soil DNA extraction and zzso approach, 135 clones were analyzed by restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis, and 27 unique zzso sequence zzso were identified, most of which were closely related to sequences from zzso zzso The diversity of zzso bacteria was assessed by constructing zzso zzso trees from sequences of all zzso and clones in this work, together with related zzso sequences from other zzso zzso in zzso The zzso diversity varied among soil samples, with distinct zzso properties within a zzso zzso When comparing different zzso zzso the zzso gene sequences from a specific site tended to cluster as individual zzso The results provided interesting data and novel information on our understanding of zzso community diversity in the zzso zzso
