The human zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in resistance to zzso zzso Here we present molecular models of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso based on a wide open zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso which were constructed in order to zzso differences in the zzso and molecular features of their drug recognition zzso As a quality assurance of the methodology, the zzso model was compared to an zzso X-ray crystal structure, and with published zzso and site directed zzso data of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a putative zzso recognition site in the zzso model, which is confirmed by both the zzso X-ray crystal structure and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso models display distinct differences in the zzso properties of their drug recognition zzso
