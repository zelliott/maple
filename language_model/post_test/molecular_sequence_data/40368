A zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso soil from zzso zzso Province, zzso Its zzso zzso and zzso features and zzso zzso gene sequence were zzso zzso of the strain were zzso and cells were zzso zzso and zzso The strain required at least zzso M zzso for growth, with optimal growth occurring in zzso M zzso Growth was observed at zzso and pH zzso with optimal growth at zzso and pH zzso The zzso content of its zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso is associated with the zzso zzso and zzso and is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso of strain zzso to type strains of related species of the zzso zzso or zzso was less than zzso Furthermore, the cellular polar lipids of strain zzso identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were consistent with the polar zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso assessment and zzso data showed that zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
