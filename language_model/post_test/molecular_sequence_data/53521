The zzso structure of zzso zzso within zzso was examined by zzso the zzso sequences of 15 zzso described species and four zzso All but one of the zzso strains formed a tight zzso as had previously been demonstrated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso relationships deduced from the zzso zzso were different from those based on their zzso zzso zzso To examine which zzso would be more relevant for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were zzso The zzso zzso agrees with the results of the zzso zzso studies, indicating that this zzso method is useful for zzso the zzso relationships of high zzso zzso bacteria at the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was reclassified into the following 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
