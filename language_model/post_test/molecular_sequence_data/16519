zzso zzso are responsible for most cases of zzso dominant inherited forms of early onset zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso zzso processing, zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso regulate zzso are not fully zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso regulates the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso through direct interaction with its regulatory zzso zzso We show that a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso tail of zzso dramatically increases the zzso activity of zzso toward the inhibitor of zzso proteins and zzso and zzso cell death in an zzso zzso zzso with these results, zzso expression of full-length zzso but not zzso lacking the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Our results suggest that the C zzso of zzso is an zzso zzso zzso for the zzso domain of zzso and may regulate the zzso activity of zzso after its release from the zzso during zzso This mechanism of zzso zzso is similar to the mechanism of zzso of the related bacterial zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
