The zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso for 23 strains (21 were zzso and two were zzso zzso isolated from zzso of common and netted zzso in France and 19 strains from other countries, including type strains of zzso zzso Three zzso were defined within the conventional species of zzso zzso and these zzso were different from other zzso described species zzso zzso zzso zzso based on previously published zzso zzso Two of these zzso (1 and 3) zzso to new species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso (with type strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (with type strain zzso zzso are zzso zzso 2 zzso to zzso zzso (with type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and includes only one French zzso The zzso strains associated with netted zzso zzso constituted a new species that was named zzso zzso zzso zzso (with type strain zzso zzso The zzso content of DNA from the three strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the type strain zzso zzso was very similar to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso was very similar to the type strain of zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene zzso the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso differed extensively from the other strains of zzso zzso
