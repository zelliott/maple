The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso is expressed as an zzso zzso zzso within the zzso acid open reading frame of the zzso zzso The two known protein zzso for this zzso are the zzso itself and the zzso assembly protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso 65, zzso In this report we describe the use of a rapid and quantitative zzso for characterizing the zzso The zzso uses a zzso zzso fusion protein containing the zzso zzso site of zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso consists of zzso the zzso 247 zzso acid zzso domain of the zzso gene product, also expressed as a zzso fusion zzso Upon zzso with zzso a single zzso zzso is released from zzso which is soluble in zzso zzso Using this zzso the zzso displayed a pH optimum between 7 and 9 but most zzso had an absolute requirement for high zzso of an zzso zzso Strong zzso out zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso activity, whereas zzso and zzso had no zzso The degree of stimulation by zzso M zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Using the fluorescent probe zzso zzso the zzso was shown to bind the dye in the presence of zzso M zzso or zzso but not at low zzso strength or in the presence of zzso or zzso M zzso This binding was most likely at the zzso active site because a high affinity zzso site zzso but not a control zzso could zzso the zzso In addition to zzso zzso the zzso zzso virus type I zzso also zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the zzso to be primarily random zzso under zzso conditions, suggesting that zzso agents affect the zzso of the zzso as well as the zzso
