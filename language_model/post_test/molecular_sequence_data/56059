The mechanism of zzso production in zzso diseases is not well zzso In the present study we performed the B cell zzso mapping of the zzso small nuclear zzso zzso one of the target molecules of zzso zzso to investigate how B cells respond to the zzso After cloning and expression of a full length complementary DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso several truncated zzso of the zzso were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso Although a few zzso were distributed on the whole zzso all zzso protein zzso patients' zzso tested recognized the region between zzso acid zzso 102 and 125 of the coding zzso This universal zzso region contains an zzso acid sequence similar to that of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso The peptides representing each zzso were zzso to each zzso In addition this region zzso to the zzso zzso These observations suggest that molecular mimicry might be involved in the initiation of zzso production, followed by zzso events between the zzso and by zzso mechanisms to generate more complicated zzso patterns against the zzso zzso zzso
