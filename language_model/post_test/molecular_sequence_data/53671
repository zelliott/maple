The inverse relationship between high density zzso zzso plasma levels and coronary heart disease has been attributed to the role that HDL and its major zzso zzso zzso zzso play in reverse cholesterol transport zzso The efficiency of zzso depends on the specific ability of zzso to promote cellular cholesterol zzso bind zzso activate zzso zzso zzso and form mature HDL that interact with specific receptors and zzso transfer zzso From the intensive analysis of zzso secondary structure has emerged our current understanding of its different classes of zzso zzso which control zzso zzso The main challenge now is to define zzso zzso structure in its zzso and zzso zzso Two models are considered for zzso zzso formed by association of two zzso with zzso In the first or zzso fence model, each zzso wraps around the disc with zzso adjacent zzso and with little zzso zzso In the second or belt model, two zzso zzso are paired by their zzso zzso wrap around the zzso and are stabilized by multiple zzso zzso While recent evidence supports the belt model, other models, including hybrid models, cannot be zzso zzso zzso control zzso binding and association with varying levels of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are recognized as important for the initial association with zzso In the central domain, zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso are also very important for zzso binding and the formation of mature zzso whereas zzso between zzso 144 and 186 contribute zzso The zzso zzso domain has now been clearly assigned to zzso zzso with secondary contribution by zzso zzso The lower zzso binding affinity of the region zzso may be important to the zzso mechanism allowing displacement of these zzso zzso by zzso and presentation of the zzso zzso No specific sequence has been found that affects zzso zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso known to be important for zzso binding and maintenance of HDL in zzso are also involved in the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso and specific zzso zzso While much progress has been made, other aspects of zzso zzso relationships still need to be zzso particularly its zzso zzso and its interaction with other zzso zzso transfer proteins and receptors important for HDL zzso
