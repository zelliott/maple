A novel series of zzso zzso named zzso have been zzso These zzso enable one to introduce not only zzso of genes with zzso maintenance but also a single copy with zzso integration into the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso plasmids can be easily converted to fragments for zzso integration by zzso of the plasmids with a certain restriction zzso before transformation of the zzso zzso The zzso fragments, lacking the autonomously replicating zzso are designed for targeting into the zzso zzso locus by zzso zzso Whether the zzso are the results of zzso maintenance of the zzso or zzso gene targeting can be readily checked by their requirement for zzso or zzso or by the zzso diagnostic zzso Furthermore, we propose the use of zzso derivatives for zzso zzso tagging of a gene to introduce several tags into zzso of a zzso employing a set of zzso Using these zzso zzso a suitable mode of expression of a cloned gene can be selected for individual analysis without any complicated zzso zzso
