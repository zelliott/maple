The zzso DNA of zzso zzso termed zzso DNA zzso is unique in its structure, function, and mode of zzso zzso is a massive network, composed of thousands of zzso zzso DNA circles, which resembles the chain mail of medieval zzso Each cell contains one network condensed into a zzso structure within the zzso of its single zzso The zzso circles are of two types, zzso present in a few dozen copies and zzso present in several thousand zzso The zzso which zzso zzso zzso and a few zzso zzso are similar in structure and genetic function to the zzso DNA of other zzso Many zzso transcripts undergo editing, a remarkable process involving the zzso or deletion of zzso zzso at specific zzso The zzso zzso small guide zzso that control the specificity of zzso During zzso zzso zzso closed zzso are released from the network by a zzso zzso The free zzso replicate as zzso within one of two complexes of replication proteins that are positioned on opposite sides of the zzso zzso The progeny zzso which contain nicks or gaps, are attached to the network zzso zzso also replicate as zzso but they remain linked to the zzso As replication zzso the number of zzso and zzso zzso When the network has doubled in size, all of the zzso nicks and gaps are zzso and the network splits in zzso The two progeny networks then segregate into the daughter zzso
