zzso are zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso from the zzso of the Central Asian zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity against zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso at zzso zzso In this work, we investigated the role of the hinge in zzso zzso zzso zzso which adopts a zzso zzso in zzso zzso on zzso interactions and its potential effect on the selective toxicity of the zzso A modified zzso zzso zzso obtained by replacing the zzso at position 11 with zzso zzso zzso adopts a more rigid structure due to the reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with atomic force zzso and X-ray zzso electron zzso zzso indicate that both peptides bind and insert zzso into zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be more disruptive of supported zzso zzso modeling zzso cell zzso However, no considerable difference in zzso activity of the two peptides toward bacterial membrane was zzso zzso the data indicate that decrease in the flexibility of zzso induced by the modification in the hinge region is likely to increase the zzso zzso interactions with zzso cell zzso and potentially increase its toxicity against zzso zzso
