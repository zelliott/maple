zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in the zzso of asthma and other conditions characterized by recruitment of zzso T cells to sites of zzso It is zzso that zzso is an zzso zzso although other receptors or zzso may zzso Among several known functions, zzso is a zzso factor for zzso T cells and it zzso zzso We previously reported that an zzso corresponding to the 16 zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify functional zzso with greater precision, shorter zzso containing native or zzso zzso zzso sequences were tested for zzso zzso Within the 16 zzso zzso the minimal zzso zzso zzso to zzso to zzso was shown to mediate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was lost when either zzso was zzso with zzso Point zzso in zzso revealed that zzso is critical for zzso activity, but zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso of zzso or even deletion of the zzso tail through zzso zzso of 12 or 22 zzso zzso of zzso had no impact on zzso activity, but zzso zzso was zzso zzso of 16 zzso plus 12 zzso zzso abolished both zzso and zzso activity of zzso These data indicate that zzso interactions with zzso that activate T cell migration are not identical with those required for zzso zzso and suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso participate in zzso binding or zzso
