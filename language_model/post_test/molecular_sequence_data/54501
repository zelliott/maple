Group C zzso zzso zzso causes sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute zzso in humans worldwide, but has not been detected among children in South zzso The present study aimed to detect zzso RV among children hospitalized with zzso in South Korea and to perform a molecular characterization of zzso RV zzso From November 2003 to January 2006, 434 zzso samples were collected from children zzso years of age who were hospitalized for treatment of acute zzso and screened for group C and A zzso by zzso zzso zzso RV strains were characterized by sequence and zzso zzso the 434 samples screened, two were positive for zzso RV and one had a mixed zzso and zzso RV zzso One of the zzso zzso shared high sequence conservation in zzso zzso and zzso genes with other published zzso zzso This is the first report describing the molecular characteristics of zzso RV among children in South zzso Additional surveillance is needed to determine the burden of zzso RV zzso
