The zzso coli zzso zzso B zzso zzso has been used as a model zzso for the production of zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso with its native signal zzso zzso has been shown to accumulate in starch zzso of transgenic zzso zzso To zzso the targeting properties of the bacterial zzso protein and zzso in plant systems, the zzso zzso of visual marker green fluorescent protein zzso fused to zzso and various combinations of signal peptides was examined in zzso zzso and transgenic zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso fusion proteins can assemble and fold properly retaining both the zzso of zzso and the zzso properties of zzso zzso kernel zzso revealed that transgenic lines carrying zzso result in zzso protein association with zzso and starch zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the fusion proteins accumulate in the zzso system of plant cells in a signal zzso zzso This is the first report providing evidence of the ability of a bacterial signal zzso to target proteins to the plant zzso zzso The results provide important insights for further understanding the zzso protein trafficking mechanisms and for developing effective strategies in molecular zzso
