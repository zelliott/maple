zzso valleys in dry areas of the Himalayas are among the most extreme, yet least explored environments on zzso These zzso rocky valleys are subjected to year-round temperature fluctuations across the freezing point and very low availability of water and zzso causing previous workers to zzso that no zzso life zzso zzso exists in these zzso However, there has been no work using modern zzso or zzso molecular methods to test the hypothesis that zzso are absent from high Himalayan soil zzso Here, we show that although microbial biomass levels are as low as those of the Dry zzso of zzso there are abundant microbial zzso displaying unexpected zzso diversity, in barren zzso from just below the permanent ice line of the central zzso Furthermore, we discovered that one of the dominant zzso zzso from the high Himalayas also contains the dominant algae in zzso surveys of both soil and ice samples from the Dry zzso of zzso revealing an unexpected link between these environmentally similar but geographically very distant zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that although this zzso zzso is globally distributed to other high-altitude and zzso soils, it shows significant genetic isolation by geographical distance patterns, indicating local adaptation and perhaps zzso in each zzso Our results are the first to demonstrate the remarkable similarities of microbial life of arid zzso of zzso and the high zzso Our findings are a starting point for future comparative studies of the dry valleys of the Himalayas and zzso that will yield new insights into the cold and dry limits to life on zzso
