zzso sodium zzso channels play a central role in the propagation of action zzso in excitable cells in both humans and zzso Many zzso animals have therefore evolved toxins that zzso the activity of zzso channels in order to subdue their prey and deter zzso zzso zzso in particular are rich in zzso channel zzso with one-third of all known zzso channel toxins from zzso zzso acting on zzso zzso Here we review the landscape of zzso peptides that have so far been described to target zzso or zzso zzso zzso These peptides fall into 12 distinct families based on their primary structure and zzso zzso Some of these peptides have become useful pharmacological tools, while others have potential as therapeutic leads because they target specific zzso channel zzso that are considered to be important zzso zzso zzso zzso are conservatively predicted to contain more than 10 million zzso peptides and so far only zzso of this diversity been zzso Thus, it is likely that future research will reveal additional structural classes of zzso peptides that target zzso zzso
