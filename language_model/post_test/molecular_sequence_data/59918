zzso strain 124 is able to convert zzso into zzso via the actions of at least two zzso systems and a putative zzso zzso We have identified a zzso clone from 124 zzso DNA that is able to zzso the ability to convert zzso to zzso upon zzso zzso zzso a strain that normally can not convert or metabolize zzso zzso analysis reveals that the transformed zzso strain produces zzso suggesting that the zzso clone encodes a zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a portion of this clone confirmed the presence of genes for the zzso as well as genes zzso a zzso and putative zzso These genes will be useful for manipulating zzso zzso in zzso strain zzso
