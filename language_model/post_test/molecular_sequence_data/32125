zzso zzso are zzso processed and small amounts of peptides captured by class II zzso zzso The details of zzso zzso zzso capture and how destruction of zzso zzso is avoided are incompletely zzso Using the zzso toxin zzso we show that the introduction of 3-6 zzso sites is sufficient to trigger a partially unfolded zzso able to bind to class II zzso zzso The known locations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites predict that large zzso of processed zzso zzso zzso are captured under these zzso zzso when zzso is bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso processing can trigger a concerted zzso reaction zzso zzso processed zzso is captured by zzso class II zzso zzso Early capture of minimally processed zzso and confinement of the processing and class II zzso loading reaction to the membrane plane may improve the likelihood of zzso zzso survival in the class II zzso zzso and may help explain the zzso relationships observed between zzso and zzso zzso in many protein zzso and zzso
