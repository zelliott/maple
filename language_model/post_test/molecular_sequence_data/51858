The zzso sequence of the zzso gene has been zzso It encodes a zzso protein precursor with a signal sequence and zzso site typical of a number of outer membrane zzso which are zzso by the equivalent of signal zzso II zzso of zzso zzso The location of the zzso gene is such that it is predicted to be zzso coupled to the zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that it forms part of an zzso Together with the zzso signal sequence and the several zzso zzso it seems likely that zzso is a zzso zzso membrane zzso
