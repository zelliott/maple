An zzso zzso of 1911 base pairs, upstream of the hip zzso in zzso coli at map position zzso has been zzso The protein zzso by this sequence is predicted to have a molecular mass of zzso Da and the zzso 276 zzso shows zzso and zzso identity with the import site proteins zzso and zzso from the zzso outer membrane of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso membrane proteins have been shown to be essential components of the protein zzso apparatus in zzso These similarities raise the possibility that zzso might represent the bacterial gene from which these zzso genes zzso
