zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso groups of zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso Here a zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and partially zzso The zzso exhibits an apparent molecular weight of approximately zzso At 37 degrees C it shows optimal activity at pH zzso Its pH stability and zzso stability are zzso zzso and zzso slightly enhance the activity of the zzso and zzso strongly zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso library was constructed and screened with a zzso probe zzso by zzso or with synthetic zzso derived from the zzso zzso sequence of the native zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso library and zzso These zzso exhibit features characteristic of zzso zzso zzso the presence of a zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and high zzso with various zzso zzso zzso The zzso were cloned in a zzso zzso expression system and produced as zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso (called zzso was active under the tested zzso It was zzso to zzso in a single step and further zzso The protein showed an apparent molecular mass of approximately zzso and, like the native zzso showed optimal activity at pH zzso at 37 degrees zzso It was strongly inhibited by zzso The isolation of several zzso zzso zzso from the same zzso is zzso
