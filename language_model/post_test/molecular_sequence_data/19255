zzso between salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso signaling is well-studied but not during leaf zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso factor interacts with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of these genes is zzso regulated in response to zzso and zzso respectively, and each zzso influences the zzso Leaf zzso is accelerated in zzso knockout plants zzso but retarded in zzso zzso zzso with the reverse true for zzso zzso showed higher resistance than zzso to bacterial and zzso zzso However, pathogen resistance was not altered in zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has a greater impact on zzso function in zzso than zzso on zzso function in pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding in zzso and their interaction is localized to the nucleus in zzso however, zzso is exclusively in the zzso in zzso cells, indicating that zzso is brought to the nucleus by the zzso zzso zzso has dual zzso as zzso zzso and as negative regulator of zzso in the zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso mediate negative zzso between pathogen resistance and zzso which is most likely governed by the zzso and zzso zzso
