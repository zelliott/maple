Kappa and zzso the two types of zzso light zzso chains present in zzso contribute differently to the L chain pool of each zzso Here we show that the extreme preponderance of zzso in the mouse results from programmed sequential zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso prerequisite of zzso monitored by analyzing zzso of zzso zzso zzso Upon in zzso differentiation of a zzso zzso line, zzso transcripts of the zzso zzso zzso that are newly described here, became zzso 2 days later than their counterparts of zzso zzso Clear differences could also be observed in zzso zzso transcripts of zzso were already present in large zzso zzso zzso zzso cells whereas zzso zzso transcripts first became zzso at the consecutive zzso stage of small zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso pattern was found to be identical in mice which can not rearrange zzso due to a targeted deletion or zzso of zzso This suggests that zzso cells follow a zzso mechanism of development which includes programmed transitions and differential zzso of the L chain zzso zzso zzso first, then zzso Thus, privileged zzso of zzso might be the decisive factor in setting the zzso ratio of zzso to zzso present in the zzso
