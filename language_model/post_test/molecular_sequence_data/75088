To gain insight into factors associated with the excessive zzso of zzso in the zzso disease zzso brain, the present studies were initiated to distinguish between a unique primary structure of the zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso a zzso other zzso that may affect zzso zzso Previous molecular cloning experiments focused on zzso derived from sources other than zzso zzso In the present work, we cloned and characterized zzso zzso derived directly from zzso brain zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was used for the preparation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An insert of zzso zzso was isolated that included the zzso domain and corresponded to zzso of the coding region and approximately equal to zzso of the zzso region of the fetal precursor zzso zzso reported by zzso On zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso consisted of a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In control and zzso cases, the zzso zzso levels were zzso and were independent of zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence analysis data, we conclude that a segment of the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso zzso as a high molecular weight precursor zzso with major coding and zzso regions that are identical to the fetal brain gene zzso
