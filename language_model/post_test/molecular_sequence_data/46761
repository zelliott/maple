zzso and 35 zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso were zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso All cell zzso zzso receptors bound zzso zzso with similar affinities as zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso did not affect the zzso zzso G protein zzso was examined by quantitative analysis of zzso increase in binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The most prominent zzso zzso zzso were located in the zzso part of the second zzso domain zzso and zzso and the zzso interface of the third zzso domain zzso and zzso In addition, less pronounced zzso was detected with deletion zzso in the third zzso loop and in the zzso zzso Further analysis of some of the zzso that were judged to be zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso were found to zzso a zzso as evidenced by zzso calcium zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Thus, these single point zzso in zzso did not completely abolish the interaction with G zzso emphasizing that the zzso site is coordinated by several different regions of the zzso zzso located in the putative fifth and sixth zzso zzso near the zzso and zzso parts of the third zzso loop did not result in zzso These regions have previously been shown to be critical for G protein zzso to many other G zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to have a G zzso site distinct from the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
