Alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso (formerly zzso urinary zzso zzso inhibitor zzso of zzso zzso are abundant serum zzso They belong to two distinct protein families, the zzso family, a family of transport proteins for small zzso molecules and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso result from a common zzso Now we have isolated and zzso the human gene coding for this precursor zzso The gene consists of 10 zzso which span zzso zzso and 9 zzso with an zzso length of about zzso zzso The largest zzso zzso zzso separates zzso 6 zzso for the zzso sequence of alpha zzso from zzso 7 zzso for a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA sequences of the zzso occur downstream of the zzso site, within zzso 4 and 6, and upstream of the putative promoter region which has been defined by sequence comparison and zzso start site zzso The gene also contains several sequence motifs reminiscent to known zzso zzso
