The zzso proteins zzso form a group of zzso zzso zzso proteins which belong to the family of zzso zzso Like other members of this family, human zzso protein 1 zzso shows zzso zzso that stimulates the zzso activity of the zzso A unique feature of the zzso is their ability to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso In order to zzso the relationship between these findings, we designed point zzso in the zzso loop zzso as well as in the switch I and switch II regions of the protein based on the crystal structure of zzso These zzso proteins were zzso for their interaction with zzso zzso labeled with a zzso dye and for their ability to zzso zzso in a cooperative zzso We identified zzso of zzso acid zzso that decrease zzso activity by orders of magnitude a part of which are zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso in the zzso were characterized that strongly impair binding of zzso In consequence, together with altered zzso activity and given cellular zzso zzso this results in zzso zzso zzso resting in the zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso bound form zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we addressed the impact on protein zzso In zzso zzso of zzso were identified and zzso characterized providing zzso locked in defined states in order to investigate their functional role in future cell biology zzso
