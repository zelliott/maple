Several zzso zzso complexes, including the zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso for zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso a new zzso zzso is essential for zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso is sufficient for normal function, and zzso interacts functionally and physically with an essential zzso zzso in a novel zzso complex called zzso (for zzso the structure of zzso A zzso zzso zzso arrests cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, and the zzso protein is specifically zzso in the zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate a link between zzso zzso and progression through the cell division cycle, providing genetic clues to possible targets for zzso zzso
