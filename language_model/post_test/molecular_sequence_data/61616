A family 36 zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed a high degree of identity with zzso zzso zzso from another species, zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso and zzso but showed no activity on zzso indicating that the zzso was zzso not zzso zzso In the synthetic reaction, the zzso was active with zzso zzso as the donor zzso as well as zzso to produce zzso with zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso allowed zzso of zzso as the zzso zzso with zzso activities of zzso zzso parameters of zzso in the zzso and zzso in the synthetic reaction were determined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthetic reaction, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of the zzso reaction followed a sequential zzso zzso zzso as frequently observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was observed in the synthetic zzso The zzso was considered a unique zzso for zzso
