zzso disease is an zzso zzso disease characterized by excessive cerebral zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso in man requires zzso A zzso and a protein zzso the zzso zzso Thus, zzso disease can be caused by the zzso of either zzso or the zzso zzso The same zzso found in mouse shares zzso zzso acid identity zzso zzso zzso with the human zzso Between the two zzso the mouse zzso zzso can effectively stimulate the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and, to a lesser extent, also stimulate zzso to zzso zzso whereas the human zzso is ineffective in stimulating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso and Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the role of these two zzso in stimulating the zzso of zzso and zzso we have constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso and studied their zzso We have identified a narrow region zzso in the mouse zzso sequence that might be responsible for stimulating the zzso of zzso Replacement of the corresponding site in the human sequence with the specific mouse sequence converted the ineffective human zzso into an effective zzso protein for stimulating the zzso of zzso This zzso zzso zzso like the mouse zzso is also able to stimulate the zzso of zzso by zzso The mouse model of human type B zzso disease recently engineered by the targeted disruption of the zzso gene showed less severe clinical manifestation than found in human zzso This has been considered to be the result of the zzso of zzso via converting it to zzso and further zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso with the assistance of mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein that bears the characteristics of the mouse zzso zzso may therefore be able to induce an alternative zzso zzso for zzso in human type B zzso zzso
