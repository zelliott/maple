The human zzso containing zzso zzso protein zzso has over 100 zzso zzso with unknown zzso and biological zzso The zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso is a member of the zzso 4 (New zzso Family 4) in the zzso with unknown zzso and biological zzso Various high zzso studies indicate that zzso could be involved in various human diseases such as zzso cancer and zzso 

In this study, we found that the previously published coding sequence of the zzso gene is zzso The newly identified sequence of the zzso gene codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids with a zzso zzso of 133 zzso zzso It has been designated as zzso zzso zzso Since it is the first of further zzso zzso we termed it as zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso on zzso but not zzso (44 zzso was found to be expressed in all human cells studied zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso and was zzso after zzso with specific zzso zzso was localized in the nucleus and the zzso By combining zzso and gene structure pattern data and zzso searches, two further zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso and zzso were zzso All these protein zzso zzso were zzso throughout the zzso The zzso gene was specifically lost during zzso zzso zzso Using comparative zzso we have identified zzso sets of these three protein zzso genes and their possible zzso gene in two sea zzso zzso 

We found the full-length coding sequence of the zzso gene and termed it as zzso We identified a new third zzso zzso zzso in zzso and a possible zzso gene in sea zzso zzso This study will provide a comprehensive platform to explore the role of zzso zzso in cell functions and human zzso
