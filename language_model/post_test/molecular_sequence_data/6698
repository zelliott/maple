The signaling mechanisms responsible for the induced expression of zzso zzso genes by viral infection or zzso zzso zzso are not well zzso Here we investigate the role of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Biological activities attributed to zzso include regulating protein zzso zzso zzso actions, and functioning as a possible tumor zzso Since binding of zzso is required for its zzso zzso has been considered as a candidate signal zzso for regulating zzso zzso To examine this role of zzso zzso zzso in stable zzso of zzso zzso cells were achieved by two different strategies, zzso of an zzso zzso transcript or a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso Both types of zzso cells were more zzso for viral replication than the control zzso zzso As the result of zzso loss, they also showed impaired induction of zzso and zzso genes in response to several zzso zzso virus, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, while zzso induction by zzso was impaired in zzso cells, zzso induction remained zzso Loss of zzso function also resulted in decreased zzso activity as zzso by zzso and, to a greater extent, by zzso These results zzso zzso in the regulation of several zzso zzso
