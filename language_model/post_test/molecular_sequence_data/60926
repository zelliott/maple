Several genes zzso putative zzso zzso from different organisms, including zzso have been identified by sequence zzso with the recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso inserted in the expression zzso zzso and the corresponding protein was zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to apparent zzso by zzso affinity zzso on zzso zzso The activity and zzso specificity of the zzso zzso were tested in zzso using zzso transcripts of different zzso zzso as zzso and zzso as a donor of the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso that is capable of zzso zzso to zzso at several positions in different zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso occurs at all four positions zzso 40, 48, and 49) at which zzso has been found in zzso zzso zzso so zzso zzso of the zzso zzso leads to the complete absence of zzso in total zzso zzso zzso no zzso activity towards all potential zzso zzso sites was detected in the extract of the disrupted zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the protein product of a single gene is responsible for complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso Because this newly characterized zzso modification zzso zzso is the fourth zzso zzso identified in zzso we suggest designating it as zzso the gene corresponding to zzso zzso
