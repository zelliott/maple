zzso B virus zzso harboring zzso zzso in the zzso promoter have been detected in zzso zzso B as well as in zzso persistent zzso However, it has not been demonstrated that zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso promoter cause various disease zzso We replaced the zzso promoter region of a zzso zzso with the most frequent naturally occurring zzso form and introduced it into zzso zzso The zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced less than one-fifth of the zzso level of zzso zzso the zzso generated zzso times more core particle zzso and showed a zzso zzso zzso protection and quantitative zzso zzso showed a 16- to zzso reduction of zzso transcripts and a zzso induction of C transcripts of the zzso compared to zzso The zzso transcript of the zzso had a more zzso zzso end than that of the zzso However, the zzso did not alter the initiation sites of C zzso When the promoter region was cloned into zzso zzso the zzso had dual effects on zzso and C promoter activities, decreasing and increasing them, zzso These results suggest that these zzso are responsible for the reduced zzso production as well as the enhanced replication and core zzso Analysis of zzso with either single point zzso showed that T at zzso is critical for the zzso zzso
