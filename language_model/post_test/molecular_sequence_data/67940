zzso zzso zzso which transport zzso zzso and vitamin zzso across the outer membrane of zzso bacteria, share a zzso architecture of a zzso zzso with an zzso plug domain zzso the zzso We previously reported that we could induce zzso to zzso open in zzso zzso zzso via the use of zzso and that these channels were responsive to zzso zzso of zzso Here we report that in the presence of zzso zzso can cleave the zzso 67 zzso of the plug of the zzso zzso zzso as assessed by gel shift and mass zzso zzso On the zzso zzso treatment in the presence of zzso resulted in the induced zzso no longer being reversed upon removal of zzso suggesting that zzso opens intact zzso channels by pulling the plug at least partly out of the barrel and that removal of the zzso then allows zzso of the plug into the zzso When expressed zzso the zzso plug domain was found to be a mostly unfolded structure that was able to zzso isolated zzso zzso inserted into the zzso Thus, although folded in the barrel, the plug need not be folded upon zzso the zzso The rate of zzso of the zzso into the membrane was tremendously increased in the presence of an zzso zzso provided by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso electron zzso showed that zzso in a zzso solution formed zzso thus explaining why an zzso zzso promoted the zzso of zzso into zzso
