The zzso zzso zzso zzso has not yet been fully zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso due to incomplete sequence information in zzso available zzso zzso Using a Rapid zzso of zzso zzso strategy we have confirmed the expression and complete zzso sequence for this zzso in zzso zzso tissue and activated zzso zzso conservation of the mature zzso zzso zzso was high when compared with human zzso although there was only zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the human zzso zzso consistent with reports of the evolutionary divergence of this zzso We also report the discovery of zzso a zzso zzso missing zzso 2, which directly translates to a truncated zzso zzso but which may also code for an alternative zzso that is translated downstream of the zzso zzso start zzso This putative gene product is predicted to maintain some, if not all, of the functions of zzso zzso and is the first zzso zzso reported outside of zzso zzso
