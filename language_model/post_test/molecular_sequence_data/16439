zzso are present in some human zzso They are spliced out during the maturation processes of zzso in a way that is irrelevant to their specific zzso zzso This unique characteristic of zzso zzso can be used for generation of small zzso zzso by replacing the zzso sequences with corresponding zzso zzso In this work, the zzso sequence of human zzso gene was replaced with a 20 zzso zzso sequence targeted to the zzso coding region of zzso zzso a zzso that was zzso in many zzso zzso zzso Under the control of zzso zzso promoter to further enhance zzso efficiency of the modified zzso gene and subsequent zzso generation, the zzso zzso exhibited obvious suppression of zzso D1 expression in zzso zzso zzso The growth of zzso tumors in mice was significantly inhibited when treated with naked zzso DNA harboring the zzso D1 zzso zzso generating zzso Such tumor growth zzso might be due to zzso caused by reduced zzso D1 expression as revealed by zzso analysis of tumor zzso
