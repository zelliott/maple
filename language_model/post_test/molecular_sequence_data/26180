It is shown here that plasmids containing the replication origin of zzso coli zzso cannot replicate in an zzso state in zzso coli cells with the zzso double zzso This zzso coli zzso is deficient in the zzso function of DNA zzso I zzso I) and is unable to produce functional zzso zzso The inability of the zzso zzso to replicate in the absence of zzso is dependent on the absence of Pol zzso cells with the zzso or zzso zzso which are deficient in the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso zzso respectively, can support replication of the zzso zzso We propose that zzso cells zzso an alternative zzso of the DNA replication in which Pol I is zzso In zzso DNA binding zzso revealed that the zzso binding site resides between the zzso coordinates 110 and 122 and is adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso Within the area protected by zzso we found at least 1 out of 11 zzso zzso sites present in zzso The consequences of lack of zzso protein binding to the zzso and the indirect effects of the zzso zzso on the zzso replication are zzso
