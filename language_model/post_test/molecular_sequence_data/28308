The zzso nuclear gene zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The identity of the gene is confirmed by the following zzso zzso The primary structure of the protein derived from the gene sequence is similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso disruption of zzso in a zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso a zzso zzso consistent with a zzso in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso from a zzso with a disrupted zzso copy of zzso are unable to zzso zzso zzso The primary structures of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the two types of zzso may have a common evolutionary zzso zzso of the current protein banks also have revealed a high degree of sequence similarity of the zzso zzso to the product of the zzso coli zzso gene and to the partial sequence of a protein zzso by an unidentified reading frame located adjacent to the zzso coli zzso zzso Based on the sequence similarities and the map positions of the zzso and zzso zzso we propose zzso to be the structural gene of the zzso expressed zzso zzso of zzso coli and the unidentified reading frame to be the structural gene of the zzso zzso zzso
