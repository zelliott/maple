We recently characterized a specific zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso This zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso Many bacterial members of this family are zzso as predicted zzso zzso because one of the founding members is zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The aim of the present study is to determine whether other members of the zzso protein family also have a zzso activity, if there are zzso activities in animal zzso and what zzso are responsible for these zzso 

zzso zzso were expressed and zzso as zzso or zzso fusion proteins and the zzso activities were determined by measuring the release of zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso coli zzso protein zzso is a specific zzso but it contributes only marginally to the total zzso activity in this zzso where the main zzso responsible for zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso zzso but this activity is low compared to its zzso zzso zzso Finally we demonstrate a high zzso activity in zzso and quail zzso particularly in the zzso We show that this activity is mainly due to zzso an zzso zzso in zzso tumors where it promotes cell zzso 

We show for the first time that zzso activities are widespread in bacteria and zzso We identified the zzso responsible for these activities but we were unable to detect significant amounts of zzso in zzso coli or brain extracts using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The role of these zzso may be to zzso zzso which could be zzso because of its high affinity for zzso thereby interfering with zzso zzso
