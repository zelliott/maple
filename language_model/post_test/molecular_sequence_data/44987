zzso diversity of zzso is generated from the limited genes by a combination of differential zzso and alternative zzso In the case of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso is specifically spliced in zzso zzso which is one of the major zzso zzso in smooth muscle zzso Here we demonstrate that expressions of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso regulated in association with zzso zzso of smooth muscle zzso zzso cloning and Western and Northern zzso have revealed that in addition to the zzso of zzso zzso converted to zzso and zzso by a zzso change from zzso zzso to zzso zzso during zzso of smooth muscle cells in zzso zzso a change of zzso zzso from high Mr type to low Mr type was also observed by alternative selection between zzso zzso and 4 in the zzso gene during this zzso In contrast, cultured smooth muscle cells maintaining a differentiated zzso continued to express zzso zzso and high Mr zzso In zzso zzso revealed specific zzso of zzso and high Mr zzso in smooth muscle in developing zzso These results suggest a common zzso mechanism for zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso in both visceral and vascular smooth muscle zzso
