We have compared the effects of a number of different zzso on the growth and zzso of normal finite life span and zzso transformed human zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences chosen initially for study were based on that of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso protein of unknown zzso We found that certain zzso zzso zzso zzso in length altered the zzso and decreased the growth rate of the normal cells in a zzso zzso These effects were zzso occurring within zzso h of zzso zzso The effects, which occurred without an accompanying zzso decrease in the levels of zzso zzso or zzso were most pronounced in the normal zzso cells, less apparent in the immortalized zzso cells, and zzso in normal breast zzso zzso sequences having mixed zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso alone, had little or no effect on normal zzso cell zzso or zzso Two out of seven additional zzso zzso which were not complementary to zzso zzso also affected normal zzso cell zzso and growth when used at similar zzso (10 zzso Taken together, the observed effects on normal zzso cells indicate that certain zzso zzso may have pharmacological consequences that do not depend on strict zzso of their sequences to known zzso
