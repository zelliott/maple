zzso zzso are zzso by an zzso richness and by a small zzso compared with other zzso zzso It has been suggested that the small zzso is mainly due to the lack of repetitive DNA zzso However, little information about repetitive DNA sequences in this zzso group is available at the molecular zzso Here we describe a zzso family of repetitive DNA sequences present in three species of the zzso zzso These repetitive sequences are zzso zzso rich, zzso in tandem and with a unit length of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that some of the zzso target sites present in these repetitive DNA sequences have zzso zzso and that there are small differences in the zzso pattern between zzso Several features of this family of repetitive sequences suggest that they evolved by concerted zzso
