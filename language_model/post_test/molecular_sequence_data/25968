The zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by direct zzso sequencing, using a modified zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicated that these three species represent a novel family in the gamma division of zzso On the basis of these data, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot retain their current generic status as they are not closely related to other members of their assigned zzso zzso we propose transfer of zzso zzso to the new zzso zzso as zzso zzso and transfer of zzso zzso to the new zzso zzso as zzso zzso and assign the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a new family, zzso in the gamma division of zzso
