zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor composed of zzso A, B, and C in zzso zzso A and C are zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and are therefore of interest for their potential roles in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso C interacts with both zzso A and zzso B, as well as with the von zzso tumor zzso protein zzso To investigate the corresponding interactions in zzso we have zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso experiments to examine complexes of zzso zzso C zzso with zzso zzso A zzso and two peptides from zzso regions of zzso and human zzso zzso alone is a zzso composed of zzso with a structured zzso region and a zzso unstable zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso or with a zzso zzso from zzso promotes folding of the zzso region of zzso into two regular zzso structures and zzso zzso into zzso Moreover, analysis of the complex of zzso with the full zzso domain of zzso reveals that the zzso zzso is zzso to zzso form an zzso zzso Thus, zzso C is found to zzso in solution and to undergo significant structural zzso upon binding of two different partner zzso These results suggest a structural basis for the interaction of an zzso protein with a zzso zzso and the zzso of this interaction by the tumor zzso zzso
