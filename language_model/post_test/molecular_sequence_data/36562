Two zzso zzso from human zzso zzso human plasma with synthetic peptides in the region zzso were found to recognize zzso zzso more strongly than the zzso form in an zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso zzso zzso which maps within this sequence to zzso recognized only zzso zzso after disruption of the zzso with sodium zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso did not recognize chemically zzso zzso zzso that had been treated with similar conditions used to disrupt the zzso zzso These results indicate that this zzso is zzso to binding by this zzso when zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso A significant proportion of this zzso was zzso when derived from chemically zzso zzso The region zzso within the zzso zzso fragment, contains the zzso zzso as well as two zzso zzso available for zzso This region is relatively zzso and has the propensity to form an zzso zzso
