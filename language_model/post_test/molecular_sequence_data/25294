We have zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso based on the consensus sequence of human alpha satellite DNA and constructed a clone of zzso or zzso sequence zzso Southern zzso analysis using the clone as a probe showed restriction site zzso in human DNA zzso by zzso or zzso The synthetic consensus unit could detect the alpha repeated zzso regions of all human zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Using the cells having a zzso X zzso we showed that the two zzso regions were stained with fluorescent alpha satellite DNA zzso Thus the probe would be useful to detect zzso abnormalities such as zzso
