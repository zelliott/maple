zzso is a response regulator protein of zzso zzso which is required for the zzso of several genes which are involved in zzso expression and in responses to environmental zzso Among these genes are zzso zzso and zzso The last is an zzso needed for the development of genetic zzso zzso production, and normal zzso We show here that partially zzso zzso zzso isolated from an zzso zzso coli strain, is zzso in zzso by incubation with zzso zzso and that zzso could bind specifically to a DNA zzso containing the promoter of zzso and associated zzso The binding affinity is enhanced when zzso is zzso zzso I protection analysis identified two protected sites located upstream from the zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso bonds induced by zzso binding which are located between the protected sequences is consistent with a model for zzso action involving the zzso of zzso
