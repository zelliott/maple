Recent studies have highlighted the structural requirements for T cell zzso and have revealed unusual modes of zzso for the zzso T zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and its B7 zzso These distinctive zzso structures potentially zzso both zzso and zzso with zzso binding properties, which suggests a number of zzso features relevant to zzso These include the potential to form a highly ordered, alternating network of zzso and B7 zzso that may represent the organization of these molecules and their associated signaling partners within the zzso zzso zzso sequence and structural considerations suggest that some aspects of the organizational and zzso features associated with the zzso complexes may extend to other members of the zzso zzso zzso An examination of the signaling mechanisms within the zzso zzso family provides an excellent framework to consider the general principles that are relevant to cell surface zzso signaling zzso
