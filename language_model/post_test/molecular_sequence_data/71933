A zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso containing the genes for zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and extreme zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso initiation on a DNA construct harboring the zzso A1 promoter was demonstrated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso analyses of the two largest zzso of bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed overall consistency with the zzso zzso zzso except for the positions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for the location of the root of the domain zzso In the zzso for both zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso was placed within the zzso bacteria below the zzso subdivision of the zzso No support was found for the zzso zzso hypothesis that zzso zzso might be the deepest branch of the zzso but the cell zzso zzso were found with a high confidence at the root of the zzso zzso This raised doubts not only about whether the original zzso were indeed like the zzso but also concerning the value of zzso zzso for hypotheses about the evolution of zzso
