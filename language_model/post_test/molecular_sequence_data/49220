The zzso are a diverse family of zzso that are related to zzso factors zzso but whose function is poorly zzso There are at least ten zzso in humans, two of which have zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The function of zzso is unknown, but zzso zzso has recently been found to interact with a number of zzso including the zzso domain that is present in a family of zzso long zzso zzso We find that in zzso the zzso targeting of zzso the only zzso zzso domain zzso is dependent on both zzso and zzso but not on the zzso zzso A zzso form of the zzso zzso domain binds to zzso in a zzso manner, but not to zzso zzso also contain a relative of zzso a protein proposed to bind human zzso but this zzso zzso zzso appears to bind zzso rather than zzso in zzso However, zzso is not the sole zzso of zzso since affinity zzso of zzso with immobilized zzso revealed an interaction with the zzso complex that is thought to act in the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso Finally, we find that zzso is required in zzso for the targeting of zzso explaining its requirement for the normal distribution of zzso
