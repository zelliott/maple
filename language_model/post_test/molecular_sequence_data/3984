In search of zzso proteins interacting with zzso zzso a zzso approach was applied, in which zzso zzso were incorporated into isolated zzso zzso Only a limited number of proteins were labeled upon zzso using either the PC analogue zzso or the small zzso probe zzso The most prominent difference was the very specific labeling of a 70 zzso protein by zzso Mass zzso analysis of a zzso digest of the corresponding zzso spot identified the protein as the zzso gene product, the zzso zzso zzso zzso This was confirmed by the lack of specific labeling in zzso from a zzso deletion zzso Only under conditions where the inner membrane was accessible to the probe, zzso was labeled by zzso in parallel with increased labeling of the zzso carrier zzso in the inner zzso A zzso version of zzso was shown to be zzso zzso extraction released the protein from the zzso whereas a high concentration of zzso did not, demonstrating that zzso is a peripheral membrane protein bound to the inner membrane via zzso zzso The significance of the observed interactions between zzso and PC is zzso
