The human zzso M zzso gene was found to zzso about zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing 11 zzso of which eight zzso zzso are common to all transcripts and contain the entire coding zzso We have cloned several alternative zzso of zzso transcripts that result from differential promoter usage and alternative zzso Although zzso belongs to the same zzso zzso as zzso their zzso structures differ zzso Multiple zzso start sites were found in the zzso gene that cluster in two regions separated by about 30 zzso and are flanked by two unique functional zzso One zzso is immediately upstream of the coding region and contains zzso sequences and a typical zzso box whereas the other zzso consists almost entirely of repetitive zzso zzso reporter zzso with zzso of the promoter regions showed they were both quite active in several cell zzso However, the zzso promoter was much stronger than the zzso one in two of the human cell lines tested zzso and zzso whereas both promoters were highly and equally active in the human zzso cell line zzso which has high zzso expression of zzso
