We have determined the zzso sequence of zzso zzso at the left part of the linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Computer analysis revealed that this zzso contains two open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso which contain 265 and zzso zzso zzso Data base search revealed that zzso and zzso might zzso proteins similar to the terminal protein zzso and DNA zzso respectively, of zzso zzso By using extracts of zzso zzso infected with zzso we demonstrated that zzso DNA replication occurs by a zzso mechanism in which these two viral proteins are zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso inhibited both the zzso initiation step and DNA zzso during zzso DNA zzso These results suggest the involvement of a zzso DNA zzso probably the product of the viral zzso in both stages of a replication process in which the zzso zzso replication at both DNA ends zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso we carried out a zzso analysis of the zzso DNA right end to determine the initiation site for zzso The results indicate that initiation of replication mainly occurs opposite the second zzso at the 3' end of the template, although the third zzso can be used as an alternative initiation zzso As in other zzso zzso a zzso mechanism is proposed to account for the maintenance of the DNA length at the zzso DNA zzso
