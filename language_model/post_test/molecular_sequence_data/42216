The zzso zzso zzso a single zzso that zzso five consecutive steps of the zzso aromatic zzso acid zzso pathway, has been cloned from the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso There is a single open reading frame of zzso zzso which includes an zzso of 45 zzso that does not introduce a stop zzso into the zzso Thus, the derived zzso acid sequence consists of zzso zzso which is highly zzso to all zzso zzso proteins studied to zzso These data support the view that zzso zzso is a fungus and imply that its aromatic zzso acid zzso is conventionally zzso
