zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso has been shown to be crucial for B cell development, zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene lead to zzso zzso in humans and zzso zzso in zzso Using a zzso approach, we present evidence here that zzso interacts physically with zzso a zzso integral membrane zzso which is the principal structural and regulatory component of zzso zzso In addition, we found that native zzso another member of the zzso family zzso is associated with zzso zzso in primary human zzso vein zzso zzso Second, in transient zzso zzso expression of zzso leads to a substantial reduction in the in zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and its zzso active form, zzso Furthermore, a zzso scaffolding zzso zzso acids zzso functionally suppressed the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Third, we demonstrate that mouse zzso zzso express substantial amounts of zzso Interestingly, zzso was found to be zzso zzso on zzso 14 in these zzso The expression of zzso in zzso and its interaction with zzso may have implications not only for B cell zzso and zzso but also for zzso zzso
