The brain is targeted by human zzso virus type 1 zzso during the course of zzso infection, leading to cognitive zzso neurological damage and zzso encephalitis zzso To study early dynamics of zzso entry into the brain, we examined a unique autopsy series of samples obtained from 15 zzso individuals who died in the zzso stages of infection from zzso zzso zzso was detected and zzso by limiting dilution zzso and genetically characterized in the zzso region of zzso zzso dilution was shown to be essential for correct zzso of genetic zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso While no actively expressing zzso cells were detected by zzso variable and generally extremely low levels of zzso DNA were detected in zzso brain zzso zzso region sequences were frequently genetically distinct from zzso zzso zzso with association index zzso values similar to those observed in cases of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the brain was strongly associated with expression of zzso markers zzso R zzso zzso P zzso zzso the presence of zzso cells zzso zzso R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and genetic segregation of brain zzso from populations in zzso tissue zzso value, R zzso zzso P approximately zzso zzso zzso may thus limit replication of zzso seeded into the brain in early stages of zzso Neurological complications in AIDS occur when this control breaks down, due to systemic zzso from zzso that destroys zzso zzso function and/or through the evolution of more aggressive zzso zzso
