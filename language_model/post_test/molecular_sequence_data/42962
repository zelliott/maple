Development of the primary zzso cells zzso of the sea zzso zzso which give rise to the zzso zzso involves the coordinate onset of expression of several structural zzso As part of an effort to identify zzso elements that might play a role in this regulatory event, zzso genes were examined by two zzso First, they were compared for zzso sequence zzso Four zzso elements were found as a cluster in all three genes zzso suggesting a regulatory zzso Second, as a test for potential function, the putative regulatory regions of two of these genes were examined for protein binding zzso zzso I protection and gel mobility shift zzso were used to: 1) identify several nuclear protein binding sites in these regions, two of which zzso to zzso elements among the zzso 2) demonstrate that the zzso time of appearance of the proteins that interact with these sites zzso to the time of zzso of the zzso and 3) show that two of the zzso sequence elements shared by these genes compete for the same binding zzso These data identify putative regulatory zzso whose specific roles in the coordinate regulation of zzso genes can now be addressed directly using appropriate transgenic expression zzso
