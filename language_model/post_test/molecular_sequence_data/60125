zzso growth zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso activity in a zzso manner in human zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase of zzso activity was accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the promoter zzso of zzso gene was analyzed by using the zzso fusion zzso A zzso effect of zzso on the reporter activity was observed, which paralleled with its effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso with a series of zzso zzso showed that the zzso region spanning from zzso to zzso zzso from translation starting site played an important role for zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel mobility shift zzso indicated that two zzso binding sequences residing at zzso to zzso zzso and 123 to zzso zzso were responsible for the zzso in zzso of human zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso the promoter activity of zzso in zzso cells, indicating that the binding of zzso with zzso binding sequences played a significant role in the regulation of zzso zzso
