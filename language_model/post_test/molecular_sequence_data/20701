zzso manipulation of the category B select agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been stifled due to the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso there is a need for additional zzso zzso zzso We engineered a zzso marker based on the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso which zzso resistance to the common zzso zzso zzso To show the ability of zzso to inhibit bacterial growth, we determined the effective zzso of zzso against zzso coli and several zzso zzso zzso based on zzso flanked by unique flip zzso target zzso zzso were constructed for zzso Both zzso approaches, one using the zzso marker zzso and the zzso cassette and one using the DNA incubation method with the zzso zzso were successfully zzso to create deletions in the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso unable to grow on media without zzso zzso and other zzso acids of this zzso were zzso zzso These zzso displayed cellular zzso consistent with the inability to zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso gene on a zzso zzso zzso by selecting for the bar gene zzso zzso zzso with zzso We conclude that the zzso gene is one of very few appropriate, effective, and beneficial zzso markers available for zzso zzso zzso Together with the bar zzso the zzso cassette will facilitate various genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso
