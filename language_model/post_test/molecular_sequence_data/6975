The solution structure has been determined for a zzso zzso that is fully folded at room zzso The sequence of this zzso is based on the zzso zzso zzso of the fourth zzso growth zzso domain of zzso a protein that acts as a zzso for the zzso zzso of protein zzso Despite its small size, the zzso forms a compact structure with almost no repeating secondary zzso The results indicate the structure is held together by zzso zzso which in turn stabilize the two zzso in the zzso The first zzso in the zzso represents a zzso motif that is found in the published structures of five other zzso growth zzso zzso The critical role of zzso in the stabilization of the first zzso is consistent with zzso data with soluble zzso The results also show that a small zzso of a larger protein can fold zzso and therefore it could act as an initiation site for further zzso
