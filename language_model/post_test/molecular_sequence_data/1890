We have developed a new strategy for zzso zzso discovery by using zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso as zzso Based on the mimicry of natural zzso zzso two genetically zzso zzso zzso libraries composed of zzso constrained peptides zzso were zzso zzso knowledge concerning the functional network of interactions in the zzso zzso complex highlights the zzso zzso as a prime target for zzso of viral zzso We present an zzso sequential drug discovery process for selection of peptides with zzso activity directed against the zzso Our approach combines zzso an exhaustive zzso selection of peptides binding two zzso divergent zzso zzso zzso a functional analysis of protein interaction zzso in a viral reverse genetic zzso coupled with a physical analysis of viral zzso complex by protein chip mass zzso and zzso an zzso for zzso of zzso infection in zzso zzso The zzso of this strategy was demonstrated by the identification of four peptides exhibiting an efficient zzso zzso Our work highlights the importance of P as a target in zzso virus drug zzso Furthermore, the screening strategy and the zzso libraries presented in this report could be considered, respectively, a general target validation strategy and a potential source of biologically active peptides which could also help to design zzso active zzso zzso The strategy described here is easily zzso to other zzso
