Five natural peptides isolated from zzso skin zzso of European zzso species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso masses zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1810 zzso were studied by zzso to compare two procedures of zzso bond zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The processes are relevant for the zzso of the zzso acid sequence inside the zzso zzso ring at the zzso The results clearly demonstrated that zzso of the zzso bond led to notably higher zzso of zzso and zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso bonds, than zzso This conclusion is true for all five peptides zzso Besides that, the zzso procedure is simpler than zzso as it is a zzso process with no zzso zzso The zzso is more zzso The results were similar each time the zzso was subjected to the zzso It was successfully applied to all five peptides while zzso failed in the case of zzso despite all variations of reaction zzso
