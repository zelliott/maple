The zzso zzso zzso function zzso zzso factor is activated by cell envelope stress zzso by zzso and by acid, heat, ethanol and zzso zzso Here, we have used several complementary approaches to identify genes controlled by zzso In many cases, expression is only partially dependent on zzso because of both overlapping promoter recognition with other zzso zzso factors and the presence of additional promoter zzso Genes regulated by zzso have a characteristic pattern of induction in response to cell zzso antibiotics as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso also contributes to the expression of the zzso zzso factor and thereby indirectly regulates genes of the zzso zzso Cell envelope stress responses also include zzso controlled by zzso zzso and several zzso regulatory systems zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso increases expression of proteins functioning in zzso control, cell wall synthesis and shape determination, cell division, DNA damage monitoring, zzso repair and zzso
