Classical zzso fever zzso has caused significant economic losses in zzso pig production, and is still present in some European zzso Recent zzso outbreaks in Europe were mainly associated with strains of zzso 2 zzso zzso Although there are extensive zzso regarding zzso zzso there is very little information available on longer fragments or whole classical zzso fever virus zzso zzso Furthermore, there are no detailed analyses of the molecular epidemiology of zzso wild zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, complete zzso sequences are supportive in zzso zzso especially in affected wild zzso zzso Here, German zzso strains of zzso zzso were fully zzso using two different zzso zzso a universal panel of zzso zzso that were developed to amplify the complete zzso in overlapping fragments for zzso zzso and zzso generation of a single full-length zzso of the zzso zzso obtained by long-range zzso for deep sequencing with next-generation sequencing zzso In total, five different strains of zzso zzso zzso were completely zzso using these newly developed zzso The approach was used to study virus spread and evolutionary history in German wild zzso For the first time, the results of our study clearly argue for the possibility of a long-term persistence of zzso zzso zzso strains in affected regions at an almost zzso level, even after long-term oral vaccination campaigns with intensive zzso zzso regional persistence in wild zzso populations has to be taken into account as an important factor in the continual outbreaks in affected zzso
