zzso progression in patients with chronic zzso colitis zzso is characterized by the development of zzso zzso which is accompanied by genetic abnormalities that can be detected by flow zzso and molecular zzso zzso Distribution of and correlation between zzso zzso DNA content, and loss of zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of nine UC patients were zzso Loss of a zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso of biopsy specimens classified zzso as zzso zzso zzso of biopsy specimens with high grade zzso and zzso zzso of biopsy specimens with low grade zzso Loss of zzso for zzso was also found in zzso zzso of biopsy specimens indefinite for zzso and in zzso biopsy specimens negative for zzso showing that this genetic change may occur early in the zzso progression towards zzso zzso DNA contents were more common than zzso zzso in regions with negative, indefinite or low grade zzso zzso moreover, zzso zzso was detected only in zzso cells and not in zzso zzso zzso alone was not as specific a marker for the zzso presence of zzso or zzso in a biopsy sample as zzso combined with zzso zzso These findings show that zzso may zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two UC patients' zzso contained geographically separated clones of cells with different zzso that also showed loss of different zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may arise within different populations of cells in separate areas of the same zzso
