zzso is widely expressed in human zzso and cell zzso Recent studies have demonstrated its involvement in zzso patterning and in the regulation of various genes implicated in zzso zzso Despite a growing number of studies, nothing is really known concerning the zzso expression zzso To understand how cells control zzso zzso we zzso the activity of the previously cloned promoter region of the human zzso zzso zzso I zzso gel zzso shift, transient zzso and zzso zzso experiments allowed the identification of two functional zzso zzso respiratory zzso zzso sites within the human zzso core promoter region, which are zzso in the mouse and rat zzso promoter zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso is associated in zzso with the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of full-length zzso enhanced zzso promoter activity, whereas expression of its zzso form reduced the promoter zzso Our results indicate that zzso is implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso gene zzso
