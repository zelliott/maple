The human zzso and zzso zzso genes are transcribed in opposite directions from a common promoter region on zzso zzso One of the alternately spliced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso is also an integral part of the coding region of a novel zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso if translated from the opposite zzso encodes sequences corresponding to the large third zzso loop of the zzso zzso The close proximity of the two zzso Y zzso genes suggests that they have evolved from a gene zzso event with the small zzso interrupting the coding sequence of the zzso gene being converted into a functional sequence within the zzso zzso while the reverse complementary sequence was zzso as an alternatively spliced zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso of both genes from opposite strands of the same DNA sequence suggests that zzso zzso of one will have an effect on the regulation of gene expression of the zzso As both zzso and zzso receptors are thought to play an important role in the regulation of food zzso coordinate expression of their specific genes may be important in the zzso of zzso zzso
