The cactus protein is the zzso zzso of the zzso I zzso B family of zzso anchor zzso We have expressed in zzso coli and zzso a cactus fusion zzso zzso zzso protein contains the six zzso repeat sequences which are necessary for specific binding to the zzso zzso family zzso factor zzso We show that the zzso zzso protein can bind specifically to zzso and, using circular zzso zzso that the protein adopts a largely zzso secondary zzso A further analysis of the zzso repeat zzso of zzso using an improved secondary structure prediction program indicates that the zzso of the repeat will form into a loop structure and the zzso section into an zzso zzso zzso On the basis of these findings we propose that the zzso repeats of cactus fold together into zzso zzso interconnected by zzso zzso
