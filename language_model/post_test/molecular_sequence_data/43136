The zzso sequence of the region between the spike zzso and the membrane zzso protein zzso and sequences of the S and zzso genes of the zzso strain of human coronavirus zzso were zzso The zzso gene comprises an open reading frame zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso protein of 279 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso The S gene comprises an zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso comparison between zzso and the zzso related bovine coronavirus zzso revealed more sequence divergence in the putative bulbous part of the S protein zzso than in the stem region zzso The zzso zzso near the zzso domain and the internal predicted zzso zzso site are zzso in the zzso S zzso zzso sequence analysis of the region between the S and M gene zzso revealed the presence of an unexpected zzso partial leader sequence and two zzso zzso potential proteins of zzso and zzso These two proteins were identified as zzso by comparison with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso translation analyses demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso like its zzso counterpart, is poorly translated when situated zzso of the zzso ORF, but is expressed in infected cells, as shown by zzso Interestingly, two zzso potentially zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins in zzso are absent in zzso indicating that they are not essential for viral replication in zzso zzso
