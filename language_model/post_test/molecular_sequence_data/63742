For functional zzso we isolated the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of the high content of zzso a combination of zzso zzso and zzso exchange zzso was necessary to yield highly pure zzso zzso All nine single zzso zzso were identified by mass zzso Western zzso revealed the zzso stable zzso of zzso c in zzso zzso In contrast to the mass zzso in the database zzso zzso zzso revealed a mass of the zzso c zzso of only zzso zzso A notable feature of the zzso zzso was its ability to zzso zzso in a wide temperature range and its stability against zzso zzso After zzso of zzso into zzso zzso synthesis energized by an applied zzso zzso zzso demonstrated functional zzso The highest zzso synthesis rate was determined at the natural growth temperature of 55 degrees C, but even at 95 degrees C zzso production zzso In contrast to other zzso and zzso zzso zzso which can be zzso with zzso dye into the membrane integral and the zzso part, the zzso zzso possessed a particular zzso Also with the zzso zzso sodium zzso and zzso zzso significantly harsher conditions were required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
