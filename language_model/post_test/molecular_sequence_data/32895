zzso resistance zzso protein is one of the most studied zzso zzso It is induced by the type I zzso system zzso zzso in various zzso but its expression has not been identified or characterized in zzso or other zzso zzso to zzso In this study, we isolated the zzso gene from a disk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso cloned and compared to other known zzso zzso The full-length 1664 zzso of zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso open reading frame that codes for zzso zzso zzso Within the coding sequence of zzso zzso characteristic features were found, such as a zzso zzso zzso motif and a zzso family zzso In addition, zzso zzso in the zzso region displayed a special zzso domain at zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may have a similar zzso function as other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited zzso zzso acid similarity with channel zzso zzso rainbow trout zzso and Atlantic zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso with the known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was performed for zzso zzso zzso The results showed enhanced zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as 48 h after injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso mantle and foot zzso in healthy zzso suggesting that the zzso level of zzso expressed is zzso There is no known zzso protein closely related to zzso zzso according to zzso zzso zzso zzso may have zzso from a common gene zzso of fish and zzso zzso zzso since zzso zzso showed high similarity in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso family signature motifs and zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso
