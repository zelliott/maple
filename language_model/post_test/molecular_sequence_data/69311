zzso zzso are a family of soluble zzso animal zzso some of which have been implicated in modulating zzso and zzso interactions through specific zzso zzso We report here the zzso crystal structure of a representative member of this family, the human zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso at zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is made up of two extended zzso zzso which associate in a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso shares not only the same zzso but a very similar zzso structure with that of the zzso plant zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso binding by zzso was found to involve protein zzso that are very highly zzso among all zzso zzso These zzso map to a single DNA zzso suggesting a zzso binding cassette common to all zzso zzso
