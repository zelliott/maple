zzso zzso cells are present in zzso and zzso tissue and contribute substantially to both innate and zzso zzso Recently, we have described several zzso zzso that recognize a zzso zzso zzso zzso which we have termed zzso zzso cloning of zzso revealed that zzso is a novel type II zzso zzso which shows zzso sequence identity at the zzso acid level to its putative zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are rapidly zzso and efficiently presented to T cells, indicating that zzso could play a role in zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso suppresses induction of zzso zzso production in zzso zzso cells, presumably by a mechanism dependent on calcium zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso as production of zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells is considered to be a major zzso factor in systemic lupus zzso triggering of zzso should be evaluated as therapeutic strategy for blocking production of zzso zzso in systemic lupus zzso zzso
