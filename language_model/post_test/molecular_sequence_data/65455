zzso in zzso have been linked to familial focal zzso zzso zzso a common zzso disorder in humans, and produce an apparent increase in the zzso affinity of zzso in zzso One of the zzso in particular, zzso falls in the middle of the zzso interface of the zzso domain zzso The zzso consists of tandem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The crystal structures of most zzso display a compact zzso characterized by extensive zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso Some electron zzso studies find that the compact zzso is preserved upon binding to zzso whereas other studies suggest that the zzso separate and the zzso becomes zzso The zzso zzso in zzso is significant in this regard since it removes a crucial zzso interaction with zzso of zzso thought to stabilize the compact zzso Together, the increased zzso affinity and the removal of this important zzso contact suggested that the zzso zzso might facilitate the transition toward the open zzso zzso proposed by some of the electron zzso zzso However, the crystal structure of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso described here displays the zzso compact zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are nearly identical zzso zzso and are in good agreement with the theoretical value calculated from the crystal structure zzso zzso zzso that the compact zzso is retained in zzso The absence of a structural change suggests that the compact zzso zzso observed in the majority of the structures is highly stable and is preserved in solution, even in zzso zzso zzso
