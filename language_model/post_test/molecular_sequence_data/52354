The zzso and zzso zzso zzso of type VI collagen are composed of several zzso zzso similar to the type A zzso zzso present in von zzso zzso The human alpha zzso chain that contributes most of the zzso zzso appears zzso in size as a result of alternative zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Chu, zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we report a further characterization of the zzso of the gene of the human alpha zzso chain and show that zzso zzso at multiple zzso Southern zzso and DNA sequencing indicate that there is an additional type A zzso zzso at about zzso zzso pairs downstream of the zzso coding for the signal zzso The open reading frame of this additional zzso reveals 1 zzso and three potential zzso zzso zzso chain reaction, Northern zzso and zzso protection zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso is subject to alternative zzso in normal and tumor cell lines and that this generates more protein zzso of the alpha zzso chain than expected zzso A comparison with the corresponding zzso zzso of the chicken alpha zzso chain shows the presence of 1 additional zzso in this portion of the zzso and suggests that human type VI collagen has more possibilities for structural and functional variations compared to chicken type VI zzso
