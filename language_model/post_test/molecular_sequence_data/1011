zzso zzso functions in coupled bone turnover by supporting zzso favoring bone zzso instead of bone zzso Gene regulation of zzso is complex occurring both at zzso and zzso zzso The focus of this paper is at the level of zzso stability, which is important in zzso gene zzso Using the zzso as an zzso model, zzso zzso was dose zzso decreased by zzso a zzso zzso zzso Steady state zzso zzso was decreased with zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso when zzso by zzso zzso zzso These effects require de zzso protein synthesis as they were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso had minor effects on zzso zzso promoter activity in reporter gene zzso A more significant effect on zzso zzso stability was observed in the presence of zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso in a dose dependent manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter cell lines zzso containing green fluorescent protein zzso with the zzso region of zzso were zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso but not zzso hormone zzso could increase zzso expression of these reporter cell zzso zzso zzso and reporter gene zzso zzso zzso was regulated by zzso in zzso zzso In addition, transient zzso of zzso zzso reporter cells with immediate upstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso expression compared to mock zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso at a post zzso mechanism and one of the primary targets of zzso gene regulation is the zzso of zzso
