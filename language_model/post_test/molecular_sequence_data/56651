We examined zzso zzso in the production of individual zzso zzso during zzso zzso in rat plasma in zzso High performance liquid zzso separation and zzso detection were used to zzso zzso of the primary zzso products of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Blood was sampled from rats through zzso zzso artery zzso before, zzso and after active avoidance training or appropriate control zzso zzso training increased zzso production, as did handling and exposing animals to the novel avoidance chamber without zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso production was elevated by blood sampling alone, by zzso and by training, but the effect of training was significantly greater than the effects of either of the other zzso Interestingly, zzso production was highly correlated zzso zzso zzso with a measure of escape zzso Since the zzso that participate in zzso zzso act upon a number of zzso regulation of zzso activity may be one mechanism zzso an zzso can zzso levels of circulating peptides in response to environmental zzso this may contribute to the expression of appropriate behavioral responses to those environmental zzso
