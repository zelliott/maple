zzso zzso zzso are an important zzso factor for successful tree recruitment because they enhance plant growth and alleviate drought stress of their zzso Thus, zzso zzso are expected to be a key factor for forest zzso after major zzso events such as zzso forest zzso Yet the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to heat is zzso In this study, we investigated the heat tolerance of zzso zzso of zzso pine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso samples of three soil depths were heated to the temperature of 45, 60 and 70 zzso respectively, and surviving zzso zzso were assessed by a zzso using zzso pine as an experimental host zzso zzso species were identified by a combination of zzso and sequencing of the ITS zzso We found that mean number of species per sample was reduced by the 60 and 70 zzso treatment, but not by the 45 zzso zzso Species composition changed due to zzso While some zzso zzso species did not survive heating, the majority of species was also found in the heated zzso The most frequent species in the heat treatment were zzso zzso zzso zzso and several unidentified zzso
