zzso of unusually high amounts of zzso zzso zzso occurs in two mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Southern zzso and DNA sequence analyses showed that both tumors have undergone zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso to positions zzso of the zzso gene zzso resulting in removal of DNA sequences zzso a negative zzso regulatory zzso In contrast to other mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rearranged zzso genes show increased transcription, partially explaining their abundance of zzso zzso Similar to other mouse zzso the abundance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is also influenced by increased stability of structurally zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso a zzso zzso species including all 3 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso species with the 3 zzso plus the first zzso The two major zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso species, also include all three zzso zzso plus portions of the first zzso zzso zzso protection analyses show that the zzso initiation and 3' untranslated zzso regions of the unusual zzso zzso zzso are normal showing that the size differences arise solely from inclusion of first zzso sequences in the large zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that the presence of first zzso sequences in the large zzso zzso is due to zzso affecting the zzso donor region at the 3' end of zzso 1 in both zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins showed them to be of normal zzso mobility but no more abundant than in a zzso cell line zzso that contains at least 10 fold less zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is atypically stable while the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal rapid turnover within the same cell, demonstrating that the presence of first zzso sequences in the large zzso zzso zzso it despite the presence of 3' zzso and putative zzso 1 zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso 1 sequences can counteract the effect of 3' zzso region zzso sequences in zzso zzso and suggest that the increased zzso zzso stability noted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is largely due to the presence of the zzso 1 zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
