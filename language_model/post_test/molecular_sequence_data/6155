Type I diabetes, an zzso disease that occurs in humans and animals, is characterized by the destruction of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso directed toward multiple zzso protein can be detected before diagnosis of type I zzso however, the identity of the inciting zzso that targets zzso for destruction has not been zzso zzso of many zzso by zzso T zzso is restricted by the products of class II immune response genes of the major zzso complex zzso and in human type I diabetes such a zzso association has been zzso The present study uses a rat zzso class II zzso zzso binding motif to predict potentially zzso zzso T cell zzso in two key zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and the insulin precursor hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso and zzso containing the binding motif were zzso and used to generate zzso zzso class zzso zzso T cell zzso Once established, the T cell lines specific for rat zzso zzso and zzso were zzso transferred to zzso zzso zzso At 10 days after transfer, zzso had developed in rats receiving zzso T cells, whereas no zzso was observed in zzso of rats receiving zzso T zzso Of particular interest is the finding that the zzso T cell zzso identified in zzso spans the zzso zzso site between the zzso and zzso of zzso Moreover, the zzso T cells were able to react specifically with material produced in zzso by a rat zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso T cell zzso can be located in portions of molecules that are subsequently zzso during normal zzso zzso As zzso is found highest zzso in the zzso of pancreatic zzso it is possible that this zzso and not its individual degradation products zzso insulin and zzso might serve as an zzso in the zzso of type I zzso
