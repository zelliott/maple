The zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso repress the replication of zzso zzso zzso protecting the host from the otherwise lethal effects of the zzso We cloned and zzso the zzso gene and found that it encodes a zzso zzso protein including a typical nuclear zzso zzso Cell zzso experiments show that the zzso gene product is indeed tightly associated with zzso and that the putative nuclear zzso sequence directs zzso into the zzso However, fusion of a part of the zzso protein lacking this signal with zzso also directs zzso into the nucleus, suggesting the presence of a second nuclear zzso zzso The zzso gene is only essential in the presence of an M zzso zzso zzso
