The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main family of zzso acid zzso found in all zzso of life and one of the largest families of secondary zzso Here, using a sensitive zzso zzso approach and zzso we show that the predicted structure of zzso members is extremely similar to the crystal structures of several zzso zzso belonging to evolutionary distinct protein families with different zzso zzso All of these zzso despite having no primary zzso acid sequence zzso share a similar structural core, consisting of two zzso zzso of five zzso zzso each, intertwined in an zzso zzso Based on this model, we reviewed available data on functional zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and obtained novel zzso data, which provide compelling evidence that the zzso acid binding pocket is located in the vicinity of the zzso part of two broken zzso in a nearly identical position to the structures of similar zzso Our analysis is fully supported by the evolutionary conservation and specific zzso acid zzso in the proposed zzso binding zzso Furthermore, it allows predictions concerning zzso that might be crucial in determining the specificity profile of zzso zzso Finally, we show that two zzso zzso constitute important functional elements in zzso Our work along with different kinetic and specificity profiles of zzso members in easily manipulated bacterial and zzso model systems could form a unique framework for combining zzso zzso and structural studies, for understanding the function of one of the most important zzso zzso
