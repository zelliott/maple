DNA zzso zzso zzso is important in attaining high zzso DNA zzso One of the most well characterized zzso activities is the zzso activity of zzso T4 DNA zzso We have used genetic analyses and protein sequence comparisons to zzso coli DNA zzso I to identify zzso acids in the zzso region of T4 DNA zzso that are required for zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or zzso reduced zzso activity zzso in various in zzso zzso and decreased DNA replication zzso in zzso DNA replication activity was also reduced for the zzso DNA zzso in zzso and in zzso Reduction in DNA replication appeared to be due primarily to the zzso of T4 DNA zzso replication and zzso activities; T4 DNA zzso requires zzso activity to repair primer zzso that are not suitable zzso for zzso Observations reported here provide further evidence in support of the proposal that DNA zzso have distinct zzso and zzso active zzso
