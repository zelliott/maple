zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show zzso to the zzso form in a zzso family on the 3rd zzso of zzso zzso It is the first experimental demonstration that the six members in the zzso family act as functional zzso To further delineate the functional divergence of these six members, their zzso sequences were cloned respectively into the zzso zzso and expressed in the zzso zzso The zzso activity of the expression products was zzso using the zzso zzso The results showed a difference among the six zzso in zzso activity against the tested zzso zzso in which zzso was most effective and showed zzso activity to all seven zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was effective to six zzso zzso was effective to five zzso zzso was effective to four zzso and zzso and zzso were effective to only three zzso zzso had no activity against any tested zzso zzso By comparing the variable zzso sites of these six zzso to that of zzso in the three-dimensional structure, we suggested that the reduction in the zzso activity was due to the variable zzso that were not in the zzso In addition, two inserted zzso zzso in zzso may affect the zzso structure and resulted in a functional zzso These results may explain the evolution of the zzso zzso family and its functional zzso
