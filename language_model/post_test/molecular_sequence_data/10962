zzso zzso was used to assess the contribution of individual zzso and a bound calcium in the zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The importance of the zzso region was reflected by finding that almost all zzso had drastic effects on zzso These effects (both stabilizing and zzso were obtained by zzso affecting main chain flexibility, as well as by zzso affecting the interaction between the zzso region and the rest of the zzso zzso The zzso of stability could be largely abolished by mutating one of its zzso zzso or zzso In the case of the zzso zzso the accompanying loss in stability was modest compared with the effects of other zzso zzso or the effects of zzso zzso stabilizing zzso The detailed knowledge of the zzso region of zzso permits effective rational design of stabilizing zzso which, presumably, are also useful for related zzso such as zzso This is demonstrated by the successful design of a stabilizing salt bridge involving zzso 65 and zzso
