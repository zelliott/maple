The objective was to identify and characterize low molecular weight zzso in urine and their zzso modifications that might be used as a screening tool for zzso zzso 

zzso samples collected preoperatively from zzso women with zzso cancer and benign conditions and from zzso controls were analyzed by zzso laser zzso mass zzso and two-dimensional gel zzso zzso proteins from mass profiles were zzso by zzso and followed by liquid zzso mass zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso were generated for further zzso including zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were developed for preliminary validation in patients of 128 zzso cancer, 52 benign conditions, 44 other zzso and 188 healthy zzso 

A protein zzso approximately zzso with higher peak zzso in cancer patients than in benign conditions and controls was identified and subsequently defined as zzso zzso zzso A zzso form of zzso was specifically elevated in zzso cancer zzso A cluster of zzso zzso was identified from two-dimensional gels of urine from cancer zzso zzso forms zzso and zzso fragments were elevated in zzso zzso zzso and a combination of both resulted to zzso specificity and zzso zzso 

zzso elevated zzso modified urinary zzso and zzso zzso fragments in zzso cancer might lead to potential zzso screening tests for early zzso zzso with less complexity than serum and relatively high zzso stability of peptides or zzso is a promising study medium for discovery of the novel zzso which may present in many zzso tract zzso zzso
