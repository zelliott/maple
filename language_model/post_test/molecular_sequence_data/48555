The zzso zzso protein zzso family is composed of 14 zzso sharing structural similarity with zzso but no zzso zzso Target proteins of four zzso have been identified to be involved in host immune zzso However, the counterparts of other zzso have been functionally zzso In this study, we have identified zzso plasma zzso as zzso protein by affinity zzso using zzso zzso The zzso recovered the zzso of zzso zzso 1 + 2) as well as factor zzso in pull-down zzso The equilibrium zzso constant between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso M in surface zzso resonance zzso On the other hand, the zzso failed to recover zzso acid zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso from zzso mice, suggesting that the zzso domain of the zzso factors is essential for the zzso zzso prolonged plasma zzso induced by the addition of zzso and factor zzso zzso did not affect the zzso activity of zzso but inhibited the generation of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso that zzso activates zzso zzso attenuated zzso induced by zzso but the zzso effect was weaker than that on zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso activity of zzso the complex of zzso with zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso blood zzso by interfering with zzso of zzso cascade via binding to the zzso domain of zzso factor but not by directly zzso zzso zzso This is the first finding that the bacterial protein zzso blood zzso via targeting the zzso domain of zzso zzso
