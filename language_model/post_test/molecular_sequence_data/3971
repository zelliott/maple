zzso for onset of alcoholism is related to genetic differences in acute alcohol withdrawal zzso We previously mapped a locus responsible for zzso of the genetic zzso in acute alcohol withdrawal zzso liability to a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here, we narrow the position of this locus to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing 15 genes and/or predicted zzso using a combination of novel, zzso zzso strains and zzso progeny zzso We report the development of a zzso zzso strain, which confirms capture of a gene affecting alcohol withdrawal within the zzso zzso zzso We also confirm a zzso withdrawal locus within this zzso suggesting that the same gene may influence predisposition to zzso dependence on alcohol and a zzso This zzso strain will be invaluable for determining whether this zzso also harbors a zzso underlying other quantitative trait zzso mapped to zzso 4, including zzso affecting voluntary alcohol consumption, zzso zzso physical dependence after chronic alcohol exposure, and seizure response to zzso or an zzso zzso To date, zzso which encodes the multiple zzso zzso domain protein zzso is the only gene within the zzso shown to have zzso zzso that differ in coding sequence and/or zzso zzso analysis of 15 standard zzso mouse strains identifies six zzso zzso that predict three zzso protein zzso These zzso and evidence using zzso zzso lines, show that alcohol withdrawal severity is genetically correlated with zzso status, indicating that zzso zzso may influence alcohol withdrawal zzso
