zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso dominant skin disorder zzso by numerous zzso zzso zzso distributed on the palms and zzso To date, no zzso gene for this disease has been zzso 

We performed zzso sequencing analysis of four affected individuals and two unaffected controls from one Chinese zzso family where disease locus was mapped at zzso by our previous linkage zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso in zzso gene zzso zzso which located within the linkage region that we previously identified for zzso The zzso was shared by the four affected individuals, but not for the two controls of the zzso zzso sequencing confirmed this zzso in another four cases from this zzso This zzso was invisible in the normal controls of this family as well as the additional zzso unrelated normal controls and zzso patients with other zzso The shared zzso zzso zzso is a zzso substitution at a highly zzso zzso acid zzso across multiple zzso 

The power of combining zzso sequencing and linkage information in the study of zzso of zzso dominant disorders, even in zzso cases, has been zzso Our results suggested that zzso would be a casual gene for zzso which was helpful for advancing us on understanding of the zzso of zzso
