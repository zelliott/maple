The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso However, obvious zzso with significant identity to known zzso could not be identified in the zzso zzso of this zzso The zzso activity from zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that, unlike all known zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso not only of zzso zzso but also of zzso zzso zzso at similar zzso efficiency, thus defining the protein as zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso reading frame zzso was identified by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene was zzso in zzso coli as functional zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in several zzso zzso and two zzso The zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso was characterized as zzso zzso zzso showed low sequence identity to the zzso zzso and formed a distinct zzso zzso However, secondary structure predictions and the presence of several zzso zzso acids potentially involved in zzso indicate some structural and functional similarity to the zzso zzso Thus, we propose that zzso zzso constitutes a novel protein family within the zzso zzso
