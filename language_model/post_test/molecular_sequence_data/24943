zzso filament assembly and turnover drive many forms of cellular zzso particularly extension of the leading edge of zzso cells and rocketing of zzso zzso through host cell zzso De zzso nucleation of zzso filaments appears to be required for these zzso A complex of seven proteins called zzso complex is the best characterized cellular zzso of zzso filament zzso zzso complex is zzso zzso relying on nucleation promoting factors for zzso zzso family proteins are prominent cellular nucleation promoting zzso They bring together an zzso zzso and zzso complex in solution or on the side of an existing zzso filament to initiate a new filament that grows in the barbed end zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and their activity is regulated by zzso zzso such as zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso These interactions provide a final common zzso for many signaling zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso either activate zzso complex directly or zzso zzso to initiate zzso zzso
