zzso virus of zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso in the family zzso We have zzso cloned and zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso shared an identity of zzso and zzso with that of human zzso and bovine zzso zzso It had distinct zzso zzso of 183 zzso and 198 zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also found in two alternative zzso zzso or zzso Both zzso shared extensive similarities with those of bovine zzso Four full-length molecular clones constructed with different zzso of the zzso zzso proved to be infectious in Walter Reed canine zzso zzso canine zzso Both zzso infection and zzso of the infectious clone in zzso cells revealed an identical zzso zzso profile that was similar to that of bovine zzso zzso of the infectious clone demonstrated that the middle open reading frame encodes the zzso zzso This zzso unique to the zzso zzso was essential for zzso DNA zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso motif in the zzso unique region was also critical for zzso zzso Thus, our studies revealed important information about the zzso zzso that may eventually help us to clone the human zzso and study its zzso
