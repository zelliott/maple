Using zzso mobility shift zzso we have zzso the binding of rat liver nuclear proteins to the fragments from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site of the rat zzso zzso zzso Studies of the competition with a synthetic consensus sequence for the zzso 1 recognition site have shown that the liver nuclear zzso responsible for the formation of specific complexes with these fragments belong to the family of the nuclear factor 1 zzso zzso We have also found that the zzso factors of the zzso 1 family form several complexes with each of the two tested fragments of the zzso zzso zzso
