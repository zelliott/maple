We have identified and further characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a protein with substantial zzso to the zinc finger and zzso zzso motifs of the human gene products zzso zzso and zzso The first part of the zinc finger region of zzso has strong similarity to the corresponding regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso As this region is structurally different from previously described zinc finger zzso sequence zzso searches were zzso Twenty-five other proteins with a similar motif were zzso Because the functional domain of this motif is potentially disrupted in zzso zzso zzso we propose the name of zzso protein zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso the zzso domain consensus sequence is zzso zzso - zzso where zzso numbers represent the number of zzso acid zzso We review the evidence that this motif binds zzso is the important zzso domain in this group of regulatory zzso and may be involved in zzso
