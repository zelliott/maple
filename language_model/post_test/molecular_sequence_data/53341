The zzso genes expressed by both resting and in zzso zzso zzso B cells from human zzso were zzso zzso zzso B cells were subdivided according to the presence zzso or absence zzso of surface zzso zzso was abundant on activated zzso B cells and low on resting zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells could be subdivided into zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells displayed zzso genes with a substantial number of zzso zzso of the molecular clones were zzso whereas zzso of the clones from resting zzso zzso B cells were zzso Moreover, zzso zzso genes were detected mainly within the zzso cell fraction of the zzso zzso B zzso Several identical zzso zzso sequences zzso were found in different molecular clones from resting zzso zzso B cells, suggesting local cellular zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were found in zzso transcripts of activated zzso B zzso zzso zzso was observed in the gamma transcripts of activated zzso B zzso zzso zzso B cells are heterogeneous, being comprised of B cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso that are zzso B cells, and a subset of B cells with zzso zzso genes that are either virgin cells or cells driven by zzso that did not induce or select for V gene zzso
