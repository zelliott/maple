Large zzso DNA zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso to catalyze the formation of zzso bonds in viral proteins produced in the cell zzso an zzso location for zzso protein zzso These viral zzso zzso belong to a family of zzso zzso that are zzso of a small zzso fold containing a zzso motif juxtaposed to a zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that the zzso zzso zzso from African zzso fever virus zzso uses for zzso surface different from that observed in zzso from zzso plants, and zzso Within a protein family, different packing zzso for the same zzso state are extremely zzso We find that the alternate zzso mode seen in zzso zzso is not characteristic of all viral zzso zzso as the zzso domain from a zzso zzso zzso assumes the same zzso structure as the known zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates the potential of large zzso DNA zzso which have faster zzso rates than their hosts and the tendency to incorporate host zzso to pioneer new protein folds and zzso zzso
