zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso two zzso in zzso cells is often inefficient zzso to the unwanted pairing between the component heavy and light zzso We have developed an efficient method for the production of a novel zzso zzso by using the natural zzso mechanism between zzso heavy and light zzso Two zzso zzso zzso of different specificity are fused to the constant domain of human zzso chain zzso and the first constant domain of human heavy chain zzso to form two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso in zzso cells results in the formation of a zzso linked zzso zzso zzso with dual zzso Our approach yields a homogeneous zzso zzso zzso product with each zzso containing four zzso binding sites, two for each of its target zzso A zzso was prepared using two zzso zzso each directed against a different zzso of a vascular zzso growth factor zzso the zzso insert zzso zzso zzso The zzso is capable of simultaneously binding to the two zzso on the zzso Further, the zzso also retains the zzso efficacy and biological activity of its component zzso
