Two open reading frames zzso of African zzso fever virus zzso zzso putative zzso have been zzso The two zzso termed zzso and zzso are located in the central region of the viral zzso but are separated by about 40 zzso of zzso Both genes are expressed late during zzso infection of zzso cells, after replication of viral DNA has zzso zzso to zzso three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative proteins of unknown function, have been zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain the zzso acid motifs that characterize zzso of zzso zzso zzso is most similar to a group of putative zzso which includes two proteins of zzso virus zzso and zzso involved in zzso of the viral zzso their zzso in other zzso the protein zzso by zzso 4 of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso resembles a group of zzso proteins which includes three proteins of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso virus zzso
