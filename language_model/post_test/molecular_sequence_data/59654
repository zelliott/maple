Among the zzso zzso several of which are zzso some of the most divergent zzso species are zzso The evolutionary distances between zzso are so large that even slowly evolving proteins like zzso are strongly zzso In this study we isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones from zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and three zzso zzso genes were detected on three zzso clones with one complete zzso and two complete zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso transcribed with very short zzso regions of only zzso zzso which contained zzso zzso as well as zzso putative promoter zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that there may be several more zzso gene zzso The two complete zzso zzso genes were different on the zzso level but zzso the same zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with sequences from animals, zzso and plants as well as other zzso revealed a significant divergence not only from the sequences in zzso organisms but especially from the sequences in other zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
