A zzso activity was identified in zzso zzso zzso extracts and was further zzso by sequential zzso and zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was able to bind to the zzso elements zzso both before and after zzso stress, although heat shock altered both the zzso affinity and the zzso mobility on zzso zzso The mobility difference was significantly reduced by treatment of the proteins with zzso The zzso zzso isolated by zzso zzso migrated on zzso gels as a closely spaced zzso to about 70 zzso zzso with similar molecular mass were recovered from zzso zzso gels indicating that both are components of the zzso zzso
