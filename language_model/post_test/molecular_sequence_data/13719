In line zzso transgenic rats zzso bearing a randomly inserted additional zzso zzso the zzso but not the zzso were found to be zzso zzso was obtained from zzso males and zzso controls after zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso and zzso was zzso zzso size was normal as was gross zzso but careful examination revealed that the release of many zzso at stage IX of the zzso cycle was zzso In addition, the process of zzso elimination was zzso as zzso fragments of zzso zzso were present in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size was significantly larger zzso zzso zzso than in zzso controls, a difference that was most marked at stages zzso effect that could be related to the retention of zzso In zzso zzso confirmed that expression of zzso zzso could be detected in zzso of zzso rats but not in normal controls or in a fertile line zzso of rats bearing the same zzso zzso and in zzso and Northern zzso were used to zzso the pattern of expression of genes that previous studies have implicated in the process of zzso maturation and/or zzso Of the gene products examined zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso transition proteins 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 2 zzso none showed any major change in the pattern of expression compared with that in zzso We zzso that zzso transgenic male rats may be zzso because the expression of a gene (or zzso involved in the process of zzso elimination and/or zzso release has been disrupted by the presence of the zzso close to or within the zzso Future planned studies will involve determination of the zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the final zzso of zzso
