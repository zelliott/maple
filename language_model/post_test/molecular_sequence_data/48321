zzso zzso including the largest known zzso multiply in zzso zzso have been linked to pneumonia, but they have never been isolated from zzso To further understand the zzso role of these zzso we aimed to isolate them from a patient presenting with zzso 

We zzso on zzso zzso zzso pulmonary samples from 196 zzso patients with zzso pneumonia during the period zzso An improved technique was used for zzso isolation, which used zzso plates where the growth of giant viruses is revealed by the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested by zzso and by zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso to identify specific zzso zzso The new zzso strain zzso sequencing was performed on Roche zzso zzso zzso zzso then AB zzso zzso 

We successfully isolated a zzso zzso the largest virus ever isolated in a human sample, from a zzso woman presenting with zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso with a size of zzso zzso 10 zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso and it is closely related to that of zzso zzso Furthermore, the serum from the patient reacted specifically to the virus compared to zzso 

This is the first zzso isolated from a human zzso The findings presented above together with previous works establish that zzso can be associated with zzso The common occurrence of these viruses in water and soil makes them probable global agents that are worthy of zzso
