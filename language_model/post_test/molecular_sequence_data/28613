zzso of the viral zzso gene drastically reduced the fitness of zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso evolution recovered much of this fitness during long-term passage, but the final fitness remained below that of the intact zzso zzso changes occurred chiefly in genes involved in DNA zzso the viral zzso zzso and DNA zzso Two other zzso changes of unknown function also zzso Using a method to distinguish zzso zzso from other beneficial zzso five additional zzso from the recovery were shown to enhance adaptation to culture conditions and were not zzso for the zzso In contrast to the few previous studies of viral recovery from zzso the zzso changes in zzso did not restore the deletion or duplicate major regions of the zzso The ability of this deleted zzso to recover much of the lost fitness via zzso in its remaining genes reveals a considerable evolutionary potential to modify the interactions of its elements in maintaining an essential set of zzso
