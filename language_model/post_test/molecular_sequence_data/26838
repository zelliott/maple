zzso acid is a zzso bound zzso found throughout the zzso of life that is required for zzso metabolism of zzso and for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso reaction that proceeds via a zzso intermediate to attach the zzso to the zzso group of a zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso of demonstrated function have a large zzso zzso domain and a small zzso accessory zzso Half of the members of the zzso family detected in zzso have only the large zzso zzso Two zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso structure have been reported, although the protein was reported to lack zzso zzso McManus et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hypothesized that the product of an adjacent gene was also required for zzso zzso We have shown this to be the case and have named the second zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso coli strains lacking zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was possible only when zzso was also zzso zzso had no zzso zzso activity in zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to interact and were zzso as a zzso zzso was required for zzso formation but was not required for transfer of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso show that most zzso zzso of the kingdom zzso are zzso We propose that the presence of an accessory domain provides a diagnostic to distinguish zzso zzso zzso from other members of the zzso attachment zzso zzso
