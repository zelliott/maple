Using newly generated zzso zzso we have compared the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, in which they play crucial roles during various key cellular zzso Whereas zzso is zzso localized in stress zzso circular zzso and at zzso zzso suggesting a role in cell attachment and contraction, zzso displays a more versatile organization, according to cell zzso In moving cells, zzso is mainly organized as a zzso in cortical and zzso structures, suggesting a role in cell zzso in stationary cells, zzso is also recruited into stress zzso zzso cells become highly spread, display broad zzso and reduce their zzso zzso by contrast, zzso cells acquire a zzso zzso with thick zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso depleted zzso exhibit distinct changes in zzso compared with their controls, suggesting a specific role for each zzso in cell zzso Our results reveal new aspects of zzso and zzso organization that support their functional zzso
