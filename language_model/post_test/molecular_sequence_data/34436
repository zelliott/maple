The zzso gene from the zzso fungus zzso zzso which zzso for an acid zzso was cloned into the zzso expression zzso giving rise to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transformed with zzso zzso both expressed and exported an active zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso similar to those reported for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has the ability to zzso zzso acid at pH zzso zzso zzso production was studied under controlled conditions in batch and zzso zzso A simultaneous addition of zzso and zzso was found to be the most suitable feeding strategy zzso resulting in a final zzso production of 50 zzso The production process proposed in this study could be applied for the industrial production of a novel and useful zzso
