We have developed a method of targeted zzso difference analysis zzso for zzso detection of zzso repeat integration site differences between closely related zzso The method includes a zzso amplification of the zzso adjacent to target zzso repetitive elements in both zzso zzso under comparison, and zzso zzso zzso of the selected zzso The potential of zzso was demonstrated by the detection of differences in the integration sites of human zzso zzso K zzso and related solitary long terminal repeats zzso between the human and zzso zzso Of 55 randomly zzso clones from a library enriched with zzso integration zzso sites, 33 zzso represented zzso All the zzso zzso zzso belong to two related zzso young groups, suggesting simultaneous activity of two master genes in the zzso zzso No zzso zzso was detected for the zzso zzso for 25 unrelated zzso zzso We also discuss the possible research applications for zzso zzso
