zzso genetic analyses of bacterial genes whose products interact with host zzso can give new understanding of infection and disease zzso Here we show that strains of the genetically diverse gastric pathogen zzso zzso from zzso from the remote Peruvian Amazon contain novel zzso of zzso a major zzso zzso and reveal distinctive properties of their zzso zzso zzso zzso is injected into the gastric zzso where it hijacks zzso signaling zzso helps zzso exploit its special gastric zzso zzso and affects the risk that infection will result in overt zzso diseases including gastric zzso The zzso zzso proteins contain unusual but functional zzso zzso motifs and attenuated zzso zzso which affect gastric zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso proteins induced less production of zzso and zzso zzso 2 than did those of zzso Western or East Asian strains and behaved as dominant negative zzso of action of zzso zzso during mixed infection of Mongolian zzso We suggest that zzso zzso is of relatively low zzso that this may have been selected in ancestral strains during infection of the people who migrated from Asia into the Americas many thousands of years ago, and that such attenuated zzso proteins could be useful zzso
