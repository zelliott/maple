zzso factor B zzso is involved in the zzso of the alternative complement zzso zzso is induced by zzso however, the mechanisms of zzso gene regulation have not been well characterized in general, and not in zzso zzso Northern analysis reveals that zzso zzso a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso expression in primary zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso cells zzso with reporter zzso containing truncated regions of the zzso promoter reveal that zzso responsiveness lies between zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso This region of the zzso promoter contains both an zzso site zzso and an zzso response element zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site or the zzso binding site in this region of the zzso promoter partially zzso zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso elements totally abrogates zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso reveal nuclear binding complexes involving both zzso and zzso zzso sequences upon zzso zzso In competition zzso both zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso compete for the DNA zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso and zzso nuclear binding complexes contribute to induction of zzso by zzso Western analysis confirms an zzso increase in zzso zzso of zzso These findings suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso binding sites have an additive effect on zzso zzso gene expression and that both are required for full expression of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso take part in zzso zzso gene induction in zzso through their respective zzso binding zzso
