The putative copper and zzso zzso of the human zzso disease gene were used as zzso to screen a human liver zzso library at reduced zzso zzso clones which remained positive after zzso screening were zzso and zzso One of these zzso clones contains an open reading frame with zzso zzso acid zzso to the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis zzso this zzso to the region of the Wilson disease locus on zzso zzso This zzso detects a zzso zzso transcript which is present in human liver and cell lines devoid of the zzso transcript and which is absent in liver from a patient with Wilson zzso These data suggest that this zzso is a candidate gene for Wilson disease and that the protein zzso at this locus is a member of the zzso zzso zzso
