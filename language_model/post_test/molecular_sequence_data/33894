zzso is a potent zzso protein derived from the zzso domain 1 zzso of collagen zzso The mechanism by which zzso exerts its zzso effect is still incompletely zzso It has been shown that the 27 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso activities comparable to the full soluble zzso To understand how this zzso can exert such elaborate function, we performed structural analysis using molecular dynamics to evaluate the behavior of this zzso in zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is able to assume a zzso structure, folding into a zzso zzso zzso zzso the folding zzso we were able to understand why the zzso zzso of human zzso with the same length failed to acquire a stable zzso zzso we were able to predict the successful folding of the zzso zzso and of a shorter form of the human zzso with 25 zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso assumed by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has a high structural similarity with fragments of another family of zzso zzso the zzso portion of the zzso domain of collagen zzso Indeed, our zzso simulations show that zzso zzso and the zzso zzso bind to the same spot of zzso zzso suggesting similar interactions via a common binding site on this zzso
