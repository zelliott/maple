zzso the central zzso of the zzso zzso complex, forms a zzso channel in the zzso inner membrane zzso an zzso membrane that generates a zzso force to drive vital zzso Using high-resolution zzso mapping of a zzso zzso segment zzso of zzso from zzso zzso we demonstrate that changes in the energized state of the zzso cause marked structural zzso in the channel zzso In an energized zzso zzso forms a continuous zzso that is zzso to the zzso zzso space zzso Upon zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso and the channel becomes exposed to the zzso zzso zzso confirm that changes in zzso zzso coincide with zzso These results reveal how the energized state of the membrane drives functionally relevant structural dynamics in membrane proteins coupled to processes such as channel zzso
