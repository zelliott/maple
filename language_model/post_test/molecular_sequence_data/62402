We describe here a novel zzso tag zzso that can be used to produce high levels of zzso in zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso This system combines the zzso ability of zzso protein zzso the versatility of the zzso tag zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso of a zzso acid tag zzso We used this zzso system in an attempt to improve expression levels of two zzso zzso factor Tu zzso and DNA zzso zzso A zzso well as two zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and small zzso partner zzso The zzso system not only vastly improved the expression of the two zzso proteins tested, but also yielded complete, zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso The results obtained from the zzso expression and zzso are presented and discussed in zzso The nuclear zzso though soluble as fusion partners, failed to remain soluble once the zzso tag was zzso Despite this limitation of the system, the zzso tag approach is a useful system that can improve expression of some otherwise zzso or poorly expressing zzso to obtain zzso zzso fully zzso protein for downstream zzso
