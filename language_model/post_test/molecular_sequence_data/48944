While zzso sequencing projects have discovered numerous types of zzso elements in diverse zzso there are many zzso of ecological and evolutionary significance that have received little attention, such as the zzso class zzso zzso of a zzso zzso sequence database from the zzso oyster zzso zzso revealed the presence of a common zzso element, zzso zzso possesses zzso zzso repeats, a zzso repeated core element, a zzso zzso region, and the ability to form stable secondary zzso Three other less abundant repetitive elements with a similar structure but little sequence similarity were also found in zzso zzso zzso a repetitive element with similar features, was discovered in the blood zzso zzso zzso by probing a zzso library with a zzso repeat element contained in zzso 2 of a minor zzso gene in that zzso All of these elements are flanked by the zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso They exhibit structural similarity to the sea zzso zzso family and zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition, they possess regions of sequence similarity to satellite DNA from several zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso repetitive elements and zzso are members of a new zzso family of zzso zzso zzso named zzso Pearl is the first putative zzso DNA zzso to be identified in the zzso zzso
