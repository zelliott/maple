We previously have shown that DNA zzso by chicken zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso needs both zzso and zzso One of these proteins is a zzso zzso Further peptides were zzso and three of them are identical to the zzso zzso mismatch DNA zzso A zzso zzso coding for the chicken zzso of human zzso mismatch DNA zzso was isolated and zzso The derived zzso acid sequence zzso zzso shows zzso identity with the human zzso mismatch DNA zzso and both the C and zzso parts have about 50% zzso As for the highly zzso chicken zzso DNA zzso complex the zzso protein expressed in zzso coli has both zzso mismatch and zzso zzso The zzso protein has the same zzso specificity as the chicken zzso zzso where zzso DNA is a better zzso than zzso zzso zzso The activity ratio of zzso mismatch and zzso is about zzso for the zzso protein expressed in zzso coli and zzso for the zzso zzso from chicken zzso The incubation of a zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso DNA zzso complex with the zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso mismatch zzso while slightly stimulating the activity of zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso mismatch and zzso activities share the same areas of the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso In zzso experiments zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the activity of zzso
