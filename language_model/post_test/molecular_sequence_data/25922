zzso mice were created to assess genetic linkage between zzso syndrome and a zzso substitution at zzso 102 of the human prion protein zzso zzso zzso disease with zzso zzso and zzso similar to that in mouse zzso developed at a mean age of 166 days in 35 mice expressing mouse prion protein with the zzso zzso Thus, many of the clinical and pathological features of zzso syndrome are reproduced in transgenic mice containing a prion protein with a single zzso acid zzso illustrating that a neurodegenerative process similar to a human disease can be genetically modeled in zzso
