zzso of zzso zzso are traditionally identified by zzso zzso type; however, identification of an additional target for typing would improve zzso Isolation of zzso filaments and analysis by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso produced multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso identified peptides in all zzso bands that matched two zzso tandem zzso genes identified in the zzso zzso Hall A zzso Designated zzso and zzso these open reading frames zzso the major structural zzso of zzso zzso Colony zzso and sequencing of zzso variable regions classified 80 environmental and clinical strains into group I or group II and clustered zzso into 12 zzso zzso zzso type was distinct from zzso type, and zzso related zzso clustered zzso zzso a larger zzso product, obtained during amplification of zzso from type E strain Bennett identified a second zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso zzso a large type zzso zzso zzso and the predicted molecular mass for zzso matched that observed by zzso In contrast, the molecular mass of zzso was 2 to 12 zzso larger than the mass predicted by the zzso sequence of a given strain, suggesting that zzso is zzso zzso While identification of zzso and the observation by zzso of different masses of the zzso zzso showed the zzso proteins of zzso zzso to be diverse, the presence of the zzso gene in all strains examined zzso single locus sequence typing of zzso zzso using the zzso variable zzso
