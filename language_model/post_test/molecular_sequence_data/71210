Human DNA zzso II is essential for zzso segregation and is the target for several clinically important zzso zzso It is expressed as genetically distinct alpha and beta zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso genes that map to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The genes display different patterns of cell zzso and zzso zzso with the alpha zzso markedly zzso in zzso zzso In addition to the fundamental role of zzso and zzso genes in cell growth and development, altered expression and zzso of both genes are implicated in zzso drug zzso Here, we report the complete structure of the human zzso zzso zzso which consists of 35 zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso data for the zzso boundaries were determined and examined in the context of zzso zzso protein structure zzso three functional zzso associated with energy zzso DNA zzso activity and nuclear zzso The organization of the 3' half of human zzso including sequence specifying the zzso nuclear zzso domain, was also zzso Of the 15 zzso identified in this 20 zzso region of zzso the first nine and the last zzso align in identical positions and display the same zzso as zzso in zzso Though their extreme 3' ends zzso the striking conservation suggests the two genes zzso recently in evolutionary terms consistent with a gene zzso zzso Access to zzso and zzso gene structures should aid studies of zzso and gene zzso associated with zzso drug zzso
