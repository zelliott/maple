A new moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a mixed zzso zzso with neutral zzso The zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso curved rod growing within a pH range of zzso zzso growth at pH zzso and temperature range of zzso degrees C zzso growth at zzso degrees zzso The optimum zzso concentration for growth is zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA is zzso zzso A limited number of compounds are zzso as electron donors, including zzso zzso ethanol, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not sulfur or zzso can be used as electron zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso or zzso extract as sources of zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence allowed strain zzso zzso zzso zzso to be classified as a representative of a new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
