zzso belong to a zzso of proteins in zzso and zzso that are based on zzso of a zzso highly zzso Greek key zzso Most members of the zzso in zzso are structural proteins of the eye lens that contain four motifs arranged as two structural zzso Absent in melanoma 1 zzso an unusual member of the zzso whose expression is associated with suppression of zzso in melanoma, contains 12 zzso motifs in six zzso Some of these motifs diverge considerably from the zzso motif zzso zzso the first zzso domain of zzso is the most zzso of zzso zzso currently zzso In order to understand the limits of sequence variation on the structure, we report the crystal structure of zzso at zzso A zzso Despite having changes in key zzso the domain retains the overall zzso zzso The domain also contains an unusual extended surface loop that significantly alters the shape of the domain and its charge zzso This structure illustrates the resilience of the zzso fold to considerable sequence changes and its remarkable ability to adapt for novel zzso
