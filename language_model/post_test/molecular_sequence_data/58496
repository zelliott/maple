zzso coli zzso in the beta zzso of the zzso can be zzso with the beta zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been shown that cells carrying such hybrid zzso have an unusual zzso zzso Although they are able to grow on minimal zzso zzso and therefore carry a functional zzso zzso they are defective in the ability to grow zzso indicating some zzso in zzso zzso pumping zzso zzso Hawthorne, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso beta zzso were constructed consisting of the zzso coli or the zzso zzso beta zzso carrying the zzso zzso of the other's beta zzso The zzso of an zzso coli beta zzso zzso with these zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso was located in this zzso zzso The zzso coli beta zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso region displayed the zzso zzso while the zzso zzso beta zzso carrying the zzso coli zzso region did zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from cells displaying the zzso zzso also pumped zzso less well than zzso isolated from cells that were able to grow zzso These results demonstrate that the C zzso of the beta zzso is involved in the zzso zzso pathway, which, through the zzso backbone of the beta zzso physically links zzso synthesis or zzso to the energy of zzso zzso
