A previously unidentified zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso strain zzso and was involved in the zzso of the zzso We have identified the zzso designated zzso as being involved in the zzso of strain zzso following random zzso The zzso acid sequence of the deduced zzso protein exhibited high similarity to those of zzso zzso from zzso and other zzso To confirm whether the protein is involved in zzso we cloned a zzso gene fragment, zzso it in zzso and prepared crude zzso The extracts containing zzso protein exhibited binding to immobilized collagen and zzso but not to zzso Compared with the parental strain zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited reduced binding to collagen and zzso but retained that to zzso This gene was detected in some strains of zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso a new zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso
