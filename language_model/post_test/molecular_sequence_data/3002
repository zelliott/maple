We previously isolated zzso zzso zzso and now describe the isolation of zzso and zzso zzso from an activated zzso cell zzso library and show their zzso expression in human vascular zzso zzso are clustered on human zzso zzso as a result of tandem gene duplication, and were detected only in primates zzso and African green zzso and not in dogs, zzso or zzso showing that this gene cluster has arisen recently in zzso The specific tissue distribution and gene organization suggest that these genes have zzso rapidly after zzso This has resulted in the emergence of an additional signal zzso zzso zzso that ensures zzso of the plasma zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso cluster might contribute to the substantial differences in the zzso metabolism of humans and mice, as dictated by the variable expression of genes involved in this zzso
