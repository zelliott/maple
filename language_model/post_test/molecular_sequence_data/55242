zzso pathogens have shaped the evolution and survival of organisms throughout history, but little is known about the evolution of zzso mechanisms and the zzso zzso strategies of host zzso The zzso model organisms, zzso zzso and zzso zzso feed on a wealth of bacteria in their natural soil environment, some of which can cause zzso Previously, we have shown that these zzso differ in their zzso to a range of human and insect zzso bacteria, with zzso zzso showing extreme resistance compared with zzso zzso Here, we isolated 400 strains of zzso from soil samples and fed their spores to both zzso zzso of six zzso strains were found to kill zzso zzso but not zzso zzso While the majority of zzso strains are benign to zzso observed zzso is restricted to either the spore or the zzso zzso We used the rapid zzso zzso killer strain zzso zzso zzso to conduct a screen for zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso with severe muscle defects and an extended zzso cycle that die rapidly on zzso spores were zzso These genes were identified to be zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso To test whether a similar relationship between zzso and bacterial zzso exists in zzso zzso we used five known zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cycle in zzso also revealed a severe effect on survival in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is critical to zzso health and contributes significantly to survival when fed zzso zzso
