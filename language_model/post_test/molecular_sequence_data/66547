zzso of zzso B is required for exit from zzso and zzso A zzso system, including zzso zzso has been shown to be responsible for zzso B zzso Here we present the zzso sequencing, and expression analysis of goldfish zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso component of zzso from goldfish zzso The cloned zzso is 348 zzso long and encodes 88 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is highly zzso to zzso from other zzso The expression of zzso for zzso was ubiquitous among zzso as opposed to that of zzso for zzso which occurred at a very high level in the zzso zzso goldfish zzso possesses zzso activity against zzso zzso We established an in zzso zzso system of proteins composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso The reconstructed system for these zzso zzso makes it feasible to zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso B zzso
