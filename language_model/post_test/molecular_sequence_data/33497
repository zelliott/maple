zzso infection of zzso B virus zzso has important impacts on both public health and clinical zzso 

To characterize the sequences of zzso S region in a chronic carrier with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso markers for zzso were tested by commercial zzso Western zzso was performed to detect zzso zzso was used to amplify zzso S zzso the zzso products were zzso directly and cloned and then zzso 

Tests with commercial kits showed that the carrier was zzso negative yet zzso zzso zzso was positive in Western zzso zzso Although zzso zzso were as high as zzso serum zzso DNA was positive, ranging from 370 to zzso Wild type and zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso virus had zzso in both zzso and S zzso the zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the S gene had a zzso repeat zzso in the a zzso By zzso search in the zzso the zzso virus had not been identified zzso Nevertheless, the carrier had no signs of liver dysfunction during follow-up zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso with wild type virus in a carrier with negative zzso and positive zzso and high level of zzso
