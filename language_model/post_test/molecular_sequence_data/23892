zzso of zzso processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso contributes to the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso and the Group zzso zzso zzso zzso is the dominant zzso zzso in the central nervous system and is subject to regulatory zzso zzso We have identified novel zzso zzso of zzso and previously zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso tag by automated identification of signature peptides in zzso analyses of zzso zzso We have developed a zzso zzso program to characterize protein zzso by identifying signature peptides that arise from zzso processing in zzso This program analyzes zzso data from zzso analyses of zzso zzso of protein zzso that can include incompletely resolved components in biological zzso This reduces requirements for zzso and thereby zzso zzso modifications during sample zzso A new zzso to generate the theoretical signature zzso set and to calculate similarity scores between predicted and observed mass zzso has been tested and zzso with model zzso The program has been applied to the identification of zzso of proteins of biological interest, including zzso zzso products and zzso and such applications demonstrate the utility of this zzso
