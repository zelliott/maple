We have designed a set of nine plasmids containing the zzso zzso cat gene with one of three zzso zzso sequences zzso strong or zzso and one of three initiation zzso zzso zzso or zzso These constructions have been used to determine the effect of zzso protein S1, zzso and initiation zzso sequences and zzso coli zzso protein zzso on translation in zzso by zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these nine constructions was determined with three types of zzso zzso coli containing zzso protein S1, zzso coli depleted of S1, and zzso zzso which is naturally free of zzso zzso coli zzso were able to translate all nine transcripts with variable zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso were similar to each other and differed from zzso zzso coli zzso in that they required strong or stronger zzso sequences and were unable to translate any of the weak zzso zzso of zzso from either zzso coli or zzso zzso a zzso zzso enabled zzso zzso coli zzso to translate zzso with weak zzso sequences but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso was the preferred initiation zzso for all zzso zzso however, zzso zzso zzso showed greater tolerance for the zzso zzso than either type of zzso coli zzso The presence of a strong or stronger zzso sequence increased the efficiency by which zzso coli zzso could zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
