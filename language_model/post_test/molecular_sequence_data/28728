zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso binding protein in the large zzso is composed of a zzso zzso zzso and four zzso and folds in a way that is zzso similar to the zzso zzso domain zzso et zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso suggests that a zzso surface formed by an zzso zzso and long loop structures are strongly involved in zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso acid zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso we made use of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acids occurred at zzso and loop structures in zzso The zzso of zzso at the beta zzso caused a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso the zzso loop, and the zzso loop, respectively, resulted in a moderate decrease in the zzso zzso binding zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso had little effect on the zzso zzso binding zzso These results, taken together with previous results, identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso structure, and zzso at the zzso loop as critical zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The contribution of these zzso acids to zzso zzso binding was further zzso evaluated by surface zzso resonance zzso analysis by the use of zzso The results showed that the zzso acids on the zzso structure are required to decrease the zzso rate constant for the zzso zzso complex, while those on the zzso are to increase the association rate constant for the zzso zzso zzso
