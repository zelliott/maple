Over 200 zzso besides the deletion delta zzso have been identified in the zzso gene and are known to cause zzso In order to characterize the molecular defects of non delta zzso zzso zzso of various French origin, we have combined the techniques of zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and direct sequencing to screen for zzso in the whole coding sequence of the zzso gene corresponding to the 27 zzso and their zzso zzso This approach enabled us to identify 12 novel zzso which are described zzso We have systematically tested a large number of other zzso changes distributed in the 27 zzso each of them was clearly zzso These data support the notion that the zzso conditions we have defined for screening coding sequence of the zzso gene allows the identification of most of, if not all, the zzso gene zzso
