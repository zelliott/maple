zzso of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Northern zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso was transcribed as an approximately zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso increased zzso zzso when zzso zzso cultures were exposed to zzso zzso with zzso or hydrogen zzso Under zzso conditions, the low levels of zzso zzso increased in a zzso manner, reaching maximum expression at late zzso or early stationary phase, followed by a decrease in stationary zzso Under zzso conditions, the expression of zzso zzso was strongly zzso by zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso However, zzso repression was completely abolished upon exposure to zzso The zzso carbon sources zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not significantly affect zzso zzso zzso and zzso limitation did not affect the expression of zzso zzso suggesting that the nutritional control of zzso expression is restricted to carbon and energy sources and not other forms of zzso zzso zzso extension analysis revealed that during both zzso stress and carbon or energy zzso zzso zzso the same promoter region but zzso initiation occurred at two different zzso separated by 3 or 4 zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso repeat sequence present in the zzso regulatory region was also observed upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso It is possible that this is a recognition site for a DNA binding protein involved in the regulation of zzso stress genes in this zzso
