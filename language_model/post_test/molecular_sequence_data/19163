zzso capable of effectively zzso zzso generally exhibit very high levels of zzso zzso both in their zzso and zzso zzso In many cases, full zzso of the zzso zzso back to zzso results in substantial to complete loss of zzso zzso However, it has been unclear whether all or most of the observed framework zzso would be necessary or whether a small subset of these zzso might be sufficient for broad and potent zzso To address this issue and to explore the dependence of zzso activity on the level of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso we applied a zzso guided zzso procedure to two broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which target two different zzso sites of zzso zzso zzso in which up to zzso zzso of 49 for zzso and zzso zzso of 35 for zzso of framework zzso were reverted to zzso retained breadth and potency within zzso of the mature zzso when evaluated on a panel of 21 diverse viral zzso Further, a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso L chain showed a zzso improvement in potency over the mature zzso Our results indicate that only a small number of zzso zzso may be sufficient for high breadth and potency of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso framework zzso of zzso broadly zzso zzso may present advantages over their highly zzso counterparts as zzso zzso and as targets for zzso zzso
