zzso from zzso zzso zzso despite having only 20 % sequence identity with the more commonly studied zzso zzso zzso properties which result in an increased number of zzso contacts and a loss of most internal salt bridges, shares a number of features of their folding zzso We show here that it contains an unusually stable core which resists unfolding even at 70 degrees zzso The equilibrium intermediate zzso at this high temperature is distinct from the acid unfolded state zzso which has many properties in common with the acid intermediate observed for the zzso zzso zzso It contains a smaller amount of secondary structure (27 % zzso instead of 35 zzso and is more highly zzso as evidenced from its zzso spectrum zzso zzso instead of 338 zzso Its stability is greatly increased zzso zzso zzso in the presence of high salt (2 M zzso lending support to the view that zzso interactions are responsible for its zzso zzso data show classical two-state zzso between zzso and the folded state both in the presence and absence of zzso Both zzso and zzso can be populated within the dead time of the zzso apparatus, since initiating the zzso reaction from zzso or zzso rather than the completely unfolded state does not affect the observed zzso zzso Our conclusion is that zzso as other zzso proteins (including for example zzso in the absence of zzso may be described as zzso with an unusually high and zzso tendency to populate partially folded zzso
