Mouse zzso B zzso editing protein gene has been isolated and zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from the zzso sequences of the gene showed 90, 70 and zzso identity to those of zzso human and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated high expression in small zzso especially in the zzso as a major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in other zzso including the liver is smaller in amounts and larger in size zzso zzso than the zzso zzso The gene spans 12 zzso and contains 5 zzso and 4 zzso zzso of the zzso region revealed that a zzso zzso box is absent and the consensus recognition sequences for several zzso factors have been zzso
