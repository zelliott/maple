zzso acids responsible for structure, core function or specificity may be zzso from multiple protein sequence alignments where a limited set of zzso types are zzso The rise in available protein sequences continues to increase the power of techniques based on this zzso 

A new algorithm, zzso for predicting protein functional sites from multiple sequences alignments was compared to 14 conservation measures and to the zzso zzso zzso was performed on an automatically generated zzso of zzso families derived from the protein interactions database zzso and a smaller manually curated set of 148 zzso The best performing measure overall was Williamson property zzso with zzso scores of zzso and zzso for domain and small zzso contact zzso zzso The zzso method performed worse than random on zzso interaction site prediction zzso score of zzso The zzso zzso gave similar accuracy to the zzso zzso zzso zzso but was superior to Williamson in prediction of zzso transient complex zzso zzso predicts sites that are significantly more zzso accessible compared to zzso 

Williamson property zzso is the the best performing of 14 conservation measures zzso The difference in performance of zzso relative to Williamson in manually defined complexes was dependent on complex zzso The best choice of analysis method is therefore dependent on the system of zzso Additional zzso employed by Miner in calculation of zzso trees did not produce improved results over zzso zzso performance was improved by use of windows over alignment zzso illustrating the necessity of considering the local environment of positions when assessing their functional zzso
