We have shown that sequential replicating zzso type 5 host range zzso human zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso delivered first zzso zzso plus orally and then zzso zzso followed by envelope protein zzso elicits broad cellular immunity and functional, zzso serum and zzso zzso that correlate with protection from high-dose zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso challenges in zzso zzso Here we extended these studies to compare the standard zzso regimen with additional zzso administration routes, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar systemic cellular and zzso immunity was zzso by all zzso zzso Central and zzso memory T cell responses were also zzso by the four zzso routes in zzso zzso fluid and zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso Cellular responses in zzso tissue were more zzso being induced primarily by zzso zzso In contrast, all zzso routes zzso zzso zzso zzso responses at multiple zzso zzso Following a repeated zzso zzso zzso challenge with zzso at a dose zzso one or two zzso protection against acquisition was not achieved except in one zzso in the zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso exhibited reduced peak zzso compared to that of controls, correlated zzso with zzso serum zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso and percent zzso zzso viral zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were correlated with the number of zzso required for zzso zzso we show for the first time a significant correlation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with delayed zzso Further investigation of the characteristics and properties of the zzso should zzso the mechanism leading to this protective zzso
