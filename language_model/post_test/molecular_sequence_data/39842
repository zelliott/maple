The zzso repeat zzso is a zzso zzso acid repeating motif that forms a repeating zzso structure and is a well characterized zzso of zzso zzso Recently, a zzso investigation on one naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso found that the zzso zzso displayed an unusual zzso unfolding pathway, distinct from the two-state model usually displayed by zzso zzso To investigate this unusual behavior, we undertook a zzso analysis of zzso where both native and engineered zzso zzso are used as fluorescent reporters to monitor the range of local and global unfolding events that comprise the unfolding zzso of zzso Specifically, seven zzso zzso were constructed, each with a single zzso zzso in each of the seven zzso repeats of zzso By combining equilibrium and kinetic fluorescent unfolding zzso with circular zzso experiments, our study reveals that the unusual folding zzso of zzso is a consequence of the unfolding of two separate, autonomous zzso zzso with the less stable region appearing to account for the low structural stability of zzso
