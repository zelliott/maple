Studies have shown that zzso zzso analysis of gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso fine needle aspiration zzso can be routinely zzso We validated zzso zzso 11 zzso analysis on cell block material obtained from fine needle aspiration zzso zzso for diagnostic purposes and compared it with the same analysis in zzso zzso full sections of the corresponding zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis was done on cell block material obtained from ten cases encountered in our department from 1999 to 2008 on which zzso was attempted zzso The findings were compared with analysis on full zzso section of the corresponding zzso zzso in seven cases where patients opted for zzso zzso zzso 11 was examined via zzso zzso acid zzso 

Our results showed zzso zzso for the presence and type of zzso 11 zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in all seven zzso These zzso had diagnostic value when compared with other zzso that are part of the zzso differential diagnosis, such as zzso or gastric zzso 

zzso zzso is a powerful tool that can complement zzso and zzso assessment of zzso material in routine practice for the diagnosis and zzso of zzso We briefly discuss the advantages and limitations of the fine needle method of obtaining tissue for the diagnosis and zzso of zzso and its current therapeutic zzso
