An understanding of the relationship between the breadth and magnitude of zzso zzso responses and viral loads is important for the design of effective zzso For this study, we screened a cohort of 46 zzso C human zzso virus type 1 zzso individuals for zzso responses against a panel of peptides corresponding to the complete zzso C zzso We used a gamma zzso zzso zzso to explore the hypothesis that patterns of zzso responses across the expressed zzso zzso correlate with viral zzso The estimated median time from zzso to response for the cohort was 13 months, and the order of cumulative zzso responses against zzso proteins was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Pol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rev zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most intensely targeted zzso with zzso of the zzso being clustered within 119 zzso zzso zzso almost one-third of the responses across the expressed zzso The second most targeted region was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso There was no correlation between viral load and the breadth of responses, but there was a weak positive correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso between viral load and the total magnitude of responses, zzso that the magnitude of zzso recognition did not contribute to viral zzso When zzso patterns of recognition were correlated with the viral load, preferential targeting of zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso associated with viral zzso These data suggest that preferential targeting of zzso zzso rather than the breadth or magnitude of the response across the zzso may be an important marker of immune zzso These data have significance for the design of vaccines and for interpretation of zzso zzso
