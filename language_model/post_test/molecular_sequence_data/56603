The zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso small zzso contains a zzso group zzso zzso with an zzso zzso in frame with the preceding zzso zzso The stop zzso was changed to an zzso acid zzso and zzso efficiency was compared with that of the wild type in the presence and absence of zzso In zzso the zzso has a much lower efficiency for producing a mature transcript than the wild zzso Also, the relative production of the full-length translation product is zzso lower in the zzso than in the wild zzso These results confirm the importance of the stop zzso which spans the zzso site of the zzso zzso The occurrence of stop zzso in 56 group I zzso in zzso genes was zzso In 33 of those translation is terminated upstream of the first common elements of the zzso core, of group I zzso In the rest translation is terminated in zzso regions outside the heart of the zzso core, with one zzso Our observations suggest that in situations where zzso and translation are coupled events there has been an evolutionary pressure to preserve stop zzso in the zzso of these zzso or to prevent zzso termination from occurring in vital parts of the zzso
