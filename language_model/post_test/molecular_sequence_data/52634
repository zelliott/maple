By using reverse zzso chain reaction, two zzso were isolated that zzso major intrinsic membrane proteins zzso that are expressed in zzso root zzso of zzso zzso zzso intrinsic membrane protein 1 zzso 1) is expressed at high levels in both zzso and root zzso and shows highest sequence similarity to members of the zzso intrinsic protein zzso zzso of plant zzso zzso analysis of zzso 1 by expression in zzso zzso zzso show that it is a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso 2 shows the highest sequence similarity to soybean zzso 26 zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso 2 is also a zzso showing expression only in mature nitrogen fixing zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 is a zzso zzso and displays the ability to flux both water as well as zzso upon expression in zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso terminal region of zzso 2 has a zzso zzso motif that is zzso by a zzso domain protein zzso Overall, the data show that zzso zzso zzso contain two structurally and functionally distinct zzso zzso one zzso 2) which appears to be the zzso 26 zzso of zzso zzso and another zzso 1) which appears to be a member of the zzso zzso
