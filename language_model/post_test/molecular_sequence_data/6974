A zzso protein was obtained by fusing together the zzso toxin A chain zzso gene and a DNA zzso zzso the N zzso of protein G of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retained full zzso activity in a zzso zzso but was zzso less toxic against human zzso cells than either native zzso zzso or unmodified zzso zzso zzso However, zzso made with zzso and human zzso zzso showed zzso greater cell killing efficacy than zzso or zzso zzso despite equivalent binding of the three zzso to target tumor zzso As a consequence, by fusion of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso the specificity factor zzso the ratio between zzso and specific zzso of zzso was increased zzso times with respect to those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso faster zzso than zzso at zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the ability of zzso zzso virus protein G to interact with cell zzso can be transferred to zzso to facilitate its zzso to the cell zzso Our strategy may serve as a general approach for zzso the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso
