zzso zzso coli zzso induce gross zzso zzso within zzso cells, immediately beneath the attached zzso The zzso 280 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a bacterial zzso zzso mediate the intimate bacterial zzso zzso Recently, interest in this process has been zzso by the discovery that the bacterial zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso into the host cell zzso zzso and after binding zzso triggers the intimate zzso Using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and combining zzso with zzso zzso of zzso groups, we have determined the global fold of zzso This represents one of the largest, zzso protein structures to be determined by zzso that has not been previously resolved by X-ray zzso zzso comprises three zzso two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso which define a new family of bacterial zzso zzso These findings also imply that zzso recognition may be important in zzso cell zzso
