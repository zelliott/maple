zzso zzso has not been a successful method to express the zzso zzso zzso zzso such that these receptors are detected on the cell zzso This is not the case for all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso type 3 zzso zzso results in zzso surface zzso zzso Cell lines zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso produce zzso albeit zzso levels of surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface expression is dependent, at least in part, on zzso zzso In addition to factors provided by the cells used for zzso zzso we zzso that the surface expression level in zzso cells is an intrinsic property of the zzso protein under zzso zzso a set of zzso type 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso we expressed these zzso in a transient zzso system and zzso surface zzso zzso We have identified zzso acids that control zzso distribution between surface and zzso zzso surface zzso expression can be manipulated without affecting the total number of zzso These zzso function independently of the cell line used for expression and the zzso method zzso How these surface expression zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso might influence synaptic efficacy is zzso
