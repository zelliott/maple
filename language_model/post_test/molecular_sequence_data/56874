The zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso protein zzso It is a zzso and zzso is the major zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes a mobility shift, resulting in two zzso protein zzso The zzso pattern is zzso altered when cell cycle progression is delayed or zzso The slowly zzso zzso form is prominent in zzso arrested cells, and the fast zzso form is enriched in zzso zzso zzso is a protein zzso It zzso as well as zzso zzso basic protein zzso zzso as well as zzso were found in zzso but no zzso zzso occurs when zzso was used as the zzso The zzso zzso from zzso arrested cells have a zzso higher zzso activity than that from wild zzso The zzso gene zzso is viable, indicating that the zzso gene is zzso for zzso High dosage of zzso however, strongly delays the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso shows that zzso pattern of zzso protein zzso alters depending on cell cycle zzso In zzso cells, zzso locates in the zzso whereas in zzso arrested cells, nuclear stain is zzso In zzso cells, nuclear stain is seen only in zzso zzso Hence zzso protein may play an important role in zzso control by altering cellular location, degree of zzso and zzso zzso We discuss possible roles of zzso zzso as an zzso regulator in zzso
