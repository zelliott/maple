A consistent lack of DNA zzso at one or both of two zzso zzso I) restriction sites in the zzso region of the zzso gene has been previously documented by the use of zzso restriction zzso in human cells and zzso zzso of their expression of DR alpha zzso Evidence presently available, however, does not exclude that a lack of zzso in this region, although not zzso might be necessary for gene zzso In this report, we show that only one of the zzso sites is protected, although less efficiently than in man, from zzso modifications in zzso and cells of transgenic mice carrying an expressed single copy of the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the two zzso zzso sites of the zzso zzso are fully zzso in DR zzso zzso (more than zzso zzso while one of them (the most zzso zzso is not zzso in a fraction of DR zzso zzso (more than zzso zzso These results provide evidence that absence of DNA zzso in the zzso region is not necessary for, but might be associated with and possibly secondary to the expression of the zzso zzso
