Two distinct zzso of 120 and 235 zzso called zzso and zzso serve as zzso of zzso a member of zzso signal zzso by stimulating its intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso (also called Ras zzso is highly specific for Ras and does not stimulate the intrinsic zzso activity of zzso or zzso Using zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of bovine zzso we have shown previously that the zzso specificity is determined by the Ras domain zzso zzso where zzso plays the primary zzso The corresponding domain zzso zzso of human zzso (called zzso which shares only zzso sequence identity with the zzso also activates Ras zzso In this article, we demonstrate that the zzso like the zzso is highly specific for Ras and does not activate either zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, using a series of zzso zzso and zzso Ras zzso we show that zzso at position 61 of the zzso primarily determines that zzso as well as zzso activates Ras zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso at position 63 of the zzso is required for maximizing the sensitivity of Ras zzso to both zzso and zzso Interestingly, replacement of zzso of zzso by zzso reduces its intrinsic zzso activity and zzso the zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso appears primarily to be due to the loss of its sensitivity to the two major Ras signal zzso zzso and zzso
