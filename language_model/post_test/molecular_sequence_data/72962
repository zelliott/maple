The gene coding for the zzso tuberculosis zzso of zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso acids required for zzso zzso are zzso whereas those important for specific DNA binding are not, when compared with zzso coli zzso The zzso start site was mapped and a DNA sequence motif was identified which resembled the consensus zzso box sequence involved in the regulation of zzso genes in zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso in zzso coli and zzso by means of a His zzso The zzso zzso was shown to bind to the zzso box sequence found upstream of its own zzso
