Several studies have reported the presence of carcass quality zzso on zzso and zzso with no specific genes being zzso linked as their zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso in genes known to affect zzso metabolism in other species and to assess their association with carcass quality zzso Two genes located on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and core binding factor, zzso domain, alpha zzso 2, zzso to 1 gene zzso have been previously evaluated in other species and found to contain zzso influencing zzso zzso A gene on zzso zzso growth factor 8 zzso has in recent studies been linked to several zzso affecting obesity in mice, indicating its potential for regulating zzso in other zzso zzso analysis identified 9 zzso in zzso 4 in zzso and 4 in zzso Multiple sequence alignment of zzso among zzso humans, and mice showed that 4 of these zzso lie in zzso regions across these zzso Using zzso Angus, zzso and zzso animals produced associations with ultrasound zzso score zzso P zzso zzso ultrasound zzso zzso P zzso zzso carcass zzso zzso P zzso zzso and lean meat yield zzso P zzso zzso zzso trait zzso analysis including a set of previously zzso markers on zzso and 1 zzso zzso resulted in several significant zzso zzso ultrasound zzso zzso at 91 zzso lean meat yield at 86 zzso carcass zzso at 15 zzso and yield grade at 87 zzso all at the P zzso zzso zzso Using zzso as a genetic zzso removed the zzso zzso indicating that this zzso was contributing to the variation observed in zzso A similar analysis was performed on zzso using 1 of the zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso for lean meat yield at 2 zzso and for yield grade at 25 zzso both at P zzso zzso and for carcass zzso at 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in further analysis resulted in the disappearance of the carcass zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso discovered in zzso zzso and zzso may play a role in the zzso metabolism zzso affecting carcass quality traits in beef zzso However, further studies are needed to confirm that these zzso are responsible for the differences observed in carcass quality in beef zzso
