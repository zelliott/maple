We performed a systematic study of 55 zzso zzso zzso the majority of which are currently classified as zzso zzso zzso by using a combination of zzso and DNA fingerprint zzso The zzso procedures used included zzso zzso testing, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The 55 strains examined exhibited a good correlation between their zzso and DNA zzso which allowed us to divide them into nine zzso The DNA fingerprints of the nine groups differed zzso but within each group the DNA fingerprints exhibited a high level of zzso To determine the zzso relationships of the nine groups, we performed a zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The results of a comparative analysis of the partial sequence corresponding to positions 830 to zzso zzso coli zzso of the zzso zzso gene indicated that the nine zzso groups could be assembled into four zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso sequences of strains representing these groups were zzso Our zzso analysis revealed that the zzso type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group I) was only zzso related to the zzso strains belonging to zzso groups II, III, and IV zzso of sequence zzso 90 to zzso The strains belonging to zzso groups II, III, and IV, represented by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso respectively, were closely related zzso of sequence zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a level of similarity of zzso with the type strain of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strains is necessary, and possible names for the four zzso groups are zzso
