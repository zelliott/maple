DNA vaccines have the potential of giving rise to a potent zzso immune response by inducing zzso synthesis and subsequent zzso presentation of zzso zzso We have tested a DNA vaccine specific for human zzso virus type 1 zzso by the injection of animals with expression plasmids zzso the zzso envelope protein and the Rev regulatory zzso zzso of both plasmids into mice, zzso or zzso was found to induce high levels of specific zzso capable of efficiently zzso both zzso infection and zzso cell zzso A readily zzso zzso hypersensitivity zzso response was zzso in injected mice and zzso derived from these proliferated in response to an zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the injected mice or zzso also developed a strong zzso T zzso zzso response against target cells zzso with the zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that injection of zzso gene expression plasmids can induce potent zzso and zzso immune responses and suggest that DNA vaccines may prove to be significantly beneficial as a means of zzso against zzso
