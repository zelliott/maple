A recent report that 93 per cent of invasive cervical zzso worldwide contain human zzso zzso may be an zzso due to sample zzso or integration events affecting the zzso zzso zzso which is the target of the zzso chain reaction zzso test which was zzso The formerly zzso cases from this study have therefore been zzso for zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso 16 zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed on 49 of the 66 cases which were zzso and a sample of 48 of the zzso cases which were zzso in the original zzso Moreover, 55 of the 66 formerly zzso zzso were also zzso by a sandwich procedure in which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for zzso review, while the inner sections are zzso by three different zzso zzso zzso targeting different open reading frames zzso No significant difference was found in zzso for zzso 16 proteins between the cases that were originally zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for 14 high-risk zzso types detected zzso DNA in 38 zzso per zzso of the 55 originally zzso and zzso zzso The zzso types detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 52, and zzso Two (4 per zzso additional cases were only zzso zzso by E1 and/or zzso consensus zzso zzso analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were zzso zzso Only two of the 34 adequate samples were zzso on all zzso tests, as against 13 of the 21 that were inadequate ( zzso zzso Combining the data from this and the previous study and excluding inadequate zzso the worldwide zzso prevalence in cervical zzso is zzso per zzso The presence of zzso in virtually all cervical zzso implies the highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a specific cause of any major human zzso The extreme rarity of zzso zzso reinforces the rationale for zzso testing in addition to, or even instead of, cervical zzso in routine cervical zzso
