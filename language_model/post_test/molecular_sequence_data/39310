Although zzso types differ between species, the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso surface of the zzso zzso is a common event during the zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso sites was isolated by zzso zzso and used for zzso zzso In a mouse zzso containing 12 345 zzso we found 136 genes zzso more than twofold at the zzso site, while 223 genes were zzso by at least zzso zzso zzso was used to verify the differential expression of seven zzso and six zzso genes chosen randomly from our zzso analysis, and the expression trends were zzso The differential expression patterns of eight zzso genes were verified by in zzso zzso Compared with the zzso site on day 5 of pregnancy and the zzso on day 5 of zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso Ras zzso gene family, member zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain containing 2, zzso zzso protein 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 61 zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso at zzso site on day 5 of zzso These genes may be related to zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso a gene zzso at the zzso site, was chosen to examine its expression and regulation during the zzso period by in zzso zzso zzso zzso was specifically localized in the zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso at day 4 midnight and on day 5 of pregnancy, and in the activated zzso but not expressed in zzso sites and under delayed zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso Our data could be a valuable source for future study on zzso zzso
