zzso of zzso zzso amplification in DNA samples extracted from zzso embedded sections of 136 zzso cancer samples was carried out by a quantitative zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso a possible association of zzso copy numbers with established zzso factors such as age, zzso zzso stage, zzso zzso residual zzso mass, zzso hormone zzso content and zzso CA 125 serum zzso In addition, correlation of zzso amplification with overall survival of the patients was zzso There was a borderline positive correlation between zzso CA 125 serum levels and the degree of amplification of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso A statistically significant association of zzso with zzso copy number could be found zzso zzso zzso No correlation between zzso amplification and overall survival was zzso The data combine to suggest that zzso is an indicator of aggressiveness of zzso zzso
