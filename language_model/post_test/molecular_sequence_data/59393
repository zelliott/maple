We have determined the complete primary structure of a putative zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso with a calculated molecular mass of 114 zzso and eight to ten putative zzso segments contains all zzso acid motifs specific to the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso scores were obtained by comparison with zzso zzso plant and animal zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso In addition, all zzso acids shown to be essential for zzso transport in animal zzso zzso zzso are preserved in zzso zzso lower zzso were found with animal plasma membrane zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso gave no indications of possible zzso sites, characteristic of those zzso It is assumed that zzso is a representative of the zzso class of zzso In Northern zzso experiments with zzso zzso a zzso transcript was detected at levels which were very low compared with those of the plasma membrane zzso from zzso zzso zzso Wolf et zzso 1995, Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses suggest the existence of additional zzso genes in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
