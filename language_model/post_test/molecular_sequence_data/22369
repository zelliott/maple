The bovine zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso one zzso of the regulatory gamma zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso plays a major role in the regulation of energy metabolism and zzso affecting the genes zzso the gamma zzso have been shown to influence zzso zzso The zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso activity in skeletal muscle and strongly influences zzso zzso zzso content in muscle is correlated to meat quality in livestock because it influences zzso maturation process and ultimate zzso zzso occurring zzso in the zzso zzso gene highly affect meat quality by influencing zzso content before zzso We present the characterization of the bovine zzso gene and a zzso analysis in three cattle zzso zzso zzso were identified among which 13 are in the coding region, one is in the 3' zzso and 18 are in the zzso Five of them change an zzso acid in the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were determined in the three breeds considered, and zzso zzso affecting the coding sequence are found at a very low zzso Alternative zzso sites were identified at two positions of the zzso introducing zzso in the population of proteins translated from the zzso
