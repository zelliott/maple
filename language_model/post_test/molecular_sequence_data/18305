An zzso element of zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso was isolated using an zzso zzso The zzso zzso was shown to stimulate the nearby zzso or zzso gene expression in zzso coli in both directions at a stimulation rate of zzso The same zzso was also demonstrated to have promoter function when a zzso zzso was zzso zzso obtained from sequencing data showed that a sequence zzso zzso to the zzso binding DNA motif of zzso and two zzso boxes were zzso
