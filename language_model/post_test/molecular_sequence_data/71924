zzso hormone zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso via suppression of the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso We examined the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso activity by giving an acute intravenous zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso per zzso increased zzso membrane zzso activity and zzso Acute infusion of zzso caused a zzso decrease in zzso activity as early as 30 zzso zzso in zzso activity at 30 and 60 zzso was accompanied by increased zzso zzso In contrast to the rapid changes in zzso activity and zzso decrease in zzso membrane zzso zzso was not zzso until 4-12 h after the zzso zzso The decrease in zzso membrane zzso occurred in the absence of changes in total zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso of the animals with the zzso agent zzso blocked the zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso acutely cause a decrease in zzso intrinsic transport activity possibly via a zzso mechanism followed by a decrease in zzso membrane zzso zzso via changes in protein zzso
