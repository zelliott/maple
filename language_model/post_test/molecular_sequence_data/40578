zzso critically regulate all zzso cell growth and proliferation by mechanisms such as the repression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso the levels of cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting its transcription, but the exact mechanism zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso degradation has not been zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso associate with zzso zzso bearing zzso elements located in the 3' untranslated regions zzso and zzso their zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso is a target of zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation by altering the competitive binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso The depletion of cellular zzso enhanced zzso binding to zzso zzso and decreased the levels of zzso transcript associated with zzso thus stabilizing zzso zzso The zzso of zzso increased zzso binding to the zzso zzso decreased the abundance of zzso zzso complexes, rendered the zzso zzso zzso and prevented increases in zzso zzso and protein in zzso zzso zzso increasing the cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso and enhanced its association with zzso resulting in an zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso the stability of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells through zzso and zzso and provide new insight into the molecular functions of cellular zzso
