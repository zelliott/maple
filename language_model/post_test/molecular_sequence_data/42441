zzso is a zzso zzso which accumulates in zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence has implicated transforming growth factor beta zzso in the zzso of experimental zzso We have, therefore, examined the influence of zzso 1 on zzso cell zzso zzso zzso first, levels of zzso zzso 1 increased zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells by zzso times 24 zzso after treatment of cycling zzso cells and by zzso times in zzso zzso There was, however, no zzso in zzso zzso zzso in either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in cell culture zzso determined by zzso of zzso from cells labeled with zzso and by zzso were not increased by treatment with zzso zzso Western blots and zzso of metabolically labeled cells showed that zzso was increased, however, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso 1 altered the zzso properties of zzso in zzso and zzso such that the zzso point of zzso determined from Western blots of zzso zzso gels, was reduced so that both became more zzso These studies zzso therefore, that in addition to increasing its zzso zzso 1 increases incorporation of zzso into the zzso Because zzso possesses binding sites for other zzso zzso greater incorporation of zzso following zzso 1 treatment may be an important zzso mechanism in zzso zzso Moreover, the altered charge of zzso may increase zzso of serum zzso to the zzso
