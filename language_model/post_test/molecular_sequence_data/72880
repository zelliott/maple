zzso with zzso or zzso zzso dramatically improves DNA binding by zzso zzso factors, indicating that recognition by such complexes is important for zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso a major zzso of specificity is the flexible zzso zzso It makes zzso contacts via the minor groove, including one to the 1st position of a zzso core by a zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso also contributes to the stability of zzso complexes, apparently by forming the same DNA zzso We further show that zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso proteins have different zzso at another position recognized by the zzso arm (the 2nd position in the zzso zzso zzso zzso arm zzso 2 and 3, which distinguish the binding of zzso and zzso zzso play no role in the specificity of their complexes with zzso In addition, zzso and zzso which are capable of binding both zzso and zzso sites as zzso can cooperate with zzso only on a zzso zzso These data suggest that some DNA contacts made by the zzso arm are altered by interaction with zzso
