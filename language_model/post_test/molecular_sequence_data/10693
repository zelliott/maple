zzso zzso zzso zzso is a plasma membrane zinc zzso that is involved in the zzso metabolism of zzso and its zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso lacks the classical signatures of other zzso zzso and shows no zzso with any other zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso to explore the roles of five zzso zzso in pig membrane zzso that are zzso among zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso zzso and zzso exhibited a specific activity and zzso for the zzso zzso comparable with those of the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso but were expressed at the cell surface at equivalent levels to the zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso These three zzso were compared with regard to their ability to bind to the competitive inhibitor zzso which binds with equal efficacy to native and zzso pig kidney membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were efficiently bound by zzso but zzso failed to zzso Thus zzso appears to be involved in the binding of zzso or zzso whereas zzso and zzso appear to be involved in zzso zzso zzso shares some similarity with a zzso recently cloned from zzso zzso In particular, zzso and zzso of membrane zzso are zzso in the bacterial zzso as are zzso and zzso previously shown to be required for zzso zzso
