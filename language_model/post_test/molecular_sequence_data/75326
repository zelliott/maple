The primary envelope zzso gene product of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso representing a zzso with an apparent Mr of 52,000 zzso was isolated from zzso normal rat kidney cells metabolically labeled with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso of the zzso present were determined by zzso analysis, zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso contains solely zzso zzso zzso 6 to 9 zzso zzso zzso some of which carry additional zzso The structures of the zzso found reflect the typical zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso isolated from zzso cells zzso however, is characterized by increased amounts of zzso species zzso other structural zzso Only zzso zzso zzso are, in part, further processed yielding incomplete zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the limited zzso processing of the primary zzso zzso gene product is neither due to zzso trimming of its zzso zzso nor due to transfer of immature zzso zzso as observed in zzso zzso
