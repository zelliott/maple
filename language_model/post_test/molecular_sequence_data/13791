The zzso behavior of simple zzso zzso acids containing a dysfunctional zzso group was zzso zzso zzso below zzso were obtained for the zzso zzso The active zzso of the zzso described zzso is involved in an equilibrium between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso in its E form interacts strongly with the zzso and we suggest that the Z form is expelled from the active site, as suggested by molecular modeling studies using the zzso zzso Also, zzso intermediate mimicry is achieved by the zzso form, but not by the corresponding zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso has been determined for the zzso zzso and by zzso the concentration of inhibitor by its zzso zzso a Ki of zzso zzso has been determined for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generated a Ki of zzso zzso The requirements at the zzso position to achieve good zzso are also zzso
