zzso sodium channels zzso are responsible for generating action zzso in nervous zzso zzso zzso a zzso soluble zzso isolated from zzso zzso seed, is believed to bind to segment 6 of zzso and act as a partial zzso However, high resolution structural interaction mechanism between zzso and zzso is difficult to zzso because of the large size and membrane zzso of zzso Here, the authors designed model peptides corresponding to domain IV segment 6 zzso of rat skeletal muscle zzso and analyzed the complex of the model peptides and zzso by solution zzso analysis to obtain structural information of the zzso The model peptides successfully formed an zzso which is the suspected native zzso of zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso of the model zzso were identified using the zzso zzso experiments with zzso including a newly discovered zzso binding zzso zzso zzso in zzso which has not been reported by point zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding zzso on the model zzso revealed the zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso experiments with a zzso analog of zzso zzso also indicated that the zzso backbone of zzso interacts with the zzso interaction surface of zzso and that the zzso group of zzso possibly causes zzso by interacting with domain I segment 6 and/or domain IV segment zzso
