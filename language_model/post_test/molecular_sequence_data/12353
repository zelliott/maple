zzso acids zzso are vitamin A derivatives essential for normal embryonic development and viability of zzso The zzso signal is zzso by two distinct classes of zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso X receptors zzso The zzso family is composed of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso beta gene is zzso and temporally restricted in certain structures in the developing zzso suggesting that zzso beta could play specific roles during zzso Four zzso of the zzso beta gene zzso zzso 4) are generated by differential usage of promoters and alternative zzso It has recently been demonstrated that the zzso beta 2 zzso is zzso for normal zzso To ascertain the function of all zzso beta zzso in zzso we have generated a zzso that zzso all zzso of the zzso beta gene in the mouse by gene targeting in embryonic stem zzso Mice zzso for the zzso are viable and fertile with no zzso apparent zzso During development, zzso zzso beta zzso zzso showed fusion of the ninth and tenth zzso zzso on both sides of the zzso However, no obvious zzso in the spatial pattern of expression of zzso zzso and zzso were observed in day zzso zzso zzso The zzso beta zzso zzso did not alter the pattern or extent of the limb and zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso beta may not be mandatory to mediate the observed zzso effects of zzso in these zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso beta zzso are not absolutely required for embryonic development and provide additional support to the concept of functional zzso among members of the zzso zzso
