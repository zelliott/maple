The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso has pronounced G versus C strand bias and zzso sized zzso characteristic of genes zzso extensively edited zzso We find that zzso transcripts of zzso zzso are extensively edited throughout by the addition and deletion of numerous zzso creating potential initiation and termination zzso and a continuous open reading zzso A potential guide zzso sequence occurs in a zzso between zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso zzso transcripts is also extensively zzso with a created initiation zzso The predicted zzso zzso acid sequences have zzso to those of zzso zzso zzso 6 genes from a variety of zzso In addition, their zzso profiles are quite similar to those of other zzso We therefore conclude that zzso encodes zzso zzso 6 zzso
