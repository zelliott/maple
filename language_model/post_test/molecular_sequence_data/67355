We have discovered a novel zzso present in multiple human stool zzso The virus was initially identified by shotgun zzso of DNA zzso from zzso particles isolated from a stool sample collected from a healthy child from zzso We subsequently zzso the zzso zzso zzso which has been zzso named zzso zzso zzso The virus has zzso features characteristic of the family zzso but is highly divergent from other members of this zzso It is predicted to zzso the large T zzso and small T zzso early proteins and the zzso zzso and zzso structural zzso A real-time zzso zzso was designed and used to screen zzso stool samples from children with zzso in zzso Louis, zzso 12 specimens were positive for zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of the index Malawi case and one zzso Louis case demonstrated that the two strains of zzso varied by zzso at the zzso zzso The number of zzso found in the human body continues to grow, raising the question of how many more species have yet to be identified and what roles they play in humans with and without manifest zzso
