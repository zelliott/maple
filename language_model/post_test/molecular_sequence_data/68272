zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso is now under extensive investigation because of its potential clinical zzso zzso labeled proteins are usually required to study zzso binding and zzso properties of zzso This study was undertaken to see if zzso affects the biological and zzso properties of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso amount of zzso cold zzso to minimize multiple zzso Of the four zzso present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso under the experimental conditions zzso zzso of zzso resulted in modification without zzso of the biological activity, whereas zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso with highly compromised biological zzso Similar zzso was observed if both zzso and zzso were zzso These modified proteins exhibited zzso and zzso apparently identical to those of the native zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso gel zzso light zzso and circular zzso From these results, we concluded that zzso and zzso are not accessible to the zzso and are probably buried in the zzso core, whereas zzso and zzso are exposed on the surface of the zzso of the two exposed zzso only zzso contributes to the biological zzso
