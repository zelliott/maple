The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the class 1 of G zzso receptors and is involved in inflammatory and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the importance of zzso regions for the large species differences between human zzso and canine zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were generated by replacing corresponding zzso of the zzso with canine zzso zzso and three canine zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso and zzso Wild type and zzso zzso receptors were expressed in zzso insect cells and subsequently characterized in zzso experiments and in zzso zzso activity zzso where standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The exchange of zzso or first zzso loop did not influence zzso zzso The effect of altered second zzso loop zzso and third zzso loop zzso was rather zzso specific than zzso zzso zzso At zzso the potency of zzso and zzso significantly zzso The efficacy of the inverse zzso zzso was strongly reduced at zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso as weak inverse zzso at zzso exhibited partial zzso activity at zzso and zzso zzso dynamic simulations suggest that the zzso and zzso are independently of each other involved in the zzso zzso of zzso and that zzso as well as zzso do not directly interact with zzso in the binding zzso In conclusion, our study indicates an involvement of the zzso and zzso in zzso zzso process after binding of some but not all examined zzso
