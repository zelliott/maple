zzso family zzso including bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso a reaction essential for maintaining zzso zzso In the presence of zzso these proteins bind a zzso DNA to form a right-handed zzso filament, which zzso pairing and strand exchange with a zzso zzso DNA zzso by zzso unknown zzso We recently reported a structure of zzso left-handed zzso filament, and here present three new structures of zzso left-handed zzso zzso Comparative structural analysis between different zzso zzso filaments reveals that the zzso domain zzso of zzso implicated in zzso zzso is highly zzso We identify a hinge region between zzso and zzso motif as responsible for rigid body movement of zzso zzso analysis further confirms that structural flexibility of zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso These results support our previous hypothesis that zzso zzso rotation of zzso zzso zzso filament promotes zzso zzso
