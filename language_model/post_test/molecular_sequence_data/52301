zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso An zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso was produced by zzso zzso zzso formed zzso filaments in the presence of zzso even in low zzso strength, whereas the zzso itself did not form any zzso Only one zzso of the five zzso zzso fragments of zzso accelerated zzso assembly to the same degree as zzso did, whereas the other fragments did zzso When zzso was zzso into two fragments, it lost the zzso zzso The sequence of zzso was determined as zzso which corresponded to zzso zzso of zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso contains a sequence indispensable for zzso assembly and that neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso included all of the zzso A single zzso of zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso diminished its zzso zzso The zzso site was determined as zzso of zzso zzso It was shown that single zzso of the zzso head domain, which contains an indispensable sequence for zzso zzso might be sufficient for zzso zzso
