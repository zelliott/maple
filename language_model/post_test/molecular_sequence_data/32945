zzso are commonly found in zzso plants, where they play important roles in plant defense and have significant health benefits for animals and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso reduction of zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of alfalfa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The structure contains a classic zzso fold domain in the N zzso and a small zzso zzso zzso and structural analysis showed that zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso despite the low levels of sequence identity, and the prominent structural differences from other zzso zzso with known zzso The putative binding sites for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were defined and located in a large zzso formed between the N and zzso zzso of zzso Potential key zzso for zzso activity were also identified, including the zzso zzso zzso A molecular zzso study showed that zzso but not the zzso zzso forms favored interactions with the zzso and zzso zzso thus providing an explanation for the zzso strict zzso zzso
