zzso is an zzso protein that was first isolated from zzso extracts of sea zzso eggs zzso 1975: zzso Cell zzso zzso and was the first bundling protein to be characterized in zzso zzso work has shown that zzso zzso zzso filaments in zzso egg zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Otto and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Fifteen years later, the molecular cloning of sea zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1993: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has led to the identification and characterization of zzso proteins in zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and humans zzso et zzso zzso DNA Cell zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that bundle zzso filaments into structures which stabilize cellular processes ranging from zzso zzso to the zzso of nerve growth zzso zzso has emerged from relative obscurity as an exotic zzso egg protein to being recognized as a widely expressed protein found in a broad spectrum of zzso and zzso The purpose of this review is to relate the early studies done on the sea zzso and zzso cell zzso to the recent molecular biology that defines a family of bundling zzso and discuss the current state of knowledge regarding zzso structure and zzso
