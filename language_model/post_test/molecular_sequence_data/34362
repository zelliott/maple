zzso zzso are small zzso zzso molecules that are processed from large zzso precursors and function as zzso regulators of target zzso Although many individual zzso have recently been extensively zzso there has been very little research on zzso zzso in zzso zzso By using high zzso sequencing technology, we have identified 167 and 166 zzso zzso zzso to 108 zzso in zzso carp zzso zzso and silver carp zzso zzso zzso We compared the expression patterns of zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso indicated that there is not a strong correlation between sequence conservation and expression zzso most of these zzso have similar expression zzso However, high expression differences were also identified for several individual zzso Several zzso sequences were also found in our zzso and some of them may have regulatory zzso Two zzso strategies were used to identify novel zzso from zzso data in the two zzso A first strategy based on zzso zzso identified 8 and 22 novel zzso in zzso carp and silver zzso zzso We zzso that these zzso should also exist in the zzso but the zzso used have not allowed for their zzso In the second strategy we obtained several zzso zzso 31 in zzso carp and 32 in silver zzso which showed low zzso zzso and loss of family members were observed in several zzso families, which suggests that zzso of animal zzso genes may occur through evolutionary processes which are similar to the zzso zzso
