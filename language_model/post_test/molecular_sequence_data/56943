At early zzso stages in the rat spinal zzso zzso day zzso when zzso zzso are still proliferating, most zzso zzso express truncated forms of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso which are the products of alternative zzso of the zzso zzso These truncated proteins do not appear to zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso acid is detected in cells only after alternative zzso of the zzso gene generates a zzso 67 zzso zzso active form of zzso Both the 67 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and appear zzso distributed in the zzso of embryonic zzso zzso does not appear associated with synaptic zzso until after birth, when its zzso distribution becomes zzso and it zzso with zzso At this time, it also zzso with an zzso distinct 65 zzso zzso protein zzso by a second zzso gene zzso zzso of different zzso proteins with distinct zzso zzso during development suggests that zzso the product of these zzso may have zzso or zzso roles during spinal zzso zzso
