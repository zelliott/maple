zzso are a class of structural membrane lipids involved in membrane trafficking and cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso family in zzso zzso demonstrates the existence of two activities selective for the length of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso but not zzso zzso are essential for plant zzso Reduction of zzso fatty acid zzso levels leads in particular to zzso zzso of lateral root emergence that is associated with selective zzso of the plasma membrane zzso carriers zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso targeting of polar zzso carriers is characterized by specific zzso of zzso and zzso early zzso along the zzso zzso These zzso correlate with the zzso of membrane structures and zzso fragmentation in the zzso In conclusion, zzso with very long zzso chains define a trafficking zzso with specific zzso compartments and polar zzso transport protein zzso
