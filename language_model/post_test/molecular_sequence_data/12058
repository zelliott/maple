The beta 1 zzso of zzso is thought to play an important role in both the zzso and zzso of T zzso beta 1 zzso can provide T cell zzso through interaction of very late zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 4 beta 1) and zzso zzso 5 beta 1) with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or by zzso binding to its cell surface zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which beta 1 zzso members zzso T zzso signals is poorly zzso Studies in zzso cells have demonstrated regulation of the zzso focal zzso zzso zzso by beta 1 zzso engagement and, most recently, indicate a role for zzso in linking zzso signal zzso to the Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Parsons, 1994, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hanks, zzso Hunter, and zzso Van der zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso Although zzso zzso occurs in T cells, there are no reports on its regulation in this cell zzso The studies described in this article characterize novel regulation of zzso by the T cell zzso zzso zzso complex and beta 1 zzso and provide the first account, in any cell type, of zzso alpha 4 beta zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate a rapid and sustained synergistic increase in zzso zzso of human zzso in zzso T cells after simultaneous zzso triggering of the zzso complex, and zzso alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 zzso binding of these cells to immobilized zzso or alpha 4 beta 1 zzso binding to immobilized zzso Studies with normal peripheral zzso zzso human T blasts confirm the synergistic action of a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso or zzso signal in the induction of T cell zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso zzso isolated from zzso cells and normal zzso T cells identified a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso distinct from zzso or zzso These results zzso for the first time, the involvement of a specific zzso zzso in alpha 4 beta zzso and alpha 5 beta zzso T zzso signaling zzso In addition, the data demonstrate novel regulation of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
