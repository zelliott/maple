zzso The zzso response to substance zzso zzso A, selective zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors and the activity of zzso zzso has been investigated in circular muscle strips of the guinea-pig isolated zzso pelvis in the presence of zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso A was the most potent zzso tested, being about 32 times more potent than substance zzso The action of both substance P and zzso A was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso was slightly less potent and effective than zzso A zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso zzso substance P zzso was effective at low zzso zzso but its zzso effect did not exceed zzso of zzso response to substance P or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso B was effective only at high zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a clear-cut zzso character, although it was less potent than zzso zzso zzso The responses to roughly zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B were antagonized to a similar extent by zzso zzso (3 zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso while the response to zzso substance P zzso was zzso zzso The response to zzso substance P zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso while the response to zzso zzso zzso A zzso was zzso zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso and R zzso antagonized competitively the response to zzso zzso A zzso with the following rank order of potency zzso values in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and L zzso also competitively antagonized the response to zzso A, although with lower potency as compared to the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso and R zzso reduced in a zzso manner the zzso response produced by electrical field stimulation (1 zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso trains of 10 zzso The rank order of potency of zzso zzso zzso in blocking the response to electrical stimulation zzso zzso L zzso R zzso closely zzso their potency in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso toward responses produced by electrical field stimulation was significantly reduced when tested in the presence of zzso zzso which increased significantly the response to nerve zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso did not significantly affect the response to nerve stimulation in zzso preparations and slightly reduced it in the presence of zzso zzso We conclude that both zzso and zzso receptors mediate the zzso effect of zzso in the circular muscle of the guinea-pig zzso pelvis and that the response zzso to zzso zzso stimulation is larger than that ascribed to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the guinea-pig zzso pelvis belongs to the same zzso previously identified in the rabbit pulmonary zzso zzso receptors play a dominant role in the zzso response determined by the release of zzso zzso and a contribution of zzso receptors becomes evident after zzso of zzso zzso
