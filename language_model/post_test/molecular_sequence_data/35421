zzso is one of the largest zzso proteins present at active zones of chemical zzso where it is suggested to play a role in recruiting and zzso molecules relevant for both synaptic zzso zzso and zzso Here we examined the zzso of a zzso mouse with a targeted deletion of zzso 14 in the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in its profound loss at conventional chemical zzso cell zzso but retinal ribbon zzso were structurally and functionally zzso This led to the identification of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present in retinal zzso cells, bipolar cells, as well as in inner hair cells of the inner zzso By zzso analysis and the generation of a zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso zzso leads to premature translation termination and generation of the zzso truncated protein specifically expressed at active zones of ribbon zzso containing cell zzso With in zzso proximity zzso zzso we provide evidence that this zzso leads to the absence of interaction sites for zzso zzso and presumably also zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso channel which exist in the full-length zzso at active zones of conventional chemical zzso The putative lack of interactions with proteins of the active zone suggests a function of zzso at ribbon zzso of sensory zzso different from zzso function at conventional chemical zzso
