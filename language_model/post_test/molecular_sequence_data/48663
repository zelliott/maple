An zzso zzso was isolated from red seaweed zzso zzso on a natural seawater zzso plate, and identified as zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened by long and accurate zzso The predicted sequence has a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso 636 zzso acids zzso and includes a zzso zzso family 16 zzso zzso module and two zzso binding zzso of family 6 zzso The deduced zzso sequence showed zzso and zzso similarity to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mature zzso was cloned and zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, and had a predicted molecular mass of 69 zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso showed optimum activity at zzso and pH zzso and had a specific activity of 85 zzso The zzso activity was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with the zzso The newly identified zzso is a zzso which acts to degrade zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and may be useful for applications in the cosmetics, food, zzso and zzso zzso
