zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso to examine their effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which bind zzso but are deficient in protein zzso C zzso zzso display zzso zzso zzso currents in zzso similar to control zzso A zzso zzso zzso which does not bind zzso and mimics the zzso state of zzso significantly enhances zzso currents in a manner similar to zzso The results suggest that zzso not only regulates the availability of free zzso in a zzso spine but also, when zzso independently stimulates zzso coupled second zzso pathways that generate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
