A novel zzso linear zzso zzso selective for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and used to zzso the human zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso Two specific zzso protein species at zzso and 46 zzso were zzso labeled, a result identical to that obtained with a previous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify contact sites between the new zzso analogue and the zzso zzso the labeled receptors were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso and chemically zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso used alone or in zzso led to the identification of a restricted zzso region spanning the first zzso zzso The results established that sequence zzso could be considered as the smallest zzso labeled zzso with zzso Based on the present experimental result and on previous zzso labeling data obtained with zzso zzso attachment to zzso domain zzso three-dimensional models of the zzso receptors were constructed and then verified by zzso zzso zzso zzso these two linear zzso antagonists, when bound to the zzso zzso could adopt a zzso zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso Despite divergent functional properties, these zzso zzso could interact with a zzso site significantly overlapping that of the natural hormone zzso
