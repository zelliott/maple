Wild radish, a problem weed worldwide, is a severe zzso weed in zzso In Australia, sustained reliance on zzso zzso to control this species has led to the evolution of many resistant populations endowed by any of several ALS zzso The molecular basis of zzso zzso resistance in a novel resistant population was zzso 

ALS gene sequencing revealed a previously zzso substitution of zzso for Ala at zzso acid position 122 in resistant individuals of a wild zzso population zzso A zzso zzso individually zzso for the zzso zzso was generated and zzso in terms of its response to the different chemical classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso was highly resistant to zzso zzso and zzso with zzso or zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso 512 and zzso 137 zzso The resistance to zzso was found to be relatively moderate (but still zzso with zzso and zzso zzso ratios of zzso 16 and zzso zzso zzso In zzso ALS activity zzso showed that zzso ALS was highly resistant to all tested zzso zzso 

The molecular basis of zzso zzso resistance in wild zzso population zzso was identified to be due to an zzso zzso in the ALS zzso This is the first report of an zzso acid substitution at zzso in the plant ALS that zzso high-level and zzso resistance to zzso zzso a remarkable contrast to the known zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso
