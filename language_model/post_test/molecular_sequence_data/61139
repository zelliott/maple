zzso experiments have shown that the zzso boundary zzso acts as an organizer for the development of the zzso zzso We have cloned zzso which is expressed in the zzso Previously it was shown that zzso a member of the same zzso zzso as zzso transformed the zzso into a zzso structure and induced zzso and zzso genes both in the zzso and in the zzso In order to define the distinct roles between zzso and zzso in development of the zzso we expressed zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso of zzso chick zzso by in zzso zzso zzso observation demonstrated that zzso transformed the zzso into a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso genes such as zzso and zzso was induced in the zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso expression was induced in the zzso making a striking contrast with the result of zzso zzso In zzso chick zzso the zzso is committed of its fate to differentiate into the zzso but the zzso has plasticity on its zzso Moreover, zzso expression in the zzso precedes zzso zzso Taking these results into consideration, it is suggested that zzso plays a crucial role in initiation of the zzso development, and that zzso functions to maintain the state of zzso zzso
