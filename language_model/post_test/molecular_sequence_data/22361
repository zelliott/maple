zzso virus zzso open reading frame 29 zzso encodes a zzso DNA binding zzso During zzso infection, zzso is localized primarily to zzso zzso whereas during zzso it appears in the zzso of infected zzso Following zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso In this report, we analyze the cellular zzso patterns of zzso during zzso infection and during autonomous zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is excluded from the nucleus in a zzso manner and that its cellular zzso pattern may be altered by subsequent expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso In these cases, zzso and zzso induce nuclear zzso of zzso in cell lines where it normally remains zzso One cellular system zzso by zzso to influence protein abundance is the zzso degradation zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but not heat shock treatment, resulted in zzso of zzso in the nucleus, similar to the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments reveal that stabilization of zzso zzso with its nuclear zzso and is dependent on a functional nuclear zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso in cultured enteric zzso and cells derived from an zzso is zzso as the zzso distribution and stability zzso to the previous states when the zzso activity is zzso Thus, stabilization of zzso leads to its nuclear zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso this is not sufficient to reactivate zzso zzso or target the zzso protein zzso to the nucleus in cultured guinea pig enteric zzso
