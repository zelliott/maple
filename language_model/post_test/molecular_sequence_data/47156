zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from patients with zzso produces an zzso toxin despite the absence of zzso zzso and ace genes from its zzso The toxin zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, produces fluid zzso in zzso rabbit zzso zzso and zzso freshly isolated rabbit zzso zzso production of this toxin zzso zzso was seen in zzso medium with the pH adjusted to zzso at 37 degrees C under shaking zzso We zzso this toxin to zzso by sequential ammonium zzso zzso affinity zzso using a zzso zzso column, and gel zzso zzso which increased the specific activity of the toxin by zzso zzso zzso The toxin is heat zzso and sensitive to zzso and has a zzso structure consisting of two zzso with molecular masses of about 58 and 40 zzso as estimated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso sheep zzso by toxin suggests that zzso might be the zzso zzso for zzso toxin on the zzso An zzso test between the zzso raised against the zzso zzso toxin and the zzso toxin gave a zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso two bands were observed in the zzso and zzso zzso At the same time, zzso against zzso toxin failed to show any zzso with zzso toxin or zzso coli zzso toxin zzso in an zzso test or zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso toxin could be inhibited by zzso against zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso toxin is structurally and functionally distinct from other zzso toxins and that the zzso activities expressed by zzso toxin appear to contribute to the zzso of disease associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso
