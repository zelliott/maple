The molecular components of zzso zzso clocks are zzso We have isolated a human gene termed zzso that encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso zzso The highly zzso mouse zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso pattern in the zzso nucleus zzso the master regulator of zzso clocks in zzso zzso expression in the zzso continues in constant darkness, and a shift in the zzso cycle evokes a zzso shift of zzso expression in the zzso zzso transcripts also appear in a periodic pattern in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but with a timing of zzso different from that seen in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso patterns of expression suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso period zzso raising the possibility that a regulator of zzso clocks is zzso
