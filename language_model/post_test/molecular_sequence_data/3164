zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is predominantly a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso Using human tumor cell lines devoid of zzso zzso activity, we have previously identified a single zzso zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso This zzso has been characterized as a genetic zzso zzso which leads to greatly diminished levels of protein due to rapid degradation of the zzso protein by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to decipher the mechanism responsible for the differential stability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the interactions of these proteins with molecular zzso of the zzso zzso Using zzso studies zzso no association was observed between zzso and either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was found to associate with zzso protein in cells when zzso were performed with an zzso zzso followed by zzso with an zzso zzso or vice zzso zzso could also be detected in the zzso protein zzso zzso were also performed using either the zzso or zzso coding regions in an in zzso zzso system employing rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso with the cellular data, zzso experiments in zzso demonstrated an association of zzso with zzso zzso protein but not with zzso zzso To further zzso the role of the association of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to modify a proposed zzso binding site near the N zzso of the zzso zzso We generated a zzso containing an zzso coding region with a zzso zzso binding site zzso to zzso acid at position 8, zzso In contrast to the zzso protein translated in zzso the zzso protein did not associate with zzso as demonstrated by zzso was zzso zzso and was zzso by the zzso These data suggest that the association of zzso with zzso may play an important role in the stability and functionality of the zzso zzso
