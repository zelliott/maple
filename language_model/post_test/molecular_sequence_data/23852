zzso and zzso are zzso regulatory zzso which participate both in zzso and in zzso The alternative zzso of these zzso in humans is known to proceed in a zzso zzso Additionally, changes in zzso can also be dependent on tissue zzso In this work, we report on the presence of alternatively spliced zzso zzso lacking zzso 2, in mouse bone zzso and zzso zzso We find that in zzso cells zzso levels strongly dominate over zzso zzso Both increase in response to zzso with the concentration of the alternative zzso rising earlier and faster than that of the full-length zzso In all other zzso studied dominance of zzso over the full-length zzso was not zzso In addition, we find expression of three forms of zzso zzso the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the second and third zzso zzso tissue and in the zzso of mice zzso with a high dose of sheep zzso It is anticipated that translation of these zzso zzso can generate proteins capable of binding to some zzso of the zzso zzso thus possessing zzso zzso Alternative zzso is discussed as a source of zzso with new regulatory zzso
