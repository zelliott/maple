The bacterial zzso and zzso zzso have a single active site that cuts both strands of DNA at their respective zzso zzso This is achieved using a hairpin intermediate that requires the DNA to change zzso during the zzso In zzso these changes are controlled in part by a flipped zzso that is stacked on a zzso zzso in a zzso pocket of the zzso Here we have investigated the base flipping mechanism in zzso zzso As in zzso zzso we find that base flipping takes place after the first zzso and is required for efficient hairpin formation and zzso zzso with an zzso zzso show that the role of base flipping in hairpin formation is to remove the base from the DNA zzso zzso interactions between the flipped base and the stacking zzso zzso are required for hairpin resolution later in the zzso We show that base flipping in zzso zzso is not a passive reaction in which a spontaneously flipped base is captured and retained by the zzso Rather, it is driven in part by a zzso probe zzso that helps to force the flipped base from the base zzso Overall, it appears that base flipping in zzso zzso is similar to that in zzso zzso
