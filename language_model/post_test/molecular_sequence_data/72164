Major zzso Complex class II zzso zzso is a disease of gene regulation that provides a unique opportunity for the genetic dissection of the molecular mechanisms controlling zzso of zzso zzso Cell lines from zzso zzso patients have been assigned to three zzso groups zzso B and zzso believed to reflect the existence of distinct essential zzso regulatory zzso Groups B and C, as well as an in zzso generated regulatory zzso representing a fourth group zzso are characterized by a specific zzso in the binding activity of zzso a zzso DNA binding complex that is essential for zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso was recently shown to be zzso in group zzso We have now isolated a novel zzso zzso zzso Associated zzso that encodes a second zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso as well as in an zzso zzso patient zzso This establishes that group D is indeed a fourth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso cell lines by zzso with zzso fully restores expression of all zzso zzso genes in zzso demonstrating that zzso is a novel essential zzso regulatory zzso
