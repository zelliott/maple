Three different strains of zzso zzso produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its complexes with zzso have previously been reported at high zzso Here, the structures of two crystal forms (I and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are presented at zzso and zzso A zzso The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the coordinates of zzso zzso as a search model and were refined to R factors of zzso and zzso and zzso factors of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso unit of crystal form I contains three zzso zzso two of which have similar structures to those seen for zzso zzso with zzso at the bottom of their active zzso In the third zzso zzso has moved zzso the CA atom moves almost 5 A and the OH of the side chain moves 10 A, inserting itself into the active site of a zzso zzso at a similar position to that observed for the zzso base in zzso zzso zzso The zzso unit of crystal form II contains two zzso zzso both of which are similar to the usual zzso zzso In one zzso two zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso Finally, a brief comparison is made between the zzso of the zzso molecules and those of 34 independent molecules taken from 20 structures of zzso zzso and two independent molecules taken from two structures of zzso zzso in various crystal zzso
