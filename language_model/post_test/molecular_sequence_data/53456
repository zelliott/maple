The Nova family of proteins are target zzso in the zzso disorder zzso zzso zzso and contain zzso zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso protein has recently been shown to regulate alternative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by binding to an zzso element containing repeats of the zzso zzso Here, we have used zzso to demonstrate that the zzso domain of Nova recognizes a single zzso element in the context of a zzso hairpin zzso the zzso zzso is zzso presented as a loop element of the hairpin scaffold and requires protein zzso zzso to the previously defined zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in general recognize zzso motifs and that biological zzso targets of zzso zzso may use either zzso secondary structure or repeated sequence elements to achieve high affinity and specificity of protein zzso
