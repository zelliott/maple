An zzso flow cell coupled zzso to a mass zzso is used to zzso a range of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso can give rise to zzso bond zzso at their zzso zzso This suggests the possible use of zzso as an alternative protein zzso zzso For the small proteins insulin and zzso (6 and 14 zzso almost all potential sites are zzso while for the largest successfully tested protein zzso zzso 29 zzso 7 of the 15 available sites were specifically zzso Several proteins did not produce peptides upon zzso zzso possibly due to problems with accessibility of zzso and zzso zzso or to competing zzso zzso zzso were generally not the major zzso zzso zzso zzso products observed as protein mass + zzso zzso 16 zzso presumably by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso account for the major fraction of protein zzso zzso zzso the amount and variety of zzso products at the present conditions shows good prospects for further improvement of the zzso The efficient protein zzso also allows the use of the zzso system as a tool to study protein zzso reactions in zzso The zzso and life history and/or age of the zzso cell was relevant to the zzso and sample conditions needed for efficient zzso zzso as opposed to other zzso zzso
