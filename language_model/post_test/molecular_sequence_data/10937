The zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso family, is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso In this report we have analyzed interaction of cellular proteins with zzso zzso 3 zzso domain of zzso For this purpose we used various zzso fusion proteins zzso a part of unique region, complete unique region and/or complete zzso domain of zzso and zzso zzso zzso When these fusion proteins (or zzso immobilized on zzso beads were incubated with zzso zzso zzso cell zzso multiple proteins which interact specifically with zzso domain of zzso were detected by zzso followed by zzso The zzso interacting proteins could also be detected by a tandem zzso binding zzso in which the zzso was incubated with zzso fusion protein (or zzso and then the interacting proteins were identified by using zzso against zzso When a part of or complete unique domain was present along with zzso domain, the interaction of some specific proteins was reduced several zzso These results raise the possibility of unique domain altering the properties of zzso domain, thus modulating or restricting the interaction of zzso domain with specific cellular zzso This zzso effect of unique domain was localized to 28 zzso acids upstream of zzso zzso zzso interacting proteins were associated with zzso and zzso zzso activities towards zzso zzso Most of the zzso binding proteins were soluble in zzso zzso zzso of zzso leukemia cell line zzso into zzso like cells resulted in appearance of novel zzso binding zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of zzso column, suggesting that it interacts with zzso binding zzso zzso A rat zzso zzso library was screened for the zzso binding proteins by protein interaction zzso zzso analysis of the clones showed the presence of zzso rich regions containing zzso zzso
