The major zzso protein of the mature zzso of the surf zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of low zzso zzso We report here the complete sequence of two zzso of its zzso zzso These genes zzso a protein of 453 and zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted mass of the larger zzso zzso zzso was confirmed using zzso zzso mass zzso The zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso is greatly zzso because of the presence of 39 tandem zzso repeats of the motif zzso with a few zzso zzso acid zzso These repeats are very closely mirrored by their zzso DNA zzso which indicates that an expansion because of sequence zzso most likely zzso The zzso domain consists of a zzso zzso core with a predicted zzso zzso structure, which is followed by an zzso zzso zzso This information provides additional molecular support for the zzso and underlying evolution of zzso nuclear basic proteins in zzso zzso
