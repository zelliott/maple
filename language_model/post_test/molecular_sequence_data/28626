zzso zzso zzso zzso is an economically important oil seed crop with an estimated zzso size of zzso zzso We have constructed a bacterial artificial zzso zzso library for zzso which represents an estimated zzso to zzso coverage of the zzso zzso isolated from young leaves were used as a source of zzso DNA and a partial restriction zzso zzso protocol was used to cleave the zzso A random sample of 60 clones indicated an average insert size of 80 zzso zzso a zzso probability of recovering any specific sequence of zzso The library was screened with zzso DNA zzso Only zzso of the clones were identified to be of zzso origin, indicating that contamination with zzso zzso is very zzso The utility of the library was evaluated by screening for the presence of genes for putative zzso receptors sharing zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso First, a zzso sunflower zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso genes zzso as a source of consensus zzso Three different zzso yielded positive zzso signals when zzso was used as a zzso zzso zzso and sequencing demonstrated the presence of two different zzso zzso zzso to genes for zzso proteins with zzso and zzso zzso from zzso This work demonstrates the suitability of the library for zzso zzso cloning of sunflower genes and physical mapping of the sunflower zzso
