zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso is controlled by the S zzso which consists of an zzso gene and an unidentified zzso zzso zzso An approximately zzso segment of the S locus of the zzso species zzso the S zzso region containing the zzso zzso was zzso zzso This region was found to contain two zzso zzso genes that are likely candidates for zzso S zzso One of them, named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed specifically in zzso and showed a high level of S zzso sequence zzso comparable to that of the zzso The other is unlikely to determine the S specificity of zzso because it showed little zzso sequence zzso and was expressed also in zzso Three other S zzso were zzso and the zzso genes were physically zzso In all four cases, zzso were linked physically to the zzso genes and were located at the S zzso region, where zzso is believed to be zzso suggesting that the two genes are inherited as a zzso These features are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso is the zzso S zzso This hypothesis predicts the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
