zzso display and two competitive panning zzso conditions were used to isolate zzso single chain zzso variable zzso zzso An zzso zzso library constructed from zzso zzso of mice zzso by zzso vaccination with an zzso killer toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for panning against zzso membrane fraction zzso Key steps were specific zzso conditions to separately release the bound zzso with original zzso zzso zzso 6 and zzso The positive zzso were screened by using zzso zzso zzso and after zzso sequencing, clone zzso and zzso clone zzso was selected for detailed zzso The zzso showed zzso values for cell growth against various zzso species and zzso zzso as zzso to zzso and zzso zzso By using surface zzso resonance analysis, the zzso had a zzso value of zzso to zzso indicating a zzso higher affinity than for zzso These results showed the generated zzso mimicking zzso affinity to zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We believe that the effectiveness of the competitive panning zzso method and zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained in this study are excellent candidates for zzso zzso
