zzso properties of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is predicted to contain zzso zzso were investigated using zzso expression techniques and zzso zzso The full-length form of zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso coli at ambient temperature was found zzso in the zzso membrane with low zzso zzso deletion of relatively zzso and less zzso zzso stretches (30 or 40 zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of the truncated soluble form of the zzso in a high yield in the zzso The zzso soluble form of the zzso zzso contained only a small quantity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso each per zzso of zzso However, the zzso content was considerably increased by in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso each of zzso and zzso per zzso and exhibited optical zzso zzso similar to those of zzso zzso Two sets of relatively broad zzso zzso signals with different temperature dependence and power zzso profile were detected in the zzso preparations at a low temperature range zzso zzso Due to a negative shift zzso zzso of the apparent zzso zzso potential of the zzso clusters in the soluble form of the truncated zzso zzso the following two possible cases could not be zzso zzso two sets of zzso signals arise from two distinct species of zzso zzso clusters with two zzso different spectral parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso and respective slow zzso zzso 8 zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso zzso spin zzso zzso two clusters exhibit similar intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso with slow spin zzso When both clusters in the same zzso are zzso zzso their zzso interactions cause a shift of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso with enhanced spin zzso In either case, our zzso data provide the first experimental evidence for the presence of two zzso zzso clusters in the zzso zzso
