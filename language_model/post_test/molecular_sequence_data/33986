zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins are inserted into the zzso zzso by a zzso zzso pathway, but no comparable zzso is known in other zzso of zzso The crystal structure of an zzso zzso sequence zzso bound to zzso zzso reveals characteristic features of zzso zzso including a zzso zzso and a large zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso zzso and directs their membrane zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is more broadly zzso than previously zzso
