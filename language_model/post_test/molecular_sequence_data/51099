The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso codes for a zzso of 413 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of which seven are zzso zzso The size of the zzso indicates that zzso is a zzso rather than an zzso zzso The deduced primary structure of the protein shows no zzso to zzso that catalyze similar reactions or, indeed, any convincing zzso with any other characterized zzso The zzso protein is identical to the zzso isolated directly from zzso zzso as determined by several zzso The zzso is obtained in a highly active form zzso zzso of the activity of the natural zzso and zzso as a single band zzso zzso in zzso zzso The kinetic parameters for the zzso of zzso acid by the natural and zzso proteins are very similar, and the proteins display identical zzso zzso primary zzso isotope effects for V and zzso when zzso acid is employed as the zzso In zzso with the activity of the natural zzso the zzso protein is able to catalyze the slow formation of zzso acid, the zzso of the natural zzso from zzso acid and zzso Earlier work in which the zzso zzso in the protein were labeled with zzso had indicated that there were eight zzso zzso per protein zzso One zzso zzso was protected by zzso Here evidence is forwarded to suggest that the zzso that was protected by the zzso is not a zzso zzso but the translation product of a zzso zzso zzso data indicate that this zzso zzso may be modified in the active zzso The implications of these findings on the mechanism of zzso are discussed within the context of a few emerging mode of action for zzso zzso
