The zzso zzso viruses have a large viral zzso zzso which encodes the major viral zzso zzso We have previously shown that this zzso zzso also encodes a putative viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Diamond, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The organization and expression of the viral zzso is similar to that of the zzso region of the zzso The complete sequence of zzso demonstrates two large open reading frames on the plus strand which overlap by 129 zzso The first is the gene for the zzso zzso and the second is the gene for the putative zzso zzso One of the products of in zzso translation of the zzso viral zzso zzso is a zzso of the size expected of a zzso fusion zzso resulting from a zzso zzso within the overlapping zzso A zzso of the size expected for a zzso fusion product was found in zzso and it was recognized in Western blots zzso by zzso to a synthetic zzso derived from the predicted zzso zzso
