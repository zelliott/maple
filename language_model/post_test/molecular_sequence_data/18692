The use of zzso biomass for second generation zzso requires zzso of zzso breakdown of plant cell zzso In this work, zzso bacteria were isolated from a native and two cultivated forest soil zzso zzso of zzso zzso was attempted by using a low zzso primer zzso strategy, using total soil DNA and bulk DNA pooled from positive colonies as zzso A set of zzso was designed based on zzso zzso zzso by search of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso families of zzso Using this approach, a zzso containing an open reading frame zzso with zzso identity to a putative zzso zzso coding gene from zzso zzso was amplified and zzso The full protein was expressed in zzso coli as zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso under native zzso Only zzso fusion zzso zzso presented zzso zzso On zzso optimal activity was achieved at pH 6 and 40 zzso and zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated on zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso 380 zzso These results demonstrated that zzso is a functional zzso and it is the first evidence of this activity for zzso zzso
