A zzso was fused to the zzso cell wall protein zzso which forms the zzso protein family and is incorporated into the cell wall by an unknown linkage to be displayed at the zzso cell zzso We first expressed the zzso fusion, in which zzso encodes zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso under the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was detected at the surface of the intact cells that produce zzso zzso To further demonstrate sequential zzso zzso two plasmids containing zzso and zzso fusion genes were constructed in which zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso The intact zzso cells transformed with these two plasmids added zzso initially with an zzso linkage and subsequently with an zzso linkage to the zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso and zzso can be used as anchors to simultaneously zzso several zzso at the zzso cell zzso Based on the high zzso specificity of zzso we propose a simple in zzso method for zzso synthesis using the zzso intact cell as a zzso
