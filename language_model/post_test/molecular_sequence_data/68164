The presentation by zzso cells of zzso zzso segments in association with major zzso complex zzso zzso proteins is fundamental to the efficacy of a specific immune zzso One approach used to identify zzso segments within proteins has involved the development of zzso zzso which zzso zzso acid sequence data to identify structural characteristics or motifs associated with in zzso zzso The zzso technique termed zzso zzso has recently been shown to be remarkably efficient at addressing the problem of pattern recognition and can be applied to predict protein secondary structure attributes directly from zzso acid sequence zzso In order to examine the potential of a neural network to zzso zzso structural features related to binding within class II zzso zzso we have trained a neural network to determine whether or not any given zzso acid of a protein is part of a zzso segment capable of binding to zzso We report that a neural network trained on a data base consisting of zzso segments known to bind to zzso is able to zzso features relating to zzso capacity zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso
