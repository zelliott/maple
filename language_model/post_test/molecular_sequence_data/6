zzso of a functional cloned zzso gene into an zzso zzso zzso cell line efficiently zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso in these clones was indistinguishable from that occurring naturally in tumor zzso When a zzso zzso clone was used instead, we observed that the zzso clones exhibited a distinct zzso zzso In the present experiments we compared the zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso by several full-length zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins generated by in zzso zzso and translation of the various zzso clones indicated variations in the content of zzso zzso Basically, two zzso protein species were zzso Both species contained the same zzso zzso except the zzso site, which was present in proteins zzso by zzso and zzso but not in the zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the various zzso clones indicated the existence of a zzso zzso insert in clone zzso as compared with clone zzso or zzso The zzso insert contained a termination signal which caused the premature termination of the zzso leading to the generation of a zzso product 9 zzso acids shorter than zzso The existence of this insert also accounted for the lack of the zzso zzso which was mapped to the 3' end of the zzso zzso following the zzso zzso This insert shared complete zzso with the zzso zzso 10 sequences mapping 96 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso site of zzso zzso zzso It was therefore concluded that the different zzso clones represented zzso zzso species which were generated by an alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso population of transformed zzso or zzso cells with either the zzso synthetic zzso or the zzso zzso indicated that the various zzso species are expressed in zzso
