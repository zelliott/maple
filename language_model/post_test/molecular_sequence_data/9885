We construct a zzso representation of protein structure based on the zzso zzso carbon point set, using the Delaunay zzso to define interacting zzso of zzso acid zzso The zzso is filtered by two criteria: interaction distance less than zzso zzso and zzso radius less than zzso zzso using zzso of zzso protein structures of low mutual sequence identity and a likelihood ratio test, we show that zzso and zzso interactions are indeed zzso We identify particular significant zzso interactions by first reducing the zzso to interacting zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso in a reduced zzso Although zzso was previously shown to be a dominant source of zzso zzso we now identify additional significant zzso interactions of charged, zzso and small zzso
