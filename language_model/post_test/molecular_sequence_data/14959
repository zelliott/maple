To investigate the microbial ecology of three zzso zzso waste zzso 

zzso analysis of sequences in a zzso zzso gene clone library and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to assess bacterial diversity in a zzso waste zzso FISH analysis and zzso were used to compare the microbial communities of all three zzso waste zzso Six operational zzso units were in high relative abundance and corresponded to the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was employed to detect the genes zzso and zzso which zzso for zzso specifically associated with zzso zzso within zzso bacteria zzso zzso of these genes confirmed their presence within the zzso 

All lagoons were dominated by purple sulfur bacteria, affiliated to zzso zzso The molecular identification of zzso bacteria and zzso indicate the following zzso processes within such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hydrogen transfer and carbon zzso 

This study provides the first molecular evidence for the existence of a sulfur cycle which is linked to zzso zzso zzso by purple bacteria and zzso zzso by zzso
