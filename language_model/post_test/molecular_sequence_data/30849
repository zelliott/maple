The zzso zzso originally found in an isolate of zzso pneumoniae, harbors a new zzso resistance zzso containing two resistance genes transcribed from an zzso promoter, as shown by zzso sequencing, zzso zzso and the effect of inserting a zzso zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this region revealed that the zzso zzso is made up of three sections that are closely related to previously described genetic zzso The zzso region of the promoter, together with the adjacent zzso is identical to sequences of the zzso zzso One of the resistance zzso zzso which is located next to the hybrid promoter, zzso assistance to zzso and structurally related zzso This zzso gene is highly zzso to zzso of zzso with five zzso zzso The second zzso zzso encodes an evolved zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso that zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows that zzso acid zzso is a zzso a zzso reported to zzso resistance to zzso We discuss how the zzso may have evolved by a combination of zzso zzso genetic zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso in the zzso zzso evolved from an ancestral form similar to zzso in zzso and that zzso evolved from an ancestral form similar to zzso
