The zzso sites for human T zzso on zzso B surface zzso zzso were studied by using synthetic zzso T cell lines of the zzso class, which were isolated from zzso B vaccine recipients, were found to react strongly and in an zzso way with peptides corresponding to a sequence of 10 to 30 zzso acids near the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with surface expression of the zzso zzso contained in these synthetic peptides induced both zzso and zzso responses in the zzso zzso T zzso The results indicate that zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso could be directly involved in this T cell zzso zzso studies with zzso to zzso class II zzso and target cells from various zzso individuals suggest that some T cell responses to this zzso of zzso might be restricted by the zzso zzso However, the possibility exists that more than one of the zzso class II molecules could be involved as restricting elements of T cell responses to this synthetic zzso In zzso experiments with synthetic peptides such as those described here are needed to demonstrate the possibility of enhancing zzso immune responses in some zzso
