Using the mouse zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso as a probe, we isolated a zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso human zzso cell line, zzso The zzso encodes for an open reading frame of 825 zzso acids including a signal sequence zzso zzso zzso the external domain zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain (24 zzso zzso and a large zzso domain zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso has a zzso identity with the mouse zzso zzso at the zzso acid level and retains the typical structural motif of the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the full-length zzso expressed high levels zzso zzso of zzso binding sites, with a zzso zzso 80 zzso an affinity identical to that of the original zzso zzso Similar to zzso responsive cells, zzso of zzso to zzso cells zzso with the zzso showed a major protein of zzso zzso and minor species of zzso zzso
