Local protein synthesis plays an essential role in the regulation of various aspects of zzso and zzso function in adult zzso At present, however, there is no direct evidence that local protein translation is functionally contributing to zzso zzso Here, we identified the zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso as one of the most abundant transcripts in zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is not evenly distributed in zzso but appears to accumulate at distinct sites such as turning points and growth zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that reducing zzso zzso levels results in a significant increase in zzso zzso both in zzso of intact cells and in isolated zzso Together, our data demonstrate that local synthesis of zzso is functionally involved in regulating zzso zzso
