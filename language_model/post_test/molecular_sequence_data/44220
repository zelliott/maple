zzso B core zzso has been zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso studies have determined the structure of human and duck zzso B virus zzso at low zzso Both viruses assemble into core particles of two sizes with zzso zzso T zzso 3 and T zzso 4 zzso Both zzso present tightly clustered zzso composed of a shell and a protruding zzso The present work introduces a model for zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso The model is based in multiple alignments of zzso sequences from 20 zzso and avian zzso and secondary structure zzso The zzso zzso zzso predicted is in good agreement with CD results reporting zzso content of zzso Despite the sequence divergence of zzso and avian zzso the secondary structure prediction of both shows a high degree of coincidence, according to the multiple sequence zzso The proposed fold of zzso zzso is built from five zzso In zzso pairs of two of those zzso conform the protruding zzso The model also suggests the convergence of the region preceding the zzso domain around the zzso symmetry zzso The model gives answers to most of the standing questions concerning the zzso assembly and zzso behavior of zzso zzso
