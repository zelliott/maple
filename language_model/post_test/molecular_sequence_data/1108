To evaluate zzso zzso distribution in zzso from dogs and determine the differential sensitivity of canine zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso drugs zzso 

zzso tissue samples zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebral cortex, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from 2 dogs for northern and western zzso zzso and blood for whole blood zzso zzso was obtained from 15 zzso 

11 zzso were evaluated to determine their zzso selectivity in whole blood zzso The zzso of the drug needed to inhibit 50% of zzso activity zzso were then calculated for zzso zzso and tissue distribution of zzso zzso were determined by northern and western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso had little selectivity toward zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso had more than 5 times greater preference for zzso zzso than zzso All canine zzso zzso including those from the gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso although protein expression was observed only for zzso 

zzso zzso was selectively inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid and zzso also appeared to be preferential zzso zzso in zzso The roles of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso zzso (as determined in zzso appear to apply to dogs; therefore, zzso zzso should prove useful in reducing the adverse effects associated with zzso zzso
