zzso are peptides from plants of the zzso and zzso families that have the unusual characteristic of a zzso zzso They are further characterized by their incorporation of a zzso knot in which two zzso along with the intervening backbone zzso form a ring through which a third zzso is zzso The zzso have been found in every zzso species screened to date but are apparently present in only a few zzso zzso The selective distribution reported so far raises questions about the evolution of the zzso within the plant zzso In this study, we use a combined zzso and expression analysis approach to zzso the evolution and distribution of the zzso in the plant kingdom and report the discovery of related sequences widespread in the zzso family, including crop plants such as rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and wheat zzso zzso which carry considerable economic and social zzso The presence of zzso sequences within these plants suggests that the zzso may be derived from an ancestral gene of great zzso zzso zzso was used to show that two of the discovered zzso genes from rice and barley zzso zzso have zzso expression zzso
