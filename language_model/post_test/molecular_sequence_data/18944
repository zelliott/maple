zzso community compositions were characterized using zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of bacterial zzso zzso gene in the sediments of the Pearl River zzso zzso analyses of the excised bands indicated that zzso bacteria, especially zzso were dominant in the Pearl River zzso The diversity of zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso gene in this zzso was then assessed by clone library zzso The zzso analyses showed that all zzso gene sequences of zzso bacteria zzso were closely related to the zzso gene described for zzso zzso U2 or zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso while the zzso gene sequences of zzso bacteria zzso at sampling site A1 showed high sequence similarity to the zzso gene from zzso zzso Meanwhile, molecular diversity of the two functional genes was higher at the upstream of this region, while lower at the zzso zzso analysis indicated that environmental factors, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and water depth, affected the distribution of the zzso gene in the Pearl River zzso
