The naturally occurring structural zzso of zzso zzso is produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso with an zzso probe facilitated the cloning of two adjacent gene zzso zzso and zzso Both genes were expressed separately in zzso coli, and their zzso products were zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso and zzso Due to its highest activity on zzso zzso was referred to as zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso to mainly zzso From Northern zzso analysis it is apparent that the zzso gene is not transcribed as part of an zzso and was zzso zzso when zzso zzso zzso cells were grown in zzso zzso whereas under investigated conditions no transcript for zzso was zzso zzso of zzso were created by a random zzso approach in order to alter the product specificity of zzso Two types of zzso have emerged, one type that prefers the zzso reaction on zzso and another type that still acts as an zzso but with a significant shift in the product from zzso to zzso The zzso character of zzso zzso was demonstrated through its higher zzso efficiency for zzso production over zzso zzso zzso zzso favored the transfer reaction, with an zzso preference for zzso
