In the zzso zzso zzso the product of the nuclear gene zzso has been shown to be involved in a variety of zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso the zzso gene from zzso zzso a close relative of zzso zzso which has important changes in the organization of its zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso gene shares considerable structural zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with its zzso zzso counterpart and that their zzso sequences display evidence of recent zzso To determine the function of the zzso zzso zzso gene we have constructed a strain carrying an inactive zzso gene and analyzed the effect of this zzso on the integrity of the zzso zzso and on the stability of zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso is essential for respiratory growth and for stability of the zzso zzso zzso thus the two genes are functionally zzso Also the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes are completely zzso despite the differences in the structure of the zzso zzso in the two zzso
