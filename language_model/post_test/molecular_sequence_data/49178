Using two-dimensional zzso partial protein internal sequencing, and zzso with zzso zzso we cloned a novel zzso named zzso from zzso egg zzso The zzso zzso encodes a 106 zzso acid protein with a zzso spacing pattern suggesting that zzso is a new member of the zzso snake zzso zzso The closest zzso of zzso is to mouse zzso Unlike most members of this protein family, zzso is not zzso zzso but is a zzso zzso as indicated by its zzso and the presence of a signal zzso in its zzso Moreover, zzso appears as an original member of this protein zzso because it is predominantly expressed in a zzso zzso the zzso and especially the zzso where the egg white components are zzso
