The aim of the study was to isolate the zzso zzso from Acer zzso and screen zzso rich in zzso zzso 

After zzso zzso 145 zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso annual zzso and seed of Acer zzso The zzso were grouped into ten different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a species of zzso zzso zzso by their zzso traits and zzso sequence zzso The content and yield of zzso acid of 141 zzso were determined by zzso On average, the species of zzso zzso zzso had the highest content and yield of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso had the zzso 

Of 141 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso showed both the highest content and the highest yield of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso may be used as potential producers of zzso acid and other compounds with biological activities, or functioned as zzso to produce natural zzso
