The region between the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso oriented zzso zzso unit contains only one termination site known to function zzso in both the zzso host and in zzso zzso The zzso sequence is similar to other zzso zzso Using two sets of point zzso that interrupt the zzso zzso tract or the zzso zzso zzso we examined the possible contribution of extended base pairing between the upstream zzso and downstream zzso zzso to efficient termination and zzso in both zzso using zzso reporter gene zzso in either zzso The results show that interrupting the zzso tract preceding the hairpin has relatively little effect on zzso strength in either orientation in the zzso host, but zzso termination in zzso polarity in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tract zzso the zzso in zzso polarity in both zzso had little effect on termination efficiency in zzso polarity in zzso zzso and also retained appreciable zzso activity in zzso zzso In general, these zzso of the zzso zzso together with additional zzso that reduce the spacing between the zzso stop zzso and the termination site or introduce a base substitution in the zzso zzso adversely affected the efficiency of termination to a greater extent in zzso coli than in the zzso zzso The disparity between the effects of certain zzso in the two hosts suggests that, in addition to zzso properties, specific host factors, including zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso
