A homogeneous preparation of a urinary zzso has been isolated from urine of patients with zzso melanoma and advanced zzso of colon and zzso This zzso Mr 30 zzso is zzso to zzso a zzso inhibitor zzso related to plasma zzso inhibitor zzso originally isolated from the urine of a zzso patient, zzso The newly isolated zzso zzso cellular proliferation of a zzso zzso cell line, zzso growing in zzso medium supplemented with insulin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso effect was monitored in terms of change in cell number and zzso zzso The growth of cells treated with approximately zzso zzso zzso was 50% that of the control group by both zzso zzso was not zzso to the cells because the zzso cells excluded zzso blue and resumed normal growth after removal of zzso In addition, zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso with zzso DNA did not release more zzso into the zzso medium than the zzso labeled zzso zzso did not affect the growth of zzso a zzso cell line, and zzso a human zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso and larger quantities of other zzso zzso with zzso profiles similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso soybean zzso zzso zzso bean zzso zzso and turkey zzso did not affect the growth of zzso zzso zzso cells have an absolute requirement of zzso as a zzso and require insulin to zzso the expression of zzso zzso The cells also zzso zzso as an zzso growth zzso zzso did not form a zzso complex with zzso insulin, or any zzso factor zzso by the zzso
