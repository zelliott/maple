Two zzso series of zzso zzso or zzso have been zzso and their zzso zzso affinities were determined in zzso binding zzso at the four human zzso receptors zzso Some of the zzso prepared zzso exhibit remarkable affinities zzso zzso 10 zzso and, most zzso the absence of activity at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structural zzso that support the affinity and selectivity profiles of the series were highlighted through an integrated zzso approach, combining a zzso model built on the second generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a novel zzso model of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso model was subsequently evaluated by the design of new derivatives exploring the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The synthesis and evaluation of the novel compounds validated the zzso power of the model, exhibiting excellent agreement between predicted and experimental zzso
