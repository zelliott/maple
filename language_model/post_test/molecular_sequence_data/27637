The mouse zzso alpha 7 zzso the signal sequence of which has been removed by zzso zzso was introduced into a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the promoter and the signal sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Different zzso zzso strains were transformed with the fused zzso zzso their cell extracts and culture zzso tested for zzso activity and the zzso alpha 7 protein showed the presence of zzso alpha 7 only in the cell zzso To promote zzso alpha 7 zzso zzso were realized in order to restore the alpha zzso zzso of the signal sequence of zzso and zzso protein zzso Our results suggest that factors other than the structure of the zzso around the zzso site are involved in the zzso of zzso alpha 7 by zzso zzso
