zzso polarized fluorescence, and Brewster angle zzso reveal that human lung zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso alter the phase behavior of zzso acid zzso by zzso the formation of condensed zzso and creating a new fluid protein-rich zzso This fluid phase forms a network that separates condensed phase zzso at coexistence and persists to high surface zzso The network changes the zzso collapse mechanism from zzso zzso and zzso processes to a more homogeneous process through zzso individual condensed phase zzso This results in higher surface pressures at collapse, and zzso easier to zzso on expansion, factors essential to the in zzso function of lung zzso The network is stabilized by a zzso tension between the zzso zzso as confirmed by the observation of extended linear zzso or zzso zzso and a zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso of zzso data and observed zzso of zzso containing zzso with those containing the full zzso sequence show that the shortened zzso retains most of the native activity of the full-length zzso which may lead to cheaper and more effective synthetic replacement zzso
