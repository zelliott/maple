The human zzso growth factor II zzso gene consists of nine zzso and has four promoters zzso The promoters exhibit a zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso In fetal liver promoters zzso are zzso but after birth these promoters are shut off and another promoter, zzso is zzso We have investigated some properties of the human promoters zzso and zzso and identified a number of sequence zzso that are recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso whereas in the zzso region of zzso we have identified several elements that are recognized by zzso factors, including zzso and zzso Besides zzso regulation of expression also regulation at the zzso level zzso We have found that the zzso zzso are subjected to zzso zzso zzso yielding a zzso zzso specific zzso and a stable zzso 3' specific zzso product of zzso zzso Two widely separated sequence elements within the last zzso were identified that are able to interact and yield a zzso stem zzso It is likely that this structure is essential for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
