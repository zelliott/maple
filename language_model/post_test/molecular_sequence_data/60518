Previously, it was found that the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids which has a long zzso region rich in zzso zzso acid zzso To understand whether the zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso activity at high zzso and to clarify the role of the extra zzso zzso zzso a comparative study examined three kinds of zzso molecules for zzso activity as well as the zzso activity of other zzso proteins under various zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso deleted zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was very high even at high zzso ( zzso M zzso or zzso whereas this activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased with increasing zzso of zzso or zzso The salt dependence on the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso by zzso was similar to that of zzso activity of the respective zzso The deletion of the zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso activity, but caused a significant decrease in the zzso activity of other zzso zzso These facts indicate that the extra zzso region of zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of other zzso proteins at high zzso Furthermore, it was shown that zzso could assist the copper binding of precursor zzso as well as that of mature zzso during the folding of these copper zzso
