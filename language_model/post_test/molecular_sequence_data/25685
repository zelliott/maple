The effect of the zzso zzso zzso upon the interaction between zzso zzso II and its DNA zzso was zzso The zzso reaction in the presence of this zzso drug took place with the hallmarks of a regular zzso II zzso zzso reaction, including zzso linkage of the zzso to the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso was extensively zzso at major zzso sites of which only one existed in the zzso base pair zzso zzso The sites zzso by zzso zzso shared a pronounced sequence zzso indicating that a specific zzso sequence is crucial for the action of this zzso The effect of zzso zzso thus differs from that of the clinically important zzso II targeted agents such as zzso zzso and zzso which enhance zzso zzso at a multiple number of zzso In contrast to the previous described drugs, zzso zzso did not exert any zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso This observation might be ascribed to the low stability of the zzso complexes formed in the presence of zzso zzso as compared to the stability of the ones formed in the presence of traditional zzso II targeted zzso
