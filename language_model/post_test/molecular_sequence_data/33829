If rates of zzso gene retention are positively correlated with levels of functional zzso then gene zzso that have been retained in a restricted number of zzso lineages would be expected to exhibit relatively low levels of sequence zzso zzso patterns are presented by gene zzso that have been retained in a small number of zzso but which are nonetheless subject to strong zzso selection relative to zzso members of the same zzso zzso This pattern suggests that such genes may have been zzso for novel, zzso zzso One possible example involves the enigmatic zzso gene zzso which appears to be exclusively restricted to zzso Available data indicate that this gene is expressed exclusively in the avian eye, but its zzso function remains a zzso In contrast to the highly restricted zzso distribution of zzso the overwhelming majority of zzso zzso zzso possess copies of the related zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was 1) to assess the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso and zzso genes among zzso 2) to zzso the duplicative origins and evolutionary histories of these three zzso and 3) to evaluate the relative levels of functional constraint of these genes based on comparative sequence zzso To accomplish these zzso we conducted a combined zzso and comparative zzso analysis involving zzso that represent each of the major lineages of zzso zzso zzso of zzso comparisons and zzso zzso tests revealed that zzso is clearly not the product of a recent, zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso originated via zzso of a zzso gene in the stem lineage of zzso Unlike the zzso zzso which has been retained in all major zzso lineages other than zzso the zzso gene has been retained only in the lineage leading to modern birds and has been independently lost in at least four major zzso zzso fish, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite the restricted zzso distribution of this zzso our results indicate that zzso is one of the most highly zzso zzso in the avian zzso
