We have isolated a zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a rat brain zzso library and examined the tissue zzso The primary structure of the zzso consists of zzso zzso including the entire coding region for 223 zzso zzso and the calculated molecular mass is zzso zzso The rat zzso is zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso of zzso acids and zzso of zzso acids being zzso The zzso of zzso is most abundant in the rat brain and to a lesser degree in the zzso In other peripheral zzso we tested, the zzso was zzso Western zzso using an zzso zzso zzso revealed the parallel distribution of zzso and protein in various brain regions and zzso The availability of the rat zzso clone provides a new approach to examine the function of zzso and the role that it plays in the pathology of neurodegenerative zzso
