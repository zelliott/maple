The zzso acid in position 54 of zzso is strongly zzso among zzso consisting of a zzso or zzso Its role was studied by analyzing zzso zzso and zzso of bovine zzso zzso circular zzso fluorescence, and electron zzso resonance zzso of zzso zzso show that this substitution has no influence on the formation and stability of the zzso The zzso potential of this zzso however, was lowered by 55 zzso as compared with native zzso indicating a role for this zzso in zzso potential zzso zzso of the zzso cluster was not impaired in the zzso zzso although structural features of the oxidized protein were considerably zzso The decreased stability of the zzso zzso as compared with the wild type and zzso zzso indicates that a hydrogen bond donor at this position zzso the zzso Both zzso have been shown to be functionally zzso Replacement of zzso 54 by zzso or zzso however, leads to zzso at the recognition sites for its zzso zzso This is reflected by decreased zzso and zzso values of both zzso for the zzso zzso whereas only zzso displayed a decreased zzso value in zzso c zzso zzso conversion was accelerated zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso
