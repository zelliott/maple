zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso concurrent with the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso allows zzso coli to use zzso widely available in the environment, as an alternative sulfur zzso Here we describe the X-ray crystal structure of zzso zzso to zzso and both zzso zzso and zzso The zzso structure and fold of zzso are similar to those observed in other zzso from the broad family of zzso zzso with closest structural similarity to zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso a model was determined for the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso supporting predictions derived from zzso zzso and other studies of that zzso zzso The zzso structure and zzso model define the metal zzso and the positions of nearby aromatic zzso that undergo zzso modifications involving zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso of zzso were identified and those of zzso zzso These results, along with sequence alignment information, reveal how zzso selects a zzso zzso zzso in preference to the zzso zzso selected by zzso providing insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso
