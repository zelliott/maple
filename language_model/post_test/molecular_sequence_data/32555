zzso zzso from the zzso family are thought to play important roles in zzso in organisms as diverse as zzso and zzso Here we used the corn zzso fungus zzso zzso to address the role of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso is essential for growth in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso caused cell wall and zzso defects at the restrictive zzso zzso patches labeled with a zzso fusion protein were zzso and a zzso fusion was directed towards the growing cell pole and rapidly zzso from the zzso These defects were found to be due to an impairment in the maintenance of cell zzso Our results indicated that zzso is required for the activity of zzso probably at the level of the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso was required for full zzso probably because zzso cells are unable to sustain the dramatic polar growth required for the formation of the zzso zzso These results support a major role for zzso in the zzso program of zzso zzso
