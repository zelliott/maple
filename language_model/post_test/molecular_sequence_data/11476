zzso are a complex group of proteins involved in regulation of the zzso cell division cycle via their interaction with zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso gene sequences have been cloned from a number of plant species, including zzso but the diversity of these genes suggests that there are many plant zzso which have yet to be zzso A zzso strategy has been adopted for cloning zzso gene sequences expressed during direct zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was used to amplify the highly zzso zzso zzso region of a novel zzso zzso zzso sequence expressed after induction of zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso product was used to design zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso using a modified zzso zzso strand zzso to single stranded zzso procedure revealed considerable sequence zzso in the zzso region of the coding sequence with several closely related sequences zzso Conventional zzso generated a single zzso zzso The complete coding sequence of one member of this zzso zzso zzso has been obtained by this zzso strategy and confirmed by zzso amplification and sequencing of alfalfa zzso zzso
