zzso zzso constitute a minor class of zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso and zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso and zzso boundaries of the much more prevalent conventional zzso In addition to the zzso borders, most known zzso zzso have highly zzso zzso zzso site and branch site sequence elements of zzso zzso zzso 6 of the zzso zzso gene and zzso 2 of the zzso zzso skeletal muscle sodium channel are zzso zzso that have been shown recently to be processed via a unique zzso zzso involving several minor U zzso Interestingly, zzso 21 of the same zzso gene and the corresponding zzso 25 of the zzso cardiac muscle sodium channel gene also have zzso and zzso zzso but they have divergent zzso zzso site and zzso branch site zzso Here, we report the accurate in zzso processing of these two divergent zzso zzso and show that they belong to a functionally distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso does not require zzso zzso and zzso zzso but instead requires the major zzso zzso zzso U2, zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies showed that G zzso A zzso at the first position and G zzso C zzso at the last position of a conventional zzso or zzso zzso zzso suppress each other in zzso suggesting that the first and last bases participate in an essential zzso zzso Our results show that such zzso zzso termed zzso II zzso occur naturally and are spliced by a mechanism distinct from that responsible for processing of the apparently more common zzso I zzso
