UMP zzso zzso the zzso of UMP by zzso to yield zzso and zzso In zzso the reaction is carried out by a zzso zzso activated by zzso and inhibited by zzso In the present study, zzso zzso UMP zzso was studied as a target for zzso research and its interest was confirmed by the demonstration of the zzso of the gene for cell zzso In the presence of zzso or zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso UMP zzso was zzso for UMP zzso zzso and zzso for zzso (the zzso concentration at zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso increased the affinity for zzso and decreased the Hill zzso zzso zzso decreased the affinity for zzso and only slightly increased the Hill zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso was not affected by the addition of zzso or zzso whose binding site was shown to be different from the active zzso The zzso radius of the protein similarly decreased in the presence of zzso or zzso There was a shift in the pH dependence of the activity when the zzso concentration was switched from low to zzso These results support the hypothesis of an zzso transition from a zzso with low affinity for zzso to a form with high zzso which would be induced by the presence of zzso or zzso
