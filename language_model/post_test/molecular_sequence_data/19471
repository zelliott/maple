zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso outgrowth and zzso zzso in the adult zzso central nervous system zzso and may play a role in maintaining neural pathways once zzso However, the presence of zzso during early zzso development is counterintuitive and hints at an additional role for zzso beyond zzso zzso 

We isolated chicken zzso and determined its zzso A multiple alignment of the zzso acid sequence across divergent species, identified five previously zzso zzso specific zzso regions that may be relevant for zzso zzso gene transcripts zzso zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in the zzso during development and a second zzso zzso zzso was zzso We further localized zzso expression during key zzso of zzso development by in zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced zzso with neural plate formation and zzso by zzso in the transformation of zzso zzso into neural zzso zzso expression was diffuse in the zzso during the early zzso phase of development, and migration, but localized to large projection zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso during architectural zzso zzso and network zzso 

These data suggest zzso plays a functional role in the determination of neural identity and/or differentiation and also appears to play a later role in the networking of large projection zzso during zzso formation and zzso These data indicate that zzso is a zzso protein with additional roles during zzso development that are disparate from its later role of zzso outgrowth zzso in the adult zzso
