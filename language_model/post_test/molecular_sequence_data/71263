zzso cells of the chicken zzso exhibit different zzso channels relative to their position along the zzso One of these channels conducts an zzso zzso current which is found primarily in zzso hair zzso Here, we report the first full length cloning and zzso expression of Shaker genes from this zzso zzso were obtained by screening a chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso library, using zzso made from zzso zzso zzso zzso a Shaker zzso isolated from rat heart, and zzso zzso a beta zzso isolated from human zzso zzso analysis revealed a chick zzso of zzso with a deduced zzso acid similarity of zzso to zzso zzso and a chick zzso of zzso with a similarity of zzso to zzso zzso In addition, we isolated a zzso of zzso 4 zzso that differs in its untranslated regions and shows complete similarity in its coding region, except for the deletion of a single zzso During development of the inner ear, reverse zzso chain reaction zzso studies show that the zzso is expressed as early as embryonic day 3, whereas zzso and zzso are zzso on embryonic days 7 to 10, 14, and in zzso
