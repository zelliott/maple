The hypothesis of an adjustment of the zzso in its zzso channel under the influence of the initiation factors has been tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso with bound zzso having zzso at specific positions were prepared in the presence or absence of initiation factors and/or zzso and subjected to zzso zzso to obtain specific zzso of the zzso labeled zzso with bases of the zzso zzso and with zzso zzso The subsequent identification of the specific sites of both zzso and zzso and individual zzso proteins involved in the zzso obtained under different conditions of complex formation, provide direct evidence for the occurrence of a partial relocation of the zzso on the zzso zzso zzso under the influence of the zzso The nature of this zzso relocation is compatible with our previous proposal of a shift of the template from an initial zzso zzso zzso to a second site closer to that occupied when the initiation zzso of the zzso is zzso in the zzso
