Cell fusion is fundamental for reproduction and organ zzso Fusion between most zzso zzso zzso cells is zzso by the zzso zzso However, fusion between the anchor cell and the zzso zzso that establishes a continuous zzso tube proceeds normally in zzso zzso By zzso zzso where the zzso fails to zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso expression results in fusion of cells that normally do not fuse in zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was further confirmed by its ability to fuse zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ in their zzso activity and expression patterns but share eight zzso predicted zzso bonds in their zzso including a putative zzso zzso We found that zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso that controls zzso invasion during zzso development, is a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso links cell invasion and fusion in a zzso zzso
