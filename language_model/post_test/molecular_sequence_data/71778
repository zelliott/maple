zzso zzso factors zzso were determined for more than zzso of the backbone zzso zzso in the zzso binding zzso of protein G, zzso and zzso from zzso zzso recorded over a range of zzso zzso zzso Previous studies suggest a correlation between zzso and hydrogen bond zzso zzso and zzso groups in strong hydrogen bonds accumulate zzso zzso zzso 1), while weak hydrogen bonds accumulate zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso have slightly lower zzso values zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso The lowest zzso value obtained zzso does not involve a backbone zzso but rather is for the interaction between two side zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors for zzso zzso are between the zzso and zzso values, on average, and are close to those for random zzso zzso Further, the difference in zzso between zzso and zzso zzso is small, suggesting that differences in hydrogen bond strength for zzso hydrogen bonds and zzso hydrogen bonds are also zzso Overall, the enrichment for zzso suggests that most zzso hydrogen bonds are zzso
