zzso disease (also called zzso is a prevalent chronic disease transmitted by ticks and caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At least one tick zzso namely zzso from zzso zzso commonly occurring in the USA, was shown to be required for colonization of the zzso by zzso Located in the tick gut, zzso interacts with the zzso outer surface protein A zzso and zzso the tick zzso zzso zzso is a primary zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission in most European zzso In this study, we characterized the capacities of zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso to interact with zzso from different zzso species and to induce an immune response in zzso We also showed that the zzso part of zzso (a putative zzso zzso is not involved in the interaction with zzso and that reduction of the total negative charge on the zzso protein impaired zzso zzso In general, the data presented in this paper indicate that zzso zzso protein retains the capacity to form a complex with zzso and zzso a significant level of zzso in orally zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso may be considered a good candidate component for an animal vaccine against zzso
