The occurrence of zzso zzso is related to the abnormal expression of some zzso but the molecular mechanism has not been clarified yet, the study screened genes related to zzso zzso by comparing different genes expressed in zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso zzso 

To compare different genes expressed in zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso zzso by fluorescent differential display reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Four sets of anchor zzso and three sets of arbitrary zzso totally twelve primer combinations, were used for zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso fragments were zzso zzso and analyzed in zzso And one of zzso expressed bands was analyzed by zzso 

zzso zzso fragments were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shared zzso zzso with the sequence of zzso zzso zzso confirmed that this gene was expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso than in normal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso with the sequence of zzso zzso and it may be related to the development of zzso zzso
