The zzso protein zzso is a putative tumor zzso We suggest that zzso is a zzso of zzso since zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso is accompanied by increased levels of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell death with all features of zzso and zzso zzso cells are defective for the zzso response to zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso involves binding to and zzso of zzso zzso is not required for but partially zzso zzso induction by zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso is defective in zzso zzso thus suggesting a role of zzso in tumor suppression by zzso the signaling from zzso stress toward induction of zzso
