In this paper, we introduce a zzso measure for computing the similarity between two biological sequences without zzso The zzso of the similarity measure is based on the zzso divergence of two constructed zzso zzso We zzso validate the method on zzso nine zzso from three zzso zzso we give the result of similarity search based on our new zzso We zzso apply the measure to the construction of zzso tree of 48 zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the weighted relative zzso is an efficient and powerful zzso measure for the analysis of sequences in the zzso zzso
