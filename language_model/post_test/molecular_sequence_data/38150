zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor with zzso and zzso zzso To identify signaling zzso of zzso membrane zzso with zzso activity were isolated from day 13 mouse zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by protein sequence analysis revealed the presence of LDL zzso protein zzso and zzso in the zzso The zzso constant of binding between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which zzso with the zzso inhibited zzso survival of embryonic zzso zzso which is also a high molecular weight protein belonging to the LDL zzso family, bound to zzso less strongly than zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a component of the zzso complex for zzso
