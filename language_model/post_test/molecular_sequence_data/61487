DNA fragments containing the sequence zzso prefer to adopt a zzso zzso duplex in the zzso zzso To investigate effects of point zzso at the 5th zzso on the structure, two crystal structures of zzso and zzso have been determined by X-ray zzso In the respective zzso the two zzso related by a zzso zzso symmetry are aligned in an zzso fashion and associated to each other to form a duplex, suggesting that the zzso duplex is stable even when the 5th zzso is zzso with other zzso The sheared zzso pair formation makes the two zzso zzso closer and zzso formation of the zzso zzso zzso The three duplexes are assembled around the zzso zzso and their 3rd and 4th zzso are bound to the zzso zzso zzso The central 5th zzso are bound to another zzso
