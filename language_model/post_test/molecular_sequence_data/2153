zzso in zzso coli of the genes that zzso the major outer membrane zzso proteins zzso and zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso which is located in the inner zzso Using zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso site of zzso we show that soluble extracts and partially zzso zzso derived from both the parent strain grown in zzso broth plus zzso zzso and the zzso strain grown in zzso broth produced zzso zzso activity, whereas soluble extracts from the parent strain grown in zzso broth produced zzso zzso We also show that the soluble extracts from the zzso strain grown in zzso broth did not produce zzso bound forms of the zzso fragments, but low levels of DNA binding were detected with soluble extracts of the zzso strain grown in zzso broth plus zzso In addition, the time course of the repression of zzso synthesis produced by a shift to zzso growth medium was correlated with an increase in the zzso affinity of soluble extracts to the zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso function influences the zzso activity of zzso and suggest that zzso binding of zzso to the upstream sequences of zzso is correlated with the repression of zzso zzso
