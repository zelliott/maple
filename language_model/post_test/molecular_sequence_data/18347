We have isolated and characterized human zzso clones containing an alpha zzso zzso which lacks zzso and has the hallmarks of having been generated by reverse zzso Two zzso termination zzso renders its coding region incapable of producing a functional zzso An zzso sequence is present in the region zzso to the 3' untranslated of the alpha zzso zzso zzso of the two sequences shows that the zzso zzso from its functional counterpart about 14 million years ago and interestingly it is the only alpha zzso zzso present in the human zzso zzso mapping locates the processed zzso to human zzso 1, the same zzso where the functional gene has been zzso
