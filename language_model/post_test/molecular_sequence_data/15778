The zzso gene from zzso zzso containing one 510 zzso zzso is spliced zzso We have shown previously that a zzso sequence within the zzso is responsible for this low zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso zzso the identified region we show in this report that a very short region contains the specificity to act zzso on the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso Furthermore, this sequence influences the zzso efficiency only when it is placed close to the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso genes show that this sequence acts independent from its natural zzso We propose that this sequence might interact with zzso zzso
