In the United States, zzso B is the zzso human zzso virus zzso zzso whereas in sub-Saharan Africa, zzso A, C, and D are the zzso zzso zzso zzso may have an impact on zzso disease zzso The effect of zzso zzso on the risk of zzso has, to our knowledge, not been zzso The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso zzso and the severity of zzso cognitive impairment among individuals initiating zzso therapy in zzso 

Sixty zzso zzso individuals with advanced zzso who were at risk of zzso cognitive impairment underwent zzso zzso and functional zzso and gag and zzso regions were zzso zzso assignments were generated by sequence analysis using a portion of the gag and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso individuals were infected with zzso A, 2 with zzso C, 9 with zzso D, and 16 with zzso zzso Eight zzso of 9 zzso individuals with zzso D had zzso compared with 7 zzso of 33 zzso individuals with zzso A zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that, in zzso zzso individuals with advanced zzso who are at risk of developing zzso cognitive zzso zzso zzso may be more common among patients infected with zzso D virus than among those infected with zzso A zzso These findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that zzso zzso may have a zzso factor with respect to their capacity to cause cognitive zzso Additional studies are needed to confirm this observation and to define the mechanism by which zzso D leads to an increased risk of zzso
