Special mechanisms of zzso are induced during zzso stress and can generate zzso zzso that permit zzso These mechanisms may provide improved models for zzso in zzso resistance, evolution of zzso cancer progression and chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically requires DNA zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso response and its zzso DNA zzso zzso We distinguished two possible roles for the zzso zzso Each might act solely upstream of zzso to create zzso DNA that zzso zzso This could zzso zzso and enhance zzso zzso Or any or all of them might function other than or in addition to zzso promotion, for example, directly in zzso zzso We report that in cells with zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso remain required for zzso zzso demonstrating that these proteins act other than via zzso zzso zzso and zzso also act by promoting zzso These and additional results with zzso zzso and zzso zzso support roles for these proteins via zzso zzso Such mechanisms could zzso zzso zzso to small zzso regions, a potentially important strategy for zzso evolution, both for reducing additional deleterious zzso in rare zzso zzso and for concerted evolution of zzso
