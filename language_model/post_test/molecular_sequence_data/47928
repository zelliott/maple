zzso zzso zzso zzso is the principal human zzso catalyzing zzso zzso and is known to be involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In this paper expression of zzso in zzso coli is zzso In order to achieve zzso the zzso of protein was modified by zzso zzso The zzso zzso with only a single zzso acid change showed expression of 210 zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso and further zzso Absolute zzso were typical for zzso proteins and indicated low spin characteristics of isolated zzso Due to a zzso segment the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso block was removed by mild acid zzso zzso zzso had good zzso activity toward marker zzso zzso in a zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its activity in the zzso system was zzso by the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was shown to metabolize zzso in the zzso system with activity of zzso zzso of zzso of zzso and thus caution should be taken when interpretation of zzso in zzso zzso data is zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced against zzso zzso and proved to be very useful for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this expression system and specific zzso should facilitate characterization of the role of zzso in the metabolism of chemicals and in the study biological relevance of genetic zzso of this zzso
