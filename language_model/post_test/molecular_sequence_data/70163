zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso binding proteins has been suggested to represent the most direct approach to zzso the protein than zzso zzso zzso The latter technique is potentially hampered by pre-existing zzso modification of the zzso However, limited data exist as to whether and in what way modifications of the zzso affect zzso of zzso alpha zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso tissue and lung were treated with zzso toxin or zzso Both, conditions prevented high affinity zzso binding to zzso and inhibited zzso by zzso toxin consistent with the notion that the modifications took place at the zzso zzso toxin treatment increased zzso to different zzso raised against the zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso towards all zzso zzso zzso toxin reduced the mobility of zzso alpha on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso depending on the presence of the toxin and sensitivity to zzso of zzso by zzso In native zzso from none of the zzso zzso zzso material zzso with zzso zzso form of zzso alpha was zzso It is concluded that modification of the zzso by zzso toxin or zzso resulting in the same functional consequence, zzso prevention of high affinity zzso zzso zzso is capable of producing opposite changes of zzso zzso toxin treatment reduces the zzso mobility on zzso zzso of the native and zzso zzso form of zzso alpha on zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso alpha is lacking in zzso from human zzso zzso lung and zzso zzso
