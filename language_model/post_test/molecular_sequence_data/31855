zzso peptides zzso are zzso zzso components of the innate immune defense system of many living organisms varying from zzso to zzso including zzso Due to their zzso activity and low level of induced resistance, these short zzso sequences represent a novel class of potential zzso zzso Besides the development of zzso drugs, zzso constitute ideal molecular models for the design of molecules with wide-ranging zzso applications, such as zzso agents and pharmacological tools to cure zzso Several techniques are currently used to shed light on the mechanisms of action of zzso ranging from the characterization of the interaction between peptides and zzso zzso and/or zzso targets, to the study of zzso effects on zzso living cells and zzso Comprehensive and zzso studies are crucial to design new zzso and to identify molecules that can boost their zzso In this zzso we zzso the most recent achievements in zzso with a special emphasis on the integration of zzso approaches, which can zzso help to bridge the gap between in zzso and ex zzso zzso
