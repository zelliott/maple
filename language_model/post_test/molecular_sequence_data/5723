The structure of zzso bovine pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso with the competitive inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso analogue without the zzso zzso group, has been zzso The zzso are zzso space group zzso a zzso b zzso zzso A and c zzso zzso A, and zzso to the zzso zzso with one zzso in the zzso zzso The structure was refined using zzso reflections between zzso and zzso A resolution to a final zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The model includes zzso protein zzso 86 water zzso one calcium zzso and 26 zzso atoms of the inhibitor zzso The overall zzso fold of the complex is very similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso with a root mean square zzso of zzso A for all the backbone zzso The electron density of the surface loop zzso zzso is clear and ordered, unlike the other zzso bovine zzso structures done to zzso This structural change could be responsible for the zzso zzso zzso which zzso relates the enhanced binding of the zzso mimic to the active site of the zzso zzso is tightly bound in the zzso zzso zzso the equatorial coordinated calcium water zzso the putative zzso water zzso and the neighboring water zzso The zzso coordinated calcium water is zzso thus the zzso calcium is a zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is a zzso zzso zzso its zzso binds to zzso differently from the zzso zzso analogue of zzso another zzso zzso The knowledge of the zzso geometry of zzso would be useful in the design of more useful therapeutic agents for zzso
