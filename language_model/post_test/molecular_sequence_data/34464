Nuclear zzso DNA sequence of the second internal transcribed zzso zzso has been used efficiently to identify the liver fluke species collected from different hosts and various geographic zzso zzso sequences of 19 zzso samples collected from Korean native cattle were determined and zzso zzso comparison including zzso sequences of zzso from this study and reference sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and intermediate zzso in zzso revealed seven identical variable sites of investigated zzso Among 19 samples, 12 individuals had zzso sequences completely identical to that of pure zzso zzso five possessed the sequences identical to zzso zzso type, whereas two shared the sequence of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso No variations in length and zzso composition of zzso sequence were observed within zzso that belonged to zzso zzso or zzso zzso At the position of zzso five zzso containing a zzso substitution zzso formed a distinct branch inside the zzso zzso group which was similar to those of zzso zzso The zzso tree of the zzso zzso based on complete zzso sequences from this study and other representative zzso in different locations clearly showed that pure zzso zzso zzso zzso type and intermediate zzso were zzso The result also provided additional genetic evidence for the existence of three forms of zzso isolated from native cattle in Korea by genetic approach using zzso zzso
