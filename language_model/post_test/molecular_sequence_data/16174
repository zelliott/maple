zzso sequences for the large zzso of human zzso zzso II corresponding to a part of the fifth zzso were inserted into an expression zzso at the zzso end of the zzso zzso The zzso construct produced a zzso fusion zzso containing approximately 10 zzso of the large zzso of zzso zzso II and 116 zzso of zzso The zzso zzso produced fusion protein inhibited specific zzso from the zzso type 2 major late promoter, while zzso had no zzso This effect of the fusion protein was during zzso zzso not at the level of zzso resembling the faithfully initiated but incomplete transcripts produced with zzso factors in the absence of zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso which zzso with the zzso zzso II region represented in the fusion zzso inhibited specific zzso at the level of zzso in a zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and the fusion zzso although unable to inhibit zzso zzso zzso II in a zzso zzso zzso selectively blocked the stimulation zzso by zzso zzso factor zzso on the activity of the zzso zzso in zzso This suggests that the fusion protein traps the zzso in zzso interactions and that zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso Thus, this suggests that an zzso contact required for specific zzso zzso resides within the fifth zzso region of the largest zzso zzso II zzso
