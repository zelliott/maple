zzso soluble and zzso zzso zzso have been proposed to belong to the family of zzso zzso These zzso zzso their zzso by a zzso zzso with the first step of the zzso reaction being the formation of a zzso zzso zzso In the present paper, we describe the direct zzso of the zzso formation between rat zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso after brief incubation with zzso zzso After zzso zzso gel zzso the zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso and crude zzso showed a single radioactive signal of the expected molecular mass that could be suppressed by inclusion of the competitive inhibitor zzso oxide in the incubation zzso In a similar manner, zzso binding of zzso acid to rat soluble zzso zzso could be demonstrated in rat liver zzso Under similar conditions, no zzso binding of zzso to zzso proteins or zzso zzso tenfold enriched in cholesterol zzso zzso activity could be zzso Our data provide definitive proof for the formation of an zzso intermediate formed in the course of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso show no formation of a zzso intermediate between cholesterol zzso zzso and its zzso under the same conditions as those under which an intermediate was shown for both zzso and soluble zzso zzso and therefore indicate that the cholesterol zzso zzso apparently does not act by a similar mechanism and is probably not structurally related to zzso and soluble zzso zzso
