zzso a protein composed of the zzso rod domain and zzso domain of zzso is expressed only in brain and zzso zzso is initiated at a unique first zzso located in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso express specific zzso with distinct alternative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso is identical to that of full-length zzso zzso and it is this region that is zzso with the zzso zzso complex in skeletal zzso Alternative zzso encodes zzso that have been shown to be zzso zzso thus this alternative zzso may regulate the association of zzso with integral membrane zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso DNA adjacent to the zzso first zzso contains a variety of zzso zzso zzso some of which could regulate zzso gene zzso
