zzso between nucleus and zzso has essential roles in plant development, including that of floral zzso We isolated a wheat zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso expression analysis using the green fluorescent protein zzso fusion protein showed that 50 zzso zzso located on the zzso of the wheat zzso zzso zzso protein acted as a zzso signal zzso zzso patterns of the zzso gene were compared among floral zzso of zzso lines of zzso in which intrinsic zzso were replaced by the zzso of a wild relative zzso zzso In these zzso lines, zzso zzso transformation of zzso into zzso zzso is induced by the alien zzso in the absence of nuclear zzso zzso The zzso transcripts zzso accumulated in zzso compared with zzso leaves, and zzso The expression level of zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso lines was similar to that in genuine zzso of both zzso lines and fertile zzso zzso The result suggested that the elevated expression of the zzso gene plays a role in aiding the development of male zzso organ but not in the determination of its zzso zzso A comparable expression pattern was observed in another zzso zzso zzso protein gene but not in a zzso zzso The different expression patterns of different zzso zzso protein genes suggest that the abundance of zzso zzso proteins is zzso regulated in the zzso development in zzso
