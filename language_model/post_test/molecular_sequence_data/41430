To characterize an unidentified zzso and associated genetic background in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and characterize small zzso plasmids in a collection of zzso zzso 

The unidentified zzso gene was identified by cloning and sequencing the zzso zzso zzso with small zzso plasmids were identified using negative zzso for zzso zzso zzso but positive zzso zzso plasmids from selected zzso were zzso zzso for rep and divergent zzso were evaluated for detecting small plasmids on selected zzso zzso zzso 

Small plasmids zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to be associated with remnants of zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The unidentified zzso was actually a zzso with negative zzso zzso associated with a previously zzso deletion of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso associated with a larger deletion within zzso This deletion was found in other zzso and may be more common than previously zzso zzso for the zzso rep gene appears useful for screening for small zzso plasmids or associated cryptic plasmids in zzso zzso 

Small zzso plasmids in zzso zzso appear relatively zzso but require further study to confirm zzso zzso associated with the rep gene may be useful for studying these small zzso A deletion in part of zzso in some strains may interfere with some zzso therefore, care should be taken with primer selection or design and, zzso regions within the open reading frame should be zzso
