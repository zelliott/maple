zzso of insect larvae with zzso zzso zzso zzso results in the zzso of the host, a process involving the action of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso is localized in the zzso zzso zzso during infection because of the presence of a zzso zzso retrieval motif zzso In this study, the zzso coding region was removed from the zzso gene so that expression of the modified zzso remained under the control of its own gene promoter, at its native zzso The deletion of zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso within the cell during virus zzso zzso lacking the zzso motif was zzso at the plasma membrane and was also evident in the culture medium of zzso cells from as early as 12 h zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the cell continued up to 72 h zzso until zzso The biological activity of the zzso virus in zzso zzso larvae was zzso with a significant reduction in the lethal dose and lethal time associated with zzso Furthermore, a reduction in feeding damage caused by infected larvae was observed compared to zzso zzso
