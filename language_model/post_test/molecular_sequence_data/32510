The zzso peripheral element zzso the zzso group I zzso and enhances its zzso zzso Despite its beneficial effects on the native structure, prior studies have shown that early formation of zzso structure during folding can slow later folding zzso Here we use a zzso deletion zzso zzso to systematically probe the role of zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso zzso radical zzso shows that zzso forms its earliest stable zzso structure on the zzso time scale, approximately zzso faster than the zzso zzso and stable structure spreads throughout zzso in zzso Nevertheless, activity zzso show that the earliest zzso formation of native zzso zzso is much slower zzso zzso zzso in a manner similar to that of the wild zzso Also similar, only a small fraction of zzso attains the native state on this time scale under standard conditions at 25 degrees C, whereas the remainder zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso zzso shares structural features with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso does not have a large overall effect on the zzso zzso along this zzso However, once zzso zzso zzso to the native state zzso faster than the zzso zzso and is less accelerated by zzso indicating that zzso zzso the zzso structure relative to the zzso transition state for zzso Together, the results suggest that, under these conditions, even the earliest zzso folding zzso of the zzso zzso represent zzso species and that zzso is principally a liability during the zzso folding zzso
