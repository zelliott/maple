zzso C zzso from zzso zzso zzso was the first zzso zzso family 19 zzso that was found in an zzso other than higher zzso An zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain connected by a zzso zzso constitute zzso We determined the crystal structure of full-length zzso which is the only representative of the zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso domain has an zzso fold with a deep zzso containing a zzso site, and lacks three zzso on the domain surface compared with the zzso domain of plant zzso The zzso domain is an zzso protein with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso aligned on the zzso We suggest the binding mechanism of zzso onto the zzso domain on the basis of molecular dynamics zzso zzso In this zzso the zzso zzso binds well on the zzso binding site through two stacking interactions and two hydrogen bonds and only zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso Furthermore, the flexibility of the zzso zzso which may be involved in adjusting the binding surface to fit the surface of zzso zzso by the rotation of zzso angle, is zzso
