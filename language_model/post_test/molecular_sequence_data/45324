The zzso type I zzso zzso zzso is unique among G zzso receptors zzso because of the absence of an zzso zzso Previously, we have found that the zzso zzso is zzso localized to zzso membrane zzso termed zzso zzso As such, association of the zzso with zzso zzso may reflect both a loss zzso and a gain zzso association zzso of structural zzso To address this, we fused either the full-length zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a truncated zzso zzso zzso to the zzso These zzso receptors are zzso to the plasma zzso bind zzso and display increased zzso zzso zzso but they do not partition into zzso zzso Thus, a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso possesses an zzso zzso We found that the zzso was localized to zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso did not alter raft zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with placement in different zzso zzso within the plasma zzso zzso recovery after zzso revealed different lateral diffusion zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso versus the zzso zzso fusion zzso We conclude that whereas an zzso zzso is capable of zzso the zzso to zzso zzso this is not a generalized feature of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso raft zzso of the zzso is not simply a result of the loss of an zzso zzso
