zzso acid type A zzso receptors are a major zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso central nervous system, and the site of action of a number of clinically important zzso These receptors exist as a family of zzso with distinct zzso and spatial patterns of expression and distinct properties that presumably zzso a precise role for each zzso The newest member of this gene family is the zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence is zzso zzso acids long and has highest sequence identity zzso with the zzso zzso Within the rat zzso this zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso acid type A receptors consisting of arrangements other than alpha beta + zzso zzso or zzso do zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells leads to the formation of receptors with a zzso decrease in the affinity for zzso acid compared with zzso This zzso has a unique distribution, with studies so far suggesting significant expression within zzso zzso of both human and monkey zzso
