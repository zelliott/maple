The three-dimensional structure of the complex formed between the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso a regulator of zzso activity, has been solved by zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso occurs through only one of the zzso rings, and the protein does not occupy the central folding cavity but rather sits above it through interactions with two regions on opposite sides of the zzso This causes the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to close in, thus excluding access to the folding zzso The atomic model of zzso generated from several atomic structures of the zzso zzso fits very well with the mass of the complex attributable to zzso and predicts the involvement of several sequences of zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments performed with zzso zzso zzso taking advantage of the fact that zzso does not interact with zzso confirm that both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are involved in zzso binding and that several regions suggested by the zzso experiment are indeed critical in the interaction with the zzso zzso
