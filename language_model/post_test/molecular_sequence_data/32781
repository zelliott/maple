zzso and zzso are orphan zzso zzso that share 51% zzso acid sequence identity and are widely expressed in selected zzso of the human brain as well as the developing and adult mouse zzso Investigation of the functional activity of zzso and zzso via expression in zzso cells showed that both proteins are zzso active and coupled to elevated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated apparent zzso zzso to a zzso zzso protein in which the 5 zzso zzso acids were from zzso A comparison of the proteins revealed an zzso zzso zzso in zzso in place of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were constructed and retained their zzso activity suggesting that these 2 receptors activate G proteins in a manner that is distinct from other group 1 zzso
