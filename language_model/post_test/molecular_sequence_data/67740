The zzso zzso T cell zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are involved in the immune evasion mechanisms for several pathogens causing chronic zzso However, there is no report concerning the role of zzso in diseases of domestic zzso In this study, zzso zzso for bovine zzso and zzso were cloned and zzso and their expression and role in immune zzso were analyzed in bovine leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso shared high zzso with human and mouse zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso motif in the zzso domain of zzso were highly zzso among cattle and other zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis showed that bovine zzso zzso is mainly expressed in T cells such as zzso and zzso cells, while zzso zzso is mainly expressed in zzso and T zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells was zzso during disease progression of zzso zzso Interestingly, expression levels for zzso and zzso correlated positively with viral load in infected zzso Furthermore, zzso expression level closely correlated with zzso of zzso in infected zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso when zzso from zzso cattle were cultured with zzso cells expressing zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso Moreover, combined blockade of the zzso and zzso pathways significantly promoted zzso zzso expression compared with blockade of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the suppression of T cell function during zzso zzso
