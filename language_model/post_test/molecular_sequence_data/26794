zzso play important roles in plant defense against zzso and zzso as well as in human zzso Some zzso zzso and zzso compounds have been clinically proven for their zzso zzso To better understand zzso zzso in zzso zzso we conducted a comparative zzso study with zzso zzso and identified total 56 putative zzso and regulator zzso This established a high zzso in the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso share zzso zzso sequence identity with the zzso zzso and exist in different copy zzso The zzso split pattern of zzso zzso is almost identical to that of zzso although zzso zzso deletion and zzso size variations commonly zzso Four genes appear to be zzso as a result of the presence of a frame shift zzso and zzso zzso At least 12 zzso of zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso whereas only three were found in zzso The expression of those zzso was not zzso but varied greatly depending on zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso was also zzso regulated in some zzso but not in other zzso Most of the regulator genes are present as triple zzso zzso zzso synthesis and regulation in zzso zzso appears to be more complex than that of zzso With the isolation and further characterization of the zzso zzso zzso vegetables or desirable animal feed crops could be developed by metabolically engineering the zzso zzso
