zzso and zzso zzso were made between the reading frame coding for zzso and sequences of either a zzso expressed rice gene zzso involved in initiation of translation or a zzso rice gene zzso The transient expression of the zzso was studied via particle zzso of zzso zzso of rice, perennial zzso and zzso Furthermore, the results of transient and stable expression were compared for cell suspensions of four rice zzso one barley variety and one perennial zzso zzso The zzso zzso were active in all three zzso zzso Best results were obtained for a construct having both a zzso and a zzso fusion as well as zzso and zzso sequences zzso The level of zzso activity was in the range of activities as obtained by the zzso zzso promoter zzso fused to zzso The zzso fusion with the zzso gene zzso was active in green zzso zzso of all zzso zzso Also a weak expression compared to the zzso zzso was found in zzso transformed rice zzso The zzso zzso with the zzso zzso promoters zzso and 2' of the zzso were zzso expressed at lower levels in cell suspensions than zzso For zzso transformed rice callus the expression of the zzso fusion often decreased during prolonged zzso This decrease in zzso activity and the various zzso zzso of transgenic zzso are explained by the presence of different cell types in the suspensions used and in the zzso It is presumed that the nature of the cells and their relative contribution in the zzso change drastically upon further zzso
