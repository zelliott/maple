We compared the ability of zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso in inducing zzso from the zzso late promoter, zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into human zzso cells alone or together with plasmids producing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity obtained from the zzso cells indicated that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso late gene zzso However, the level of induction zzso by zzso protein was significantly higher than that obtained with zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity over a narrow range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso plasmids at optimal zzso resulted in greater than additive zzso activity from the zzso zzso This zzso suggests that the two zzso proteins zzso alternative mechanisms to exert their zzso Using deletion zzso from the zzso end of the zzso promoter, we demonstrated that different regions within the zzso zzso are important for zzso and zzso zzso zzso that these zzso function through distinct targets to increase zzso promoter zzso
