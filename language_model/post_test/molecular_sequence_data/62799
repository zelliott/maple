zzso growth factor beta zzso zzso members signal via complexes of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and zzso These complexes are recruited to DNA by specific zzso zzso The zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso bind an activated zzso zzso zzso two zzso and one zzso Here we identify a novel zzso interaction zzso the zzso motif zzso present in all known zzso family members, zzso to the common zzso interaction motif zzso The zzso is necessary and sufficient to bind active zzso zzso The zzso differs from the SIM since it discriminates between zzso and zzso and zzso only binds zzso zzso in the context of activated zzso zzso It is the first zzso interaction motif with this zzso zzso zzso indicates that the binding site for the zzso on a zzso zzso is a zzso pocket that incorporates the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the presence of an zzso and SIM in the zzso proteins allows them to compete efficiently for activated zzso complexes with zzso factors such as zzso that only contain a zzso This establishes a hierarchy of zzso zzso factors, determined by their affinity for active zzso zzso
