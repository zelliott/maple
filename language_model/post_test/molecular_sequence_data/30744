The primary structure of the F protein of a host range zzso of the Ulster strain of zzso Disease virus zzso has been determined by zzso sequence analysis and compared to that of the wild type and other zzso zzso The zzso site of the zzso had the sequence zzso as compared to two isolated basic zzso acids zzso with the zzso strains and two pairs of basic zzso acids zzso with the zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso of the F protein of zzso increases with the number of zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso site and that the zzso of the zzso strains to ubiquitous host zzso depends on both pairs of basic zzso zzso
