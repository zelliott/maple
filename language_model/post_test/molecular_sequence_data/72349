zzso use of T cell zzso zzso gene segments is characteristic of several induced zzso disease zzso zzso sequences have previously been unavailable for zzso T cells which react with a defined zzso in a spontaneous zzso zzso The majority of T cell zzso derived from zzso of zzso mice which spontaneously develop type I diabetes, react with insulin zzso zzso We have zzso the alpha and beta chains of zzso from these zzso T cell zzso No zzso beta chain restriction was zzso In contrast, the clones (10 of zzso used V zzso coupled with one of two zzso J alpha segments zzso zzso or J zzso in 8 of 13 zzso Furthermore, 9 of 10 of the V zzso segments are a novel zzso sequence that we have tentatively termed V zzso This dramatic alpha chain zzso similar to the beta chain restriction of other zzso models, provides a target for zzso and zzso zzso
