zzso of the group A zzso zzso protein gene zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso which encodes an inhibitor of zzso zzso was previously shown to depend on a third genetic zzso designated zzso A zzso zzso region of DNA which is 200 zzso upstream of zzso and is thought to contain the zzso zzso was zzso An open reading frame which zzso deletion zzso that define zzso was zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso which was deduced to contain zzso zzso zzso is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein to a variety of DNA binding zzso such as zzso zzso revealed a DNA binding zzso zzso was also compared to the zzso positive regulator, zzso and found to be zzso zzso The predicted zzso promoter is preceded by two sets of zzso repeats, in contrast to zzso which is preceded by one zzso Introduction of zzso on the shuttle zzso zzso into a strain of group A zzso with a deletion in the zzso zzso gene demonstrated that the zzso protein activated zzso of both zzso and zzso genes in zzso Analysis of zzso by Northern zzso using zzso zzso identified two zzso zzso a zzso zzso transcript which zzso to the predicted size of the zzso and a second transcript, zzso zzso which also zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are structurally and functionally very similar and show that the former is a trans zzso of both M protein and zzso zzso zzso
