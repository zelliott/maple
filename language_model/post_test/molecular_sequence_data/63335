Plant growth and crop yields are limited by zzso zzso In this study, we attempted to isolate the rice genes responsible for zzso stress tolerance using a transformed zzso population expressing a full-length zzso library of zzso From approximately 20,000 lines of transgenic zzso we isolated a zzso line, zzso that could survive transient heat stress at the zzso zzso The rice zzso inserted in zzso encodes zzso a member of the heat stress zzso zzso The zzso zzso was observed in newly constructed transgenic zzso plants expressing zzso Among 5 zzso zzso genes zzso in the rice zzso four zzso including zzso are induced by high temperatures in rice zzso The zzso protein was localized to the nuclear region and exhibited zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that under zzso conditions transgenic zzso zzso zzso highly expressed certain zzso zzso including several classes of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was observed not only in the zzso but also in zzso leaves, zzso stems and zzso In addition, transgenic zzso exhibited tolerance to zzso zzso These observations suggest that the zzso may be useful in molecular breeding designed to improve the environmental stress tolerance of zzso
