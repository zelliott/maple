In order to zzso the mechanism of the zzso expression of rat brain zzso we investigated the multiple promoter systems in the zzso Total zzso extracted from the zzso zzso was subjected to a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso with the zzso for mouse zzso zzso I zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso product had zzso zzso to the corresponding region of zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso It was first demonstrated that zzso zzso with zzso zzso was expressed in the rat zzso This type message was expressed in the zzso area zzso but not in the cerebral zzso zzso Furthermore, total zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso of the rat brain were zzso by zzso with the zzso for rat zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of the products were generated in the zzso and zzso with no signals in the zzso zzso zzso zzso seemed to be unique in that the tissue had no zzso zzso and zzso type zzso We thus zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in the rat zzso by zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso with zzso zzso for zzso zzso The upstream sequence from the zzso of zzso IV of the zzso zzso clones was completely different from that of the zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso gene in the rat brain contained at least three zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso type and cortical type, and that the zzso expression of the brain zzso seemed to be zzso at least in part, by differential promoter zzso
