The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element system has been used in a variety of plants for zzso zzso zzso elements can also generate zzso zzso via alternative zzso reactions which involve the zzso of closely linked zzso Here, we introduced a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso together with an zzso zzso gene into rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the transgenic zzso we identified and characterized 25 independent zzso zzso at three different zzso zzso The zzso include zzso deletions and zzso and one zzso Most of the deletions occurred within the zzso region, but two cases showed the loss of 72 zzso pairs zzso and 79 zzso of rice zzso DNA zzso the zzso In addition to zzso we obtained zzso zzso ranging in size from less than 10 zzso zzso the zzso zzso to over 1 million base pairs zzso For 11 zzso we cloned and zzso both inversion zzso in all 11 cases, the inversion junctions contained the typical 8 base pairs zzso zzso target site zzso confirming their origin as zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that alternative zzso zzso can be an efficient tool for functional zzso and zzso manipulation in zzso
