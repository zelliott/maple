zzso binding site selection was used to define the sequence characteristics of high affinity zzso binding zzso zzso of the sequences of 189 selected zzso containing high affinity zzso binding sites revealed two types of core zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were surrounded by other zzso zzso forming the consensus zzso A search of the 73 zzso human zzso zzso cluster with this consensus revealed eight matching zzso six of which were located within 1-3 zzso upstream of the gamma and beta zzso zzso zzso were more variable in surrounding sequence zzso the consensus zzso was found to fit zzso of the selected zzso zzso A search of the human beta zzso cluster with zzso consensus sequences revealed zzso potential zzso binding zzso Several of these were tested directly in gel shift zzso and confirmed as high affinity zzso binding zzso Finally, a strategy called zzso zzso analysis was employed to determine which of the 179 total sites are zzso zzso This analysis permits the detection of functionally zzso binding sites despite sequence differences present between the two zzso The 21 zzso sites identified will serve as important starting points in further dissection of the possible role of zzso in zzso gene zzso
