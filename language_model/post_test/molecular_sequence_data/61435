zzso Gal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) Gal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides were obtained from a zzso zzso library by an affinity zzso The selection processes were in zzso by a zzso zzso method, on which a zzso zzso zzso was zzso After five rounds of zzso the DNA sequencing of 18 selected zzso showed that only three individual clones were zzso The zzso sequences of the random region were found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso clones to the zzso zzso were zzso zzso Three synthetic zzso inhibited the binding of zzso toxin B zzso to the zzso zzso with an zzso of 24, 13 and zzso zzso zzso These peptides will be useful for searching functional roles of zzso zzso
