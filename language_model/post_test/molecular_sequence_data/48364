In their natural environment, bacteria often behave differently than they do under laboratory zzso To gain insight into the physiology of bacteria in zzso dedicated approaches are required to monitor their adaptations and specific behaviors under environmental zzso zzso zzso is crucial for the observation of fundamental characteristics of bacteria, such as cell shape, size, and marker gene zzso Here, zzso force zzso zzso was exploited to isolate zzso selected bacteria for subsequent identification and zzso In this study, zzso bacteria, which can be zzso due to their characteristic zzso in the infrared range, were isolated from leaf zzso zzso communities from the zzso were investigated because they harbor genes indicative of zzso zzso zzso Our data show that different species of zzso express their zzso in zzso and they show a distinct pattern of zzso production under laboratory conditions that is dependent on supplied carbon zzso
