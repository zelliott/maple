The zzso gene of zzso major zzso zzso as zzso was confirmed as a zzso with an internally located motor domain and termed zzso Both the native form of the protein and a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso version were shown to be exclusively zzso and, more specifically, to zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso regulation of the protein levels was demonstrated using synchronized zzso zzso zzso was highly abundant in the zzso phase and present at very low levels after zzso Altogether, these features suggest that this protein zzso in zzso The construction of systematic deletion zzso allowed the zzso of the primary sequence regions responsible for nuclear targeting on the one hand, and for cell zzso variations on the other zzso A zzso region of the zzso domain mediates nuclear import and could be defined as an zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso level regulation during the cell cycle was shown to also depend upon the zzso domain, where apparently redundant degradation signals are zzso zzso degradation signals appear to be present on both sides and inside the nuclear zzso zzso Further experiments strongly suggest a role for the zzso zzso in this cell zzso zzso These data underline the importance of zzso regulation of protein abundance in this ancestral zzso where zzso regulation seems to be rare or near zzso
