The zzso mechanisms of various zzso diseases were investigated utilizing recently developed molecular biological and molecular genetic zzso It was revealed that zzso 51 was closely associated with zzso zzso Investigation of genetic zzso of zzso zzso necrosis zzso showed that zzso of zzso disease patients had the zzso zzso zzso I zzso It was therefore concluded that the gene of zzso to zzso disease is located between zzso and zzso zzso on the short arm of zzso zzso Similar studies of zzso typing in zzso disease frequently seen in Japan showed that zzso of zzso * zzso zzso * zzso and zzso * zzso were significantly increased in patients compared with normal zzso These data suggested that those who have zzso at position 57 of zzso zzso acid at position 70 and zzso acid at position 71 of zzso respond to certain unknown agents significantly more than those without them, thus leading to the development of zzso zzso The same zzso association was observed between zzso disease and sympathetic zzso and the zzso mechanism was thought to be similar in both zzso Recent zzso and molecular genetic investigations on various zzso diseases have shed new light not only on the genetic individual zzso and biased racial differences, but also on the diagnosis of the zzso diseases, zzso of disease entities according to zzso associations, and zzso of disease zzso Further progress of molecular medicine may make it possible to treat various intractable zzso diseases by gene therapy in the near zzso
