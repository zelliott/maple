zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso which is comprised of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein has been detected in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso patients, with little or no zzso expression in normal adult zzso It interacts with components of cartilage zzso zzso zzso and zzso and thus may be involved in zzso zzso during joint zzso In addition, zzso has been found to have zzso properties in models of acute and chronic zzso Here we have mapped the human zzso gene to zzso a region of zzso 2 linked with zzso A single zzso zzso was identified that involves a zzso G zzso A transition at zzso 431 of the zzso coding zzso resulting in an zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso module (at zzso 144 in the zzso zzso modeling of the zzso domain indicated that this zzso acid change might lead to functional zzso zzso of 400 zzso cases and 400 controls revealed that the zzso zzso identified here is the major zzso zzso in Caucasians (with over zzso being zzso zzso but that this zzso is not a marker for zzso zzso in the patients we have zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Schneider 2 cells, and functional zzso showed that there were no significant differences in the ability of these full-length proteins to bind zzso or form a stable complex with zzso
