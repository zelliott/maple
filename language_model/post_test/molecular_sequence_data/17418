Very virulent infectious zzso disease viruses zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso samples obtained from Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and zzso After zzso sequence analysis of the zzso region of zzso zzso the zzso from Brazil and Venezuela exhibited all of the 14 zzso changes that are zzso in the European zzso and most other zzso zzso However, the zzso from the Dominican Republic presented 11 zzso changes that are zzso in zzso zzso After zzso analysis, the Latin American strains were found to be related to other zzso strains from Europe, Asia, and zzso However, Brazilian and Dominican zzso clustered in two separate subgroups, while the zzso from Venezuela were closely related to other strains from other parts of the zzso By deduced zzso acid zzso the three zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso strains zzso Ala, 256 zzso and zzso zzso were confirmed in the Latin American zzso and one zzso acid change zzso zzso was unique to all zzso from the Dominican zzso The occurrence of this change in the Dominican zzso may have an impact in their zzso zzso zzso of this study indicate that the zzso detected in Latin America are genetically similar to zzso strains from other parts of the zzso However, zzso from Venezuela were more similar to the zzso strains from Europe and zzso Of all the samples zzso zzso from Brazil and the Dominican Republic exhibited more genetic zzso These changes may have emerged as a result of the different management practices and environmental conditions present in each particular geographic zzso
