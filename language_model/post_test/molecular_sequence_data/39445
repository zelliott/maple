zzso zzso reverse protein zzso and rescue their target proteins from destruction by the zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a member of the zzso specific zzso family, is zzso in prostate cancer and zzso fatty acid zzso which has been associated with the zzso of some aggressive prostate zzso Here, we report the structure of the human zzso zzso domain in complex with zzso zzso uses two major sites for the interaction with the zzso Both sites are required zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso with peptides and zzso zzso In addition, a layer of ordered water molecules mediates key interactions between zzso and zzso As several of those molecules are found at identical positions in the previously solved zzso complex structure, we suggest a general mechanism of zzso zzso recognition by zzso
