To construct a human zzso displayed single chain zzso zzso zzso library and screen specific zzso against rabies zzso 

Using a zzso technique, zzso and zzso genes were cloned from peripheral blood zzso from three donors zzso with the zzso PM strain zzso Genes zzso zzso fragments were constructed by random linkage of zzso gene and zzso gene by zzso zzso and then the constructed zzso genes were cloned into zzso zzso and zzso into zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso were screened by four rounds of panning with rabies virus zzso The positive zzso zzso were zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso was detected by competition zzso 

A human zzso zzso library with about 7 zzso zzso sink size was zzso A new human zzso was selected, which bound specifically to rabies virus and had higher zzso 

The results lay a solid foundation for preparation of human engineering zzso to rabies virus reported zzso with higher zzso
