The differential expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes is zzso but not zzso due to several base differences near the zzso boundary of the internal control zzso A hybrid zzso zzso gene with zzso base changes at zzso zzso zzso and zzso had intermediate zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso These base zzso also resulted in increased affinity for a zzso other than zzso which forms a stable complex with the zzso zzso
