The black tiger prawn zzso zzso is a valuable aquaculture product in zzso Two specific diagnostic methods were established for zzso zzso zzso one using zzso chain reaction zzso technology and the other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso from zzso bodies of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA was subsequently zzso from the zzso bodies and its presence was confirmed by zzso using zzso of the zzso zzso Based on zzso sequences of the DNA zzso genes of zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso zzso were designed and zzso to yield a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso However, the sequence of this zzso revealed low zzso with that of zzso and zzso From the DNA sequence of this fragment, a second set of zzso was zzso and using these zzso a zzso zzso DNA zzso was amplified only when zzso DNA was the zzso DNA templates from zzso white spot syndrome diseased shrimp, or zzso cells (a cell line derived from the zzso organ of zzso zzso did not give any amplified DNA zzso zzso this primer pair was specific for the diagnosis of zzso By using zzso zzso of rabbits with zzso zzso zzso bodies, a zzso rabbit zzso against zzso was zzso This zzso could detect zzso levels of zzso but did not cross react with white spot syndrome virus zzso zzso of zzso cells, zzso zzso tissue or zzso tissue of black tiger prawns by competitive zzso This sensitive method could detect zzso even in tissue zzso
