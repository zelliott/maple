The zzso sequence zzso the zzso zzso precursor is identified and encodes a single copy of the zzso that is flanked by appropriate processing zzso The distribution of the zzso precursor zzso is described and matches the zzso zzso described zzso Single cell zzso independently confirms the presence of zzso precursor zzso in selected zzso zzso zzso is used to identify additional peptides derived from the zzso precursor in zzso zzso and nerves, suggesting that the zzso precursor may give rise to additional zzso zzso
