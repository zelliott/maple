A full-length zzso zzso zzso clone zzso zzso a protein with the characteristics of plant zzso transfer zzso has been isolated and zzso The size of the deduced 173 zzso acid zzso long protein is around 18 zzso The first zzso zzso show similarity to zzso zzso transfer proteins in zzso acid sequence as well as in predicted secondary zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso cultures of zzso zzso representing different stages of development as well as in zzso callus and zzso The zzso gene product has an zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene is equally expressed in all embryonic cells of zzso zzso cultures but during zzso maturation the expression of the gene in maturing and mature zzso as well as in mature zzso zzso is stronger in the outer cell layer than in other zzso Southern zzso analysis at different zzso was consistent with a single gene with one or two copies rather than a gene zzso Twenty independent transgenic zzso zzso and zzso the zzso gene under the zzso zzso zzso promoter were zzso There was a high yield of mature zzso zzso with a smooth surface only in zzso control zzso zzso of the expression level of zzso the zzso zzso started to mature when given a maturation zzso However, in the transgenic zzso the outer cells in the maturing zzso frequently became zzso and zzso instead of remaining small and zzso One explanation for this was that the expression of zzso was not restricted to the outer cell layer in transformed zzso zzso and zzso separated about 300 million years ago and the zzso genesis is different in the two zzso The outer cell layer zzso the first tissue to zzso is less clearly delineated in zzso For normal zzso development in zzso expression of the zzso gene must be restricted to the zzso zzso In this work we show that the expression of the zzso gene must be restricted to the putative zzso cells of the zzso
