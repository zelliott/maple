zzso DNA zzso with gene zzso is a common feature of human cancer, and zzso zzso is believed to be a landmark of tumor zzso genes zzso Identification of novel zzso genes would not only aid in the development of tumor markers but also zzso the biological behavior of human zzso We identified several zzso silenced candidate zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines by zzso agents zzso and zzso zzso combined with zzso expression profiles using expression zzso zzso was identified as an zzso silenced candidate zzso and further examined for zzso expression status, zzso zzso status, and zzso functional involvement in cancer cell zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes two putative promoters zzso A and zzso associated with two open reading frames zzso and zzso respectively), and zzso and zzso were both zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso B harbors dense zzso islands, in which we found dense zzso in a zzso manner zzso in tumor zzso by zzso zzso zzso whereas promoter A does not harbor zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with DNA zzso of promoter B in nine zzso cell lines tested, and zzso by optimal conditions of zzso agents, whereas zzso zzso was not zzso by such zzso zzso expression of zzso suppressed zzso in soft zzso in four different zzso cell zzso cell zzso More zzso zzso interference zzso of zzso in zzso cells showed drastic restoration of the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a putative zzso that harbors tumor zzso activity, and we for the first time showed that the final shutdown process of zzso expression is linked to promoter DNA zzso under the double control of the discrete promoter regions in zzso
