Little is known about the patterns of zzso gain and loss or the relative contributions of these two processes to gene zzso To investigate the dynamics of zzso evolution, we analyzed zzso genes from four zzso zzso zzso and determined the pattern of zzso zzso We developed a zzso model to estimate the most likely rates of zzso gain and loss giving rise to these observed conservation zzso Our data reveal the surprising importance of zzso zzso Between about 150 and 250 gains and between 150 and 350 losses were zzso in each zzso We discuss one gene in particular zzso zzso zzso that displays an unusually high rate of zzso gain in multiple zzso It has been recognized that zzso are biased towards the zzso ends of genes in zzso zzso but are evenly distributed in zzso zzso Current models attribute this bias to 3' zzso loss through a zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso to standard models, we find no increased frequency of zzso loss toward the 3' ends of zzso Thus, recent zzso dynamics do not support a model zzso zzso zzso zzso bias is generated solely by zzso zzso zzso
