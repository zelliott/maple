Type I zzso zzso are highly zzso among zzso Of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso is related to the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Three zzso zzso zzso leading to single zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso promoter, result in partial zzso which leads to a zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso and resistance to toxic zzso acid zzso These zzso correlate with zzso of the zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso under conditions that, in the wild type, result in their delivery to the plasma zzso zzso to the zzso and subsequent zzso degradation results in a major zzso in the zzso of the corresponding zzso acids that zzso the inability of the zzso strains to zzso zzso Our findings may have important implications for understanding how zzso zzso and other zzso zzso regulate the zzso of transport at the zzso zzso
