zzso zzso and zzso zzso closely related zzso bacteria, are zzso agents of serious infectious diseases of humans and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite numerous studies of these zzso the detailed mechanism of their zzso is still zzso The problem is even more complicated due to natural zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the understanding of which is a prerequisite for rational design of tools for zzso prophylaxis and therapy of the zzso Using a zzso zzso technique, we compared the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso library of DNA fragments specific for zzso zzso zzso and absent from zzso zzso zzso was obtained and zzso A variety of differences have been detected and mapped on the recently zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A comparative sequence analysis also revealed considerable zzso differences between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso at The Institute for zzso Research zzso We also observed significant zzso differences between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Some of the differential DNA fragments displayed similarity to different mobile elements which have not yet been described for zzso zzso whereas the others matched various zzso zzso components of active transport systems, different zzso and zzso zzso A substantial proportion of the differential clones had no database matches either at the zzso or protein zzso The results provide evidence for great zzso zzso of zzso zzso further confirmed by Southern zzso analysis of various zzso zzso zzso The data obtained can be useful for future development of efficient diagnostic tools allowing rapid identification of species, strains and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
