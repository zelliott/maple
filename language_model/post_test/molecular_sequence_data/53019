The zzso major zzso complex zzso genes fall into two classes and each of the classes into several zzso Of the class II families, the zzso family has a long and complex evolutionary history marked by gene zzso zzso and molecular zzso Because the history is not easily zzso from sequences alone, zzso element insertions were used as zzso markers to support the zzso zzso relationships among the zzso zzso zzso 1 segments of 24 zzso genes from five zzso species and five zzso genes from three zzso species were amplified by zzso and zzso and the amplification products were zzso or zzso for zzso zzso Three zzso elements were identified in the zzso and four in the zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso elements zzso is also found in the zzso whereas the other two zzso zzso are restricted to the New World zzso Similarly, the four zzso elements are found only in this zzso This distribution of zzso elements is consistent with the zzso of the zzso genes as determined from their zzso 1 sequences in an earlier and the present zzso It contradicts the zzso zzso zzso and thus corroborates the conclusion that the evolution of zzso zzso 2 sequences is, to some extent, shaped by molecular zzso Taken together, the data indicate that each of the zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso is derived from a separate ancestral zzso
