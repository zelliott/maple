zzso zzso genes linked to zzso familial Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso membrane proteins that are presumed to constitute the zzso zzso of zzso forming a high molecular weight complex with other zzso During our attempts to identify binding partners of zzso we cloned zzso zzso zzso a novel member of zzso protein family that interacts with the zzso region of zzso Upon zzso in cultured cells, zzso was directly bound to and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect the metabolism or stability of zzso complex, and zzso of zzso or zzso site 3 zzso was not zzso However, zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso the features of zzso zzso currents and zzso directly bound zzso indicating that zzso functions as zzso that are known as components of native zzso channel zzso Taken together, zzso is a novel zzso protein interacting with zzso as well as with zzso that may zzso functions of a subset of membrane proteins in zzso
