The putative zzso gene cluster for the zzso inhibitor zzso was identified in the producer zzso zzso zzso by cloning a DNA segment containing the zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso The two zzso genes were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a protein with significant similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso zzso in zzso zzso 66, and the product was shown to be a zzso zzso using zzso zzso but not zzso zzso as its zzso The zzso product, zzso zzso is a precursor of the zzso zzso of zzso A possible zzso reaction mechanism is proposed for the zzso reaction zzso by zzso based on the recent analysis of the three-dimensional structure of a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso Hawkins, zzso zzso Frost, zzso zzso and Brown, zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso
