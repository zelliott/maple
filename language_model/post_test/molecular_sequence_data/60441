The zzso zzso zzso acting on zzso zzso constitute a family of zzso proteins involved in zzso editing of nuclear transcripts through zzso zzso zzso We report here the identification and characterization of a human zzso zzso zzso that specifically zzso zzso 37 to zzso in zzso zzso It represents the functional zzso of the recently identified zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Melcher, zzso & Keller, zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso The zzso zzso predicts a protein of 502 zzso whose sequence displays strongest overall zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain is closely related to the other zzso zzso In zzso the zzso expressed and zzso zzso protein efficiently and specifically zzso zzso in the zzso loop of zzso from higher zzso and with lower efficiency from lower zzso It does not modify zzso residing in zzso zzso or in zzso that serve as zzso for zzso or zzso The zzso zzso of zzso alone is not a functional zzso for zzso The zzso is expressed zzso in human zzso and is represented by a single zzso The identification and cloning of zzso should help to zzso the zzso significance of this unique modification in zzso which is zzso from zzso to zzso
