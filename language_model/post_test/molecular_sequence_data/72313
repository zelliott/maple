zzso elements from promoter zzso DNA (the small zzso fraction of mouse zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso One of the selected zzso elements originated from 1 zzso 3' of the zzso start site of zzso We show that the mouse zzso gene extends over 49 zzso and contains 17 zzso zzso has been reported as a mouse zzso transcript zzso an integral membrane protein with a short zzso tail which we note may have a zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso expression in rat brain is specific to zzso but shows sharp regional differences, unconnected with the zzso of major zzso zzso and a 3' truncated transcript are also abundant in zzso We define the origins of all reported sequence zzso The hypothetical domain structure of the protein is in excellent agreement with the zzso structure of the zzso The zzso promoter is a zzso zzso In transient zzso even the smallest promoter zzso tested zzso zzso was extremely selective towards a mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso compared with zzso a zzso zzso
