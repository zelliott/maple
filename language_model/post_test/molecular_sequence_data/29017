The emergence of zzso the large-scale analysis of zzso has been inspired by the realization that the final product of a gene is inherently more complex and closer to function than the gene zzso zzso in the ability of zzso to predict both the existence and function of genes have also illustrated the need for protein zzso Moreover, only through the study of proteins can zzso modifications be determined, which can profoundly affect protein zzso zzso has been enabled by the zzso of both DNA and protein sequence databases, improvements in mass zzso and the development of computer zzso for database zzso In this review, we describe why zzso is important, how it is conducted, and how it can be applied to complement other existing zzso We conclude that zzso the most practical application of zzso is the analysis of target proteins as opposed to entire zzso This type of zzso referred to as functional zzso is always driven by a specific biological zzso In this way, protein identification and characterization has a meaningful zzso We discuss some of the advantages of a functional zzso approach and provide examples of how different zzso can be zzso to address a wide variety of biological zzso
