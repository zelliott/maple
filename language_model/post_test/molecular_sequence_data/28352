The zzso zzso of tobacco etch virus zzso is expressed as a zzso which is zzso and zzso processed by viral zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso at five positions each defined by the seven zzso acid consensus zzso zzso see zzso One of the zzso sites, the zzso nuclear zzso zzso protein junction was altered by zzso zzso and the effects of these zzso on zzso were zzso zzso precursors were zzso by translation of zzso zzso transcripts and processed in a zzso system using zzso nuclear inclusion bodies as a source of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso site and 61 zzso containing zzso zzso acid replacements at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso positions were zzso zzso acid replacements zzso the putative zzso zzso sequence at the zzso and zzso positions had minimal effects on zzso zzso acid zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso which were processed by the zzso zzso zzso albeit generally at reduced zzso No substitution at any of these five positions resulted in total elimination of zzso A model is presented which proposes different roles for zzso and variable positions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
