The major zzso complexes of mice, rats and humans each contain a pair of related zzso zzso and zzso that zzso members of a large zzso of proteins having similar structure and zzso The zzso zzso called zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso proteins each contain zzso predicted zzso alpha zzso and a zzso domain containing a putative zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that a functional zzso zzso is required for efficient presentation of zzso to zzso zzso T zzso This zzso resides in the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso and probably functions to transport peptides zzso in the zzso into the zzso zzso for binding to zzso class I zzso
