zzso zzso factors constitute a family of the basic zzso zzso zzso factors and recognize unusually long DNA motifs (13 or 14 zzso termed the zzso recognition element zzso The zzso harbors extended zzso sequences on each side of its core zzso which is similar to zzso or zzso (7 or 8 zzso recognized by the zzso and zzso families, zzso To ascertain the structural basis governing the zzso of such unique DNA recognition, we determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso Each zzso zzso consists of three zzso in which the zzso long zzso organizes one zzso element and one zzso zzso formation zzso To our surprise, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the basic region, play critical roles in zzso DNA zzso These two zzso show unique zzso zzso and interact directly with the extended zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and basic regions appear to indirectly stabilize zzso recognition through DNA backbone zzso zzso This study revealed an alternative DNA recognition mechanism of the zzso factors that zzso specific target gene profiles upon zzso zzso or zzso zzso
