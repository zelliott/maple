zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso is critical for both zzso and long-term zzso in zzso sensory zzso There are two types of the zzso I and II, differing in their regulatory zzso zzso We cloned zzso zzso zzso was cloned zzso Type I zzso is mostly soluble in the cell body whereas type II is enriched at nerve endings where it is bound to two prominent A zzso zzso zzso of the binding of zzso to zzso by zzso an zzso zzso derived from a human zzso zzso prevents both the zzso and the long-term zzso produced by zzso zzso During long-term zzso zzso is zzso zzso in contrast, the amount of zzso zzso zzso and previous studies have indicated that the decrease is through zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso injected into the sensory zzso cell body show that the increase in zzso protein is essential for the production of long-term zzso Using zzso we found that zzso treatment causes zzso protein to increase at nerve zzso In addition, using reverse zzso we found that zzso zzso is transported from the cell body to nerve zzso Our results suggest that type I operates in the nucleus to maintain zzso response zzso zzso gene zzso and type II zzso acts at sensory zzso zzso zzso proteins to enhance release of zzso Thus, the two types of the zzso have distinct but complementary functions in the production of zzso at zzso of an identified zzso
