The small zzso protein zzso consists of two zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain, which mediate multiple zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain can interact with zzso zzso in the protein zzso zzso zzso and with the zzso domain of zzso zzso Here, we describe and zzso the interaction of the zzso zzso domain with the zzso protein zzso a protein containing three zzso zzso zzso The second zzso domain in zzso is sufficient for a strong interaction with zzso A weaker interaction with the third zzso domain in zzso including the proper zzso is also zzso zzso also interacts with the second out of five zzso motifs in zzso For this interaction to occur both the third zzso domain and the proper zzso are zzso zzso expression analysis revealed overlapping patterns of expression for zzso zzso and zzso most notably in zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso cells zzso can be zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso structures is zzso Taken together, zzso zzso and zzso may function as components of zzso complexes at zzso zzso zzso
