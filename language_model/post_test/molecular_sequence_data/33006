zzso identity in the avian wing is a classical example of conflicting anatomical and zzso evidence regarding zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso evidence supports the hypothesis that the three remaining digits in the bird wing are digits 1, 2, and zzso At the same time, various lines of zzso evidence support the notion that these digits develop in positions that normally produce digits 2, 3, and zzso In recent years, gene expression as well as experimental evidence was published that supports the hypothesis that this zzso arose from a zzso identity shift in the evolution of the bird zzso A similar but less well-known controversy has been ongoing since the late 19th century regarding the identity of the digits of the zzso Italian zzso zzso zzso Comparative anatomy identifies these digits as 1, 2, and 3, while zzso evidence suggests their derivation from zzso positions 2, 3, and zzso Here we re-examine this evidence and add gene expression data to determine the identity of the three digits of zzso zzso The data confirm that the adult and the zzso evidence for zzso identity are in conflict, and the expression of zzso suggests that digits 1, 2, and 3 develop in positions 2, 3, and zzso We conclude that in zzso zzso and likely in its close relatives, a zzso identity frame shift has occurred, similar to the one in avian zzso This result suggests that changes in of zzso identity might be a more frequent consequence of zzso reduction than previously zzso
