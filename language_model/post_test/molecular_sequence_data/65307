zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample from a zzso field in the Republic of Korea and characterized in order to determine its zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso short zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it has low values for zzso zzso with the above strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed zzso markers that were consistent with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the major zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso were the zzso cellular fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The zzso sugar was zzso and the zzso acid in the zzso zzso was zzso On the basis of data from this zzso study, strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
