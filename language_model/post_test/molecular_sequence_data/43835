During a surveillance program associated with the Italian clinical trial for the evaluation of new zzso zzso vaccines, two bacterial zzso were obtained in cultures of samples from zzso infants who had episodes of zzso Both clinical zzso were identified as zzso zzso by zzso criteria, although both strains zzso with zzso specific for zzso zzso suggesting that the strains exhibited some characteristics of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both children from whom these strains were isolated exhibited an increase in serum zzso zzso to zzso toxin zzso a protein that is produced by zzso zzso but that is not thought to be produced by zzso zzso We therefore examined whether the clinical zzso were capable of producing zzso Neither strain produced zzso under laboratory conditions, although both strains appeared to contain a portion of the zzso region that encodes the structural zzso of zzso In order to determine whether the zzso genes may zzso functional zzso we inserted an active promoter directly upstream of the zzso region of one of these zzso zzso active zzso was produced, suggesting that this strain contains the genetic information necessary to zzso an active zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter region of both strains indicated that, while they shared zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso they contained certain sequence motifs that are characteristic of zzso zzso and certain motifs that are characteristic of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso strains of zzso zzso exist and might be capable of causing significant illness in zzso
