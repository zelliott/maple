We have previously reported a zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso The aim of this study was to identify the zzso 

zzso DNA zzso clones were isolated by zzso a human zzso zzso library with serum from a patient with zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The composite zzso sequence of the zzso for zzso was zzso base pairs long and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was found in zzso zzso which consisted of 21 zzso and was located on the zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically reacted with zzso from 3 of 4 unrelated patients with zzso but not with 58 control zzso zzso was predominantly distributed in the zzso cells of the zzso surface and the upper half of the zzso of the zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso searches revealed that the zzso zzso sequence was an authentic form of several colon zzso zzso of unknown zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contained 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso protein expressed in the differentiated zzso cells of the zzso and kidney and may be involved in zzso zzso The identification of the zzso may prove useful in the approach to the zzso of this poorly understood zzso
