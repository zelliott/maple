The distribution of eight putative zzso that are not zzso in the locus for zzso zzso zzso in 139 zzso zzso zzso coli zzso of different zzso was investigated by zzso Five of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in regions corresponding to zzso O islands of zzso coli zzso while the other three zzso have been reported to be zzso in the zzso zzso of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains were isolated from humans zzso zzso zzso animals zzso zzso zzso and food zzso zzso zzso They were classified into five zzso (A through zzso based on the reported occurrence of zzso zzso in human disease, in outbreaks, and in the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Clark, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The most prevalent zzso was that zzso by the zzso gene zzso zzso of 139 zzso which was distributed in all zzso zzso and zzso were present mainly in strains of zzso A and B, which were LEE zzso zzso was present only in strains of zzso C, D, and zzso which were LEE zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were strongly associated with zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was present in all zzso except for zzso A, while zzso was not present in any of the strains zzso The distribution of zzso zzso depends mainly on zzso and not on the source of zzso zzso A, which is associated with severe disease and frequently is involved in outbreaks, possesses a unique zzso profile which is not present in the other zzso The wide distribution of zzso in zzso strains suggested that it could be a candidate for vaccine zzso
