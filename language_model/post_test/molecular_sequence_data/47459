The zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso was first identified as a zzso for zzso dependent protein zzso regulation of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso this protein which contains two zzso zzso was shown to interact with multiple cellular zzso To understand more fully the function of zzso and its regulation, we have cloned the full-length zzso for mouse zzso and a portion of the mouse gene containing the promoter zzso zzso zzso isolated from a mouse kidney zzso library, predicted a zzso of zzso zzso acids that shares striking sequence conservation within the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites with the human and rat zzso The zzso sequence zzso of the zzso start site, identified by primer extension analysis, was highly zzso rich and lacked zzso zzso or zzso zzso Using a zzso reporter zzso deletion analyses localized the critical segment for gene expression in mouse zzso thick ascending limb cells to 114 zzso zzso of the zzso start zzso Although zzso has been recently identified as an zzso zzso the lack of an zzso element in the mouse zzso zzso and the inability to demonstrate zzso stimulation of reporter gene expression in zzso cells suggests a zzso or indirect mechanism for zzso regulation by zzso
