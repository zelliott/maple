An zzso virus, zzso zzso is present at high frequency in all brown egg layer zzso Using inverse zzso chain reaction zzso based on the viral zzso regions, products were obtained containing cellular sequences zzso and 3' to the viral zzso zzso zzso of chicken zzso DNA was carried out, using zzso chosen from the zzso and 3' cellular sequences and a primer chosen from either the zzso or zzso portions of the viral zzso zzso of DNA from birds that did not carry zzso with the primer triplets always gave a single 364 zzso reaction product, interpreted as representing the zzso amplification zzso zzso of DNA from known zzso or zzso zzso carriers, with the same primer zzso always gave both the expected junction product and 364 zzso zzso zzso these primer sequences can be used to distinguish zzso carriers from zzso but cannot distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
