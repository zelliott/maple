zzso that act as disease zzso rely upon zzso cues for zzso zzso blood feeding and zzso To reduce the risk of infection in humans, one of the approaches focuses on zzso zzso system in the effort to disrupt zzso zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso play a key role in zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the successful zzso zzso of an zzso binding protein zzso from Aedes aegypti in zzso zzso zzso zzso methods were set up by zzso affinity binding and zzso zzso Analysis by zzso and mass spectrum revealed the zzso purity and molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso secondary structure had a pH dependent zzso zzso The protein functions of zzso were tested by fluorescent probe zzso binding zzso and zzso competitive binding zzso The results show zzso proteins have characteristics of selective binding with various zzso
