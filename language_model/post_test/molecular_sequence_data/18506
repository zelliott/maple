Many epidemic outbreaks of zzso fever zzso have been reported throughout the world including India after its zzso in zzso The zzso protective role of envelope proteins during zzso virus zzso infection has been zzso With the aim of identifying the zzso zzso within the envelope protein we investigated the detailed analysis of fine specificity of zzso response in different individuals during zzso zzso 

The peptides corresponding to the full length of zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso strain of zzso were zzso and their zzso with zzso positive patients' zzso collected from different epidemic regions of India was determined using indirect zzso 

The data analysis reveals many potent zzso throughout the length of envelope zzso protein thus displaying it as the most promising zzso for diagnostic zzso We found that the main zzso zzso response to envelope protein was predominantly of zzso zzso Interestingly, most of the zzso were found to be zzso for detecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were revealed as the most zzso peptides that together can form the basis for designing an accurate, economical and easy to zzso a zzso zzso for zzso This study provides new and important insight into the zzso response generated by zzso zzso strain during the early phase of zzso
