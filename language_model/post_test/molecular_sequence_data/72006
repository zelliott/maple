We have previously reported on the death zzso domain containing zzso gene product from zzso zzso designated zzso zzso protein zzso and on its cellular zzso zzso which inhibit the zzso of zzso by death zzso Here we report on the structure and function of the E10 gene product of zzso zzso designated zzso and on its cellular zzso zzso which contain a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to the viral protein in its zzso zzso motif but differs in its zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact directly in a zzso manner yet reveal different binding zzso toward members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso factor zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso and zzso to zzso and, upon zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso or truncated versions zzso do not appear to induce zzso and zzso zzso by themselves, nor do they affect the zzso and zzso zzso potential of zzso Thus, in contrast to the cellular zzso zzso may have additional properties in its unique C zzso that allow for an autonomous zzso effect on zzso and zzso Through zzso of zzso zzso may regulate the expression of the cellular and viral genes important for viral zzso
