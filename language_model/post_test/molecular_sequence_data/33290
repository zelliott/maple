zzso repeat zzso 2 zzso functions as a putative protein zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso family zzso A Parkinson's zzso zzso substitution in the zzso domain of zzso further enhances the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso proteins are restricted to the zzso of growing zzso in which they zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso membrane and regulate the dynamics of zzso zzso Here, we show that, in cultured zzso derived from zzso zzso transgenic mice, the number of zzso and zzso zzso was significantly increased, and this zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso which lowered the zzso and zzso contents in zzso promoted zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso growth zzso These data support a model in which the zzso zzso of zzso causes a zzso effect that zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso critical for zzso zzso
