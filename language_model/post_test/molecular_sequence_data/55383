The aim of this study was to isolate and screen zzso from solitary zzso and swallow bird mud nests for zzso zzso The zzso were isolated from soil of nests of solitary zzso and swallow bird, and identified on the basis of zzso characteristics and molecular biological zzso A total of 109 zzso zzso were obtained from 12 soil samples (6 from each zzso using two zzso The highest number of zzso were recovered on zzso acid vitamin zzso media zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso isolation zzso media zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso was determined using the zzso plug zzso Among 109 zzso 51 zzso zzso showed zzso activity by zzso plug zzso The zzso and molecular characteristics confirmed that the most of active zzso in both sample belonged to the zzso zzso the other potential zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also recovered, but in a low zzso The zzso designated as zzso zzso MN zzso MN zzso and MN zzso showed most promising activity against various drug resistant bacterial zzso It seems that the promising zzso from these zzso zzso may prove to be an important step in development of drug for treating zzso resistant bacterial zzso
