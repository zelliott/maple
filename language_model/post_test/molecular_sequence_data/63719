To investigate more closely the zzso of transmission and escape in zzso internal zzso we analyzed the characterization of putative zzso zzso sites zzso and the variable loop of zzso zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso isolated from intravenous drug users zzso We studied the characterization of zzso and the variable loop in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso gene in 12 intravenous drug users zzso who were divided into two groups according to the length of infection zzso In addition, two zzso were zzso monitored from the time of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso characterization within the individuals on zzso and the variable loop in the zzso and zzso region were also zzso Based on the above analysis, we found that zzso and the variable loop appeared to increase over time within zzso transmission of zzso zzso zzso We argue that limited zzso and the length of variable zzso may be involved in selective transmission and zzso
