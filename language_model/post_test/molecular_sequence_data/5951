zzso zzso enriched zzso 8 is a zzso autonomously replicating DNA sequence previously isolated by zzso of nascent monkey zzso DNA in early S zzso A 186 zzso zzso of zzso 8 has been identified as the minimal sequence required for origin function, since upon its deletion the in zzso and in zzso replication activity of this zzso is zzso We have zzso total zzso cell extracts on a zzso and then on a zzso zzso column and identified a protein fraction that interacts with the 186 zzso zzso of zzso 8 in a specific zzso The same fraction is able to support the in zzso replication of zzso 8 zzso The zzso binding activity zzso present in this fraction sediments at approximately 150 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of the specific zzso complex detect by zzso predominantly two protein bands with molecular weights of 146 zzso and 154 zzso zzso The fraction containing the zzso is also enriched for zzso alpha and zzso zzso II, and replication protein A, zzso
