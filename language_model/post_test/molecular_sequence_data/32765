zzso acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent zzso In addition to true zzso species of worldwide significance, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso several species have been reported to produce occasional fish zzso in limited geographic areas, and many zzso or zzso zzso are regularly isolated from fish or fish zzso To clarify the nature and prevalence of different zzso bacteria belonging to the zzso acid zzso group, a collection of 57 zzso of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type zzso using amplified zzso gene restriction analysis zzso Twelve distinct clusters were delineated on the basis of zzso profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These clusters included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso group, a zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso representatives of zzso zzso or the recently recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso clusters appeared to include many zzso of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be zzso The significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be established more zzso
