A novel zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso pool on zzso Island, zzso The zzso of cells was observed to vary from zzso to zzso The temperature range for growth of strain zzso was zzso degrees C with an optimum at 45 degrees zzso The pH for growth ranged from pH 0 to 4 with an optimal at pH zzso zzso zzso was able to grow zzso and zzso zzso zzso iron and reducing zzso iron, zzso The isolate grew zzso with zzso extract and zzso extract with zzso as the sources of energy and zzso The zzso zzso content in the DNA was 36 zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis demonstrated that strain zzso was a member of the family zzso order zzso zzso zzso showing sequence identities of 100 % with zzso zzso zzso zzso % with zzso zzso zzso 94 % with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 92 % with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso analysis showed that strain zzso formed a zzso cluster together with zzso zzso zzso and all other zzso zzso with available zzso zzso gene zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso formed another cluster with zzso zzso within the family zzso zzso zzso values between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso were well below 70 zzso indicating that the two strains belong to separate zzso Principal membrane lipids of strain zzso were zzso zzso lipids containing zzso zzso The polar lipids were dominated by a single zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso together with smaller amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso lipids and the corresponding zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso present were zzso zzso Given the notable zzso and chemical differences as well as the distinct zzso placement of the new isolate relative to the type species of the zzso zzso we propose strain zzso as a member of a new zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we propose to transfer zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2008 to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
