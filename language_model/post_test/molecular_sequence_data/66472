zzso zzso of the zzso giant larvae zzso tumor zzso gene have been identified and these zzso can complement the zzso double zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso as reported zzso In the absence of these genes in zzso cellular viability is affected at restrictive temperature and salt zzso Members of this family contain five or more of the zzso repeat zzso which is known to be involved in zzso zzso In order to investigate the zzso roles for zzso zzso acids within the most zzso zzso repeat motif amongst these family members, we generated deletion zzso for five zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso zzso located between zzso zzso zzso We found that the deletion zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were not capable of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at restrictive temperature and high salt zzso These results indicate that the zzso repeat motif is important for cellular viability by regulating zzso and salt tolerance in zzso
