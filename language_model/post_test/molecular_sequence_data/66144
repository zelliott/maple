zzso signal factor zzso is a fatty acid signal zzso involved in regulation of zzso in several zzso species as well as zzso zzso In this study, we identified a variety of bacteria that could disrupt zzso induction of zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso zzso While many bacteria had the ability to degrade zzso several bacterial strains belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified that were capable of particularly rapid degradation of zzso The molecular zzso for rapid degradation of zzso in zzso zzso strain G were zzso Random zzso zzso of strain G lacking the ability to degrade zzso were zzso Cloning and characterization of disrupted genes in these strains revealed that zzso required for the synthesis of zzso a precursor for zzso and zzso zzso is required for rapid degradation of zzso in strain zzso zzso of zzso zzso restored both zzso zzso and zzso degradation ability of the strain G zzso An zzso coli strain harboring zzso of zzso zzso strain G degrades zzso more rapidly than the parental strain, and zzso of zzso in trans increased the ability of zzso zzso strain G to degrade as compared with the parental zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso bacteria into mustard and cabbage leaves reduced disease severity up to twofold compared with plants zzso only with the zzso Likewise, disease zzso and severity in grape stems zzso with zzso zzso and zzso strains were significantly reduced compared with plants zzso with the pathogen zzso zzso of grape plants with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain G zzso with zzso in trans reduced disease severity as well or better than the parental zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso in other zzso could be a useful strategy of zzso for the control of diseases caused by plant pathogens that produce zzso
