zzso synthesis and release from the anterior zzso is governed by the opposing actions of zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso derived from the zzso and zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate its own release by zzso zzso mechanisms, but the extent to which this is a direct effect rather than indirectly via the generation of zzso is still a subject of zzso zzso receptors are known to be present in the zzso but their zzso regulation is poorly zzso We therefore used in zzso zzso zzso to investigate the effects of zzso status on zzso zzso zzso gene zzso using zzso normal and zzso dwarf rats as models of acquired and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in zzso zzso gene zzso ARC zzso zzso transcripts in zzso zzso dwarf rats were half those found in normal animals of the same background strain zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso circulating zzso by peripheral infusion of 200 zzso human zzso zzso for 6 days increased ARC zzso zzso expression in zzso rats to zzso In contrast, central infusions of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso for 6 days in normal rats lowered ARC zzso zzso gene zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso gene expression within the central nervous system to peripheral and central zzso levels suggests that feedback regulation of zzso and/or SS may be zzso directly by these zzso and that the sensitivity to zzso feedback is also subject to zzso by zzso altering its own zzso zzso
