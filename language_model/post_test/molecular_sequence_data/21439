zzso being the second most abundant zzso in zzso wood, is considered to be one of the factors contributing to wood biomass zzso for zzso zzso To better zzso wood as zzso zzso it is crucial to functionally characterize all the genes involved in zzso zzso during wood zzso In this report, we investigated roles of zzso families zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso during wood zzso There exist seven zzso genes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso five of which, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be highly expressed in the developing wood and their zzso proteins were localized in the zzso Comprehensive genetic zzso coupled with chemical analyses demonstrated that zzso of zzso but not zzso was able to rescue the zzso defects zzso by the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso but not zzso led to a zzso of the zzso defects in the zzso zzso zzso The essential roles of zzso zzso members in zzso zzso was further substantiated by zzso zzso of zzso in the hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to reductions in wall thickness and zzso content in wood, and an zzso in the abundance of the zzso reducing end zzso Wood zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso released more zzso from the wood of zzso zzso zzso lines than the control wood, indicating a decrease in wood biomass zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of another zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to cause decreases in wall thickness and zzso content as well as in the abundance of the zzso reducing end zzso Together, these findings demonstrate that the zzso zzso members form two functionally zzso groups, namely zzso as functional zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as functional zzso of zzso zzso all of which are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of the zzso reducing end zzso
