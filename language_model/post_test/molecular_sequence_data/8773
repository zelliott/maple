zzso zzso is essential for the major zzso of zzso zzso of linear DNA in zzso zzso It is a potent zzso and zzso and, during its unwinding of zzso DNA, makes zzso zzso in the vicinity of Chi zzso hot zzso We report here that both the strand that is cut and the position of the cuts relative to Chi depended on the zzso to zzso zzso With zzso in zzso zzso nicks occurred, as we have previously reported, four to six zzso to the zzso of the Chi zzso zzso and were detected only on the strand bearing that zzso Three differences were seen with zzso in zzso 1) zzso zzso were produced on the zzso strand closer to and within the Chi zzso 2) zzso cuts occurred on the complementary DNA zzso 3) zzso zzso destroyed the zzso strand of DNA from its entry point up to the vicinity of the Chi site, as others have previously zzso We show here that, with zzso in zzso the zzso continued to travel along DNA, after encountering a Chi site, releasing both strands of the DNA zzso to Chi as single zzso We discuss potential biological consequences of these two modes of zzso zzso zzso
