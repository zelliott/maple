zzso viruses gain entry into host cells by binding to cellular receptors and promoting the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell zzso The fusion zzso of influenza zzso zzso is crucial for zzso To examine the structural and functional roles of zzso acids E11 and zzso of the zzso zzso fusion zzso a series of fusion zzso was zzso We determined the effect of each zzso on fusion activity and infection of rescued zzso virus by zzso formation, zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso Our findings indicate that zzso and zzso zzso dramatically inhibit fusion and that at position 11 a polar zzso such as zzso acid or zzso may be desirable for preserving the fusion zzso More interestingly, one zzso zzso raised the threshold pH of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso as well as E11 play an important functional and structural role in membrane fusion and that the polarity of E11 is crucial for fusion zzso Finally, we developed an zzso based on a reporter gene plus zzso virus that could sensitively detect fusion zzso
