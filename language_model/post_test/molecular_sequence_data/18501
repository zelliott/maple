As part of the efforts to understand zzso metabolism in zzso zzso at the molecular level, the zzso zzso two divergent zzso A zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso had an zzso extension of zzso zzso acid zzso compared to zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso fell into zzso Class II and Class I, zzso Through in zzso zzso zzso both zzso were found to have the capacity to zzso zzso and zzso as zzso while neither of them could convert zzso zzso had a broader zzso specificity than zzso The affinity of zzso for zzso was zzso higher than that of zzso (with the zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso Combining the zzso including gene expression profiles, zzso zzso and zzso properties, our results indicated that zzso just as other zzso Class II zzso might play a role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso while zzso belongs to zzso Class I, and may function as a zzso zzso concerning zzso
