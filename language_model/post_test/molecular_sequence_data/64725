zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are small, zzso zzso zzso zzso with intriguing zzso zzso zzso is specific for zzso zzso while zzso is an excellent inhibitor on both zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the zzso zzso and zzso backbone dynamics investigations of these zzso zzso expression could be achieved by a zzso construct similar to the natural precursor of the zzso An engineered zzso zzso between the two zzso served as a unique zzso zzso zzso site to cleave the precursor and physically separate zzso and zzso The overall correlation time of the precursor zzso zzso as well as the resulted zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are as expected for proteins of this zzso General order parameters zzso for the zzso are lower than those characteristic of zzso zzso zzso in the binding loop region are even zzso Interestingly, the distribution of zzso for which a chemical exchange zzso term should be considered is zzso different in zzso and zzso Together with zzso exchange studies, this indicates that the internal dynamics of the two closely related molecules zzso We suggest that the dynamic properties of these zzso is one of the factors that determine their zzso
