The gene zzso translation zzso factor zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The gene revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso with the potential to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated mass of zzso zzso The potential of the promoter zzso zzso in zzso zzso was investigated with comparison to the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso by using a bacterial zzso gene as a reporter zzso P zzso demonstrated a tighter zzso expression mode, improved functioning in the presence of high zzso zzso and promoter activities that yielded zzso protein at levels similar to or in one case greater than P zzso The sequence of the gene was deposited in zzso under zzso zzso zzso
