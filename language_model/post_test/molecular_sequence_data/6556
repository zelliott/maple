While Ras zzso has been shown to play an important role in signal zzso by the zzso zzso zzso the mechanism of its zzso in T cells is zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso but not zzso or zzso was sufficient for zzso signaling in T zzso zzso of zzso appears to involve membrane recruitment and not zzso changes, because interaction of zzso with the linking zzso zzso was not required for Ras zzso To extend this analysis, we constructed a modified zzso that could be localized to the membrane zzso by using a rationally designed chemical zzso of zzso zzso The role of zzso in signaling was zzso with this technique, which induced the association of a modified zzso with the zzso resulting in rapid zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso to the membrane did not activate signaling and suggests that the interaction of zzso with zzso in T cells is subject to zzso This conditional zzso of zzso demonstrates that membrane zzso of zzso is sufficient for Ras zzso in T cells and indicates that the role of zzso is to realize the zzso advantages of zzso zzso enhanced specificity and favorable zzso for zzso This method of generating conditional zzso may also be useful in zzso other signal zzso pathways regulated by protein zzso or zzso zzso
