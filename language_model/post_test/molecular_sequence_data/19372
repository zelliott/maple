The zzso zzso cell surface zzso zzso mediates zzso binding to distinct zzso zzso structures on human zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and is then transported to the cell surface via a dedicated transport system that includes the accessory zzso components zzso and zzso The means by which the zzso zzso is selectively recognized by the accessory zzso system have not been characterized zzso zzso has a zzso zzso signal sequence that displays a traditional zzso structure, with an atypically long zzso zzso region followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this report, we investigate the relative importance of the N and H regions of the zzso signal zzso for trafficking of the zzso The results show that the extended N region does not prevent export by the zzso zzso zzso Instead, three zzso zzso in the H region not only are necessary for export via the accessory zzso zzso but also interfere with export via the zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso led to a decrease in the efficiency of zzso transport of the zzso and a simultaneous increase in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso core of the zzso signal sequence is responsible primarily for zzso towards the accessory zzso zzso
