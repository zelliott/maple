zzso snails zzso are predatory marine zzso that zzso prey with zzso containing zzso zzso zzso Most of these zzso are small zzso zzso that can be classified into families according to their respective zzso targets and patterns of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso toxin isolated from zzso zzso zzso is a member of a newly defined zzso family with sequence zzso to zzso proteins such as zzso and bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso While zzso and zzso are zzso identical in zzso zzso zzso has only four of the six zzso normally found in zzso zzso Here, the crystal structure of zzso is zzso zzso adopts the zzso zzso zzso fold complete with additional distinguishing structural features including two completely buried water zzso The crystal structure, although completely consistent with previously reported zzso distance zzso provides a greater degree of precision for atomic zzso especially for S atoms and buried zzso zzso The region normally zzso by zzso II and IV in other zzso proteins retains a network of hydrogen bonds and van der zzso interactions comparable to those found in zzso and zzso In zzso zzso occupies the sequence position normally reserved for zzso II and the special zzso properties of zzso allow additional van der zzso contacts with the zzso zzso substituting for zzso zzso Evolution has thus zzso the cost of losing a zzso bond by zzso and zzso weaker yet nonetheless effective zzso zzso
