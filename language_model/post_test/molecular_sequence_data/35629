Several members of zzso are renowned for their ability to survive extreme drought and zzso when conditions zzso Many of these belong to zzso zzso a group of zzso species primarily found in North and Central America, with substantial diversity in the Sonoran and zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso and the age of zzso zzso and assess how drought tolerance contributed to the evolution of this zzso 

Our study included most zzso species, using zzso and nuclear zzso fossil and zzso records, and climate variables to describe the species diversity, zzso zzso divergence times, and zzso niche evolution in the zzso 

We found that zzso zzso forms a zzso group sister to zzso zzso and may have zzso from other zzso because of a zzso zzso event zzso 240 zzso The North American radiation of zzso appears to be much more recent and to have occurred during the Early zzso zzso zzso We identified two significant and zzso ecological niche shifts during the evolution of zzso associated with extreme drought tolerance and a more recent shift to cold zzso Our analyses suggest that drought tolerance evolved in the warm deserts of southwest North America and may have been advantageous for colonization of cold and dry zzso zzso 

Our investigation provides a foundation for future research addressing the zzso of ecological niche evolution and the potential role of zzso evolution in zzso zzso zzso
