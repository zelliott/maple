Two basic processes are involved in protein zzso One is zzso acid replacement and another is reorganization of structural or functional units of zzso zzso or zzso proteins are thought to have evolved by fusion of smaller structural units such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of such fused zzso The zzso part forms of zzso domain with zzso activity and the zzso part forms another zzso domain with zzso H activity zzso H zzso There are zzso zzso which are zzso with the zzso H zzso The group of zzso is called type I zzso H zzso zzso It is most likely that the ancestors of zzso zzso and the zzso domain were fused and became contemporary zzso At fusion, zzso acid replacements presumably occurred at the interface of the zzso to reinforce the zzso zzso Such replaced zzso acid zzso are zzso during evolution of the fused zzso We analyzed the pattern of zzso acid replacement at each zzso site in the free form, zzso zzso group, and the integrated form, zzso H domain zzso Then we compared the patterns between the two zzso zzso fitting replacements of zzso acid zzso occurred at four of 29 zzso sites involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the free form were zzso with zzso or ambivalent ones in the integrated zzso These zzso aid in stabilizing the fused zzso by zzso interactions at the interface of the zzso These observations imply that domain fusion could have occurred with only a relatively small number of zzso zzso acid zzso
