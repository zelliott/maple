We previously reported the cloning of a transforming zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso zzso In the present study zzso zzso were cloned from a zzso and zzso The restriction map and zzso sequence indicated that the sequence upstream of the zzso zzso domain was replaced by another zzso which zzso a fusion protein composed of zzso zzso zzso This zzso sequence differed from that of the zzso previously reported and had no zzso zzso acid stretch for a zzso zzso Furthermore, we obtained two kinds of zzso zzso differing in their 3' regions and found that the differences were generated by alternative zzso From these zzso two types of zzso products differing in their zzso zzso acid zzso were zzso The two products exhibited similar transforming activity in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso can occur as a result of replacement of the zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso In addition, differences in the zzso zzso acid zzso in the two types of zzso zzso products have no influence on the transforming activity of the zzso zzso
