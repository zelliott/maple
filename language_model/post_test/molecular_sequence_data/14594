zzso genes zzso a family of zzso factors, which control diverse zzso processes in flowering plants, with zzso ranging from roots, flowers and zzso In this study, six zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso searches and zzso analysis indicated that the six zzso genes belonging to the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these genes had differential expression patterns in different zzso in zzso The results of zzso zzso system indicated that the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated that the zzso of zzso was mainly detected in the zzso of onion zzso zzso zzso analysis for expression pattern of zzso showed that the gene was zzso by zzso stresses and zzso by zzso zzso The zzso rates of zzso transgenic lines were lower than that of the wild type on medium with 150 zzso zzso 350 zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso might be a negative zzso factor responsive to zzso zzso
