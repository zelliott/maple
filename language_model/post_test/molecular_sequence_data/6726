The zzso zzso gene zzso functions in both zzso and zzso Alternative zzso processing and promoter usage generates zzso transcripts which differ in their zzso and 3' untranslated regions, but zzso the same predicted zzso We have zzso the zzso of an zzso zzso which is defective in zzso but functions normally in zzso This zzso zzso most of the sequence specific to the male zzso together with some zzso DNA, and causes a reduction in zzso level of zzso zzso in the zzso In addition, we find that a smaller deletion which removes only sequence within the male zzso reduces the zzso level of the zzso and prevents an zzso zzso from rescuing male zzso Males carrying multiple copies of this zzso are zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso functions to maintain a proper level of zzso product in the zzso
