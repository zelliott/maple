zzso a zzso protein zzso from the human zzso fungus zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso development and zzso To address its regulatory mechanisms, we searched for zzso interacting proteins by zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the screening with the zzso zzso domain as the zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso as shown by zzso and zzso zzso zzso could complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was hardly zzso in the zzso zzso at restrictive zzso However, upon expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso protein was detected even at restrictive zzso Our data suggested that zzso was required for the production of zzso zzso Like zzso proteins of zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso might function as a molecular zzso that stabilized zzso and other protein zzso in zzso zzso In support of this, zzso was identified from a zzso screen with the full-length zzso as the zzso zzso showed zzso interactions with both zzso and the zzso
