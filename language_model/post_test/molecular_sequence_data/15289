zzso zzso zzso make up one of the most important zzso regarding the number of individual zzso Previously, zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified from zzso zzso and zzso having a prevalence of zzso between zzso and zzso Since zzso is a common phenomenon within zzso species we wanted to know whether this protein also represents an zzso in zzso zzso zzso a screening of a zzso zzso zzso library was performed using the coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso o zzso as zzso probe, ending up with a full-length zzso zzso and zzso characterization of this clone revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso most likely is zzso as a precursor with an zzso zzso sequence and represents a minor zzso zzso h 9) with a prevalence of zzso of zzso zzso zzso h 9 specifically reacted with the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso as do the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Investigation of zzso between zzso h 9 and other zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is higher between zzso than alkaline zzso zzso zzso mapping of zzso h 9 was done in order to test whether four zzso h zzso having a high sequence zzso to previously determined zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso models of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated for the three-dimensional zzso of the zzso h zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together a new zzso zzso zzso has been identified, which may be useful in a zzso approach of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso h 9 represents a further member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which stresses the importance of these proteins with respect to zzso zzso
