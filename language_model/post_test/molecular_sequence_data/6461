The model of protective immunity induced by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso has become the zzso for a promising vaccine strategy based on zzso and zzso responses directed against zzso stage zzso in particular the zzso protein zzso and zzso surface protein 2 zzso However, results from recently conducted vaccine studies suggest that T cell responses directed against additional zzso might also be required for zzso We have tested this hypothesis by examining human T zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso volunteers for zzso zzso to zzso red blood cells zzso and zzso proteins and synthetic peptides representing certain liver and blood stage zzso In this work, we report that although zzso protective immunity is zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso associated with zzso and liver stage zzso Thus, protective immunity induced by zzso zzso may depend upon responses against zzso zzso in addition to zzso and zzso
