The zzso zzso includes the possibility of a zzso error in its alignment algorithm, and therefore can find alignments that span different reading zzso zzso in this unit describe the use of zzso to search a protein sequence database for sequences that are similar to a query zzso zzso and to search a zzso sequence database for sequences that are similar to a query protein zzso Three alternate protocols describe ways to improve the speed of zzso and thus make it practical for routine zzso zzso is especially appropriate for low-quality zzso zzso sequence data, such as zzso zzso sequence zzso or early drafts of zzso zzso it does not offer any significant advantage over less zzso zzso for relatively high-quality zzso sequences without many zzso zzso or deletion zzso
