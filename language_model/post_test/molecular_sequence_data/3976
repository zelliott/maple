The zzso gene zzso the zzso 33 zzso protein of zzso zzso II zzso complex was cloned and zzso from a red zzso zzso zzso The gene encodes a zzso of zzso zzso of which the first 76 zzso served as transit peptides for transfer across the zzso envelope and zzso zzso The mature protein consists of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The sequence zzso of the mature 33 zzso protein was zzso between the red zzso and zzso and zzso between the red zzso and higher zzso The cloned gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso protein was zzso subjected to zzso The zzso sites of the 33 zzso protein by zzso or zzso zzso were determined and compared among a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a green zzso zzso zzso and two higher plants zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sites by zzso were at zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso for red zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso for green zzso and zzso for spinach, zzso The zzso sites by zzso zzso were at zzso zzso zzso and zzso (red zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso Since most of the zzso at these zzso sites were zzso among the six organisms, the results indicate that the structure of the 33 zzso zzso at least the structure based on the accessibility by zzso is different among these zzso In terms of the zzso sites, the structure of the 33 zzso protein can be divided into three major groups: zzso and red zzso has zzso sites at zzso around zzso higher zzso at zzso zzso and zzso and green zzso at zzso of both zzso and higher zzso
