We used a zzso cloning approach to isolate a zzso of zzso whose zzso and protein are zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells undergoing zzso outgrowth induced by treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a precursor protein for a newly discovered rat zzso zzso As with other zzso zzso the zzso protein contains a putative signal zzso rich in zzso zzso acids at the zzso zzso zzso is present only in brain and spinal zzso in adult zzso and is expressed at higher levels in early zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso protein functions not only as a zzso precursor but also as an important component in zzso zzso
