The purpose of this study was to determine the existence of zzso zzso complex zzso at species level and the zzso species in the environment of zzso bamboo plantations in zzso zzso A total of 423 zzso were recovered from zzso bamboo zzso soil samples of three sites on the selective medium during zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso gene sequencing, zzso sequence typing zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso Out of 423 zzso zzso zzso were assigned to the following zzso species, eight zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso 193 zzso zzso and 51 zzso zzso which indicated zzso zzso as the most dominant species followed by zzso zzso Moreover, false zzso were observed in certain zzso of zzso zzso while performing zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the results of zzso gene sequence similarity and zzso data demonstrated that nine zzso formed a single discrete cluster but were zzso negative to zzso zzso representing novel species may exist within the zzso In addition, zzso zzso for all the zzso zzso also showed the strain zzso It is the first report of the existence of zzso zzso and predominance of zzso zzso in the zzso bamboo zzso
