Many studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor zzso is a potent soluble zzso of zzso and zzso zzso substance P zzso has been known to exert significant influence on production of certain inflammatory zzso by immune zzso zzso mechanism underlying the effect of zzso substance P zzso and the specific zzso acid sequence of SP that zzso zzso has not been clearly zzso zzso ex zzso and in zzso model systems, we investigated the direct effect of different sequences of SP on zzso zzso by whole blood and separated total zzso zzso zzso of blood samples (1 zzso or zzso total zzso cells (1 zzso zzso were cultured with different zzso of SP and its sequences zzso zzso SP zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso at 37 degrees zzso Plasma samples and culture zzso were zzso for zzso levels in a zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 cell zzso Plasma from blood samples or zzso treated with whole SP and SP zzso at zzso zzso and zzso M zzso induced significant production of zzso compared to negligible levels of zzso produced by SP zzso and zzso zzso zzso at all zzso tested did not induce zzso production and was similar to zzso control zzso zzso zzso cells also produced significant levels of zzso in response to SP and SP zzso zzso zzso neutralized the zzso induced by SP zzso in zzso These studies suggest that an ex zzso system using whole blood may be an ideal model to study the effects of SP on zzso zzso These studies also demonstrated that the zzso inducing activity of SP zzso in the region containing zzso acids 4 to zzso
