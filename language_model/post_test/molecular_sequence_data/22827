There is now zzso and genetic evidence that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso is the critical step in the regulation of zzso acid zzso synthesis in higher zzso The peel of zzso fruit accumulates large amounts of zzso during zzso To understand the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso two full-length zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated and characterized from the zzso of orange fruits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene increased in the zzso during natural and zzso fruit zzso and in zzso leaves, in a pattern consistent with the zzso of zzso The second zzso zzso was not detected in dehydrated leaves and, in zzso exhibited a differential expression to that of zzso Taken together, these results suggests that zzso is likely to play a primary role in the zzso of zzso in both leaves and zzso while zzso appears to play a subsidiary role restricted to zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso and zzso as the two possible zzso for zzso revealed that the former was the main zzso in the outer zzso part of the fruit peel as the fruit zzso or after zzso treatment, whereas zzso was not detected or was in trace zzso By contrast, zzso and dehydrated leaves contained zzso but zzso was zzso Based on these results, it is suggested that zzso may be the zzso zzso for zzso in the peel of zzso zzso whereas zzso would be the precursor of zzso in zzso zzso
