zzso regulation of the zzso system zzso is crucial for the cell to adjust its protein degradation capacity to changing zzso zzso We have shown previously that zzso cells zzso zzso gene expression in response to zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a key regulator for zzso zzso formation in human cells to compensate for reduced zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso resides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso There, zzso is targeted to zzso protein degradation requiring the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the AAA zzso zzso zzso zzso trigger the zzso of zzso proteins and promote the nuclear zzso of zzso from the zzso permitting zzso of zzso gene expression by binding to zzso response elements in their promoter zzso Thus, we uncovered the zzso control loop regulating human zzso protein degradation to counteract zzso stress caused by zzso zzso
