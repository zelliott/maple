A number of clones that specifically zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from human and Chinese zzso zzso cell zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis shows that one of these zzso zzso is completely zzso to the human zzso zzso (in both coding and zzso zzso with no intervening zzso The other human clones analyzed were all zzso zzso containing numerous small additions, zzso and base zzso but no zzso On the basis of sequence data, six different zzso zzso were identified in human zzso In addition, we also cloned and completely zzso a zzso clone from zzso zzso This zzso which was also a zzso contained a small zzso zzso near the 3' zzso Southern zzso analysis of human, zzso and Chinese zzso DNA, zzso with unique restriction zzso (no sites in zzso indicates the presence of about 8-12 genes for zzso in the zzso zzso The sequence data, however, suggest that most of these zzso except one zzso zzso zzso are likely to be zzso zzso
