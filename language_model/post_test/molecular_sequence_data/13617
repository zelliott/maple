A simple and efficient procedure was described for the isolation of total zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrated that the quality and the quantity of zzso zzso zzso were increased by substituting zzso mixture for zzso as a zzso agent in the first zzso step and using an ice bath instead of a dry zzso bath in the freezing zzso Additionally, this protocol had the advantage of zzso total zzso without any degradation of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the high amounts and quality of zzso extracted by this modified procedure enabled us to perform some experiments such as Northern zzso zzso zzso primer extension, and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso without further zzso zzso We suggest that this procedure is very useful to zzso primary structures and zzso levels of zzso from zzso zzso
