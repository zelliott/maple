zzso early zzso controls the initiation and establishment phase of zzso expression in the zzso Comparative studies indicate the presence of zzso early zzso sequences in different zzso zzso including zzso birds and zzso Previous studies have shown differences between zzso and zzso zzso early enhancers with respect to sequence and organization of protein binding zzso This raises the question of when the zzso early zzso arose and how it has become modified in different zzso zzso Here, we describe zzso early zzso from the Indonesian zzso zzso zzso zzso are the only extant zzso fish whose zzso is zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso early zzso sequence more closely resembles that of the mouse than that of zzso or zzso When zzso for zzso activity by reporter gene analysis in transgenic mouse zzso zzso zzso early zzso directs expression to the zzso neural tube and zzso similar to that of the mouse zzso These observations support a close relationship between zzso and zzso and place the origin of a common zzso early zzso sequence within the zzso zzso The divergence of zzso zzso zzso early zzso may reflect a case of relaxed selection or other forms of instability induced by zzso zzso zzso
