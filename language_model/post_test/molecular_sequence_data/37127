The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso structural motif that contains a single zzso zzso capped by a hairpin loop containing three zzso The two zzso immediately outside of this motif zzso and 3' to the zzso are not zzso to one another, restricting the length of this zzso to a single zzso Four examples of this zzso along with three tentative examples, were initially identified in the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso An evaluation of the recently determined crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the authenticity for all of these proposed interactions and identified 16 more zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This motif is found in the T loop in the zzso crystal zzso The zzso are zzso in nearly all examples, immediately 3' to a regular secondary structure zzso and are stabilized by zzso stacking onto this zzso zzso In all but two cases, the zzso in the zzso are involved in a zzso interaction with another section of the zzso establishing an overall three-dimensional function for this zzso Of these 24 examples, 14 occur in zzso zzso seven in hairpin zzso and three in internal zzso While the most common zzso zzso occurs in ten of the 24 zzso the remaining 14 zzso contain seven different zzso zzso Only a few of these zzso adopt the standard zzso zzso zzso while the majority of the zzso have zzso zzso While the general three-dimensional zzso is similar for all examples of this zzso characteristic differences lead to several zzso present in different structural zzso At least one zzso zzso in 22 of the 24 zzso in the zzso and zzso forms a zzso interaction with another part of the zzso When a zzso containing the zzso or zzso zzso sequence forms a zzso interaction with the first (and zzso zzso zzso it recruits a fourth zzso to mediate stacking and mimic the zzso zzso zzso half of the zzso motifs are in close association with zzso The majority of these zzso are positioned at sites in zzso that are zzso in the three zzso zzso a few of these occur in regions of the zzso associated with zzso function, including the presumed site of zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso
