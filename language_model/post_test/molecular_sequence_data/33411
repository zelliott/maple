zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important component of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso has been shown to mediate the zzso response to zzso in zzso However, the exact components of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso by zzso remain zzso Here, we used stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in cell culture zzso coupled with mass zzso to identify zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Using zzso we were able to detect changes in zzso zzso patterns of 43 potential zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This included 23 known zzso zzso zzso of which 16 proteins have known roles in zzso signaling while the remaining 7 proteins have not previously been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso our analysis also led to identification of 20 novel zzso zzso zzso of which 5 proteins were previously reported as zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso while the remaining 15 proteins represent novel signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso In validation experiments, we demonstrated that zzso indeed induced the zzso of a subset of candidate zzso zzso zzso - zzso 2, zzso and zzso - in a zzso zzso
