zzso heavy chain class switch zzso zzso determines the expression of zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso and the factors regulating this process have remained zzso zzso occurs primarily within switch zzso regions, located upstream of each heavy chain gene (except zzso These repetitive sequences contain consensus zzso sites for the zzso protein late zzso factor zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate by zzso that zzso zzso as well as zzso within B cell zzso directly binds both zzso and zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is involved in regulating zzso two different zzso dominant negative zzso were zzso expressed in the mouse B cell line zzso zzso which can be induced to switch from zzso to zzso zzso of these dominant negative zzso proteins results in decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso activity and an increase in cells undergoing zzso Thus, zzso zzso class switching to zzso In agreement, zzso zzso activity was found to decrease in whole cell extracts from zzso B cells induced to undergo class zzso To zzso the mechanism of zzso regulation by zzso the interactions of zzso with proteins involved in zzso modification were tested in zzso zzso interacts with both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso within S regions, thereby limiting accessibility to the switch zzso zzso
