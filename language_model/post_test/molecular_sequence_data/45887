In organisms ranging from zzso to humans, zzso requires zzso proteins zzso to carry out its roles in zzso interference zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso acts with zzso during the initiation of zzso when long zzso is zzso to small interfering zzso zzso zzso is not required in subsequent steps, and how zzso zzso between long zzso and short zzso is zzso We report the first detailed analysis of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and various truncated zzso We find that, similar to other zzso zzso is not zzso However, consistent with its in zzso roles, zzso binds with higher affinity to long zzso We also observe that zzso is a zzso in solution, and that the zzso domain of the protein is required for zzso Using extracts from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso domain is required for the production of zzso Our findings suggest a model for zzso function during the initiation of zzso
