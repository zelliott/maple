A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a molecular mass of about 140 zzso on zzso and natural zzso The zzso was zzso The zzso when resolved by zzso was negative for Schiff zzso suggesting that the zzso is not a zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso was zzso The zzso displayed a temperature optimum of around 60 degrees C and a pH optimum of around pH zzso The zzso was stable to incubation from pH zzso to pH zzso at 4 degrees C for 24 zzso The presence of zzso protected the zzso from heat zzso the extent depending upon the zzso zzso The activity of the zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso had an apparent zzso of zzso zzso for zzso a zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso when measured at pH zzso and 50 degrees zzso The zzso caused the complete zzso of zzso to zzso The activity was not inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso The western zzso analysis with mouse zzso against zzso showed that zzso is produced as a single zzso form during bacterial zzso
