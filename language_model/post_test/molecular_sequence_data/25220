A genetic system for directly zzso zzso membrane proteins in zzso coli and assessing their ability to insert into the bacterial zzso membrane is zzso The components of this system are the direct expression zzso zzso and the mature zzso zzso cassette zzso zzso that can be used to generate zzso zzso of zzso to any zzso membrane zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso plasma membrane zzso was zzso in zzso coli using zzso and zzso was fused to a normally zzso portion of zzso The fusion protein zzso zzso resistance on individual host cells, indicating that the zzso portion had been zzso to the bacterial zzso and that, by zzso the zzso zzso protein can insert into the bacterial zzso zzso A series of 31 beta zzso fusion proteins was isolated and zzso to map the zzso of the zzso plasma membrane protein with respect to the bacterial zzso zzso This analysis revealed that the zzso of the beta zzso in the zzso coli zzso membrane was indistinguishable from that in its native plasma zzso
