zzso zzso 2 zzso bind to zzso growth factor receptors and are found in proteins that serve as zzso for zzso zzso such as zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso We have previously described the cloning of zzso zzso zzso from expression libraries with the zzso zzso growth factor zzso as a zzso We have now modified this technique by using zzso zzso expression libraries, which significantly improves sensitivity of the zzso In one screening of such a library, we identified five different zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso which we call zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Two of these proteins represented the zzso zzso zzso and the mouse zzso of zzso zzso 1, whereas two genes zzso proteins similar to zzso and zzso We also isolated the gene for zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso In addition to a zzso zzso 2 domain, zzso also has a region of similarity to the zzso domain of zzso zzso protein and is highly expressed in liver and zzso Use of this zzso system should increase our ability to identify downstream zzso of growth factor zzso
