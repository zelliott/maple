The zzso consequences of recent climate change remain controversial, and there is little zzso or zzso evidence that zzso zzso zzso glacial cycles acted as drivers of zzso especially among lineages with long generation times, such as zzso We combined genetic and zzso data from 2 closely related North American tree species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to determine if their divergence coincided with and was possibly caused by zzso zzso zzso We analyzed 32 nuclear zzso from individuals of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to produce zzso estimates of the divergence time between the 2 zzso We coupled the zzso analyses with zzso models to assess the influence of climate change on zzso zzso Furthermore, measures of niche overlap were used to investigate patterns of ecological differentiation between zzso We estimated the divergence date of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at approximately 75 zzso which zzso closely with the onset of Marine zzso Stage 4 zzso zzso and a rapid increase in global ice zzso zzso tests of niche zzso in conjunction with genetic estimates of migration, suggested that zzso occurred in zzso possibly resulting from the environmental effects of zzso glacial zzso Our results indicate that the divergence of zzso tree species, which have shaped community diversity in northern North American zzso was recent and may have been a consequence of zzso zzso and climate zzso
