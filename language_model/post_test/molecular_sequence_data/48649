To propose a model for recently described zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the role of its zzso zzso For this purpose, three zzso zzso of protein with deletions zzso zzso and zzso were constructed and studied in a series of in zzso zzso and using atomic force zzso zzso Specifically, all zzso zzso zzso zzso with the use of zzso zzso zzso have shown reduced affinity for zzso DNA and reduced activity in zzso zzso experiments zzso to that of zzso zzso thus zzso the modern concept on the zzso role of zzso in formation of open complex and zzso zzso The ability of zzso proteins to form zzso structures has been investigated using zzso which revealed the increased propensity of zzso proteins to form zzso zzso with the effect being more pronounced for the zzso with the deletion zzso (10 fold zzso zzso zzso zzso ability has shown complex dependence on the zzso zzso which we explain by zzso screening effect and the change of the internal state of the zzso Basing on the obtained data, we propose the model of zzso zzso formation by zzso zzso zzso the involvement of zzso region according to the domain swapping zzso
