zzso of protein zzso C zzso by zzso is investigated and we describe the zzso of zzso sequences within the zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso zzso zzso through an zzso of the zzso of zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso is not affected, but zzso is zzso The potent zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso of zzso by zzso at zzso up to zzso zzso Two zzso fragments of zzso were isolated which inhibited zzso They were only slightly less potent than intact zzso with an zzso of 6 zzso compared to 1 zzso of intact zzso They were identified as zzso and zzso Each of the zzso fragments contains an intact zzso domain with complete zzso structure zzso zzso Other zzso peptides showed only weak zzso zzso Both fragments did not stimulate zzso zzso even at zzso zzso higher than the zzso concentration needed for zzso zzso None of the fragments acted as a zzso zzso
