zzso are a major branch of zzso evolution with an extensive zzso record, but only scarce molecular data are zzso The zzso species zzso zzso belonging to the zzso is zzso in freshwater zzso In culture, it zzso only as a zzso with thousands of zzso zzso in one zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso to be zzso 

The zzso is extremely zzso and the large amounts of identical sequences hint at frequent zzso and zzso zzso zzso Presumably, these mechanisms are employed to provide more gene copies for higher zzso activity and to build up a zzso of gene diversification in certain gene families, such as the zzso zzso The gene repertoire indicates that it is able to switch to a zzso zzso sexual state never observed in zzso zzso to another zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that proteins involved in signaling were likely drivers in establishing the zzso zzso Compared to some other zzso horizontal gene transfer is zzso but we found evidence of zzso and zzso transfer zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso exhibits a unique architecture with extensive repeat homogenization and gene amplification, which highlights its potential for diverse zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to rapidly transport matter from the zzso to the cell body may be supported by the high diversification of zzso and zzso gene family zzso
