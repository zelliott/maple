The zzso D3 zzso has been implicated as a potential target for drug development in various complex psychiatric disorders including zzso drug zzso and Parkinson's zzso In our overall goal to develop molecules with preferential affinity at D3 zzso we undertook a hybrid drug development approach by combining a known zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso In the present study, three compounds produced this way with preferential D3 zzso activity, were tested at D3 receptors with zzso in the zzso binding pocket of three zzso known to be important for zzso binding zzso At zzso and zzso the hybrid zzso compounds produced an interaction profile in zzso binding zzso similar to that of the parent zzso and zzso zzso The loss of affinity at the zzso zzso was most prominent for zzso and its corresponding hybrid compound zzso zzso did not show any zzso zzso zzso modeling indicated that zzso zzso uniquely shares zzso with zzso which produced favorable interaction and no loss of zzso in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activity may not be solely controlled by zzso in the binding zzso
