zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is required for cells to complete zzso and enter zzso of the next cell zzso In clam eggs, this process is zzso by a zzso zzso carrier zzso zzso and the zzso promoting complex zzso a zzso particle containing zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report cloning a human zzso of zzso zzso which shares zzso zzso acid identity with clam zzso and can substitute for clam zzso in zzso zzso clam zzso and human zzso zzso created by altering the zzso zzso to zzso inhibit the in zzso zzso and destruction of zzso B in clam zzso zzso When zzso into zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso the destruction of both zzso A and B, arrests cells in M phase, and zzso the onset of zzso presumably by blocking the zzso zzso of proteins responsible for sister zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is involved in both zzso zzso and sister zzso zzso processes that are normally coordinated during exit from zzso
