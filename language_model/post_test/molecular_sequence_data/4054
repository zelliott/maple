The zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain was zzso in zzso zzso The zzso domain consisted of 226 zzso acid zzso containing the signature motif zzso a motif highly zzso among protein zzso and zzso zzso and showed zzso activity toward zzso zzso The zzso activity was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso motif are essential for activity, but the zzso zzso is zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso the reaction through a zzso mechanism involving a zzso intermediate like in the cases of other protein zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso inactive form of zzso B complex zzso from extracts of immature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso mimicking zzso acid sequences around the zzso site of zzso still retained zzso zzso zzso and zzso underwent zzso in this zzso This is the reverse order to that reported for the in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso having the same sequence served as much poorer zzso As judged from the results with synthetic zzso the presence of two zzso zzso was important for specific recognition of zzso by the zzso zzso
