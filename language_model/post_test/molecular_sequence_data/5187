To determine the extent of zzso structuring in North American black bear zzso zzso zzso we examined zzso DNA sequences zzso zzso zzso and restriction zzso length zzso profiles zzso zzso zzso in individuals from 16 zzso Among the bears zzso 19 lineages falling into two highly divergent zzso were zzso The zzso differ at zzso of zzso positions, a distance consistent with an origin zzso zzso and have different but overlapping geographical zzso Areas of zzso zzso show that eastern and western populations are currently zzso but regional differences in lineage distribution suggest that mixing has begun only zzso The long-term population history of black bears appears to be characterized predominantly by long-term regional isolation followed by recent contact and zzso zzso between the pattern of diversity observed in black bears and patterns of forest refuge formation during the zzso supports earlier speculation that zzso forest zzso zzso a common pattern in the zzso of North American forest zzso
