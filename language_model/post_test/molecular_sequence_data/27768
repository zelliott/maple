The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 library by screening with a synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acid zzso zzso 34 to 43 of zzso The zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence indicates a protein precursor of 195 zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence comparisons establish that zzso shares extensive zzso with zzso zzso but is more closely related to the zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was cloned into an zzso expression zzso and zzso in monkey zzso cells, a high level of zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso analyses of total zzso reveal that the zzso gene is expressed during a relatively short period zzso to 21 zzso The abundant expression of zzso zzso zzso closely to the time at which the zzso acts to extend zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were also detected in goat and cow zzso at equivalent periods of their development, but not in the zzso
