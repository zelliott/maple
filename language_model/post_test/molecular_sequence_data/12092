A zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso located close to the zzso zzso zzso gene on zzso 11, is associated with elevated levels of zzso in normal healthy individuals and with depressed levels in patients with coronary heart zzso In both cases the association is with the zzso zzso (the zzso not containing the zzso cutting zzso zzso exercise is known to increase zzso plasma zzso zzso We investigated the effect of adaptation to endurance exercise on the association of the zzso marker with plasma zzso zzso zzso male subjects between the ages of 20 and 50 years were randomly selected from a group of local marathon zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso was zzso in this zzso This was similar to the frequency reported for this zzso in other population groups of healthy zzso Plasma levels of zzso were elevated in the marathon runners compared with randomly selected healthy South African men in the same age zzso There was, however, no association between the zzso zzso and the plasma zzso zzso cholesterol and/or zzso zzso in this zzso The elevated zzso levels in marathon runners therefore bear no relation to differences associated with the zzso zzso at the zzso gene zzso
