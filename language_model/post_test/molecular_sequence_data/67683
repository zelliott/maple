We analyzed sequences of newly inserted repeats in an zzso coli zzso zzso regularly zzso short zzso zzso array in zzso and showed that a base previously thought to belong to the repeat is actually derived from a zzso Based on further experimental results, we propose to use the term zzso for a repeated sequence in a zzso array that serves as a template for a new zzso Our findings suggest the possibility of zzso the borders between repeats, zzso and zzso adjacent zzso
