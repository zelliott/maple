zzso anchored in the membrane by zzso linkage to zzso zzso can be released by treatment with zzso zzso zzso C zzso A recent survey of zzso zzso using flow zzso has shown that zzso of certain zzso zzso was diminished after zzso treatment, but zzso of structurally related zzso zzso was not zzso zzso in this study, the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso by zzso was investigated zzso by zzso of zzso molecules from cell zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso was released from the surface of zzso zzso mouse zzso cells and recovered in the cell zzso Similar analysis of zzso cells zzso with cloned zzso genes showed that zzso zzso molecules zzso by a zzso zzso and the zzso or zzso gene were sensitive to zzso by zzso whereas the zzso and zzso gene products were zzso Using zzso cells zzso with hybrid genes constructed by exchanging zzso between zzso and zzso the signals for zzso modification were localized to a defined region of zzso This region differs from zzso most significantly by the presence of a central zzso zzso in the zzso segment and in the length of the zzso zzso
