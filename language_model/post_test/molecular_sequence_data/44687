An approach to isolate zzso quantities of zzso zzso from human zzso is zzso The zzso zzso from 500 zzso of the zzso were released zzso zzso and isolated free of protein using zzso exchange zzso The pooled zzso were converted into zzso zzso by reaction with ammonium zzso then coupled to zzso to prepare zzso zzso These were resolved on zzso zzso to recover zzso quantities of six zzso zzso zzso The zzso structures were zzso by a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso time of flight mass zzso and included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso containing a single zzso zzso zzso degradation was zzso to reverse the zzso zzso zzso leading to the generation of reducing zzso These were used to characterize the zzso profile of zzso zzso zzso on high pH zzso exchange zzso This application of zzso zzso has allowed for the first time the complete resolution of the complex zzso mixture from zzso on a zzso scale in a single zzso and provide the first zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso from this zzso This study demonstrates the broad utility of the zzso zzso to develop zzso libraries useful for probing the biological functions of zzso
