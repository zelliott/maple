zzso small zzso zzso are a class of structural zzso that often regulate zzso targets via zzso base pair zzso We determined features that discriminate functional from zzso interactions and assessed the influence of these features on zzso target zzso For this purpose, we compiled a set of 71 zzso verified zzso pairs from zzso coli and zzso zzso Furthermore, we collected full-length zzso untranslated regions by using zzso zzso verified zzso start zzso Only interaction sites in zzso but not in targets, show significant sequence zzso In addition to this zzso we found that the base pairing between zzso and their targets is not zzso in general across more zzso related zzso A closer inspection of zzso and zzso zzso and their targets revealed that the base pairing zzso is only zzso in a small subset of the zzso In contrast to zzso accessibility of functional interaction sites is significantly higher in both zzso and targets in comparison to zzso zzso Based on the above zzso we successfully used the following constraints to improve the specificity of zzso target zzso the region of interaction initiation must be located in zzso highly accessible regions in both interaction partners and zzso zzso zzso zzso regions derived from reliability profiles of multiple zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso functional and zzso targets, and a supplementary document with supplementary tables, figures and references are available at zzso zzso
