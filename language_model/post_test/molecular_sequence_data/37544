To investigate the frequency of common zzso primary zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing were used to detect zzso DNA zzso zzso Chinese examiners from 15 families, including 22 visual affected and their 44 unaffected maternal relatives, underwent molecular genetic zzso Eleven normal individuals underwent evaluation as zzso 

Of the 15 families with suspicion of zzso 13 had zzso position zzso zzso zzso 2 had zzso zzso zzso All examiners had zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso at zzso zzso and zzso are primary zzso zzso zzso genetic findings suggest that the silent zzso at zzso zzso may be a common genetic zzso in zzso
