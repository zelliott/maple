zzso source zzso plays a critical role in zzso development, secondary zzso production and zzso In both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso factors globally activate the expression of zzso zzso genes required to degrade complex zzso zzso However, in the presence of preferred nitrogen sources such as zzso zzso factor activity is inhibited in some species through interaction with zzso zzso zzso This regulatory phenomenon, nitrogen zzso repression, enables preferential zzso of readily assimilated nitrogen zzso In the zzso pathogen zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso has been zzso into regulating multiple key zzso traits in addition to nitrogen zzso Here, we further characterize zzso function and investigate the regulatory role of the predicted zzso zzso zzso While zzso expression is induced during nitrogen zzso zzso zzso is unaffected by nitrogen zzso zzso of zzso leads to inappropriate zzso of zzso nitrogen zzso pathways in the simultaneous presence of zzso zzso In addition to exhibiting its evolutionary zzso role of zzso zzso factor activity under zzso conditions, zzso also positively regulates zzso zzso under zzso zzso The molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso nitrogen zzso repression, however, remains open to zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso and zzso each lacking the zzso zzso regions present in zzso zzso proteins and zzso factors that are known to interact with each zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and highlighting the paradigm of nitrogen regulation of zzso
