A bacterial zzso zzso the zzso E1 from zzso zzso was imported into zzso and an active zzso was recovered both in zzso and in zzso zzso fusion proteins were zzso with E1 or its zzso domain, CD, fused to the transit zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso A zzso region of 1, 5 or 15 zzso acids was included zzso to the transit zzso The efficiency of import and processing by the zzso processing zzso depended on the nature of the transit zzso and the passenger zzso and increased with the length of the zzso between zzso Besides finding E1 or CD in the zzso protein was arrested in the envelope during import showing that structural features of E1 and CD, along with their proximity to the transit zzso influence zzso The cellulose binding domain and/or zzso zzso of E1 may impede efficient zzso zzso most precursors for E1 and CD zzso by in zzso translation possessed zzso activity that was zzso and required the zzso zzso at the zzso of E1 and zzso Furthermore, activity was detected upon import into zzso Based on the in zzso zzso five precursor fusion proteins were selected to determine if E1 and CD would be successfully targeted to zzso in zzso In transgenic tobacco plants, E1 and CD accumulated in both the zzso and membrane zzso and, importantly, zzso extracts showed zzso zzso
