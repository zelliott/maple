zzso bacteria play an important role in technical water systems zzso wells, distribution systems) due to their intense deposition of iron zzso and resulting clogging zzso zzso is known as zzso and zzso and accumulating zzso The ability to detect and zzso members of this species in zzso communities is therefore zzso In this study the zzso in zzso zzso zzso method was used to detect zzso in iron and zzso zzso zzso Based on comparative sequence analysis, we designed and evaluated a specific zzso probe zzso zzso complementary to the zzso region 8 of the zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso were tested against 3 different strains of zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso Using zzso conditions the probe zzso with all tested strains of zzso with an efficiency of zzso The zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso The new FISH probe was applied successfully for the in zzso detection of zzso in different native, zzso zzso The zzso results of native zzso using probe zzso agreed with the results of the zzso structure of zzso zzso based on scanning electron zzso
