The zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso has been cloned by transformation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain with a zzso gene zzso The zzso gene contains two zzso and potentially codes for a zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence is zzso to known zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse and man, particularly in the zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene is specifically induced by zzso and is also under the control of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the gene occurs at both zzso and zzso zzso The promoter region of zzso contains putative zzso and zzso zzso Fusion proteins containing zzso or zzso zzso zzso bind some of these zzso zzso zzso zzso very well to the zzso consensus sequence which is zzso zzso zzso are composed of zzso sequences which are not typical binding sites for the zzso - binding family of zzso zzso
