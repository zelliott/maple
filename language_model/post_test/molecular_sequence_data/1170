The targeting mechanism of zzso outer envelope membrane proteins remains largely zzso We investigated the targeting of zzso In zzso the zzso domain zzso and its zzso zzso zzso region zzso were both necessary and sufficient for targeting to the outer envelope zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso region were zzso without the zzso the zzso was targeted to the zzso or the plasma zzso In addition, the types of zzso acid zzso of the zzso but not the zzso acid sequence per se, is a signal for targeting to the zzso envelope zzso zzso containing zzso were not targeted to the zzso in zzso Based on these results, we propose that the zzso targeting signal of zzso comprises two different zzso 1) the zzso which is a signal for evading zzso zzso zzso and 2) the zzso zzso acid side chains of the zzso whose size functions as a signal for a zzso factor that mediates transport to the zzso
