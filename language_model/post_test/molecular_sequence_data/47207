We have zzso characterized and zzso the zzso zzso zzso Associated Factor 1 zzso zzso zzso mapping and Southern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene comprises 10 zzso and 9 intervening zzso and spreads over 18 zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso transcript using zzso from activated zzso B cells revealed several zzso start sites between positions zzso to zzso relative to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also isolated and zzso the zzso promoter region, which lacks zzso and zzso sites but contains zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso gene promoter is a member of the class of zzso zzso Near the zzso initiation start site we identified three identical zzso repeats zzso which may play a role in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso In addition we show that zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso zzso but can be induced upon zzso with different zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso
