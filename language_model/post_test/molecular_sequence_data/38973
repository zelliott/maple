The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso controls zzso expression of both nitrogen fixation and zzso activities in symbiotic zzso Two copies of zzso are present in this strain, one zzso zzso and the other located in the symbiotic zzso zzso Their expression was studied by cloning the regulatory regions in zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes were found to be zzso they are expressed only at zzso levels under zzso zzso they are highly expressed under zzso zzso and they are expressed at zzso levels in the double zzso zzso zzso zzso under any zzso The promoters of both genes contain two zzso sequences zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and gel zzso experiments with zzso promoter zzso altered in key bases of the zzso sequences demonstrated that binding of zzso to the zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso of transcription, and that binding of zzso to the zzso zzso results in zzso zzso The apparent affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso was fivefold lower than for the zzso zzso resulting in repression of zzso of zzso only at zzso zzso This positive and negative zzso mechanism ensures an zzso expression of zzso in response to zzso zzso
