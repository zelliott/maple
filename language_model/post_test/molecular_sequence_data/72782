zzso experiments in zzso show that zzso zzso zzso is not essential for nuclear assembly or cell zzso These results, together with a series of zzso and cell biological zzso challenge the existing paradigm that requires zzso zzso to be a key organizing component of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also reveal a much more subtle role for zzso Instead of acting as a general zzso zzso zzso is found to regulate a limited number of specific zzso Surprisingly, zzso can both activate and repress zzso We discuss how this architectural protein might accomplish this important regulatory zzso
