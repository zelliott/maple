zzso is a small zzso rich repeat zzso zzso whose function is critical for normal zzso The absence of zzso results in the complete form of zzso stationary night zzso Normally, zzso released by zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso type 6 zzso which through a zzso cascade closes the zzso zzso channel, zzso on the zzso tips of zzso bipolar cells zzso in the zzso zzso has been shown to interact with zzso and expression of zzso on the zzso tips of the zzso is dependent on zzso zzso In the current study, we used zzso two hybrid and zzso approaches to investigate whether zzso zzso was membrane bound, and if so by what zzso and also whether the functional form was as a zzso Our results show that zzso zzso is anchored to the plasma membrane by a single zzso domain, such that the zzso domain is located in the zzso zzso
