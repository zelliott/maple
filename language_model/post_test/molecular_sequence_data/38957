zzso a novel zzso acid zzso protein expressed by the zzso zzso virus, was previously found to zzso zzso after infection of rabbit zzso Furthermore, infection of rabbits with an zzso knockout virus unexpectedly produced zzso with a profound zzso zzso We show here that zzso is zzso when expressed independently of other viral zzso and is directed specifically to zzso by a short zzso region that is necessary and sufficient for zzso This targeting region consists of a zzso domain flanked by basic zzso acid zzso adjacent to a positively charged zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso by preventing zzso from undergoing a zzso transition, and the zzso zzso of this protein is essential for this zzso We show that zzso is specifically required to inhibit the zzso response of zzso during virus infection, as cells of this lineage undergo zzso when infected with the zzso knockout zzso As zzso zzso is uniquely zzso we propose that this observation zzso the paradoxical zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso knockout zzso We suggest that zzso of tissue zzso represents an important zzso defense, and that the zzso of zzso by viral proteins can be directed in a zzso zzso
