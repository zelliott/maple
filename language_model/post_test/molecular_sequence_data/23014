A gene zzso the zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso gene shares zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by growing cells, and required to zzso from viable but zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso long, and shared a zzso segment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso after expression in zzso coli zzso harboring the zzso zzso was approximately 25 zzso Since zzso zzso cells are relatively quick to enter the zzso state just after zzso in the presence of zzso zzso at 37 degrees C for 3 days, we evaluated the biological effect of zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso not only promoted proliferation but also induced resuscitation of zzso cells to the zzso state in a zzso zzso zzso zzso may be useful for detection of bacterial zzso present in the zzso form in food samples and the zzso
