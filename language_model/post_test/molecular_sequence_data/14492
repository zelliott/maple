zzso complex protein 3 zzso is a zzso protein located on the lateral elements of the zzso zzso This protein plays an important role in zzso zzso pairing and is necessary for male zzso of zzso To further understand the zzso gene function and its relationship to zzso male sterility, we investigated the characteristics of the bovine zzso zzso gene as well as its zzso level and zzso modification zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso acid protein with the zzso motif and two zzso regions, zzso with other zzso zzso identity zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the expression level of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso level of the zzso promoter zzso 7th, 13th and 17th zzso zzso in zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso plays an important role in zzso of bovine zzso further, zzso zzso between zzso and cattle might influence zzso gene expression in zzso zzso which might be influenced by zzso gene promoter zzso
