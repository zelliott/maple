The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso acids with similar rate zzso However, zzso exhibits approximately zzso higher zzso rate zzso for the zzso of aromatic zzso acids than does zzso A series of natural and zzso zzso acid zzso was used to zzso specificity differences for these two highly related zzso A general trend toward lower zzso activity with increasing zzso length zzso from zzso to zzso to zzso is observed for both zzso This result suggests that zzso zzso associate with the two highly related zzso in a similar zzso The high zzso of the zzso with zzso and zzso can be attributed to an zzso pair interaction between the zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso and the zzso group of the active site zzso zzso zzso that is common to both zzso A strong linear correlation between zzso zzso and zzso rate zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso but not for zzso The present kinetic data support a model in which zzso contains one binding mode for all classes of zzso whereas the active site of zzso allows an additional mode that has increased affinity for zzso zzso zzso
