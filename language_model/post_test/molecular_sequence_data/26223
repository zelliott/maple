zzso zzso nuclear factor 4) is a protein enriched in liver extracts that binds to sites required for the zzso of the genes for zzso zzso the carrier protein in the serum for vitamin A and zzso hormone, and for zzso zzso zzso a major constituent of zzso and very zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso protein (54 zzso were used in the zzso chain reaction zzso to isolate a zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso is a member of the steroid hormone zzso zzso with an unusual zzso acid in the zzso zzso of the first zinc finger zzso Studies with in zzso zzso protein show that it binds to its recognition site as a zzso and zzso zzso indicate that it activates zzso in a zzso fashion in zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals that zzso zzso is present in kidney and zzso as well as liver, but is absent in other zzso zzso and zzso zzso data suggest that zzso could be identical to liver factor A1 zzso a zzso activity implicated in the regulation of zzso of the alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The similarity between zzso and other zzso zzso factors raises the possibility that zzso and the genes it regulates respond to an as yet unidentified zzso
