zzso zzso zzso has long been considered as a major player in cell zzso However, direct evidence for this view is lacking due, in part, to the complexity of zzso plant zzso Here, we used cotton zzso zzso zzso fast-growing zzso seed zzso to address this zzso zzso activity in zzso fibers was approximately zzso higher than that in leaves, zzso and zzso It was zzso in zzso cotton seed zzso but became evident in initiating fibers and remained high during their fast zzso and dropped when zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso with faster fiber zzso had significantly higher fiber zzso activity and zzso levels than a zzso zzso By contrast, cell wall or zzso zzso activities did not show correlation with fiber zzso To unravel the molecular basis of zzso fiber zzso we cloned zzso which displayed zzso sequence features and localized to the zzso Once introduced to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and enhanced the zzso of root cells in the wild zzso This demonstrates that zzso functions as zzso in zzso In cotton zzso zzso expression level matched closely with zzso activity and fiber zzso zzso Indeed, transformation of cotton fiber with zzso zzso interference or zzso zzso reduced or enhanced fiber zzso zzso Together, these analyses provide evidence on the role of zzso in cotton fiber zzso zzso by zzso Based on the relative contributions of zzso to sap zzso in cotton fiber and zzso zzso we conclude that zzso regulates their zzso in an zzso dependent and independent manner, zzso
