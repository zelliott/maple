The zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso consists of at least 28 closed circular zzso zzso zzso In this study we used complete clones of four zzso zzso to analyze viral zzso both in the adult zzso zzso host zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso host, zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed in zzso zzso zzso but no viral transcripts had been characterized from zzso zzso until this zzso The clones of the zzso zzso B, zzso M, and zzso were used to probe Northern blots of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso tissue and from zzso zzso zzso zzso All four zzso zzso zzso to viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso to messages expressed in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso to transcripts that were detected only in either zzso zzso zzso tissue or zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that some zzso genes are expressed in a zzso zzso In a previous study we identified a family of zzso zzso zzso repeated zzso repeat elements on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1987 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso repeat regions to Northern blots showed that they were all zzso to viral zzso A zzso clone of a zzso that is transcribed from the zzso repeat region of zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso 10 library and completely zzso The sequence data revealed that the zzso repeat element was contained within the open reading frame of this zzso These results indicate that transcribed sequences zzso to the zzso repeat elements represent a second gene family to be identified within the zzso zzso
