zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are major zzso agents of zzso zzso zzso a disease zzso by zzso dissemination zzso from the original zzso zzso to form debilitating secondary zzso in the zzso zzso We employed a protein profiling approach to identify potential zzso factors in laboratory clones of zzso zzso zzso with stable zzso ranging from highly zzso zzso through infrequently zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the soluble zzso of zzso by two-dimensional zzso revealed two abundant protein spots specifically associated with zzso and zzso clones zzso and zzso and two others exclusively expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The association between clinical disease zzso and differential expression of zzso was less clear in zzso zzso strains from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso Identification of zzso by biological mass zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso and zzso clones express distinct zzso and neutral zzso of both zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This interchange of zzso may relate to the mechanisms by which the activities of zzso and zzso are zzso and/or differential zzso modification of the gene zzso The multiple zzso functions of zzso and zzso support the zzso of their participation in zzso survival and persistence and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso are active in resistance to chemical and zzso stress, providing a basis for further zzso of the importance of zzso zzso in the zzso underlying zzso
