The astonishing variation in the shape and size of bird zzso reflects a wide range of dietary zzso that played an important role in avian zzso Among Darwin's zzso ground zzso zzso zzso have zzso that represent zzso variations of the same shape, which are generated by zzso in the signaling pathways that regulate growth of the two skeletal components of the zzso the zzso cartilage zzso and the zzso bone zzso Whether this zzso mechanism is responsible for variation within groups of other closely related bird species, however, has remained zzso Here, we report that the Caribbean zzso zzso zzso which are closely related to Darwin's zzso have independently evolved zzso of a novel shape, different from zzso but also varying from each other only in zzso However, despite sharing the same beak shape, the signaling pathways and zzso patterning zzso zzso differ among the three zzso In zzso zzso as in zzso the zzso develops first, shaped by zzso and zzso zzso followed by the development of the zzso regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, beak zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is generated almost exclusively by the zzso through a mechanism in which zzso and zzso zzso to promote expansion of bone zzso Together, our results demonstrate high flexibility in the relationship between zzso and underlying zzso causes, where different zzso programs can generate identical shapes, and similar zzso programs can pattern different zzso
