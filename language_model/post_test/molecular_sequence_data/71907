zzso B is a zzso zzso protein exhibiting zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that it interacts with two types of binding sites on T zzso The type I sites zzso to specific functional receptors and the type II sites to zzso zzso The interactions of zzso B with type I and type II sites are reduced in the presence of zzso A and of a synthetic zzso mimicking the zzso part of zzso B, respectively, suggesting that the protein possesses two distinct binding zzso In this study, we intended to characterize the areas of zzso B involved in the interactions with binding sites present on zzso zzso The use of zzso B zzso modified in the zzso region demonstrated that the zzso and zzso clusters are probably solely required for the interactions with the type II zzso We further engineered zzso of the zzso central core of zzso B, which bears the zzso and the zzso A binding sites as an approach to zzso the binding regions for the type I zzso The zzso activity of zzso B was dramatically reduced after substitution of the zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso A binding activity was destroyed by zzso of the zzso zzso and strongly decreased after modification of the zzso zzso Only the substitution of the zzso zzso reduced the binding of the resulting zzso B zzso to type I binding zzso The zzso site of zzso B therefore did not seem to be essential for cellular binding and the zzso A binding site appeared to be partially involved in the binding to type I zzso
