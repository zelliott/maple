A novel bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from zzso Island, in zzso Province, zzso The strain was found to be able to grow at zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso The whole cell zzso were found to contain zzso acid, zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were identified as zzso and zzso zzso was identified as the zzso zzso and the zzso polar lipids were identified as zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was determined to be zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences placed the isolate within the zzso zzso and further revealed that strain zzso had highest sequence similarity with zzso zzso and forms a separate zzso with its closest relatives zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with which it shares zzso zzso and zzso similarity zzso The zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso AB zzso
