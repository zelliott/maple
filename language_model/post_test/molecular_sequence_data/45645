DNA amplification plays important roles in the development of drug resistance and tumor zzso One mechanism of DNA amplification involves the zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell line, breakage at fragile site zzso was associated with zzso gene amplification through the zzso zzso To zzso the molecular basis of zzso DNA amplification, we cloned zzso fragile site DNA from a Chinese zzso cell line containing an integrated zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed many characteristics similar to those in other common fragile zzso Moreover, this fragile site contains an zzso zzso novel zzso designated fragile zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a approximately zzso zzso from which an unusually large open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso acids can be zzso The zzso portion of zzso shares a striking sequence similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene whose function has been demonstrated to involve in zzso zzso We also demonstrated that expression of zzso is associated with the zzso programs of zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the Chinese zzso zzso fragile site has many important functions including regulation of zzso amplification and differentiation of zzso and zzso
