zzso DNA zzso clones zzso zzso receptors zzso were isolated using synthetic zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors as zzso to screen a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso proteins zzso produced in zzso bound the zzso zzso with high affinity and selectivity similar to the human zzso zzso present in target zzso and zzso A second zzso clone zzso zzso an identical zzso terminal and DNA binding zzso but differing by four zzso acids at the hormone binding domain, did not bind zzso with high affinity when incubated with protein expressed by in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in an expression zzso with mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed a zzso zzso defining the binding affinity of zzso between 5 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso M for zzso A similar zzso experiment with zzso indicated a zzso of zzso for zzso to be above approximately zzso zzso The deduced primary structures of zzso and zzso contain the viral zzso zzso region found in other zzso zzso and vitamin receptors and is identical to the zzso sequences reported by zzso The zzso acid sequence differs at the zzso stretch (16 zzso instead of 27, 24 or zzso of the zzso domain and in zzso the sequence reads zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso in the zzso and other reported zzso zzso The difference of four zzso acids in the steroid binding domain of zzso is associated with altered zzso binding and thus a lack of zzso by way of zzso responsive elements in zzso terminal zzso The interaction of zzso and zzso with synthetic responsive elements by zzso zzso and their responsiveness in zzso by calcium zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso can inhibit zzso by zzso in this zzso
