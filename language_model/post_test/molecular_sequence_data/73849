The kinetic mechanism of zzso initiation by zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated using transient state kinetic zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs in three stages consisting of zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso products, up to zzso were zzso during the initiation zzso the transition from initiation to zzso occurred between the synthesis of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso phase began after the synthesis of zzso zzso Our results show that the synthesis of zzso product from the zzso 10 promoter is limited both by the efficiency of initiation and by the frequency at which the zzso escapes the zzso Studies with zzso trap suggest that the zzso maintains contact with the promoter region during multiple turnovers of zzso zzso zzso thus, the zzso does not completely zzso from the promoter after each event of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso synthesis indicate that initiation occurs at a rate constant zzso zzso that is about 30 times faster than the zzso rate constant of zzso synthesis zzso zzso The zzso rate constant of zzso synthesis is limited largely by the cycling of the zzso zzso whereas initiation is limited by the formation of zzso the first zzso zzso We show that the synthesis of zzso is not limited by steps associated with zzso zzso DNA zzso or the melting of the promoter zzso Instead, the kinetic results indicate that initiation at the zzso promoter is limited either by the first zzso bond formation step or more likely by a zzso change prior to zzso zzso Such a zzso change could play a role in proper alignment of the initiating and zzso zzso for efficient zzso bond formation and in maintaining the zzso of zzso zzso
