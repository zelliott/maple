Using a zzso model of inflammation in the rat hind zzso the present study was undertaken to examine possible peripheral effects of specific zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso zzso zzso on an inflammatory response induced by substance zzso the putative zzso of zzso zzso When zzso over the zzso base, SP induced both plasma zzso and zzso zzso These responses were significantly inhibited in the presence of either zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited SP responses in a dose dependent manner and was 100 times more potent than zzso The role of primary zzso sensory nerve terminals in these zzso effects was investigated in rats zzso as zzso with zzso The ability of zzso and zzso to inhibit the inflammatory response in these rats was significantly less than that in zzso The data raises the possibility that the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso on the inflammatory response might reflect a role for zzso in modulating zzso to zzso
