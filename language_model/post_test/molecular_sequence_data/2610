The very limited development of zzso agents targeting protein synthesis stems in part from the belief that zzso and host zzso are sufficiently similar to zzso selective zzso However, recent studies have revealed that zzso zzso zzso has an unusual size and zzso consequently, this zzso and its homogeneous zzso provide a useful model for the development of protein synthesis zzso with zzso zzso In this study, I determined the sequence and secondary structure of the 3' end of the zzso zzso the target for zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of these 140 zzso includes two blocks of sequence highly zzso among other zzso the remaining zzso although not zzso can be folded into a secondary structure common to all zzso The presence of zzso within one of the zzso blocks predicts zzso zzso Also, a specific base pair zzso implicated in zzso zzso is zzso whereas all zzso have this base pair, it is absent in many zzso (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance can be predicted from substitution of zzso with zzso A growth zzso zzso was used to test the zzso of zzso zzso to a variety of zzso After 48 zzso 8 of 11 zzso tested failed to inhibit growth at a concentration of 200 zzso zzso and zzso however, inhibited growth of three strains tested by 50% at 50 to 60 zzso and by close to zzso at 120 zzso These results correlate well with the sequence and zzso zzso zzso may be clinically useful when the toxicity of standard zzso drugs is of zzso
