We present a method to determine the location and extent of protein binding regions in zzso acids by zzso analysis of sequence zzso The program zzso establishes a library of consensus descriptions based on sequence sets containing known regulatory zzso These defined consensus descriptions are used by the program zzso to predict binding sites in new zzso We show the programs to correctly determine the significant regions involved in zzso control of seven sequence zzso The internal profile of relative zzso of individual zzso positions within these regions paralleled experimental profiles of biological zzso Consensus descriptions are determined by employing an anchored alignment zzso the results of which are then evaluated by a novel method which is superior to cluster zzso The alignment procedure is able to include several closely related sequences without zzso the consensus zzso Moreover, the zzso detects additional elements on the basis of a moderate distance correlation and is capable of discriminating between real binding sites and false positive zzso The software is well suited to cope with the frequent phenomenon of optional elements present in a subset of functionally similar zzso while taking zzso advantage of the existing sequence data zzso Since it requires only a minimum of seven sequences for a single element, it is zzso to a wide range of binding zzso
