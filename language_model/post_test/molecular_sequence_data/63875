Gene targeting is a precise manipulation of zzso gene by introduction of zzso DNA and has contributed greatly to the zzso of gene zzso Conventional gene targeting has been achieved through a use of embryonic stem zzso However, such procedure is often long, zzso and zzso This study was carried out to develop a simple procedure of gene targeting using zzso coli zzso A zzso and modified zzso zzso The new procedure was attempted to modify zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in mouse zzso The zzso zzso to target an zzso 3 of zzso was 74 bases in length including zzso linkages at each zzso to be resistant against zzso when introduced into zzso The zzso sequence was zzso to the target gene except a single zzso that zzso a mismatch between an introduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso repairing of such mismatch would give rise to the conversion of zzso to zzso stop zzso thereby losing the function of the target zzso Before an introduction into zzso zzso zzso were bound to zzso to enhance the zzso zzso The zzso complex was zzso into the zzso of zzso Individual zzso zzso developed to the zzso stage were analyzed for the expected zzso conversion using zzso chain reaction zzso and subsequent zzso The conversion of zzso to zzso stop zzso was detected in three zzso among 48 tested zzso zzso in zzso The result suggests that the gene targeting was feasible by relatively easier and direct zzso
