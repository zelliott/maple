zzso was isolated by an zzso approach intended to identify specific proteins present in the different pea zzso zzso zzso floral zzso and the genes zzso zzso Following this strategy we obtained a zzso zzso zzso that specifically recognized a zzso protein zzso only detected in zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso showed that zzso is expressed specifically in the zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the specific expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and middle layer cells during the different stages of zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso gene isolated from zzso The absence of a zzso pea transformation method together with the fact that no zzso zzso gene exists in zzso prevented us from carrying out zzso functional zzso However, we designed functional studies with the zzso promoter in different zzso species, as the specific spatial and zzso expression pattern of zzso suggested, among other things, the possibility of using its promoter region for zzso zzso Using different zzso to drive the zzso zzso gene controlled by the zzso isolated promoter sequence we have proven that the zzso promoter is fully functional in the zzso of transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence in the zzso region of the promoter sequence of three putative zzso boxes also suggests that zzso could be a target gene of zzso proteins and that, zzso it would be activated by genes controlling floral organ zzso
