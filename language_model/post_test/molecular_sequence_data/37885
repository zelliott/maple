A previously published method for the analysis of zzso zzso by high pH zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1994), zzso zzso has been modified and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso up to zzso in size and zzso zzso up to zzso For zzso zzso chain length controls zzso zzso however, for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso times primarily depend upon the level of zzso although chain length and hence charge density plays a zzso The zzso position of zzso zzso within an zzso is also important in determining its zzso zzso Compared to zzso a reducing terminal zzso zzso zzso however, when present on an internal zzso zzso it is the zzso containing zzso which zzso zzso These effects allow discrimination between zzso differing only in the position of zzso zzso Using this simple methodology, a zzso zzso zzso column with zzso zzso and detection by zzso at 232 zzso a quantitative zzso fingerprint of a zzso zzso chain may be zzso allowing a determination of the abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along with an analysis of structural features with a linear response to approximately zzso zzso The method may readily be zzso using either commercial zzso or the zzso and zzso products of a limit digest of commercial zzso zzso by zzso ABC zzso zzso available and freshly prepared zzso zzso zzso and human cartilage zzso zzso have been examined by this methodology and we have confirmed that freshly isolated shark cartilage zzso contains significant amounts of the biologically important zzso zzso
