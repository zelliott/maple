zzso familial zzso convulsions zzso is an zzso disorder caused by dominant zzso in the genes zzso and zzso zzso the zzso channels zzso and zzso We identified two novel zzso zzso in two zzso zzso One zzso predicted a truncated protein zzso that lacks the channel's pore region, the other resulted in the zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso segment of zzso In comparison to zzso zzso zzso functional analysis of zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso revealed a significant positive shift and increased slope of the zzso curve leading to significant current reduction in the zzso range of an action potential zzso reduction at zzso zzso Our results establish an important role of the zzso zzso segment in zzso channel gating and demonstrate in a human disease that zzso zzso are likely to represent the zzso relevant range for this zzso channel to regulate zzso zzso
