We explore the possible mechanism by which association rates of zzso with activated B cells influences the ability of the latter to selectively recruit zzso zzso Our system used zzso of zzso B and T cells, where the zzso was a synthetic zzso zzso zzso was with either zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso zzso has been previously shown to display a higher on rate, relative to the zzso zzso zzso of binding to zzso B zzso This difference in on rates was eventually exerted at the level of zzso but not of zzso induction from T cells, with zzso zzso proving more zzso However, various treatment regimens rendered zzso zzso as potent as zzso zzso at zzso zzso responses from the above zzso This included simultaneous treatment of B cells with zzso zzso and the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of B cells with a zzso representing only the B cell zzso constituent of zzso zzso zzso was also equally zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso production from activated T cells resulted from an engagement of zzso by zzso on the B cell zzso Finally, the extent of cell surface zzso zzso on activated B cells was dependent on the on rate of zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso Thus, cumulative results suggest that the zzso of zzso binding to activated B cells can zzso regulate zzso zzso This influences selective zzso zzso zzso with its zzso effects on relative zzso subset zzso
