The identification of fur origins from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not yet complete, although zzso identification is essential for the zzso context of his zzso Neither have all potential samples been identified so far, nor there has a consensus been reached on the species identified using the classical zzso zzso hair often lacks zzso hair scale patterns in microscopic analyses and zzso chain reaction zzso techniques are often zzso due to the lack of zzso ancient zzso To overcome these zzso a zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso method was used exclusively based on hair zzso Thirteen fur specimens from his zzso were analyzed after zzso digest of native zzso zzso mass fingerprints zzso from ancient samples and from reference species mostly occurring in the Alpine surroundings at his lifetime were compared to each other using zzso zzso and zzso zzso cluster tree zzso Both statistical methods highly reflect spectral similarities among zzso as close zzso zzso While zzso zzso was useful to discriminate specimens on the zzso order level, zzso zzso cluster tree reached the family or zzso zzso Additionally, the presence and/or absence of order, family and/or zzso diagnostic masses in their zzso allowed the identification of zzso mostly down to single species zzso Red deer was found in his shoe zzso goat in the zzso cattle in his shoe sole and at his zzso closing zzso as well as sheep and zzso in his zzso zzso species, like zzso zzso domestic dog or European red zzso were discovered in his leggings for the first time, but could not be differentiated to species zzso This is widening the spectrum of processed zzso species to at least one member of the zzso zzso His fur cap was allocated to a zzso species, but differentiation between brown bear and a zzso species could not be made with zzso
