A zzso corresponding to the entire zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso peptides were prepared by the conventional solution method and their heavy zzso properties were zzso The zzso or zzso activities of various peptides were not greatly dependent on the zzso structure, so far as zzso although the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited slightly higher binding activity than the other zzso On the contrary, the zzso activities of these peptides were fairly zzso
