We report that zzso which form zzso hairpin structures and which have zzso zzso can form strong complexes with complementary zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso were constructed with a zzso zzso loop and with variable zzso zzso The complexes of these zzso with the sequence zzso were studied by zzso zzso Evidence is presented that the complexes are zzso zzso complexes in which the zzso loop bases comprise the outer strands in a zzso zzso in effect zzso the zzso strand in the center of the zzso Melting temperatures for the loop complexes are shown to be up to 29 degrees C higher than zzso duplex of the same zzso It is shown that the presence of a stem increases stability of the triplex relative to an analogous zzso without a zzso The effect of stem length on the stability of such a complex is zzso Such hairpin zzso represent a new approach to the zzso binding of zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the finding raises the possibility that such a complex may exist in natural zzso folded zzso
