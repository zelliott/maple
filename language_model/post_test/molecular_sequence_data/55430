Nuclear zzso an essential cellular process of zzso cells, plays critical roles in differentiation , development, as well as viral disease and zzso making the small molecules that target this process very intriguing not only in fundamental research but also in disease zzso However, only one compound, zzso B, is commercially available to inhibit nuclear zzso zzso it will be a great advantage to establish an zzso that targets the whole nuclear transport zzso for screening and obtaining small zzso that regulates nuclear zzso In this study, we established an efficient nuclear transport zzso based on the zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso We constructed zzso and zzso making them locate in zzso and nucleus zzso Their distribution will be changed when nuclear transport is zzso resulting in zzso of zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso of fluorescent zzso The zzso effect of zzso B on nuclear transport can be sensitively detected by zzso report system, providing an efficient zzso for zzso screening of small zzso against nuclear zzso
