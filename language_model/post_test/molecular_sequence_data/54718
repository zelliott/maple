The zzso anchor for zzso zzso zzso protein is a binding partner for zzso that plays an important role in the zzso promoting signaling zzso initiated by transforming growth zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of SARA comprises the zzso domain zzso By direct interaction through the zzso SARA zzso zzso zzso and blocks the interaction between zzso and zzso thereby zzso the process of zzso In this study, we constructed a SARA zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso The zzso SARA zzso fused with a protein zzso domain zzso was zzso zzso from zzso coli, and characterized for the first zzso The full-length zzso coding zzso created with zzso coli favored zzso was cloned into a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was transformed into an zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso induction and zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso was further identified by zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso was transferred into the zzso and nucleus more efficiently than zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was found to zzso the level of zzso and zzso the levels of zzso and zzso more efficiently than SARA zzso zzso zzso Our work explored a method to obtain zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein could enter zzso cells (an immortalized zzso zzso zzso cell line) more efficiently than the SARA protein and reverse the zzso zzso zzso process that was induced by zzso more effectively than the SARA zzso zzso zzso is likely to be a potential candidate for clinical prevention and treatment of zzso zzso
