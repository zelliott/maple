zzso in the gene zzso the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso have been shown previously to cause zzso zzso dystrophy, an zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso irregularities in zzso zzso To assess the involvement of zzso in a variety of other zzso zzso the authors have screened this gene for zzso zzso in age-related zzso zzso zzso adult zzso zzso zzso zzso central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dystrophy, and a group with unspecified zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis of the entire coding region was performed using the zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso the five zzso of the zzso gene as well as the putative zzso region and a highly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The authors analyzed a total of 217 patients, including 143 patients with zzso 28 patients with zzso 21 patients with zzso and 25 patients with other forms of zzso zzso 

In the 217 patients zzso the authors have identified one sequence zzso (a zzso base zzso in the zzso region in a patient with zzso However, the functional consequences of this zzso are not zzso No other zzso zzso were zzso The authors have characterized a frequent zzso zzso in zzso 3 of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso that will be useful for genetic linkage or zzso sharing analyses or zzso 

The zzso results suggest that zzso is not a major factor in the cause of zzso zzso and zzso Thus far, zzso zzso zzso appears to be the only zzso known to be associated with zzso in zzso
