While previous studies with truncated zzso receptors zzso have suggested that the zzso zzso of the zzso does not play a role in zzso zzso we have found, using a more zzso full length zzso zzso designated zzso in which all eight of the zzso zzso have been zzso with zzso zzso that zzso cells require substantially more zzso than zzso cells in order to zzso as zzso A comparison of zzso proliferation with zzso zzso zzso patterns, using zzso and zzso zzso cells, revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated directly with zzso Moreover, studies with a zzso zzso point zzso and various zzso deletion zzso revealed that both zzso proliferation and zzso zzso were zzso primarily through zzso but that other zzso within the zzso could activate zzso in its zzso
