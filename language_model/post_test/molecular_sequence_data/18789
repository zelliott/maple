The zzso is a geographically widespread zzso of African zzso monkeys whose evolutionary history is of particular interest to zzso The zzso relationships among arboreal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso remain zzso zzso zzso analyses have revealed marked gene tree zzso for these zzso and several recent zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso have supported different zzso zzso To address this issue, we investigated the zzso of the zzso group using zzso methods, as well as alternative methods that incorporate gene tree zzso to estimate a zzso zzso Our compiled DNA sequence zzso was zzso pairs long and included 57 independent zzso All analyses of zzso alignments strongly supported a zzso zzso and a zzso position for zzso The zzso zzso analysis supported the same zzso A zzso zzso method resulted in a very poorly resolved species zzso The zzso agreement between zzso and the zzso zzso analysis offers considerable support for a zzso zzso as the dominant relationship across the zzso However, the results of the zzso zzso analysis indicate that almost half the zzso has an alternative zzso As such, our results offer a zzso zzso hypothesis for the zzso zzso while at the same time providing evidence for a complex evolutionary history that likely includes zzso among zzso
