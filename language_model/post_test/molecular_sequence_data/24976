zzso develops when a zzso drug is introduced into the zzso of normal mice, but the relevance of this model to the human disorder is unclear in part because it is widely assumed that the zzso is zzso in the zzso We compared zzso function in 10 patients with symptomatic zzso lupus to that in 13 zzso patients who only developed drug-induced zzso T cell output from the zzso was zzso using a competitive zzso chain reaction that detects T cell zzso DNA zzso circles in peripheral blood zzso Despite the advanced age of the patient population under study, newly generated T cells were detected in all zzso Although there was no overall quantitative difference between the symptomatic and zzso patients, we found a positive correlation between the level of T cell zzso zzso circles in peripheral zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso activity in patients with drug-induced zzso The association between zzso and nascent peripheral T cells supports the requirement for T cells in zzso zzso Our observations are consistent with findings in mice in which zzso T cells derived from drug-induced abnormalities in T cell development in the zzso
