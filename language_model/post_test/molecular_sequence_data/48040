We have previously reported a transcript of the novel gene for human zzso zzso containing zzso repeat zzso By additional screening of a human zzso zzso library, we isolated another type of transcript with a zzso zzso different from that of the previously reported zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene revealed that these two types of zzso zzso and zzso originated from the same gene but are composed of different first zzso Because the entire open reading frame is contained in the second zzso these two transcripts produce the same zzso zzso hybrid mapping linked the zzso gene to zzso which is in the critical region of zzso syndrome type 4 zzso on zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene in five zzso patients, however, showed no zzso although a few zzso changes were zzso Cloning of the mouse zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the predicted protein consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso of which are identical to those of zzso The zzso gene was expressed in various mouse zzso including zzso in which zzso zzso was detected in the zzso cell layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the inner segment of the zzso
