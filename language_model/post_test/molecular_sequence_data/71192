In this study, we have further delineated the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that contribute to the zzso zzso binding zzso Taking an zzso approach, we have constructed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressed them in zzso cells, and determined the binding of the zzso site zzso zzso zzso acids zzso were sufficient to form a zzso binding site with affinities for zzso and zzso that were not significantly different from zzso zzso More extensive zzso from either the zzso or the zzso end, resulted in loss of zzso zzso Additional zzso were made starting from zzso acids zzso of zzso replacing the zzso zzso domain with intervening zzso sequences while retaining the zzso domain so as to anchor the zzso to the zzso Although robust amounts of zzso were zzso by zzso cells, only low levels of zzso binding sites could be zzso This suggests that only a small proportion of the zzso zzso folds in the appropriate manner so as to form a zzso binding zzso These data indicate that although it is possible to reduce the zzso binding site to minimal so-called zzso and zzso zzso efficient folding of the zzso so as to form a zzso binding site may require sequences within the zzso zzso
