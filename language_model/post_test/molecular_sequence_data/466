Alternative zzso zzso may provide unique opportunities to identify drug targets and zzso We identified an alternative spliced transcript for zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso This transcript is present in failing human hearts and is reduced following mechanical zzso The zzso transcript would generate a unique 34 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso while maintaining the remaining structure of native zzso We generated zzso to this zzso zzso and identified zzso in failing human heart zzso The alternatively spliced zzso zzso was zzso and unlike zzso failed to stimulate zzso in vascular cells or zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may lack the zzso effects of zzso zzso Given structural considerations, a zzso truncated form of zzso was generated zzso and was determined to retain the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso in canine zzso zzso and cultured human zzso cells but lacked similar effects in vascular zzso In a zzso model of heart failure, systemic infusion of zzso did not alter mean zzso pressure but increased the zzso zzso rate zzso suppressed plasma zzso and zzso while inducing zzso and zzso zzso with its distinct in zzso effects, the activity of zzso may not be explained through binding and zzso of zzso or zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso associated with heart failure while lacking the zzso properties of zzso These findings demonstrate that peptides with unique properties may be designed based on products of alternatively zzso
