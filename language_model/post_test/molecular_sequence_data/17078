Despite extensive study of human zzso type 5 zzso surprisingly little is known about the zzso proteins of other zzso We report here a comprehensive analysis of the sequences of 34 zzso zzso These represent all six zzso zzso zzso and include all human representatives of zzso A, C, zzso and zzso eight from zzso B, nine from zzso D, and seven zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed that many, but not all, functional zzso identified in human zzso type 5 zzso are recognizably present in the other zzso zzso zzso we identified highly zzso sequences without known activities or binding partners, suggesting that previously zzso zzso of zzso function remain to be zzso Overall, our analysis forms a solid foundation for future study of the activities and features of the zzso proteins of different zzso and identifies new avenues for investigating zzso zzso
