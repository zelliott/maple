zzso zzso or zzso is the major zzso of septic zzso a serious complication of zzso bacterial infections in zzso zzso that bind zzso and neutralize its biological effects or enhance its clearance could have important clinical zzso zzso zzso factor zzso binds zzso zzso and, in animal models, reduces mortality when administered before or after zzso challenge or bacterial zzso Here we present the high resolution structure of a zzso zzso It has a single domain consisting of three zzso packed against a zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a striking charge distribution and zzso that suggest how it can insert into zzso The binding site for zzso probably involves an extended zzso loop, and we propose that two zzso zzso proteins will have a similar zzso The zzso loop structure may be used in the design of molecules with therapeutic properties against septic zzso
