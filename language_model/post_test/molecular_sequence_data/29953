zzso zzso zzso zzso is a regulatory zzso of 28 zzso acids involved in a wide variety of zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso zzso related to the rat zzso we have isolated and characterized the gene zzso the rat zzso zzso and compared it to the human zzso zzso The rat zzso gene spanned zzso base pairs, and contained 7 zzso interrupted by 6 zzso zzso identity was found between the gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in sizes of zzso 2, 4 and 5 (shorter in the rat zzso are the reason for the shorter rat gene compared with the human gene of zzso base zzso zzso of the genes in the two species showed a high zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso 2, 4, 5, 6 and zzso in zzso 1 and zzso In addition, the zzso junctions shared high identity between the zzso The rat untranslated zzso 1 had little zzso zzso with human zzso 1 and was 13 base pairs zzso Interestingly, the 160 base pairs at the zzso region upstream of the zzso share more than zzso identity between the two zzso including the exact position of zzso in positions zzso zzso zzso a zzso element in position zzso and a zzso sequence in position zzso The conservation of the zzso region of the zzso gene in parallel with the conservation of its coding zzso emphasize the importance of these sequences during zzso
