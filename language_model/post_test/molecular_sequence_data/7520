A hybrid gene named zzso coding three protective zzso zzso of zzso zzso and two zzso T cell zzso zzso was designed and zzso A zzso hybrid gene named zzso was also zzso The two genes were cloned into expression zzso zzso and the hybrid fusion proteins containing zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso The molecular weights of the fusion proteins were zzso and zzso zzso The expression rate was about zzso of total bacterial zzso The fusion protein could react specifically with mouse and rabbit zzso against zzso of zzso zzso The rabbit immune serum against the zzso fusion protein could specifically recognize the zzso of zzso zzso and effectively inhibit the in zzso development of the zzso The zzso capacity of the immune zzso to zzso invasion was enhanced as the amount of the zzso increased and the incubation time of the zzso with the zzso was zzso After zzso incubation at zzso concentration with the zzso the serum suppressed the zzso of zzso to a level of zzso and caused zzso and death of the zzso The results indicated that the zzso hybrid zzso of zzso zzso has zzso activity and zzso It is probably a candidate malaria zzso
