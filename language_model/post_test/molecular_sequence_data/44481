To study the effect proteins have on the zzso and evolution of zzso zzso we simulated evolution of zzso P zzso zzso zzso in zzso in the presence and absence of its zzso protein zzso In the presence of zzso functional zzso sequence zzso (not zzso active in the absence of zzso were selected in addition to those identical to zzso zzso maintains the zzso active structure of the zzso and allows for an enhanced spectrum of zzso molecules to function in the context of a zzso zzso zzso The generation of an zzso zzso requiring both zzso and protein zzso from a zzso active zzso zzso has implications for how modern zzso complexes evolved from ancestral zzso
