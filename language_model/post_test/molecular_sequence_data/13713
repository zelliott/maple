In the present study, we have isolated the zzso for the mouse zzso zzso zzso by screening the mouse zzso zzso library with the bovine zzso zzso zzso probe and by the zzso rapid amplification of the zzso end zzso The total length of zzso was determined to be zzso base pairs zzso by sequence zzso The coding region contained zzso zzso translating to zzso zzso zzso Based on comparisons with the zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso it was zzso that the derived zzso acid sequence contained a signal zzso region of 21 zzso acids and a mature zzso zzso zzso region of 700 zzso acids zzso zzso It was also zzso that the mature zzso contained three potential zzso zzso sites and 24 possible zzso zzso sites, and had the unique zzso repeat sequence (21 zzso within the predicted sequence in the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of a portion of zzso was highly zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also observed with two zzso zzso proteins that were reported as a zzso member of a zzso protein zzso Northern zzso zzso with a zzso probe indicated that a single message of zzso zzso was present in total zzso prepared from zzso zzso In zzso zzso using zzso showed that a zzso message was only detected in the zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that a significant degree of zzso exists among zzso zzso of various zzso zzso
