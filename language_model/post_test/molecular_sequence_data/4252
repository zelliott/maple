zzso zzso tagging was used to generate four zzso zzso tobacco cell zzso Plants zzso from the zzso lines displayed similar zzso reduced zzso dominance, poorly developed roots, delayed growth and zzso and male and female zzso zzso culture experiments demonstrated that the zzso in the different lines zzso cell proliferation from the effects of both zzso and zzso No significant increase of zzso or zzso was found in transgenic zzso in comparison with zzso zzso The functional plant sequence zzso in one of the zzso lines, zzso was used to isolate an active zzso zzso that was able to trigger zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis shows that the transcript corresponding to zzso accumulates to high levels in the zzso zzso shortly before the onset of cell division, and that these levels decrease when zzso reach maximum rates of cell zzso A small putative open reading frame, starting with the first zzso in zzso and zzso a 22 zzso acid zzso has the same activity in tobacco zzso as the whole zzso This activity is destroyed by a frame shift zzso Apparently zzso encodes a zzso which zzso in the events downstream of a joint point of zzso and zzso action leading to cell zzso
