At least three types of zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso namely zzso and alpha zzso are identified in different zzso Only two of them alpha and zzso have well known structural and zzso zzso Here we present zzso data indicating that the alpha 3 protein really exists in pig and human zzso and human zzso Crude membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso with alpha zzso zzso raised against the synthetic zzso corresponding to the unique sequence of this zzso The mature alpha zzso is shown to include the sequence zzso followed by the initiating zzso zzso zzso collecting zzso are proposed to specifically contain zzso alpha zzso
