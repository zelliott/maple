zzso liver zzso cells zzso are zzso zzso cells that readily emerge in primary culture and can be established as cell lines, but their in zzso zzso of origin is zzso We reported recently some evidence indicating that the zzso line, zzso contains two zzso zzso equivalent to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells also contain zzso assembled as a network of intermediate filaments distinct from that of the zzso In the present study, we examined the expression of zzso gene in various zzso preparations and a zzso rat skin zzso zzso and then assessed its usefulness as an zzso specific marker in the zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses with zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed that rat zzso express zzso and zzso genes only, whereas zzso cells express zzso zzso and zzso genes in the absence of zzso zzso was also present in zzso derived as primary from zzso 12 rat liver and secondary cultures from 4-day-old rat zzso zzso cultures of oval cells isolated from zzso zzso treated rat liver (an enriched source of zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso which were slightly shorter than those in zzso The analyses of zzso (the usual partner of zzso gene expression using specific zzso and zzso clearly demonstrated its absence in zzso In zzso double zzso analyses by laser scanning zzso zzso showed that zzso was not present in zzso zzso zzso and was expressed in some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were also found in the zzso zzso However, zzso cells of the portal region were zzso negative, whereas those of the zzso capsule were zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso gene expression is part of the differentiation program of two types of zzso and that this differential zzso gene expression can be used as a new means to type zzso in culture and in zzso
