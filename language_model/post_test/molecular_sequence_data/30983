zzso trees of two different zzso gene products were constructed by using the progressive alignment zzso The reverse zzso domain and the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso domain of at least one member of each of the established zzso zzso or groups, were separately zzso The resulting zzso tree of the reverse zzso was compared to that of the zzso zzso The similarities and differences are discussed with respect to the genetic events that occurred during the evolution of zzso A segment of the central part of the viral zzso protein sequence was found to have zzso to 37% zzso with some members of the zzso zzso
