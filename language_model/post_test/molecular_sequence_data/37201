zzso zzso derivatives zzso at the C2 position with an zzso chain are endowed with high affinity for zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso while being less active at the low affinity zzso zzso On the other hand, the introduction of an zzso chain at the zzso position of zzso is zzso for the affinity and potency at zzso zzso and zzso zzso while is more tolerated by the zzso zzso The evaluation of the stimulation of zzso binding revealed that zzso behave as zzso receptors zzso while, on the contrary, zzso behave as zzso With this work we demonstrated, by means of an zzso and a zzso zzso analysis, that zzso differently from zzso cannot adopt the zzso anti zzso required for zzso zzso zzso using the recently reported X-ray crystal structure of bovine zzso as template, we built a zzso model of the seven zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso After identification of the binding site we carried out zzso experiments, demonstrating that the two class of molecules have different binding modes that explain their different degree of affinity and the shift of their activity from zzso to zzso
