zzso 1, a likely mouse zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso has been cloned and its expression pattern analyzed during zzso In zzso zzso is expressed in the developing zzso zzso cone cells of the eye, and zzso In the zzso zzso 1 is expressed in many of the same zzso young zzso of the zzso region of the zzso developing eye lens and zzso zzso is also detected in the developing liver and heart, as well as zzso in the skeletal zzso The similarities in protein sequence and expression patterns between the mouse and fly zzso genes suggest that zzso 1 may play, among others, a fundamental role in early development of the zzso zzso
