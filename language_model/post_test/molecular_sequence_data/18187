zzso DNA zzso from 36 wild species of the zzso zzso has been zzso with three restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso III and zzso zzso Out of the 71 restriction sites described on the reference zzso zzso zzso three zzso and seven site modifications were detected during the survey of the other zzso Since restriction mapping showed only a very limited fraction of the DNA zzso we chose to adapt the zzso zzso mapping technique to detect fine variations between zzso zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso obtained between sunflower and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and the resulting zzso were detected by classical zzso restriction and zzso zzso The zzso zzso mapping results were confirmed by sequencing one zzso zzso region detected between cultivated sunflower and two perennial zzso zzso As a result of these zzso it appeared that the combination of restriction mapping and zzso zzso mapping might be helpful to differentiate zzso close zzso
