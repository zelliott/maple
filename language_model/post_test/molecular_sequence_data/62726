A full-length zzso sequence coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a sheep strain zzso zzso library by zzso using a pool of zzso from mice infected with zzso zzso expressed as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso zzso activity that protected zzso DNA from damage by zzso zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, the suggested zzso role for zzso was reinforced in an in zzso zzso zzso its expression in zzso bacterial cells markedly increased the tolerance and survival of the cells to high zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso was specifically expressed in all zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Higher intensity of zzso was detected in many, but not all, zzso zzso cells in zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein was used to screen zzso from heavily infected mice and patients with confirmed zzso zzso Only a portion of the zzso reacted positively with the zzso fusion protein in Western zzso suggesting that zzso may form zzso complexes or that responses to the zzso zzso may be zzso zzso zzso zzso may prove useful for the screening of specific zzso that could serve as new drugs for treatment of zzso zzso Moreover, given that zzso from different zzso zzso were zzso distant from host zzso zzso the development of zzso zzso zzso that do not react with host zzso might be zzso
