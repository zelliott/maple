zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso have usually been large plasmids with only one or a small number of sites that are suitable for cloning and zzso We report here the construction and properties of a series of 12 expression zzso with multiple (four to zzso unique sites in their zzso which allow directional cloning and expression of DNA sequences under four different zzso Eleven of these plasmids replicate at high copy number in zzso coli, and all have the zzso zzso zzso and the 2 zzso origin including zzso zzso allowing selection and high copy number replication in zzso Six of the plasmids are designed for the construction and selection and high copy number replication in zzso Six of the plasmids are designed for the construction and selection of zzso libraries from various zzso organisms, allowing directional cloning and expression of zzso All of these six have similar zzso containing a unique promoter zzso zzso site and a unique promoter zzso zzso site, allowing for directional cloning and expression of zzso zzso zzso that complement a wide variety of zzso zzso can be selected from libraries constructed in this zzso The four alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were compared for their relative activity, both in zzso coli and in zzso All zzso promoters showed substantial activity in zzso coli with zzso showing the highest zzso zzso also was zzso in zzso showing very high relative activity under zzso zzso zzso selected by genetic zzso from libraries constructed in these zzso should be easily zzso into other zzso allowing expression in different zzso organisms, DNA sequencing or zzso zzso
