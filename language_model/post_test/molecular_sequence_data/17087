We investigated the effects of zzso chemicals zzso on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and brain of the Japanese common zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso 220 zzso acid zzso zzso with zzso overall sequence identity with human and mouse zzso A competitive zzso zzso was used to zzso the levels of zzso zzso in the zzso and brain of male zzso after exposure to zzso A, zzso or zzso for 3 zzso Exposure to zzso at a nominal concentration of 100 zzso induced significant increase in zzso zzso levels in both zzso and brain zzso whereas exposure to zzso induced a significant decrease in zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can either positively or zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso
