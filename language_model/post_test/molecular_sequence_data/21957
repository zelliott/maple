Human zzso zzso zzso uses zzso zzso to zzso several clinically important zzso in addition to its natural zzso Although zzso is the preferred zzso donor for this reaction, our previous studies reported zzso structures solely containing zzso in the zzso donor binding zzso To determine the molecular basis of the zzso observed zzso donor zzso we solved crystal structures of a zzso zzso lacking a flexible insert zzso zzso but having similar zzso properties as wild type, in complex with zzso zzso and zzso and in the presence of zzso but the absence of zzso or zzso These structures reveal major changes in the donor base binding loop zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso forms, involving significant zzso zzso This loop is zzso in the zzso structure, which lacks a zzso at the zzso donor zzso In comparison with the zzso form, in the presence of zzso this loop is shifted inward to make closer contact to the smaller zzso zzso These structures illuminate the zzso donor binding and preference mechanisms of zzso
