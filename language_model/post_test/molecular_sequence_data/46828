zzso screens have been widely used in recent years for identifying and zzso new interaction partners to known zzso Current zzso zzso screens employ mostly bait and library zzso which both have the zzso gene as a selection marker in zzso The isolation of the library plasmids takes several days, because library and bait zzso cannot be separated zzso We have replaced the zzso gene by a zzso gene in a zzso DNA binding domain bait zzso This zzso reduces zzso to fivefold the time period required for the isolation of library zzso zzso In addition we have changed the zzso site in the modified zzso for easy cloning of zzso zzso This zzso is advantageous not only in standard zzso screens, but also in mass screens that require multiple screening rounds in order to characterize networks of zzso zzso
