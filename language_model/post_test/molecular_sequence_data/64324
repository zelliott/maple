On the basis of data from zzso and zzso characterization and analysis of zzso zzso gene zzso two novel species belonging to the zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso strain isolated from a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is zzso by means of a single zzso zzso and was isolated from sea grass zzso zzso are marine, zzso zzso zzso zzso Both strains have the ability to degrade zzso but not zzso zzso zzso DNA, zzso 80 or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and grew at zzso zzso of zzso % and temperatures of zzso degrees C, whereas strain zzso zzso grew in zzso % zzso and at temperatures of zzso degrees zzso The zzso fatty acid was 18 : zzso amounting to up to 80 % of the total fatty zzso The other characteristic feature was the presence of 18 : 2 zzso The DNA zzso contents of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were respectively zzso and zzso zzso The level of DNA similarity between the two strains was 33 zzso DNA from zzso zzso and zzso zzso had zzso values of zzso % and zzso zzso respectively, with DNA from the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed that strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent two novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
