zzso is a zzso zzso member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso In helper and zzso T cells it is physically associated with the zzso and zzso surface zzso and appears to play a role in signal zzso during zzso zzso zzso contains both an zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso Such zzso have been suggested to play a role in the regulation of the activity or function of both zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of either or both zzso in zzso was found here to activate the protein and to lead to increased zzso of the zzso site, zzso in zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that these zzso participate in repression of the zzso activity of zzso None of the deleted forms was capable of transformation of zzso zzso of the zzso domain of a zzso activated form of zzso zzso did not diminish the transforming activity of this zzso This suggests that this domain is zzso for the transformation of zzso by zzso In contrast, deletion of the zzso domain abolished the transforming potential of activated zzso However, interpretation of this effect is made somewhat difficult because the zzso also lowered the zzso abundance of the zzso
