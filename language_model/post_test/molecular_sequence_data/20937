zzso zzso is one of the most salt tolerant species of zzso and has become a model zzso for the study of tolerance mechanisms against zzso The goal of this study was to identify key zzso genes that are involved in its adaptation to high zzso 

By using forward zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso zzso from zzso zzso that is significantly zzso during zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene family, which zzso the reduction of zzso at the expense of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has zzso zzso of zzso and contains a 516 zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a deduced protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that belongs to the zzso of the zzso type zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso share a common ancestry but show divergent zzso Silence of its expression in zzso zzso by zzso resulted in decreased tolerance to salt whereas zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a higher tolerance with a reduced level of zzso oxygen zzso 

In conclusion, for the first time our study has identified zzso zzso zzso as a key protein involved in the salt tolerance of the extremely zzso zzso zzso Apparently, this zzso plays a zzso role in the zzso adaptation to zzso it serves as a zzso in scavenging zzso oxygen species, as a molecular zzso in protecting essential proteins from zzso and as a zzso sensor in regulating zzso cell defense zzso
