zzso are a class of zzso with widely reported zzso and zzso zzso However, knowledge of their activity at a molecular level is zzso The objective of this study was to identify biological targets of zzso zzso zzso using an affinity zzso zzso An analogue of zzso was zzso to enable zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso was the major protein captured from cell zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso showed that zzso zzso modified the zzso zzso zzso of zzso This resulted in complete loss of zzso zzso activity and disruption of protein zzso as determined by impaired recognition by a zzso zzso directed to the region that receptors and interacting proteins bind to zzso The zzso change was supported by in zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to plasma zzso was disrupted in humans consuming zzso a major dietary source of zzso The zzso have significant potential for development as zzso zzso and this activity may contribute to the biological properties of these zzso
