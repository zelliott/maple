zzso plasticity has been suggested to facilitate zzso diversity, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship are little zzso We analyzed a feeding zzso in zzso zzso zzso one of two alternative adult mouth forms is executed after an irreversible zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso with functional tests in zzso divergent populations and species, we identified a regulator of zzso zzso that acts in a zzso zzso zzso zzso eliminate one mouth form, whereas zzso of zzso fixes zzso zzso is a zzso that acts dosage zzso is necessary and sufficient to control the sexual zzso of feeding forms, and has a zzso function in zzso zzso It is zzso to known signaling zzso and results from zzso gene zzso zzso thus zzso a zzso switch for zzso plasticity in the adult stage, showing that regulatory pathways can evolve by terminal addition of new zzso
