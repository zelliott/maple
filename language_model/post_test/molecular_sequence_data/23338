An zzso protein with strong zzso at zzso zzso was zzso from zzso culture fluid of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso This protein was identical to the gene product of a recently characterized gene cloned from zzso zzso as revealed by determination of zzso values and sequencing of selected isolated peptides obtained after zzso fingerprint zzso The zzso protein zzso both natural rubber latex and zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso of the double bonds of zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified and unequivocally characterized as the major zzso product, and there was a zzso series of minor zzso that differed from the major degradation product only in the number of repetitive zzso units between terminal functions, zzso An in zzso zzso zzso for zzso rubber degradation was developed based on zzso liquid zzso analysis and zzso detection of product zzso functions after zzso with zzso zzso zzso of rubber by the zzso protein was strictly dependent on the presence of zzso it did not require addition of any soluble zzso or metal zzso and was optimal around pH zzso at 40 degrees zzso zzso monoxide and cyanide inhibited the zzso addition of zzso had no effect, and zzso activity could not be zzso The zzso protein was specific for natural rubber latex and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the cloned gene zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of two zzso motifs zzso for zzso attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso analysis confirmed the presence of zzso and approximately 2 zzso of zzso per zzso of zzso was zzso
