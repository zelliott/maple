Engineering zzso to degrade anthropogenic compounds efficiently is zzso We obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with up to zzso higher activity than wild type toward the toxic, recalcitrant anthropogenic compound zzso zzso using a new zzso We identified key zzso in access tunnels connecting the buried active site with bulk zzso by rational design and zzso them by directed zzso The most active zzso has large aromatic zzso at two out of three zzso positions and two positions modified by zzso zzso These changes apparently enhance activity with zzso by decreasing accessibility of the active site for water zzso thereby promoting activated complex zzso zzso analyses confirmed that the zzso improved zzso bond zzso and shifted the zzso step to the release of zzso Engineering access tunnels by combining zzso protein design with directed evolution may be a valuable strategy for refining zzso properties of zzso with buried active zzso
