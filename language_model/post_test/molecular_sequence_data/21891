Thirteen bacterial zzso from root zzso of soybean grown in zzso zzso in the Chinese province of zzso were identified as a unique group in the zzso zzso based upon zzso patterns, sequencing analyses of zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso positive tests for acid production and negative results for reduction in zzso milk and sensitivity to 50 zzso zzso zzso as well as some other features, could differentiate the novel group from defined species of the zzso zzso The novel group had symbiotic gene sequences zzso and zzso that were identical or very similar to those of zzso zzso zzso and formed effective zzso with zzso max zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based upon the consensus of these zzso a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso
