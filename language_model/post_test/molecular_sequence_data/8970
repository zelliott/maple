By using four labels of the zzso family displaying selective sensitivity to hydrogen bond zzso donors and poor response to other polar zzso we developed an approach for measuring local water concentration zzso (or partial volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the label surrounding both in zzso zzso and in zzso by the intensity ratio of two zzso forms of the label, zzso Using a series of zzso zzso zzso with limited preferential zzso effects, a linear dependence of zzso on the local concentration of HB donor was obtained and then used as a zzso curve for zzso the zzso values in the surroundings of the zzso zzso to zzso By this approach, we estimated the zzso of the labels in different peptides and their complexes with zzso We found that zzso values for the label at the zzso zzso are lower zzso than for free labels and depend strongly on the nature of the zzso zzso zzso When zzso with different zzso the estimated zzso of the labels zzso to the labeled peptides was much lower zzso zzso zzso and depended on the DNA nature and zzso zzso Thus, the elaborated method allows a zzso evaluation of zzso at the surface of a zzso through the determination of the partial volume of zzso We believe the developed procedure can be successfully applied for monitoring zzso at the surface of any zzso or zzso
