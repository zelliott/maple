zzso coils of different order were investigated using infrared zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso coiled coils display unique zzso zzso with at least three zzso bands instead of only one band of a classical zzso in the zzso I zzso This was attributed to a distortion of the zzso structure by the zzso bending, giving rise to bands that are not observed in the zzso zzso Here, we investigated coiled coils forming zzso zzso and zzso These higher order coiled zzso in general, possess larger zzso zzso resulting in a smaller zzso zzso We found that all coiled coils zzso including the native zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso leading to parallel zzso and zzso as well as the rod portions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed the typical three band pattern of the coiled zzso zzso I zzso However, the separation of these three bands and their zzso zzso from the classical zzso band position was correlated to the extent of the zzso distortion as reflected by the pitch values of the zzso The most pronounced spectral anomaly was found for the zzso zzso with a reported zzso pitch of 137 A, whereas the smallest spectral distortion was found for the zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso zzso both with a pitch of about 205 zzso
