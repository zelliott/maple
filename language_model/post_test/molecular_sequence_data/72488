Gene zzso in zzso embryonic stem cells is a proven method for the simultaneous identification and zzso of genes in the zzso Gene trap zzso are designed to detect insertions within genes through the production of a fusion zzso transcript, making the identification of the zzso gene possible by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso Although the amplification of specific zzso can be achieved zzso cloning and screening of zzso zzso has proven to be time zzso To eliminate the need for zzso we have developed a method for zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso More than 150 independent gene trap cell lines were zzso and sequence information was obtained for every line successfully amplified by zzso With the zzso used in this study, zzso of the cell lines were found to contain properly spliced gene trap zzso The remaining lines were either spliced zzso or contained deletions of the zzso These results highlight the advantage of sequencing gene trap zzso before further zzso This work now zzso the way for large-scale gene trap screens in mice and should greatly accelerate the functional analysis of the zzso zzso
