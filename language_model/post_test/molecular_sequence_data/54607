zzso III zzso has been known to play critical roles in zzso transport and immune zzso in zzso This study reports a partial zzso gene cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso It showed that the gene was expressed in all zzso stages of zzso zzso In zzso stage, it was expressed in all tested zzso of zzso fat body, gut, and zzso In response to bacterial challenge, the larvae showed an enhanced level of zzso expression by a quantitative real-time zzso zzso interference of zzso by its specific double stranded zzso zzso caused significant zzso of its expression level and resulted in significant suppression in zzso zzso formation in response to bacterial zzso However, larvae treated with the zzso exhibited a significant recovery in the cellular immune response by addition of a zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed expression of zzso and resulted in a significant suppression in the zzso zzso zzso The addition of the zzso zzso to the zzso larvae significantly restored the zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso caused potent zzso of zzso zzso However, the addition of the zzso zzso to the infected larvae significantly prevented the lethal zzso This study suggests that zzso limits zzso induced by zzso or bacterial infection in zzso zzso
