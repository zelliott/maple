zzso zzso fish usually develop as zzso zzso Thus, the presence of germ cells is generally considered to be essential for female zzso differentiation or the maintenance of zzso zzso However, little is known of the role of germ cells in the determination of the sexual fate of zzso zzso zzso We have established an zzso germ cell zzso system in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a small freshwater fish, using zzso of the dead end gene with a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso lacking germ cells could develop as either zzso males or zzso as characterized zzso by the presence or absence of zzso plates in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso males and females had zzso and zzso structures, respectively, but lacked germ zzso Gene expression patterns in these male and female germ zzso zzso were essentially the same as those in zzso of normal zzso Our observations indicate that sexually zzso zzso can develop in germ zzso zzso In contrast to the situation in other model fish species, the zzso zzso cells in zzso females autonomously differentiated into zzso zzso and also played a role in the maintenance of zzso zzso On the basis of our zzso we propose two possible models to explain the role of germ cells in sex determination in zzso
