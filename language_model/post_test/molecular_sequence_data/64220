zzso of the zzso C virus zzso zzso is zzso by the interaction of zzso and cellular proteins with an internal zzso entry site zzso located within the zzso region zzso We have investigated whether small zzso molecules corresponding to the different zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso when introduced in zzso can bind to the cellular proteins and antagonize their binding to the viral zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso We have found that a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso III could efficiently inhibit zzso zzso translation in a zzso manner without affecting zzso zzso The zzso III zzso was found to bind to most of the cellular proteins which zzso with the zzso zzso A smaller zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of domain III also strongly and selectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso protein and prevented the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso This study reveals valuable insights into the role of the zzso structures of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Finally, these results provide a basis for developing zzso therapy using small zzso molecules mimicking the zzso structures of the zzso to specifically block viral zzso zzso
