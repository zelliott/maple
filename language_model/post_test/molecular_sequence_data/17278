The transmission dynamics of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Montana appears to be regulated by zzso zzso a tick symbiotic zzso that interferes with transmission of virulent zzso zzso To zzso the molecular relationships between the two zzso and glean information on how to possibly exploit this interference phenomenon, we studied a major zzso outer membrane protein zzso zzso presumed to be involved in infection and zzso of spotted fever group zzso zzso but which is not expressed in the zzso Based on zzso amplification and DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso is the most closely related of all known zzso to zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso originally described as East Side agent in zzso zzso ticks from the east side of the zzso Valley in Montana, is still present in that tick population as well as in zzso zzso ticks collected at two widely separated locations in zzso The zzso genes of zzso zzso from these locations share three identical premature stop zzso and a weakened zzso binding site consensus sequence relative to zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter closely resembles that of zzso zzso and is functional based on reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and Western zzso showed that zzso translation products were not detected in cultured tick cells infected with zzso zzso Double zzso studies revealed zzso tail structures in tick cells infected with zzso zzso strain zzso but not in cells infected with zzso zzso
