We have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso of the human genes zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso from the zzso fish zzso zzso The zzso zzso beta and zzso genes each consist of 21 coding zzso similar to the human zzso zzso but are considerably smaller than their human counterparts because of the smaller zzso Furthermore, the two zzso genes are linked zzso in a zzso array similar to their human zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso and human zzso beta and zzso genes show an overall zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, with the zzso zzso showing a much higher degree of zzso zzso analysis revealed several short stretches of zzso sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of the zzso beta genes and the adjacent promoter regions of the zzso zzso These zzso sequences may have a role in the regulation of expression of either or both of these closely linked zzso
