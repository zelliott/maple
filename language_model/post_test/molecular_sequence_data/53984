The construction of functional fusion proteins often requires a zzso sequence that adopts an extended zzso to allow for zzso zzso zzso sequences are generally selected based on zzso Without a reliable selection zzso the design of such zzso is often difficult, particularly in situations where longer zzso sequences are zzso Here we describe a program called zzso which can automatically generate a set of zzso sequences that are known to adopt extended zzso as determined by X-ray zzso and zzso The only required input to the program is the desired zzso sequence zzso The program is specifically designed to assist in fusion protein zzso A number of optional input parameters have been incorporated so that users are able to enhance sequence selection based on specific zzso The program output simply contains a set of sequences with a specified zzso This program should be a useful tool in both the biotechnology industry and biomedical zzso It can be zzso through the Web page zzso zzso
