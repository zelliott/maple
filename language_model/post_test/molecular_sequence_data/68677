Maintenance of a stable internal environment within complex organisms requires specialized cells that sense changes in the zzso concentration of specific zzso (such as zzso Although the molecular nature of such zzso sensors is unknown, zzso cells possess a cell surface zzso mechanism that also recognizes zzso and zzso zzso (such as zzso and couples by changes in zzso turnover and zzso zzso to regulation of zzso hormone zzso The latter restores zzso by acting on kidney and zzso We now report the cloning of complementary DNA zzso an zzso zzso zzso from bovine zzso with pharmacological and functional properties nearly identical to those of the native zzso The novel approximately zzso zzso shares limited similarity with the zzso zzso receptors and features a large zzso domain, containing clusters of zzso zzso zzso possibly involved in calcium zzso coupled to a zzso domain like those in the zzso zzso zzso
