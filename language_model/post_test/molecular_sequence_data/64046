zzso is a zzso zzso type III zzso protein that is zzso into host plant cells during attempted zzso zzso harboring the corresponding resistance protein zzso can detect zzso and mount a rapid host defense response, thus avoiding active zzso In the plant cell, zzso zzso zzso of zzso a key component in zzso zzso Although the zzso system is among the best characterized of the numerous bacterial zzso resistance protein systems involved in plant disease resistance and zzso the details of the molecular recognition mechanism are still zzso To gain further zzso the crystal structure of zzso was zzso The zzso A structure exhibits a novel mixed zzso zzso zzso Aided by the structural information, we demonstrate that one lobe is the zzso of zzso recognition zzso This structural information and preliminary zzso studies provide a framework for the future understanding of zzso function on the molecular zzso
