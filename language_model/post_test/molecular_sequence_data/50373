An internal portion of zzso growth factor zzso amplified from the total zzso of rainbow trout zzso zzso liver by a zzso was used to screen a rainbow trout liver zzso library, and zzso clones zzso two distinct zzso were zzso On the basis of a zzso zzso and zzso predicted zzso acid identity to zzso salmon zzso one zzso sequence was identified as rainbow trout zzso growth factor I zzso The second zzso sequence shared zzso and zzso identity with zzso at the zzso and predicted zzso acid levels, respectively, and was identified as rainbow trout zzso growth factor II zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons of zzso with those of human zzso indicate that zzso is more similar to human zzso than to human zzso and that zzso is more similar to human zzso than to human zzso Southern zzso analysis of rainbow trout zzso DNA zzso with zzso and zzso zzso suggests that these two forms of zzso originate from separate zzso The presence of a zzso zzso suggests that the divergence of zzso occurred early in zzso zzso
