zzso chain reaction zzso based DNA amplification has replaced many time-consuming protocols in molecular zzso Here we describe a simple strategy to quickly select deletion zzso based on zzso methodology which then can be confirmed by zzso zzso A forward zzso primer is designed in such a way to recognize only the wild type sequences in the amplification reaction and thus a negative selection identifies the deletion in the zzso
