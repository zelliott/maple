zzso parameters of the zzso secondary structure of zzso of several major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were subjected to computer zzso The distribution of zzso values was close to normal in all groups (except for the zzso zzso In the organisms existing under extreme environmental conditions, the stability of the zzso secondary structure was zzso Comparative analysis of zzso frequency of zzso zzso pairs in stems of randomly generated and real sequences demonstrated preferential fixation of such pairs in the contexts with the most favorable thermodynamics zzso zzso pairs in zzso stems set limits on the presence of highly zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the effect of zzso pairs other than zzso on the frequency of such zzso is far more pronounced than that of zzso zzso
