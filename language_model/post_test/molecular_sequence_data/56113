The zzso zzso invasion process requires the synthesis of the zzso proteins and their zzso by specific factors zzso by the zzso and spa zzso which are clustered upstream from the zzso zzso We report here the characterization of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are located in the zzso end of the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso endowed with high levels of alkaline zzso activity confirmed the functionality of a classical signal sequence detected in the sequence of zzso The zzso and zzso genes were each zzso on the large zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso each of the zzso and zzso zzso thus constructed showed the same invasive zzso as the zzso strain and was able to provoke zzso in guinea zzso It thus appears that two genes located at the zzso part of the zzso locus are not directly involved in zzso Analysis of concentrated culture zzso of the zzso and zzso strains indicated that zzso of one zzso whose size was consistent with that predicted for the zzso protein zzso zzso was abolished in the zzso zzso
