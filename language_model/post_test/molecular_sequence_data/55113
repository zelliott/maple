The zzso zzso complex of zzso coli zzso type I zzso of the toxin zzso A zzso In this complex, zzso is an inner membrane ABC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an outer membrane channel zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso anchored in the inner membrane that bridges zzso to zzso This zzso organization is reminiscent of that of drug zzso systems such as zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We have previously shown the crucial role of zzso zzso located at the hairpin tip region of zzso and zzso zzso during assembly of their zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of the putative tip region of zzso using zzso zzso with single zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso data show that all zzso abolished zzso binding to zzso and resulted in the absence of zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that, similarly to zzso and zzso zzso interacts with zzso in a zzso zzso A general model in which these zzso interactions induce opening of zzso during drug zzso and type I zzso is zzso
