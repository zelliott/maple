A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene lineage zzso affiliated with the zzso of the class zzso zzso was discovered in a zzso zzso gene clone library prepared from a water sample collected from 250 m in the western zzso zzso This clone library of nearly full-length zzso of bacterial zzso zzso genes has been the subject of previous studies aimed at identifying bacteria that inhibit the lower ocean surface zzso The novel lineage was identified by randomly sequencing clones that did not zzso to zzso zzso specific for several abundant zzso groups identified in previous zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was most closely affiliated with the zzso although it showed no specific relationship to any zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso Eight of the clones in the library of 148 clones were identified as members of the zzso lineage by zzso to an zzso probe specific for zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso group is zzso in the lower surface layer of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with zzso between 160 and 500 zzso The repeated discovery of sequences belonging to different gene clusters with similar zzso in this region of the water column suggests that microbial communities in the lower surface layer may be functionally zzso
