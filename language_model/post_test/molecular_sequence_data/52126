The prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso point zzso within zzso 1 and 2 was studied in 17 cases of zzso cell tumors (8 zzso and 9 zzso induced by zzso or zzso DNA samples prepared from zzso zzso zzso were amplified by means of the zzso chain reaction, and point zzso at zzso 12, 13 and 61 were analyzed by direct sequence methods with zzso zzso No zzso were detected in any of the zzso zzso The results thus indicated that zzso family point zzso is not necessary for kidney tumor development in rats, supporting the view that zzso zzso may not be generally relevant to zzso development in various zzso in different zzso
