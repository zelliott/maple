The mouse zzso zzso zzso gene is responsible for the metabolism of numerous zzso and toxic zzso zzso by the environmental contaminant zzso zzso requires a functional aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso We examined the zzso region of the zzso gene in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells and a zzso line having a zzso in zzso binding of the zzso zzso We identified two zzso elements zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso required for zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso Three classes of zzso complexes binding to the zzso element were zzso class I, found only in the presence of zzso and a functional zzso zzso that was heat zzso and not zzso against by zzso virus 40 zzso early promoter zzso class II, consisting of at least three zzso complexes that were heat stable and bound to zzso zzso and class III, composed of at least three zzso complexes that were zzso and were not zzso against by zzso zzso Essential contacts for these proteins were centered at zzso to zzso for the class I complex, zzso zzso or both for the class II complexes, and zzso to zzso for the class III zzso The zzso element was absolutely essential for both zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso and at least two zzso complexes bound to this zzso These data are consistent with the zzso element that binds proteins being necessary but not sufficient for zzso gene zzso interaction of these proteins with those at the zzso element was found to be required for full zzso induction by zzso
