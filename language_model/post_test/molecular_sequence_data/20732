zzso and zzso repeats occur in a large number of zzso zzso As these repeats are often highly diverged, the prediction of zzso or zzso zzso can be zzso Except for the most clear-cut cases, identification at the individual repeat level is zzso in particular for determining domain zzso However, methods using single sequence queries do not have the sensitivity required to deal with more divergent repeats and, when applied to proteins with known structures, in some cases failed to detect a single zzso 

Testing zzso which use multiple sequence alignments as queries, we found two of them, zzso and zzso to detect zzso and zzso repeats with greatly enhanced zzso zzso against zzso determined structures suggests the use of three score classes with increasing confidence in the zzso and prediction thresholds for each zzso When we applied a new protocol using both zzso and zzso to these structures, it detected zzso of zzso repeats and zzso of zzso repeats, with the minimum for a given protein of 57% for zzso repeats and zzso for zzso zzso Application to bona fide zzso and zzso proteins or zzso indicated that similar numbers can be expected for the full complement of zzso zzso A systematic screen of the zzso Data Bank for false positive hits revealed their number to be low, in particular for zzso zzso Double false positive hits for a given protein were rare for zzso and not at all observed for zzso zzso In combination with fold prediction and consistency checking (multiple sequence zzso secondary structure zzso and position zzso repeat prediction with the new zzso protocol dramatically improves prediction in the twilight zone of fold prediction methods, as well as the zzso of zzso domain zzso 

A protocol is presented for the identification of individual zzso or zzso repeats which is straightforward to zzso It provides high sensitivity at a low false positive rate and will therefore greatly enhance the accuracy of predictions of zzso and zzso zzso
