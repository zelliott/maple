zzso delta virus zzso is a zzso pathogen of humans, a satellite of zzso B virus zzso that zzso severe acute and chronic liver zzso The zzso zzso consists of eight zzso or zzso with zzso being ubiquitous and frequently zzso In Turkey, zzso infection is highly endemic among zzso carriers, especially in the zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed 34 samples from patients who were chronically infected with zzso originating from 22 cities of rural regions in the central and eastern parts of Turkey, in order to determine the levels of viral replication and genetic zzso zzso zzso levels ranged between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA was detected in 25 samples zzso with values ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and full-length zzso sequences indicated that all of the strains belonged to zzso zzso However, a high genetic diversity was observed among the zzso with a mean full-length zzso score of zzso zzso sequences clustered with sequences from Western Europe zzso Eastern Europe and Asia zzso or Africa zzso zzso zzso related to strains of African origin had a zzso zzso instead of an zzso at position 202 of the large delta zzso zzso zzso sequences obtained for 34 zzso indicated an zzso zzso in all zzso Taken together, our results indicate that in Turkey, where zzso dual infection is highly endemic, both viruses have high levels of zzso and zzso strains exhibit wide genetic diversity, which might reflect ancient evolution and/or successive zzso
