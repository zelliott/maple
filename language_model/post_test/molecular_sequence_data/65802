To evade the zzso zzso virus zzso immune response, the zzso zzso protein zzso major zzso complex class I zzso trafficking by recruiting the zzso zzso protein 1 zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Under normal conditions zzso binds zzso and zzso signals zzso zzso zzso via physically separate binding zzso In the case of the zzso complex, a zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso tail zzso and a zzso in zzso zzso are absolutely required for zzso zzso Also present in zzso is a zzso zzso which does not normally affect zzso trafficking and is not needed to recruit zzso to the zzso However, evidence is presented here that this zzso motif can be activated by fusing zzso to the zzso tail in zzso Thus, the inability of this motif to function in trans likely results from a structural change that occurs when zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso relevant zzso recruitment of zzso to zzso which occurs whether zzso is present in zzso or zzso was stabilized by the zzso and zzso zzso within zzso Additionally, zzso acids zzso and zzso in the zzso tails of zzso and (but not zzso and zzso molecules also stabilized zzso zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso binding pocket in the zzso zzso of zzso created a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso zzso of zzso that disrupted binding of wild type zzso to the zzso zzso Thus, these data provide evidence that zzso binding to the zzso zzso tail zzso the interaction of a zzso in the zzso zzso tail with the natural zzso binding pocket in zzso
