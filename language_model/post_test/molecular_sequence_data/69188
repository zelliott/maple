The zzso heat shock protein zzso is present in cells at high levels in the zzso and is composed of two separate gene products, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso heat shock proteins were isolated from serum by zzso affinity zzso zzso against each form of zzso are capable of zzso zzso Each zzso preparation is specific against either zzso or zzso when tested on a protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio of zzso in zzso 1 zzso was estimated to be 2 to zzso Each zzso preparation was used to zzso zzso or zzso from zzso 1 zzso to test whether zzso exists as a zzso and/or zzso After zzso silver zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso This result would suggest that zzso forms zzso with zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso almost entirely zzso suggesting that zzso exists largely as zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were able to zzso the zzso zzso zzso from zzso 1 zzso indicating that these zzso are able to bind to zzso when it is zzso with other zzso Both zzso preparations recognize zzso in zzso zzso and human cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed using both zzso zzso and the results indicated that both zzso and zzso were located in the zzso and nucleus of zzso 1 zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso in the zzso while zzso was found evenly dispersed throughout the zzso zzso also appeared to be localized to a greater degree than zzso in the vicinity of the nuclear zzso
