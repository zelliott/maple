zzso communication relies on the fusion of zzso zzso with the plasma zzso The soluble zzso fusion protein attachment protein zzso zzso proteins initiate membrane fusion through the formation of the zzso complex, a process tightly regulated by zzso zzso zzso The emerging trend is that zzso proteins promote zzso membrane fusion by binding to a zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso in the zzso pocket of zzso zzso and zzso predicted to disrupt the zzso zzso interaction have a modest effect on binding to zzso in its free state, but abolish binding to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells lacking zzso zzso both zzso and the plasma membrane zzso of zzso However, total internal reflection zzso zzso analysis reveals that expression of a zzso double zzso reduces the rate of zzso fusion, an effect only zzso at the onset of zzso The zzso zzso pocket is therefore critical for zzso complex zzso However, zzso zzso this interaction have a limited impact on zzso zzso in zzso zzso
