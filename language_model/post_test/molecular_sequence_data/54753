The production of zzso of zzso zzso is generally a high cost zzso To reduce the production costs, inexpensive carbon sources such as volatile fatty acids zzso from zzso wastewater can be zzso zzso isolation of bacterial strains that can produce zzso zzso using zzso as a sole carbon source would be a beneficial zzso In this study, a strain of zzso accumulating zzso was isolated from the wastewater treatment plant of a soybean processing facility in zzso The strain was identified as zzso according to its zzso zzso information and was originally named as strain zzso The strain accumulated a mass of zzso up to zzso of its dry cell weight when it was cultured under the optimum zzso condition in this study when zzso was used as the carbon zzso In addition, zzso could zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso either from zzso zzso or from zzso zzso and one-third of the zzso was zzso zzso from this study demonstrated that small zzso organic acids can be used by the strain of zzso as the carbon source for growth and zzso zzso The maximum zzso yield in the study was zzso g zzso dry zzso
