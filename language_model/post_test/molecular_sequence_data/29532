A drastic increase of zzso activity was demonstrated during plant seed zzso and in seed protein extract in zzso Multiple zzso proteins with a wide spectrum of activity were generated and zzso zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that during seed zzso more zzso with potent zzso activity were generated, and the zzso activity shifted from small molecules to high molecular zzso This zzso increase of zzso activity were observed in all three plants tested, zzso zzso cigar tree and zzso This rapid increase of zzso activity was also observed with incubation of seed proteins in zzso suggesting that at least part of the zzso protein generation is independent of gene zzso Seven zzso proteins with activities against five different plant pathogens were isolated from the active zzso However, random zzso of zzso seed protein with multiple zzso failed to generate any zzso zzso It is suggested that during plant seed zzso a regulated zzso process takes place that results in the generation of multiple peptides or proteins with zzso zzso This onset of zzso proteins is transitional in nature, but could play an important role in the protection of plants in early stage of development when the more sophisticated defense system has yet to zzso
