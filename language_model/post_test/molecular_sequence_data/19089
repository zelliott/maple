zzso zzso is a model species for ecological or zzso studies of zzso zzso Three to six groups or species linked to it have been ecologically and zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed the existence of four species in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a fourth as yet not described zzso We studied 47 collections from 24 French and Italian locations, supplemented with zzso data, in order to genetically and zzso delineate these zzso zzso analyses of three nuclear DNA regions zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the four European zzso zzso culture, and ecology features allowed us to delineate species boundaries and to describe the fourth species we named zzso zzso since it turns coppery with zzso As there is no existing original zzso zzso for zzso zzso one of our collections was chosen as the zzso The low genetic diversity found in zzso zzso zzso with stable zzso traits zzso zzso zzso spores with an zzso zzso and with ecological preferences zzso with zzso in open and temperate zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is characterized by a high genetic diversity and a high variation of its zzso and ecological zzso
