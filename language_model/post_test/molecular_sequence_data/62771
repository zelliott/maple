zzso initiation in all three zzso of life requires the assembly of large zzso complexes at DNA promoters before zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso Core zzso zzso show zzso among the three zzso of life, and recent structural information supports this zzso General zzso factors are required for productive zzso initiation complex zzso The zzso general zzso factors zzso protein zzso which mediates promoter recognition, and zzso factor B zzso which mediates recruitment of zzso show extensive zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso information is becoming available for fragments of zzso initiation complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso but understanding the molecular topography of complete initiation complexes still requires zzso and zzso characterization of zzso and zzso zzso In published work, systematic zzso zzso zzso has been used to define positions of zzso zzso and general zzso factors in bacterial and zzso initiation zzso In this work, we have used systematic zzso zzso zzso to define positions of zzso zzso and general zzso factors in an zzso initiation zzso zzso a set of 41 zzso DNA fragments, each having a zzso zzso zzso zzso agent incorporated at a single, defined site within positions zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter of the zzso marine zzso zzso zzso zzso we have determined the locations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso relative to promoter zzso The resulting topographical information supports the striking zzso with the zzso initiation complex and permits one major new conclusion, which is that zzso interacts with promoter DNA not only in the zzso region but also in the zzso region, near the zzso start zzso zzso with zzso information implicates the zzso zzso domain in the interaction with the zzso zzso The results are discussed in relation to the known effects of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso initiation and zzso zzso zzso
