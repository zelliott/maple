The members of the zzso zzso family, zzso the zzso tumor zzso zzso and its relatives, zzso and zzso zzso regulate cell proliferation and zzso fundamental biological processes including embryonic development, zzso zzso tissue renewal, and defense against zzso The large, zzso pocket proteins act by binding a plethora of cell zzso and zzso zzso the most prominent of which are the zzso zzso zzso These zzso interactions are in turn regulated by carefully orchestrated zzso events on multiple zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso events which are carried out, at least in part, by the zzso zzso that form the key elements of the cell cycle zzso Here we discuss the recently obtained new insights into the diverse functions of the zzso family, and show examples of how integration of zzso cell biology, and a range of zzso approaches help to advance our understanding of the biological roles played by the pocket proteins in both normal and cancer zzso
