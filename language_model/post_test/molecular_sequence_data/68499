We recently described the cloning of zzso the putative structural gene for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To analyze the gene product of zzso we expressed it in zzso zzso When placed under the control of a zzso promoter, zzso could be transcribed and labeled specifically with zzso The zzso gene product exhibited an apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso when subjected to sodium zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso was tested by expressing it from its own promoter in the zzso coli zzso zzso This zzso lacks both of the endemic zzso zzso and zzso its growth is thus very sensitive to zzso and zzso and zzso derived from this strain do not exhibit zzso zzso When zzso with zzso zzso gained tolerance to zzso or zzso zzso prepared from the zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso The properties of this activity were determined by zzso zzso zzso on zzso energized with zzso The zzso expressed by zzso exhibited a zzso of 1 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso at pH zzso At pH zzso the relative rate of zzso activity was zzso with little change in the zzso and approached zero at pH zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is the structural gene for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibits properties different from those of the two zzso coli zzso zzso by zzso and zzso yet functionally zzso a zzso in these zzso
