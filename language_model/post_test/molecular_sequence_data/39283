The four zzso bacteria so far described in the family zzso belong to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacterial strain zzso was isolated from zzso tea and, based on the zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequence which is supported by a high zzso value, was found to belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso differed from zzso zzso the nearest member with a zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso zzso and type strains of other zzso species with regard to several characteristics of growth features in culture media, growth in zzso zzso production of zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ethanol, but not methanol as a carbon zzso These results, along with zzso mobility patterns of nine zzso zzso suggest that strain zzso represents a novel zzso zzso The zzso present was zzso and DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a low value of zzso % zzso zzso to the type strains of related zzso which placed it as a separate zzso On the basis of this data, the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
