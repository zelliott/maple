zzso X-ray zzso fine structure zzso zzso has been used to determine the structure of the zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The active site zzso is four zzso with exclusively zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso The zzso of the zzso scattering from the zzso zzso is best fit using two zzso zzso suggesting a zzso site, where O most likely represents a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The same structure was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso although in this case it is possible that the coordination sphere may expand to include a fifth zzso zzso zzso data were also measured for the zzso coli zzso zzso When a single zzso is zzso for zzso in the active site of zzso coli zzso zzso data show the same zzso environment as is found for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso data for zzso coli zzso with two zinc zzso bound per zzso with the second zzso acting as an zzso metal, demonstrates that the zzso metal is bound to at least two zzso zzso presumably zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso scattering analysis, combined with previous studies of the zzso zzso indicate a novel zinc binding motif not found in any previously studied zinc zzso
