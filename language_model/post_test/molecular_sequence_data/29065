zzso zzso D zzso has been implicated in the cellular signal zzso pathways leading to diverse zzso events and known to be regulated by many cellular zzso To identify the proteins that interact with zzso we performed a protein overlay zzso with zzso obtained from the sequential column zzso separation of rat brain zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso A protein of molecular mass 40 zzso which was detected by zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso is shown to be zzso C by zzso zzso with zzso laser zzso flight mass zzso zzso zzso A also showed similar binding properties as zzso C and was zzso with zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain corresponding to zzso acids zzso of zzso was necessary for the interaction observed in zzso and zzso A was found to interact with the zzso domain of zzso specifically, but not with other zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by the presence of zzso zzso A in a zzso manner, and the zzso by 50% was observed by the addition of less than zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the inclusion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso resulted in an enhanced interaction between zzso and zzso A with a zzso increase in the potential ability of zzso A to inhibit zzso which suggests the existence of a possible regulation of the interaction by the change of zzso zzso of zzso zzso
