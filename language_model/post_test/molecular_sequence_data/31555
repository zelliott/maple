In ancient DNA studies the low amount of zzso DNA represents a limiting factor that often zzso the result zzso In this study we extracted the DNA from nine human skeletal remains of different ages found in the Byzantine cemetery of zzso zzso and in the medieval cemetery of zzso zzso in Rhodes zzso zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect in the extracts the presence of zzso zzso and to estimate the DNA zzso As zzso DNA was detected in all samples, amplification of nuclear targets, as zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regulator zzso yielded positive results in one case zzso In an effort to improve amplification success, we applied, for the first time in ancient DNA, a zzso strategy based on zzso zzso Master zzso A comparison between results obtained from zzso and zzso samples is zzso Our data, even if zzso show that the zzso zzso procedure may improve the sensitivity of zzso zzso
