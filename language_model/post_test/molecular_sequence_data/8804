We demonstrate zzso that the bacterial zzso zzso O zzso is a target zzso for zzso zzso T cell responses following infection with zzso zzso The minimal zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso Most zzso T cell zzso recognized zzso zzso zzso and zzso although each exhibited a characteristic pattern of preferential zzso One zzso zzso reacted to zzso but not to zzso or any other zzso zzso zzso With zzso from B10 zzso mice and cells zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso recognized zzso with zzso while a different zzso zzso recognized zzso with zzso Competitive binding studies demonstrated that of 15 zzso peptides tested, only zzso zzso and zzso had high affinity for zzso while zzso could also bind to isolated zzso Of nine zzso peptides tested, only zzso bound multiple class II zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of zzso may be due in part to the presence of multiple T cell zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Many of the rules of zzso observed with model zzso are also operative in our zzso model of bacterial infectious zzso Furthermore, a novel mechanism of zzso based on newly defined structural features of zzso molecules is zzso This information is crucial for rational vaccine zzso
