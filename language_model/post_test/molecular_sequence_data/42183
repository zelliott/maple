Two new zzso zzso zzso and their corresponding sense zzso specific for mouse zzso zzso were zzso and zzso with zzso They were used to zzso zzso zzso in the spinal cords of normal mice and in mice 3 and 7 days following unilateral zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed at low levels in motor and other zzso of the normal spinal zzso As expected from other studies, zzso occurred in the cell bodies of zzso motor zzso but, in addition, zzso was also observed in the cell bodies of intact motor zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso zzso was less in the intact, zzso motor zzso cell bodies than in the zzso motor zzso cell bodies and zzso was zzso being higher at 3 days than at 7 days following zzso Both zzso zzso gave the same result, although differences in cellular zzso was observed, and the two sense zzso were zzso zzso binding was abolished by zzso of the sections with zzso and zzso was carried out under different conditions of stringency in order to ascertain whether the zzso expression of zzso zzso was a true reflection of its distribution in zzso There is conflicting evidence on the presence or absence of zzso effects following unilateral peripheral nerve injury in the literature, and it is suggested that these differences can be accounted for by the methodology and type of probe zzso
