zzso zzso is the first committed intermediate in the zzso of the zzso precursors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the growth medium with zzso has been shown to complement disruptions in the zzso coli gene for zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the immediate precursor of zzso zzso In order to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso must be zzso We describe the construction of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso in which the essential gene zzso zzso zzso zzso has been disrupted by zzso of a synthetic zzso zzso consisting of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responsible for converting zzso to zzso zzso under the control of an zzso zzso Random zzso of zzso produced defects in the zzso zzso system that prevented the transport of zzso into the zzso zzso and zzso strains of zzso unable to grow on zzso were incubated in buffer containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso was isolated from these cells and analyzed for zzso zzso zzso incorporation of zzso was observed for zzso However, there was no evidence of zzso incorporation into the zzso side chain of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
