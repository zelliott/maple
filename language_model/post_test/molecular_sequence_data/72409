The secondary structure and global fold of the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protein consists of three zzso strands forming a rigid region of zzso On the basis of the zzso parameters and distance geometry calculations, it is evident that the zzso protein is structurally very zzso to zzso zzso inhibitor zzso of which the X-ray structure is zzso The zzso protein reveals the presence of a zzso zzso which consists of a ring formed by two zzso bridges and the zzso backbone through which the third zzso bridge zzso This structural motif is found in several small proteins such as zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and growth zzso The implications of the structural relationship between zzso and other biologically active proteins are zzso
