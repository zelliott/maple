The evolution of the zzso zzso is intriguing in light of their elaborate relationship with zzso and their significance in the decoding zzso Based on sequence motifs and structure determination, these zzso have been assigned to two zzso The crystal structure of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso a class I zzso zzso to zzso and zzso has been zzso It is shown here that a zzso zzso zzso a zzso from which zzso interacting with the zzso and the zzso of the zzso have been deleted, has zzso activity and can charge a zzso amber zzso zzso with zzso The zzso core of zzso which is structurally zzso in other class I zzso is therefore sufficient for the zzso of zzso zzso Some of these truncated zzso have lost their ability to discriminate against zzso zzso zzso a more specific role of the zzso domain in the recognition of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso and zzso recognition properties are carried by distinct zzso of zzso and support the notion that class I zzso zzso evolved from a common zzso jointly with zzso and the genetic code, by the addition of zzso zzso zzso new recognition zzso
