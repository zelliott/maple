zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso sea zzso zzso requires an upstream regulatory region that is part of a repetitive sequence element zzso associated with all zzso zzso zzso from the zzso end of zzso DNA, monitored for activity using the sea zzso zzso zzso expression system, indicated that this regulatory region has multiple DNA elements and that no positive element lies upstream of the zzso We mapped the regulatory region using zzso fragments containing zzso sequences fused to an zzso minimal zzso The region between base pairs zzso and zzso defined as the zzso zzso was essential for zzso activity and zzso preferential zzso zzso expression to a zzso reporter zzso zzso was not fully restricted to zzso zzso however, suggesting that negative spatial elements are also associated with the proper zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso identified an zzso DNA element, the zzso zzso This element binds a single zzso nuclear zzso the zzso zzso binding protein zzso whose specificity suggests a possible relationship with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are incapable of binding the zzso protein and lower promoter activity by zzso zzso activity for zzso is low in zzso eggs, increases by the zzso stage and continues rising in zzso These data suggest that zzso plays a major role in the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso
