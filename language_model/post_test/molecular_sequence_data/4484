zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been shown to cause Barth syndrome zzso an zzso disorder characterized by cardiac and skeletal zzso short zzso and zzso We recently reported a family with a severe zzso zzso described as isolated zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso Other findings associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso elevated urinary organic zzso and zzso zzso were either absent or zzso A linkage study of the X zzso localized zzso to the zzso region near the zzso zzso suggesting that these disorders are zzso We screened the zzso gene for zzso in this family with zzso and direct sequencing and found a novel zzso substitution at position zzso This position is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a severe zzso zzso of zzso with a specific effect on the zzso This finding provides further zzso information about the zzso gene product and has implications for unexplained cases of severe infantile zzso zzso in zzso
