The zzso zzso receptors zzso are a group of nuclear receptors that were originally identified on the basis of sequence similarity to the zzso zzso The three zzso zzso genes have been implicated in diverse zzso processes ranging from zzso development to maintenance of bone density, but the diversity, function, and regulation of zzso in zzso species are not well zzso In this study, we report the cloning of four zzso zzso from the Atlantic zzso zzso zzso along with adult tissue expression and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of the single zzso identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso placement of the fourth zzso zzso zzso tentatively identified as zzso is less zzso The four zzso showed zzso partially overlapping zzso expression patterns in adult zzso zzso was broadly zzso zzso was expressed at apparently low levels in eye, brain, and zzso zzso was expressed more broadly in liver, zzso eye, brain, and zzso zzso was expressed in multiple zzso including zzso heart, zzso and zzso zzso expression patterns of zzso and zzso are consistent with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso exposure has been reported in some zzso zzso In adult male zzso zzso expression did not significantly change following zzso injection, but showed a trend toward a slight induction zzso to zzso of zzso expression in zzso In a second, more targeted experiment, expression of zzso in adult female zzso was zzso zzso in the heart following zzso zzso In zzso our results indicate that zzso contain additional zzso genes relative to zzso including zzso zzso In addition, regulation of zzso expression in zzso apparently differs from regulation in zzso Together, these features may facilitate determination of both zzso and specialized zzso gene zzso
