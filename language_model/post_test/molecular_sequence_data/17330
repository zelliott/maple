In the zzso fungus zzso zzso a complex regulatory network of zzso factors controls the expression of at least seven zzso C zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso binds to regulatory sequences in the promoter region of zzso C zzso zzso and is involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso gene which encodes zzso N zzso In this study, we used zzso in a zzso zzso screen to identify potential protein interaction zzso A zzso was identified, zzso the zzso part zzso zzso of the novel zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso acid sequence is 665 zzso and shares between zzso and zzso identity with zzso protein sequences in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is characterized by two zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso which might be involved in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso of the winged zzso zzso The zzso system was also used to map the protein zzso required for the interaction of zzso factors zzso and zzso The observed interaction between zzso and the zzso of zzso in the zzso system was verified in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Using gel zzso analysis, the zzso properties of the zzso zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso recognizes two zzso consensus binding sites within the zzso zzso promoter region of the zzso oriented zzso zzso gene pair zzso from zzso zzso Additionally, zzso is able to bind with high affinity to the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso
