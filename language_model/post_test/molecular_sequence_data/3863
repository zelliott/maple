Genome sequencing revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso besides zzso two additional zzso zzso zzso genes zzso located in two different zzso gene zzso which were designated zzso and zzso The coding regions of the two gene clusters as well as the predicted gene products showed sequence identities of about 70 to zzso zzso sequence similarities were found also to the zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso which are known to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes revealed that their gene products were active as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Growth tests showed that zzso zzso used zzso as a single or partial carbon source, although the beginning of the exponential growth phase was strongly delayed by zzso for up to 7 zzso Compared to growth on zzso the specific zzso zzso activity increased about zzso when zzso was provided as the sole carbon source, suggesting that in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso occurred via the zzso zzso Additionally, two-dimensional gel zzso experiments combined with mass zzso showed strong induction of the expression of the zzso zzso zzso genes by zzso as an additional carbon zzso zzso analyses revealed that only the zzso genes were essential for the growth of zzso zzso on zzso as a sole carbon source, while the function of the zzso genes remains zzso
