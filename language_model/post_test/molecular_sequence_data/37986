zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that plays a key role in the zzso of natural killer and T helper 1 cell responses principally by inducing zzso zzso Human and mouse zzso zzso proteins zzso have recently been described which block zzso activity but have no sequence similarity to membrane zzso zzso Several zzso genes zzso proteins with sequence similarity to zzso Here we show that zzso zzso and zzso viruses zzso from infected cells a soluble zzso zzso that may zzso the host zzso zzso The zzso virus protein was found to block zzso zzso and induction of zzso in response to zzso The highly attenuated zzso virus modified virus Ankara encodes zzso activity, and thus deletion of the zzso may improve further the safety and zzso of this promising human vaccine zzso We confirm that zzso zzso virus, a zzso that produces small skin zzso in zzso individuals and opportunistic infections in zzso AIDS patients, also encodes a zzso larger zzso zzso zzso This protein may contribute to the lack of inflammatory response characteristic of zzso zzso virus zzso The expression of zzso by distinct zzso zzso that cause local or general viral zzso or persistent or acute infections in the host, emphasizes the importance of zzso in response to viral zzso
