zzso and zzso clones zzso the mouse zzso zzso involved in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were isolated and the structural organization of the gene was zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso is zzso and zzso identical to those of the rat and human zzso zzso zzso spliced zzso of mouse zzso are present in the brain and zzso two proteins that are identical throughout their length except for an additional 13 zzso acids in the zzso zzso domain of the major zzso The coding region of zzso is composed of 5 zzso spanning approximately 6 zzso and the zzso gene was mapped to the A4 region of mouse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso start site, no typical zzso or zzso box was found, but binding sites for several known zzso factors including zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region acts as a strong promoter in zzso cells, which express the zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Thus, this minimal promoter region of zzso is suggested to be associated with the regulation of zzso zzso
