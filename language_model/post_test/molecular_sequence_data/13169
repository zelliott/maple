A complementary DNA zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso was isolated, and the transport characteristics of orally active zzso antibiotics were assessed by measuring zzso into zzso zzso expressing the rat zzso The rat zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid protein with zzso identity to the rabbit zzso The message for rat zzso was approximately zzso zzso and was found predominantly in the small zzso whereas reverse zzso chain reaction amplification revealed that the message was expressed both in the small zzso and in the kidney zzso The zzso protein was identified by translation of in zzso zzso transcript of rat zzso zzso by use of rabbit zzso zzso and by Western zzso analysis with a specific zzso against the rat zzso When expressed in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of an inward zzso zzso and the expressed zzso was inhibited by excess zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso has zzso higher affinity for the rat zzso than zzso These findings suggest that the rat zzso mediates zzso uphill transport of the oral zzso antibiotics across the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
