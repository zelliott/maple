zzso zzso is an abundant zzso gut hormone which regulates zzso zzso and possibly zzso proliferation in the zzso Though zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs in the zzso zzso zzso of humans, zzso zzso receptors themselves have not been clearly localized within the adult human gastrointestinal zzso Using an zzso directed against the zzso of the zzso zzso we determined the actual extent of zzso zzso protein expression in the human colon in order to identify areas targeted for zzso zzso effects and suggest additional zzso roles for zzso in the human zzso 

zzso zzso protein expression was seen throughout the zzso zzso along its zzso zzso There was an unexpected dense distribution of zzso zzso zzso in zzso fibers within the zzso zzso was also noted in nerve fibers of the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and in nerves in the zzso zzso 

zzso distribution of zzso receptors in the zzso zzso and zzso nerve fibers suggests diverse regulatory roles for zzso zzso in modulating zzso function as well as zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso
