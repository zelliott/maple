zzso 186 B is a zzso acid protein belonging to the zzso family of analogous zzso factors present in zzso zzso which contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular characterization of these proteins has been hampered by their zzso a difficulty overcome in the present study by obtaining B as a soluble zzso zzso zzso Atomic zzso zzso showed the presence of one atom of cadmium per zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso spectrum revealed a shoulder at 250 zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the difference zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso indicated the presence of a zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analysis of zzso with a 186 late promoter demonstrated specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein was shown to activate zzso in zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The B zzso site was mapped by gel shift and zzso I zzso protection experiments to an area zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start site, zzso with the consensus zzso zzso from zzso to zzso of the 186 and zzso late zzso zzso B point zzso were obtained in the putative zzso loop of the zzso zzso motif and in a central region thought to interact with the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso A truncated B zzso zzso the first 53 zzso acids zzso exhibited close to zzso activity, showed a zzso affinity similar to that of the full-length zzso and could be zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was a majority zzso species whereas zzso B showed larger zzso 186 B therefore exhibits a potentially linear organization of functional regions zzso an zzso C4 zzso zzso region, a zzso zzso region involved in protein zzso and a central region that interacts with zzso zzso
