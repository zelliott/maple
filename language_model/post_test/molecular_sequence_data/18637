zzso zzso such as the chicken zzso locus control region hypersensitive site 4 zzso and zzso attachment regions zzso have been incorporated separately or in combination into zzso zzso zzso in order to increase zzso expression levels, avoid zzso and reduce expression zzso However, their incorporation into zzso either produces a reduction on zzso and/or expression levels or do not have sufficient effect on stem zzso In order to develop an improved zzso we decided to combine zzso elements with zzso zzso We designed several synthetic shorter zzso elements containing 4 or 5 zzso recognition signatures zzso and studied their effects on a zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso through the zzso promoter zzso A 388 zzso zzso element containing 5 zzso named zzso was as efficient or superior to the other zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression and reduced zzso and zzso on human embryonic stem cells zzso We next compared the effect of different zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso All zzso elements reduced zzso and expression zzso but they also had a negative effect on zzso expression levels and zzso In general, the zzso element had a better overall zzso Based on these data we developed a zzso zzso zzso combining the zzso and the zzso When incorporated into the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso element was able to enhance zzso avoid zzso and reduce zzso of expression on zzso zzso these effects were maintained after differentiation of the zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso elements had these zzso The zzso element is therefore a novel zzso that zzso expression stability and enhances expression of zzso on stem zzso
