Crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso proteins have implied that the zzso of a flexible loop containing a highly zzso zzso zzso is necessary for the protection of the proposed zzso zzso transition state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 78, zzso zzso zzso zzso Carter, zzso Roos, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso 3, zzso An essential role for this zzso zzso in zzso zzso has now been verified zzso and genetically for the zzso zzso zzso employing a combination of protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso completely, and zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso treatment modified the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso confirmed that both zzso acids were vital for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited dramatic reductions in their zzso capabilities of 2-3 orders of zzso whereas zzso containing conservative zzso zzso and zzso displayed only a zzso decrease in zzso zzso values for the zzso of the forward and reverse reactions were largely unchanged for all zzso zzso except for a zzso decrease in the zzso value of the zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli indicated that wild type and zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso deficiencies, whereas the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not support bacterial zzso These data zzso that the zzso zzso that is zzso among all members of the zzso family is essential for zzso of zzso zzso by zzso
