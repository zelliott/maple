Complete zzso and truncated zzso forms of zzso from zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso gene indicated that zzso was produced from zzso by zzso of the 186 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso The results of zzso Southern analysis and Western analysis suggested that the two zzso originated from the same zzso gene and that zzso of zzso to zzso occurred during the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the primary structure of zzso was approximately zzso shorter than that of zzso the two zzso forms had the same zzso characteristics zzso zzso activity, zzso pattern, zzso ability, effect of pH on stability and activity, optimum temperature, and raw zzso zzso except that the zzso stability of zzso was higher than that of zzso An analysis of the secondary structure as well as the predicted three-dimensional structure of zzso showed that zzso retained all of the necessary zzso zzso A, B, and zzso which were most likely to be required for functionality as zzso
