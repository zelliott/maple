We have studied the effects of a four zzso zzso into the zzso loop of the heavy chain variable region from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is obtained as zzso zzso without major defects in zzso indicating that zzso variable zzso can accommodate length variation not only in zzso determining regions zzso but also in framework region zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding site is not affected by the change in a zzso zzso zzso insertions represent a new method of zzso engineering with a potential to obtain strong zzso binding by designing additional zzso zzso zzso
