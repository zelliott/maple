The aim of the project has been to zzso molecular events leading to zzso in zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso patients, to enable simple diagnosis of the disease and with the ultimate goal to understand the zzso formation process in detail, in order to develop zzso to the zzso At the DNA level, a point zzso segregating with zzso was identified in the zzso C gene on zzso 20, after basic characterization of zzso and gene for the zzso zzso The zzso results in the zzso acid substitution zzso zzso and zzso a recognition site for zzso zzso This information was used to design a zzso based zzso for simple and rapid zzso detection in DNA from blood samples to allow routine diagnosis of zzso Studies at the protein level, allowed through zzso coli expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso C zzso revealed that both protein zzso effectively inhibit the zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), but differ considerably in their tendency to zzso and form zzso The initial zzso of zzso C results in complete loss of biological activity and is highly zzso with a rise in incubation temperature from 37 to 40 degrees C resulting in a zzso increase in zzso zzso This result might be of clinical zzso since medical intervention to abort zzso periods of carriers of the disease trait may reduce the in zzso formation of zzso C zzso The three-dimensional structure of normal zzso C, zzso in a complex with zzso B, was zzso by X-ray analysis and subsequent refinement of the structure to zzso A zzso Besides zzso the zzso C structures resulting in efficient target zzso zzso the results demonstrated that the zzso zzso is buried in the zzso core of the zzso Studies of the three-dimensional solution structure of zzso zzso C by zzso zzso revealed that zzso C zzso can be formed as a result of slight, localized structural changes under conditions preceding complete zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso C are likely similar but are formed at temperatures nearly 30 degrees C lower than needed for the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso substitution lowers the transition temperature for zzso Thus, the results presented suggest that zzso C provides a system where decreased stability of a zzso protein zzso with its zzso zzso The zzso results zzso imply that the zzso zzso region of zzso C is directly involved in zzso formation and that compounds designed to interact with this region could serve as zzso to the zzso and likely also the subsequent zzso formation process, of zzso C in zzso zzso
