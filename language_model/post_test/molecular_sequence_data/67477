Common to all of the nitrate zzso zzso family are two zzso motifs in zzso zzso 5 and 11 termed zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso Although perfectly zzso zzso zzso zzso have been described in zzso zzso 2 and 8, the role of zzso has not been zzso In the present study, a combination of structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso with zzso scanning zzso of zzso within and around the zzso has been used to shed light on the probable role of zzso zzso in the zzso Models show that zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso are positioned approximately midway within the protein at the central zzso point in close proximity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which lie offset from the zzso point towards the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso pairs are relatively widely separated on opposite sides of the probable zzso zzso zzso The results of the present study demonstrate the critical structural contribution of several zzso zzso in each zzso at sites of close zzso zzso Given the relative locations of zzso zzso the zzso of the models and possible role of the zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso are zzso
