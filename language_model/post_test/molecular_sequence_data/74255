The positive regulatory domain containing 1, zzso by the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso considered as a master regulator that is required and sufficient for plasma cell zzso In the present study we have performed sequence analysis of the upstream region of the human zzso gene to detect the minimal promoter region necessary for zzso gene zzso This region comprises the region upstream of the initiation site, as well as the first zzso zzso deletion and zzso analysis in conjunction with zzso reporter zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso zzso as an essential element for zzso zzso This zzso element matches to a binding site for multiple zzso factors such as zzso and zzso zzso as well as early growth response zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the in zzso binding capability of these factors to the human zzso zzso These studies together characterize for the first time the zzso activity of the human zzso promoter, through which several factors, including zzso zzso and early growth response 1, zzso its expression through a zzso zzso
