Using zzso zzso we have zzso the structural and functional roles of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso from chicken muscle expressed in zzso zzso The two zzso were chosen since according to the nuclear magnetic resonance zzso model zzso zzso zzso & Fry, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 58, zzso they are located near the zzso and the zzso respectively, of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso in the case of zzso along with a zzso loop is considered zzso in the zzso of zzso and other zzso binding zzso The zzso to zzso zzso zzso showed only slight increases in zzso and zzso but a substantial increase zzso zzso in the free energy of zzso relative to the zzso zzso For proper interpretation of the zzso kinetic data, zzso zzso was used to show that the chemical step is partially zzso in the zzso of zzso Computer modeling suggested that the folded form of zzso could gain stability zzso to the wild zzso via zzso interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso and/or formation of a zzso complex between zzso and zzso The latter was supported by an zzso shift of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Other than this, the zzso zzso spectrum of zzso is very similar to that of zzso suggesting little zzso in the global or even local zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
