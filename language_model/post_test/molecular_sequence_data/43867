zzso zzso is an important regulatory zzso whose involvement extends into diverse areas of the human immune zzso Recent characterization of the promoter and zzso zzso regions has demonstrated the presence of positive and negative regulatory segments in the zzso In addition, the characterization of two zzso repeat elements immediately upstream of the gene has shown that there is considerable zzso directly associated with the human zzso zzso In the present report, we describe the mapping of the human zzso gene to a discrete area of zzso 1, the definition of a potential zzso segment 3 - 4 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site, and the identification of two new point zzso in the immediate promoter region with their distribution in a panel of 75 unrelated healthy zzso These data should further the understanding of how the zzso gene is controlled in humans and how its function may vary between zzso
