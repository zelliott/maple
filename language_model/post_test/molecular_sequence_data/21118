The reaction zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso is proposed to be the zzso step in zzso zzso which has been found as one of the most zzso zzso pathways during cotton fiber zzso However, the transcripts of the identified zzso genes did not increase in a similar manner as those of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso implicating a possible zzso modification or regulatory zzso In this work, cotton zzso was shown to interact with zzso protein zzso 1 zzso zzso expressed and zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso is a possible zzso site for zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso activity, leading to elevated zzso zzso We thus speculated that zzso is involved in cotton fiber growth regulation by zzso zzso which results in enhanced zzso production in zzso
