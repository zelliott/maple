The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the repeating unit structure zzso zzso zzso was examined to identify its linkage to the bacterial cell zzso In a previous paper it was suggested that this zzso is zzso linked to the surface layer zzso zzso of that zzso By improved zzso techniques zzso zzso over zzso zzso zzso C4 zzso zzso the zzso material was completely separated from the zzso zzso This implicates only low, if any, specific affinity between these zzso zzso To obtain sufficient amounts for the chemical characterization of its linkage region, the identical zzso material was isolated from zzso cells of that zzso by a zzso procedure different to that for preparation of zzso This method allowed collection of the intact zzso including its linkage zzso From the combined results of the chemical characterization and 600 zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that the zzso zzso chain, consisting of approximately six zzso repeating units, is directly linked via a zzso bridge to carbon 6 of zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso About zzso of the zzso acid zzso are zzso with these zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso represents a secondary zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
