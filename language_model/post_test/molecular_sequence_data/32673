The field of zzso has in recent years been transformed by the ever increasing number of publicly available zzso zzso This sequence information has significantly enhanced our understanding of the zzso zzso and evolutionary development of zzso Among the latter group of zzso zzso represent important human zzso because of their perceived contribution to maintaining a balanced gastrointestinal tract zzso In recent years zzso have drawn much scientific attention because of their use as live bacteria in numerous food preparations with various zzso zzso For this reason, these bacteria constitute a growing area of interest with respect to zzso molecular biology and zzso Recent zzso sequencing of a number of zzso species has allowed access to the complete genetic zzso of these zzso In this review we will discuss how zzso data has allowed us to understand zzso evolution, while also revealing genetic functions that explains their presence in the particular ecological environment of the gastrointestinal zzso
