zzso zzso found in municipal wastewater may increase selective pressure on zzso for development of resistance, but studies with mixed microbial cultures derived from wastewater have suggested that some bacteria are able to zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso with wastewater was used to enrich zzso zzso One bacterial strain isolated from an enrichment culture was identified by zzso zzso gene sequence analysis as a zzso zzso similar to a plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During growth in medium with zzso this strain produced four zzso which were identified by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso analyses as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The production of the first three zzso was enhanced by zzso acid and zzso but it was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso was most abundant in cultures supplemented with zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso and zzso of a zzso by an isolated bacterial zzso The results suggest that some bacteria may degrade zzso in wastewater to zzso with less zzso activity that could be subject to further degradation by other zzso
