The zzso zzso zzso serves as a zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, interacting with the zzso E1 during zzso with zzso linked zzso after E1 transfer and with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso Here, we describe the structure determination of a zzso complex between human zzso and zzso at zzso A zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso are zzso in human and zzso zzso as human zzso interacts with each of the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso interacts with zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons reveal similarities to several other zzso complexes in the zzso pathway, suggesting that the zzso zzso interface may be important for zzso chain formation, for zzso recruitment to zzso zzso zzso or for zzso zzso interactions with either E1 or zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that this surface is less important for E1 zzso or zzso formation, but more important for zzso interactions and for zzso chain formation when the chain exceeds more than two zzso zzso
