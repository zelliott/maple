In the zzso zzso and nucleus the activity of the molecular zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso that zzso zzso binding and zzso by zzso Among such zzso is the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is expressed as multiple zzso which are distinguished by their zzso zzso We investigated whether distinct zzso differ with respect to their zzso zzso By comparing the mainly zzso zzso zzso and zzso opposite effects of the two zzso were observed in zzso folding zzso Whereas zzso was found to inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The opposite effects are not due to differences in the regulation of the zzso activity of zzso by the two zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in an zzso manner through an acceleration of zzso zzso Our results reveal that the different zzso zzso of the distinct zzso zzso determine the outcome of an zzso folding event, most likely by zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso with different zzso binding properties appears to provide the means to influence the zzso function of zzso in addition to modulating its zzso zzso
