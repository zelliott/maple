Three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from human clinical zzso They shared more than zzso % of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso The strains were related to zzso zzso with about zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the strains were grouped in a lineage that was distinct from other zzso species in the family zzso zzso acid zzso polar zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso organization, and zzso and zzso data differentiated these zzso from recognized species of the zzso zzso The three clinical strains therefore represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso
