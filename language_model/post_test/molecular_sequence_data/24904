Although zzso inhibitor proteins are known to zzso insect resistance in transgenic plants, their zzso roles remain zzso Here, we describe the expression of a zzso inhibitor II zzso protein from zzso zzso in zzso of zzso roots and leaves suggesting a novel zzso role for zzso in zzso The zzso consists of zzso cells, sieve elements zzso and companion cells zzso which are in close association with zzso We isolated two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso library using a tomato zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso shows zzso identity to zzso Southern zzso analysis confirmed that two genes occur in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that both are zzso and are expressed in zzso Unlike zzso and other previously characterized plant zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso In zzso zzso studies on stem sections showed that zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and some SE, likely the immature developing zzso of external and internal zzso Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in zzso leaf zzso and zzso zzso zzso using these zzso revealed zzso expression in external and internal zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso root and leaf sections further localized zzso to the zzso and predominantly to the SE, particularly the zzso zzso adjacent to the cell wall, the zzso and the zzso zzso These results suggest that, other than a possible role in plant defense, zzso could be involved in regulating zzso in the zzso
