We recently described an unknown zzso that is present on the zzso particles isolated from zzso rat zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the concentration of this zzso rises zzso over its concentration in the normal zzso In this report we have identified the zzso by partial zzso acid sequence analysis as zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso showed it to be composed of a series of molecular weight zzso of between 27 zzso and 31 zzso that increase 2 zzso in apparent molecular mass upon zzso zzso zzso has multiple zzso points between pH zzso and zzso apparently resulting from zzso zzso In the zzso unlike the human, little zzso is found in zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso in 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, and zzso showed that a variety of cells contained substantial levels of zzso The broad distribution of zzso suggests that it may play a general role in cellular zzso Moreover, many of the same cell types varied dramatically in their content of zzso in different zzso suggesting that the zzso or zzso of zzso by cells is zzso
