zzso zzso zzso nearly 150 million people, primarily in Africa, and is transmitted by select species of local zzso zzso These snails can host other related zzso species as well, so that effective detection and monitoring of snails infected with zzso zzso requires a successful differentiation between zzso zzso and any closely related zzso zzso To enable differential detection of zzso zzso DNA by simple zzso chain reaction zzso we designed and tested primer pairs from numerous newly identified zzso DNA repeat zzso However, all pairs tested were found zzso for this zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (but not from zzso zzso was ultimately accomplished by zzso using one primer from a newly identified zzso zzso and a second primer from a known zzso zzso zzso For evaluation of residual zzso zzso transmission after control interventions, this differentiation tool will enable accurate monitoring of infected snails in areas where zzso zzso is zzso with the most prevalent other zzso zzso
