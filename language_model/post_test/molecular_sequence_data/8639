To determine whether the growth of cardiac zzso during development is modulated by the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso the expression of IGF-1, zzso and zzso was determined in zzso from fetal and zzso zzso The expression of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and DNA zzso was also evaluated in combination with the zzso of DNA zzso In comparison with fetal hearts, at zzso day 21, zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso was reduced by 77, 70, 80, and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso protein decreased by zzso at 21 zzso zzso labeling decreased by 88 and zzso in the left and right zzso respectively, at this zzso Two different zzso zzso to zzso reduced DNA replication by 60 and zzso in zzso in zzso In addition, this intervention markedly attenuated the growth response of zzso to IGF-1 or zzso In conclusion, the zzso system appears to play a major role in the regulation of zzso growth in the heart in zzso
