The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso has been zzso Twenty-two peptides were isolated from the zzso digest of zzso and zzso employing the zzso double zzso zzso zzso of these peptides was achieved by analyzing the zzso peptides or zzso of zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of 248 zzso acid zzso and its relative molecular mass is calculated to be zzso zzso excluding the attached sugar chains reasoned to be present at each zzso zzso of positions 28, 33, 77, 84, zzso and zzso A comparison with the sequence of zzso zzso showed zzso sequence identity indicating that these proteins are zzso
