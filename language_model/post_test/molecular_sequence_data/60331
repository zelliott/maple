zzso zzso 1 zzso and its binding protein zzso are essential for the regulation of zzso repression pathways in zzso zzso In order to identify zzso zzso for the zzso complex, we examined the effects of deletion of the zzso gene on the zzso zzso Analysis by two-dimensional zzso mapping identified two distinct proteins that were greatly increased in zzso content in zzso zzso Mixed zzso sequencing identified these proteins as zzso II zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso of zzso extracts by zzso zzso identified zzso zzso activity in zzso strains that was selectively lost in the zzso zzso The zzso state of zzso and zzso zzso activity was restored to zzso levels in the zzso zzso by expression of a zzso fusion zzso In contrast, expression of zzso containing zzso at zzso in the putative zzso site motif zzso was unable to rescue zzso zzso in intact zzso or restore zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso targets zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and that the motif zzso zzso is necessary for its zzso targeting zzso
