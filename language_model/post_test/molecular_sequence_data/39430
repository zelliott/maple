It is well established that polarized zzso is essential for zzso zzso By contrast, the contribution of zzso is zzso We made use of a zzso zzso in the zzso target soluble zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso and demonstrate that zzso in zzso zzso is essential for the initial steps of zzso development, including zzso perception and zzso zzso Furthermore, spore formation and zzso were drastically reduced, whereas colonization of the plant was only slightly zzso The function of zzso in the recognition of mating zzso through the G zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in greater zzso zzso active zzso fluorescent protein zzso to the plasma membrane and is zzso zzso zzso zzso that are blocked in the fusion of zzso transport zzso with early zzso are impaired in zzso perception and zzso zzso zzso This is attributable to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and the depletion of the zzso from the zzso zzso strong zzso expression zzso the signaling defects in zzso zzso but subsequent cell fusion is still zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso is essential for recognition of the partner at the beginning of the zzso program but has additional roles in mating as well as spore formation and zzso
