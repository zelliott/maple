zzso contact between blood and artificial surfaces causes zzso zzso and zzso The aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of zzso zzso a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso in preventing zzso loss in guinea pigs undergoing zzso circulation zzso with bubble zzso In 15 guinea zzso an zzso shunt was created and zzso for 1 h from the zzso arch to the descending zzso The guinea pigs were divided into three groups: A control group receiving only zzso as an zzso zzso a low zzso group and a high zzso group receiving in addition to zzso and before starting zzso 1 or 7 zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso In the control group, the zzso count at 30 and 60 zzso of zzso was dramatically decreased (35 zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso of initial zzso In the low zzso group, zzso zzso partially prevented the drop in zzso count zzso zzso zzso and 54 zzso zzso p zzso zzso whereas in the high zzso group, the zzso count was normal at 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso and only slightly decreased at 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso pressure and zzso were not significantly different between groups during the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in guinea pigs provides an interesting zzso model for studying zzso loss by contact zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso loss during zzso in a dose dependent zzso
