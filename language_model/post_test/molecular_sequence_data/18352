To explore the possibility of regulating zzso processes in zzso coli cells, a series of plasmids directing the synthesis of zzso zzso complementary to different regions of the zzso gene was zzso The effect of these zzso zzso on the rate of degradation of abnormal proteins zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso in the bacterial cells was zzso The greatest zzso effect occurred in the case of a zzso complementary to the regulatory region at the zzso end of the zzso zzso The reasons for the differences in the efficiency of zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso are zzso
