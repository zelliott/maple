zzso zzso is a key zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso Using a zzso genetic strategy to create unique zzso class II zzso zzso we have obtained a number of novel zzso which display improved zzso zzso To engineer the zzso zzso zzso we constructed a synthetic zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso that was devoid of an internal zzso zzso zzso amplified zzso products zzso with zzso based on zzso zzso sequences zzso the deleted internal zzso were generated using zzso DNA isolated from soil and were zzso for the zzso internal zzso The zzso genes were expressed in a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Out of zzso zzso clones screened for zzso production, we obtained five different zzso zzso genes that produced more zzso than the native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels of in zzso activity, zzso All of the zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso with a slightly increased zzso fraction of zzso however, the zzso molecular weights zzso of the zzso in all cases remained almost the zzso Based upon DNA sequence zzso the various zzso fragments appear to have originated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence analyses showed that the zzso proteins had 17 to 20 zzso acid differences from the zzso zzso and these differences were clustered in the same positions in the five zzso zzso A zzso model of zzso developed based on zzso of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso acid zzso found in the active zzso were located mostly on the protein model zzso Thus, our zzso genetic engineering strategy proved to be broadly useful for improving the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso
