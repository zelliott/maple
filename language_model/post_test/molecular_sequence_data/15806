We have recently zzso a Mr 22,000 zzso protein zzso zzso to near zzso from human zzso zzso and characterized it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso and Takai, zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso in zzso This zzso G protein was present most abundantly among several G proteins in zzso and showed a Mr of about 22,000 as estimated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso This zzso G protein showed kinetic and physical properties very similar to those of the novel zzso gene product, having the same putative zzso domain as the zzso gene products, which we have recently zzso to near zzso from bovine brain zzso and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Takai, zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, the zzso map of the zzso G protein was identical with that of the zzso gene product and the partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso G protein was identical with that of the zzso gene zzso These results indicate that this human zzso G protein is the zzso gene zzso
