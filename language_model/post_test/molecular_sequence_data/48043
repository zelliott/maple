zzso is a zzso zzso exchange factor that was identified in a screen for genes that increase the zzso of T zzso cell lines zzso et zzso 1994, Cell zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso invasion and zzso 2 zzso symbol zzso with significant identity to the zzso region of the zzso and mapped it to zzso zzso is expressed as an approximately zzso transcript in zzso and as an approximately zzso transcript in the zzso and zzso The approximately zzso zzso message encodes a longer form of the approximately zzso zzso predicted zzso and both contain zzso to the zzso region zzso and zzso zzso regions of zzso We have zzso zzso and shown it to have zzso exchange zzso In zzso zzso demonstrate zzso expression in the zzso zzso of mouse zzso and in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso of adult mouse zzso
