zzso zzso proteins zzso are important pattern recognition receptors zzso in zzso innate immune zzso These immune proteins are capable of identifying and binding to specific targets on the surface of zzso and thereby trigger a variety of defense reactions through the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso immune signaling zzso In this paper, a full-length zzso of zzso coding for a zzso zzso domain was isolated from zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that it belonged to a new member of the zzso zzso The expression of zzso was investigated at various stages during the embryonic development of zzso zzso using real-time zzso and zzso zzso The result showed that the highest expression level was on the 10th day of the zzso The larvae showed a remarkable zzso of zzso transcript after challenged with zzso zzso In contrast, the level of zzso transcript in the larvae increased gradually after challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that during embryonic development, zzso protein was mainly expressed in the head, zzso and on the zzso canal zzso This new zzso member showed a zzso and regional expression during the early embryonic development of zzso zzso and may therefore play an important role at the adult stage, as well as during zzso
