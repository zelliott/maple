The zzso DNA binding protein zzso plays an important role in DNA zzso repair and zzso To study the zzso properties of zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso we have used the recently published zzso sequence to clone the zzso open reading frame by zzso and have developed an zzso zzso zzso comparison reveals that the zzso lacks many of the highly zzso zzso acids crucial for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso A highly zzso zzso important for zzso of zzso is represented by a zzso in zzso Similarly, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso required for stabilizing zzso complexes are represented by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, a group of positively charged zzso acids oriented towards the DNA binding zzso in zzso contains several zzso changes in zzso We show that in spite of these changes in the primary sequence zzso is similar to zzso in its zzso zzso It exists as a zzso it has the same minimal size requirement for its efficient binding to DNA and its binding affinity towards DNA zzso is indistinguishable from that of zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts with DNA in at least two distinct modes corresponding to the zzso and zzso modes of zzso interaction with zzso However, zzso does not form zzso with zzso zzso therefore presents us with an interesting system with which to investigate further the role of the zzso zzso acids in the biological properties of zzso
