A new zzso crystal form of zzso zzso has been determined in complex with a zzso zzso from influenza virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The three-dimensional structure was resolved to zzso A with an improved refinement and better geometry than two previously determined zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes, zzso a detailed description of the zzso zzso The binding pockets and the zzso zzso are structurally similar in all three zzso complexes of zzso zzso The zzso adopts an extended zzso zzso 100 to zzso and a type I reverse turn zzso 104 to zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso described here zzso well with previous zzso mapping zzso The structures of the free and zzso bound zzso illustrate the role of induced fit as a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a large zzso change, mainly in the zzso loop, upon zzso zzso As a result, the shape of the binding pocket changes substantially in the zzso zzso However, the backbone zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show no significant difference between free and bound zzso The zzso of the zzso loop is also maintained in all structures, but its position relative to the framework varies in different crystal zzso The availability of three X-ray structures of an zzso complex in three different space groups makes it possible to clearly distinguish between crystal packing and zzso binding as the cause of structural zzso Two distinct zzso zzso free and bound, are observed with no evidence otherwise for multiple zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or increased flexibility in either the free or bound zzso
