The aim of this study is to verify whether the combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is a candidate genetic risk factor for zzso liver failure, is common to that for the zzso mild zzso 

The zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined in 192 Japanese zzso treated with zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the subjects were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in 46 zzso and 62 zzso cases, and the mean values were approximately zzso and zzso higher than the upper limit of normal levels, zzso The levels of zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso than in zzso present zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The level of zzso was significantly higher in zzso than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and that of zzso was significantly higher in zzso and zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence the zzso 

These findings suggested that zzso rather than zzso was a risk factor for zzso mild zzso
