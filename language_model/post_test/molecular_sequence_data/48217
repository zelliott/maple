zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso type I zzso proteins belonging to an zzso zzso zzso by multiple zzso zzso They are expressed on immune cells such as mast cells, zzso and B zzso Two zzso of zzso have been classified according to the difference in the primary structure of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are designated as zzso and zzso In this study, the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso were shown to mediate zzso signal events such as zzso calcium zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso in rat mast cell line zzso The association of the zzso zzso gamma and beta zzso with zzso was shown to be responsible for zzso function but not required for membrane expression of zzso on zzso zzso We further revealed the role of two charged zzso acid zzso in the zzso region, namely zzso and zzso acid, in zzso function and its association with the above zzso In contrast to the zzso nature of the zzso zzso present findings reveal that zzso potentially acts as a zzso zzso in mast cells, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of mast cell functions by the zzso zzso
