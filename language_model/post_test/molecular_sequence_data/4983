zzso are specialized zzso found in most zzso cells, where their major functions are in cellular zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso of this zzso and induction of zzso zzso is a phenomenon that occurs in diverse species, and is zzso by a number of zzso and pharmacological zzso A large number of chemically diverse compounds, including zzso drugs and industrial zzso have been shown to cause zzso proliferation and the induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso exposure to these compounds produces zzso zzso however, the mechanism by which this zzso event occurs is zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso are induced when a fatty acid such as zzso is supplied as a carbon source in the growth zzso In addition, many zzso zzso are induced by growth on zzso these include zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This regulation occurs at the zzso level, and is controlled by specific zzso zzso The research in our laboratory has focused on the mechanisms involved in this regulation, and on the identification and characterization of the proteins zzso Our recent results, and current research directions are zzso
