A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from seawater collected from the South Sea zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso formed a lineage within the zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity to representative strains of the zzso zzso and was part of a distinct branch with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso algae zzso zzso zzso characteristics enabled strain zzso to be distinguished from zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the data presented in this study, strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso marina zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
