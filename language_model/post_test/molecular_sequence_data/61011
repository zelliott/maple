We have cloned and characterized zzso a novel tandem zzso in zzso that associates with the zzso throughout the cell zzso zzso zzso and live imaging of zzso transgenic flies show that zzso zzso to the zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and is zzso almost zzso on the zzso male X zzso compared to zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso together with human zzso defines a separate family of tandem zzso That zzso is a functional zzso was demonstrated by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Based on these findings, we propose that zzso may play a role in zzso control potentially by regulating zzso zzso
