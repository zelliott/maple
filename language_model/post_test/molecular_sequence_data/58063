Mouse mast cells zzso express at least four zzso zzso mast cell zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso mast cell zzso A zzso The previously zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated and found to consist of 5 zzso The zzso region of this gene is 89, 93, and zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso length zzso of these six mast cell zzso genes in zzso zzso mouse strains and zzso zzso were used to determine their zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are located on zzso 17 and 3, respectively, whereas the four mast cell zzso genes all reside on zzso 14 linked to a gene complex that encodes four zzso T zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso DNA zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso genes are within zzso zzso of each zzso Although zzso of the zzso zzso genes on zzso 14 may be important at a higher level of zzso organization, the ability to independently induce or suppress the zzso levels of the four zzso transcripts by treatment of mast cells with zzso suggests that gene zzso is not the most critical factor for coordinate expression of these zzso Because of the unique features of their zzso structures, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by genes at the zzso 14 complex are predicted to be more limited than those of pancreatic zzso and pancreatic zzso whose genes reside on zzso 8 and 6, zzso Based on present day zzso distribution and sequence similarities, we propose that a primordial gene that zzso a zzso zzso with restricted zzso specificity underwent extensive zzso and divergence to form a family of zzso transcripts from genes on zzso zzso
