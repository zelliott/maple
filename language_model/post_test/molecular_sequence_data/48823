zzso used classical zzso mouse strains have mosaic zzso with sequences from different zzso zzso Their zzso are derived predominantly from the Western European subspecies zzso zzso zzso with the remaining sequences derived mostly from the Japanese subspecies zzso zzso zzso However, it remains unknown how this zzso zzso zzso occurred during the establishment of classical zzso zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso originated from Japanese wild mice, and the ancestry of zzso was originally found in Europe and then transferred to zzso We compared the characteristics of these sequences to those of the zzso reference sequence and the recent data sets from the zzso of 17 zzso strains in the Mouse Genome Project zzso and the results unequivocally show that zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso provided the primary framework for the mosaic zzso of classical zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso and other classical zzso strains have long consecutive segments with extremely high similarity zzso to the zzso zzso In the early 20th century, Japanese waltzing mice with a zzso zzso resembling that of zzso mice were often crossed with European fancy mice for early studies of zzso which suggests that the zzso of the extant zzso strain provided the origin of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in classical zzso strains and largely contributed to its zzso zzso zzso
