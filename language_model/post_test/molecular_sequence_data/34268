Rev is an essential zzso regulatory protein which binds to the Rev responsive element zzso present within the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso This binding zzso the transport of the zzso to the zzso which in turn triggers the switch between viral zzso and active viral zzso Essential components of this complex have been localized to a minimal zzso rich Rev zzso and stem zzso region of zzso A synthetic zzso known as zzso binds with high binding affinity and specificity to the zzso than the Rev zzso however the zzso basis of this specificity has not yet been zzso The present study aims to probe the zzso origin of this specificity of zzso over Rev zzso for zzso The temperature dependent melting studies show that zzso binding zzso the zzso structure significantly zzso in contrast to Rev zzso Interestingly the zzso signatures of the binding have also been found to be different for both the zzso At pH zzso zzso binds zzso with a zzso zzso where zzso change zzso zzso is the main driving force with limited zzso contribution from zzso change zzso zzso A large part of zzso may be due to specific stacking between zzso and zzso In contrast binding of Rev zzso zzso is driven mainly by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which arises from major zzso changes in the zzso upon zzso
