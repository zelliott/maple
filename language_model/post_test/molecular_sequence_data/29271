The zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso is selectively expressed by a subset of T zzso zzso cells, and zzso To understand the mechanisms underlying this pattern of cell zzso zzso we initially identified alternative zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso end of the zzso zzso In this study, we focused on the zzso promoter and demonstrated this zzso region to be highly specific in governing restriction to zzso cell zzso This property of zzso is context independent and can extend to a disparate zzso zzso analysis defined a contribution of two separate elements located to the zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso regions of zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso part of zzso contains binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso factors and substitution mapping studies revealed a critical requirement of the zzso zzso The importance of zzso protein to regulate zzso zzso promoter activity was further established by zzso and zzso experiments in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso can zzso in part, to zzso cell restriction and further indicate that the zzso zzso sequence might be useful to direct the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso
