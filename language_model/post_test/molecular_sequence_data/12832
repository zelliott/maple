zzso related zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is identical to the zzso zzso In previous studies, we showed that various types of cultured tumor cells zzso with zzso zzso have low zzso and diminished zzso potential to the zzso More recently we used zzso procedures, zzso and reverse zzso to demonstrate that the level of zzso expression was zzso related to the clinical stage of a given zzso of the zzso In addition, we found that the primary tumors of almost 50% of the patients had higher zzso levels than their respective zzso zzso zzso In consideration of these findings, we have now applied reverse zzso to determine zzso gene expression in lung zzso We analyzed tumor zzso of 109 zzso 49 tumors were stage zzso 15 were stage zzso and 45 were stage zzso We found that 67 patients had zzso tumors, and that gene expression was reduced in the tumors of the remaining 42 zzso The overall rate of survival was zzso higher among patients with positive tumors than in those whose tumors had reduced gene expression zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso This also zzso to patients with zzso of the lung zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso analysis with the Cox zzso model indicated that zzso zzso correlated better with overall survival rate than did other zzso except zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that low zzso expression by tumors of the lung may be associated with poor zzso It is conceivable that testing for zzso may identify zzso lung cancer patients and patients with zzso who are at high risk for early disease zzso
