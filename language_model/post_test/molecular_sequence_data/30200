In zzso the zzso regulators, alpha 1 and alpha 2 have been proposed to be zzso zzso both of which have to interact with an additional factor called zzso or zzso respectively, to exert their biological zzso Although the zzso sequence requirements for alpha 1 and alpha 2 are different, their target sequences share a common zzso zzso or zzso is thought to act via this common DNA zzso therefore, it has been suggested that they represent the same zzso I zzso a protein that binds to this common promoter element by DNA affinity zzso The zzso protein is able to recruit the zzso zzso alpha 1 to its binding sites, suggesting that it is indeed zzso Further evidence is presented to show that zzso and zzso are the same protein and that zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso protein were zzso They identify the protein as a component of zzso complexes that formed with zzso promoter zzso Using these zzso the gene zzso the protein was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso The DNA sequence established that the gene zzso zzso is identical with a previously described zzso zzso zzso factor of unknown zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison showed further that zzso shares similarities with a zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso
