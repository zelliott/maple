In this study, we identified and characterized zzso alcohol zzso 3 from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso shares over zzso of its identity with the alcohol zzso of other zzso and exhibits the highest similarity of zzso with the alcohol zzso 1 of zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso zzso appears to be a zzso zzso as a zzso targeting extension exists at its N zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli showed similar zzso efficiencies for ethanol zzso and zzso zzso The zzso displayed zzso zzso with clear preferences for medium chain length primary alcohols and zzso for an zzso reaction and a reduction reaction, zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso gene was induced by ethanol in the culture zzso both an zzso zzso pattern analysis and an zzso activity zzso indicated that zzso is not the major zzso in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon zzso However, when the zzso zzso was zzso by an zzso expression cassette fused to a strong zzso promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the zzso strain in a zzso zzso In contrast, in a zzso zzso the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an zzso overproduction strain compared to that in the zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of zzso would be an ideal engineering target to develop zzso zzso as a zzso specific zzso production zzso
