Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and zzso studies were carried out on the hairpin form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso referred to as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso compound were assigned by means of nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso and correlated zzso zzso From a detailed analysis of the zzso data and of the zzso zzso the following conclusions are zzso zzso The hairpin consists of a stem of three zzso type base pairs, and the two remaining zzso zzso and zzso participate in a zzso zzso All sugar rings show zzso flexibility although a strong preference for the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The zzso does not stack upon the 3' side of the stem as expected, but swings into the minor zzso (This folding principle of the loop involves an unusual alpha zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso At the zzso zzso junction a stacking zzso occurs as a consequence of a sharp turn in that part of the zzso caused by the unusual beta + and gamma zzso zzso angles in zzso zzso zzso The A base slides over the zzso side of the stem to stack upon the zzso zzso at the 3' side of the stem in an zzso zzso On the basis of J zzso and a set of approximate zzso distances from zzso cross peaks, a model for the hairpin was zzso This model was then refined by using an zzso relaxation zzso approach zzso in combination with restrained molecular dynamics zzso The resulting final model zzso explains all the distance zzso
