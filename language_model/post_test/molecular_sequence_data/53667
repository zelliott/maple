The zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and G are components of the small nuclear zzso zzso U2, zzso and zzso that are essential for the zzso of zzso in zzso D1 and D3 are among the most common zzso recognized by zzso zzso an zzso population found exclusively in patients afflicted with systemic lupus zzso Here we demonstrate by protein sequencing and mass zzso that all zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats of the human zzso proteins D1 and zzso isolated from zzso small nuclear zzso contain symmetrical zzso zzso a zzso modification thus far only identified in the zzso basic zzso The further finding that human D1 individually zzso in zzso insect cells contains zzso zzso suggests that the symmetrical zzso of the zzso repeats in D1 and D3 is dependent on the assembly status of D1 and zzso In zzso binding studies, 10 of 11 zzso patient zzso tested, as well as the zzso zzso zzso reacted with a chemically zzso zzso zzso of D1 containing zzso but not with peptides containing zzso modified or zzso zzso These results thus demonstrate that the zzso C zzso of D1 forms a major linear zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and further suggest that zzso modifications of zzso proteins play a role in the zzso of systemic lupus zzso
