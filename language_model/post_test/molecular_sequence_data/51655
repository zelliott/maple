We have developed a novel system to study zzso by zzso zzso zzso I zzso I) of zzso zzso units within the zzso zzso For this, complete zzso units carrying specific zzso tags in both the zzso and zzso zzso genes were integrated into the zzso zzso zzso Using this novel system, we zzso the action of the zzso zzso in stimulating zzso within the zzso zzso We found that the zzso acts as a zzso element in both directions, mainly on its two most zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences between the zzso and the Pol I promoter in the zzso integrated unit indicated that this part of the zzso zzso contains no other zzso regulatory elements for Pol zzso We also applied the system to study the function of the zzso binding protein zzso For this purpose, we zzso zzso units in which either one or both of the binding sites for this protein have been zzso We found that zzso of both binding sites strongly diminish the zzso of the adjacent zzso The protein is hypothesized to play a crucial role in keeping the zzso zzso units in an optimal spatial zzso by zzso consecutive enhancers and promoters to the zzso zzso
