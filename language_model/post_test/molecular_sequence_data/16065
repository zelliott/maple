The usually small zzso B cell population is markedly increased in older mice by expansion of certain zzso This results in a cellular picture very similar to human B chronic zzso zzso Here we report a molecular analysis of the zzso gene zzso of the zzso B cell populations in zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso the number of clones found in the zzso (a major tissue source of zzso B zzso decreases with age till zzso or zzso is common by approximately 6 months, zzso many clones from different mice show the same size zzso at both the zzso heavy and light chain zzso and zzso the zzso zzso found in a clone isolated from the zzso of one mouse are a subset of those found in the zzso of the same zzso zzso migration occurs from the zzso to the zzso zzso cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso from the zzso clones of one zzso mouse revealed that all productive zzso used the identical zzso zzso and D elements joined to different zzso Indeed, two zzso zzso were recovered which were identical but for six zzso (N zzso zzso The conservation of zzso and D segment usage in the zzso of these zzso B cell clones could indicate some strong selective pressure for zzso expansion (for example zzso zzso operates via the zzso molecules of these zzso Southern analyses of other zzso zzso zzso mice with this cloned zzso and the usage of the same or similar zzso genes among a number of zzso B origin tumors in other mouse strains indicate the zzso of this repetitive zzso gene usage in individual zzso
