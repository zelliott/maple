zzso zzso zzso zzso are important members of the plant zzso They are zzso zzso that colonize the roots of most land plants and enhance host zzso zzso Many zzso themselves harbor zzso in their zzso and zzso Two types of zzso are known in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso limited in distribution to members of the zzso family, and zzso zzso zzso zzso widely distributed across different lineages of zzso The goal of the present study is to investigate the patterns of distribution and coexistence of the two zzso zzso and zzso in spore samples of several strains of zzso zzso Based on previous zzso we hypothesized that some zzso could host populations of both zzso To test this hypothesis, we performed an extensive investigation of both zzso in zzso margarita spores sampled from zzso zzso as well as in the Japanese zzso margarita zzso isolate using different approaches zzso zzso electron zzso zzso in zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso We found that a single zzso host can zzso both types of zzso with zzso population being more abundant, variable and prone to zzso than the zzso zzso Both zzso seem to retain their genetic and lifestyle peculiarities regardless of whether they colonize the host alone or zzso These findings show for the first time that zzso support an zzso bacterial zzso in which distinct types of zzso coexist in a single zzso
