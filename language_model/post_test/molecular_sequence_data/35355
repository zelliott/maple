The zzso zzso complex functions in general and zzso zzso degradation and is specifically recruited to zzso targets by zzso zzso We describe the zzso zzso protein crystal structure that, unexpectedly, forms intertwined and zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a coiled zzso that links an zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds zzso and this function is required for zzso degradation in zzso We further identified zzso surfaces required for zzso degradation, including the binding surface for the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The most remarkable structural feature is the presence of a zzso pocket at the zzso zzso which mediates binding to zzso in human zzso Together, our data reveal the structural basis for the interaction of zzso with zzso and the recruitment of the zzso complex to zzso targets by zzso zzso
