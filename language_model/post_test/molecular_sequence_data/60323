zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso virus zzso zzso in the zzso of chronically infected zzso by zzso viral DNA zzso However, after 6 to 12 months, zzso zzso begin to increase toward zzso zzso Three zzso zzso with zzso in the active site of the DNA zzso gene are present at this time zzso zzso Mason et zzso zzso zzso zzso We have asked if these zzso viruses were responsible for the zzso resistance and if their emergence caused an immediate rise in virus zzso Cell cultures studies implied that the zzso were resistant to zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not always zzso however, with an immediate rise in virus zzso in the zzso One of the three types of zzso viruses became prominent in serum up to 7 months before zzso in serum actually began to increase, at a time when zzso virus was still zzso in the zzso The two other zzso did not show this behavior but were detected in serum and liver later, just at the time that virus zzso began to zzso A factor linking all three zzso was that a similar duration of drug administration preceded the rise in zzso irrespective of which zzso ultimately zzso A simple explanation for these results is that the increase in virus zzso following emergence of drug-resistant zzso can occur only as the zzso zzso virus is cleared from the zzso population, allowing spread of the zzso Thus, prolonged suppression of virus zzso in the serum may sometimes be a measure of the stability of zzso infection rather than of a successful therapeutic zzso
