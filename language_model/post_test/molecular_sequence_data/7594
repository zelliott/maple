The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso contains at its zzso end a zzso zzso domain designated zzso Two functions have been proposed for zzso incorporation of the zzso accessory protein zzso into virus particles and virus particle zzso To characterize the role of zzso in the zzso life cycle and to map functional zzso within zzso we introduced a number of nonsense and single and multiple zzso acid substitution zzso into zzso Following the introduction of the zzso into the full-length zzso molecular clone zzso the effects on zzso protein expression and processing, virus particle production, and virus zzso were zzso The production of zzso virus particles was also examined by transmission electron zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso is required for efficient virus particle production from a full-length zzso molecular zzso zzso a zzso zzso located between zzso 7 and 10 of zzso is critical for virus particle zzso zzso zzso outside the zzso motif have little or no effect on virus assembly and zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso at a late stage in the budding process; and zzso zzso in zzso that severely reduce zzso production in zzso cells also block or significantly delay the establishment of a productive infection in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso of the viral zzso reverses the zzso zzso suggesting a functional linkage between zzso and the zzso processing of the zzso precursor protein during the budding of progeny zzso
