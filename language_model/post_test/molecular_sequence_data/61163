The zzso complex constitutes a protein conducting channel across the bacterial zzso zzso It binds the peripheral zzso zzso to form the zzso When zzso zzso in zzso segment 7 of the zzso zzso was replaced by a unique zzso zzso supported an increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, and allowed zzso of a zzso with a defective signal zzso zzso binds zzso with a higher affinity than normal zzso in particular in the presence of zzso The increased zzso activity of zzso was confirmed in a zzso system consisting of zzso zzso while zzso in zzso solution reveal that zzso complexes are more stable with zzso than with normal zzso These data imply an important role for zzso zzso segment 7 in zzso zzso As improved zzso binding to zzso was also observed with the zzso zzso zzso it may be a general mechanism underlying signal sequence zzso
