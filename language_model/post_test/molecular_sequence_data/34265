zzso structures are often stable, remaining unchanged in organization for the lifetime of a differentiated zzso Little is known about stable zzso structure formation, organization, or zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cones mediate cellular zzso zzso VI is necessary for building the dense zzso at the zzso zzso We test several ideas for zzso zzso mechanism of action using domain deletions or zzso zzso of zzso zzso The head zzso and zzso tail zzso zzso were both needed for zzso at the cone front and dense zzso zzso Several zzso zzso sites in the zzso tail previously identified in zzso zzso VI were critical for function in zzso zzso and promotion of proper zzso organization were zzso properties of zzso zzso A zzso zzso VI was able to zzso and function, indicating that functional properties are zzso Our data eliminate several models for zzso zzso mechanism of action and suggest its role is controlling organization and action of zzso assembly regulators through interactions at zzso zzso The zzso zzso of interaction partners previously identified for zzso zzso VI are likely not required, indicating novel partners mediate this zzso These data demonstrate that generating an organized and functional zzso structure in this cell requires multiple activities coordinated by zzso zzso
