To identify the zzso in the gap junction protein zzso gene zzso or zzso in the Chinese family with zzso dominant zzso cataract zzso 

All zzso family members and 100 unrelated control zzso undergone comprehensive zzso examination, and zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood (5 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso genes were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso products were then zzso directly for screening zzso zzso 

Upon zzso sequence analysis, a zzso transition at zzso 138 zzso zzso 2 of zzso was found, resulting in synonymous zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso at zzso 139 zzso in zzso 2 of zzso resulting in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso 47 zzso These two zzso were not seen in all unaffected members and 100 unrelated control zzso zzso analyses also showed that a highly zzso region was located at zzso Meanwhile no sequence variations for zzso were detected from the 3 affected zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene in a Chinese family with zzso is zzso
