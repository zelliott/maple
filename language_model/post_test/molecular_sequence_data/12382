zzso influence the zzso and prevalence of pancreatic cancer in humans and animal zzso To our knowledge there has been molecular demonstration of the presence of neither the zzso zzso zzso nor transcripts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was employed for molecular detection and measurement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso Total zzso obtained from zzso zzso seminal zzso and zzso of zzso and adult male and female rats, as well as zzso males zzso with testosterone zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso zzso Positive zzso to zzso zzso was obtained in all zzso zzso but not in the zzso However, a clear zzso zzso zzso zzso signal was obtained in pancreatic zzso after zzso synthesis using zzso zzso The levels of the zzso transcripts obtained by zzso in the various pancreatic samples were as zzso adult females and zzso animals zzso zzso adult males zzso adult males zzso zzso adult males zzso with zzso These results indicated that the pancreatic tissue possessed zzso activity of the zzso zzso although to a lesser extent than the typical zzso responsive zzso zzso and seminal zzso In conclusion, zzso activity of the zzso gene in the zzso seemed to be modulated by the zzso milieu in the tissue similar to that reported for the classical zzso zzso
