In the past decade, the small zzso zzso has received widespread attention as either a potential therapy or as a preventive agent for numerous age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular zzso cancer, hypertension, and diabetes, but the biological processes and molecular pathways by which zzso zzso these beneficial effects, as well as its safety and zzso remain largely zzso To explore the molecular mechanisms of zzso involved in the zzso of zzso dysfunction and vascular disease, in the present study the protein profile changes of human zzso vein zzso cells in response to zzso treatment were investigated using zzso approaches zzso combined with zzso As a result, four zzso protein species named zzso factor 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso and zzso factor, and five zzso protein species named heat shock protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Among them, two zzso protein species zzso and zzso were the most significantly changed (over zzso zzso was further verified to be dramatically zzso by zzso zzso It is notable that in the present study several protein species with zzso modification zzso zzso and zzso were found to be altered following exposure to zzso These findings may improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso
