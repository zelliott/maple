zzso zzso zzso DNA spanning an zzso gene zzso zzso (in zzso map region zzso was cloned and a composite zzso base sequence was derived from this DNA and from a corresponding zzso Based on genetic evidence, the zzso gene is thought to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso to a zzso message that encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with extensive similarity to zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence is considerably more like that of the zzso coli zzso than is the zzso of zzso zzso which has two zzso with, zzso zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that the zzso anomalous similarity between the zzso zzso and that from zzso coli may indicate horizontal exchange of genetic zzso On the basis of substantially greater conservation of sequences shared by all three species compared with those present only in zzso coli and zzso zzso we suggest that no radical zzso of zzso function accompanied the transition between the zzso and the zzso zzso
