To determine the prevalence and expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso species recovered from natural water reservoirs in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso species were tested for zzso production by the combined disk test using zzso and zzso disks as zzso and zzso or zzso acid as zzso The presence of zzso genes was investigated by zzso and sequencing using new consensus primer pairs designed in this zzso The zzso gene was found in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, whereas the acquired zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso On the other hand, production of zzso activity was zzso in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso seems to be intrinsic in the environmental zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Brazil, although, based on the combined disk test, not all of them are apparently able to express the zzso zzso 

These data confirm the presence of zzso zzso species in natural water zzso zzso of zzso diseases zzso to domestic and industrial uses of freshwater should be zzso from the increase of bacterial resistance point of zzso
