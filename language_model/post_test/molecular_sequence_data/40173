zzso zzso are typically low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso proteins with characteristic repeating zzso motifs zzso or zzso and a zzso zzso shape containing single zzso and zzso While functionally diverse, they play important roles in metals zzso zzso and the stress zzso The present study, combined with previous observations zzso Jenny et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005; zzso defines an unprecedented diversity of zzso primary structure and domain organization in the American zzso zzso zzso Two novel zzso zzso families are zzso One of these zzso is characterized by the presence of two zzso and the absence of zzso This family exhibits zzso expression during zzso development and is the dominant zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso displays low zzso levels of expression in adult zzso and only moderate responsiveness to metal challenges in both larvae and zzso A second novel zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso by zzso zzso techniques following a zzso immune challenge with zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on conservation of the zzso zzso this zzso appears to be a zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso A series of zzso acid zzso has resulted in four additional zzso which give rise to a zzso motif and three zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso is zzso upon sterile wounding and immune challenge, displays moderate expression in larvae and adults and differential gene induction in response to metals zzso
