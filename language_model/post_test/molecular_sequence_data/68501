To probe the zzso zzso zzso a number of point zzso were introduced in selected regions of human tumor necrosis factor zzso alpha by zzso zzso The zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli and analyzed for selective binding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors in competition with zzso zzso zzso zzso Generally, zzso in the loop from position 29 to 34 and at positions 86 and 146 zzso impaired binding to the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso in the region from 143 to 145 mainly affected binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic loss of binding activity to both zzso The selectivity for one or the other zzso type was found to be enhanced by combining two or three point zzso the effects of the single zzso with respect to zzso selectivity being at least zzso A combination of the zzso zzso and zzso yielded a double zzso zzso with zzso binding to the 55 zzso but no measurable binding to the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, combining the zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in a complete loss of binding to the zzso zzso zzso whereas binding to the zzso zzso zzso was impaired by only zzso In functional zzso selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso a full zzso response in human zzso cells and zzso of zzso 6 and zzso zzso factor in human zzso vein zzso zzso In contrast, stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso as well as with zzso zzso failed to induce these zzso
