The zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso zzso using zzso zzso with alkaline zzso and green fluorescent protein and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso prediction resulted in two models with 9 and 10 TM zzso zzso 32 fusion zzso were made between truncated forms of zzso and the reporter genes at 17 different sites throughout the zzso sequence to discriminate between these zzso Nine strong reporter protein signals provided information about the majority of the locations of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and showed that both the zzso and the zzso are located in the zzso Two ambiguous data points indicated the possibility of an alternative 8 zzso zzso This possibility was investigated using another 10 fusion zzso but no experimental support for the 8 TM zzso was zzso We therefore conclude that zzso has 10 zzso zzso Overall, the zzso which connect the membrane spanning segments are short, with zzso zzso being somewhat longer than the zzso zzso The study provides the first ever zzso derived structural information on a protein of the zzso family which constitutes one of the largest classes of zzso zzso
