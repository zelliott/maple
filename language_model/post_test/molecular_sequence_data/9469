Following the increase in development of protein zzso there is a growing demand for the sensitive and reliable zzso of these proteins in complex biological zzso such as plasma and serum to support zzso zzso In this field, zzso binding zzso zzso are currently the standard zzso technique, but in recent years, there is a trend towards the use of liquid zzso zzso with zzso mass zzso zzso One of the reasons for this trend is the possibility to use internal standards to correct for zzso zzso and thus improve the precision and accuracy of the zzso In the zzso zzso of small zzso internal zzso is quite zzso either a zzso labeled zzso form of the zzso or a structural analogue is zzso For the zzso of zzso zzso the situation is more zzso Since the protein of interest is zzso to a mixture of zzso one of which is subsequently used for zzso there are more options for internal zzso A zzso form or a structural analogue of either the intact protein or the signature zzso can be zzso In addition, a modified form of the zzso internal standard, containing one or more zzso groups is a possibility, and an internal standard can be generated during the analysis by using differential zzso zzso In this paper we provide an overview of the different options for internal zzso in the field of absolute targeted zzso of protein zzso using zzso based on literature from 2003 to zzso The advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches are evaluated both with regard to the correction they provide for the zzso of the different steps of the analysis and with regard to their generic zzso As most of the approaches used lead to acceptable results in terms of accuracy and precision, we conclude that there currently is no clear preferable method for internal zzso in the field of protein zzso by zzso It is essential, however, that any step in the analysis that is not covered by the internal standard zzso should be carefully zzso and zzso
