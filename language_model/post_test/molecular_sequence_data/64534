In the sea zzso zzso the zzso axis is specified after zzso by mechanisms that are largely zzso We report that early sea zzso zzso express zzso and zzso in the zzso oral zzso and demonstrate that these genes control formation of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso converted the whole zzso into oral zzso and induced zzso expression of the orally expressed genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when the function of zzso was zzso by injection of an zzso zzso zzso or by injection of zzso zzso neither the oral nor the zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso induced an zzso axis in a largely zzso zzso These observations suggest that the mechanisms responsible for patterning the zzso axis of the sea zzso zzso may share similarities with mechanisms that pattern the zzso axis of other zzso
