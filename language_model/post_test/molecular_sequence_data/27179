Human zzso zzso and zzso maintain copper zzso through regulated trafficking between zzso zzso zzso of these zzso causes zzso disease and Wilson disease, zzso In zzso disease, copper accumulates in zzso and causes zzso damage, indicating that the zzso zzso does not compensate for the loss of zzso zzso We show that this is likely due to a zzso regulation of zzso Unlike zzso (or zzso zzso which zzso from the zzso to export copper, zzso zzso does not traffic and therefore is unlikely to mediate copper zzso The lack of zzso trafficking is not on account of the loss of a zzso zzso or simultaneous presence of zzso in zzso zzso Rather, the zzso zzso appears 2-3 zzso smaller than zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells is similar to zzso protein in size and zzso The analysis of zzso zzso revealed a complex behavior of zzso 1 upon amplification, suggesting that it could be zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso 1 zzso differently in zzso and zzso cells, but does not fully zzso the zzso zzso We discuss factors that may contribute to zzso behavior of zzso and propose a role for zzso zzso in zzso copper zzso
