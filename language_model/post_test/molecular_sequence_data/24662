An important goal in biology is to predict from sequence data the high-resolution structures of proteins and the interactions that occur between zzso In this paper, we describe a zzso approach that can make these types of predictions for a series of zzso zzso Our method comprises a dual strategy that zzso extensive zzso sampling with molecular mechanics zzso To test the performance of the method, we designed six zzso coiled coils with a range of zzso and solved zzso crystal structures for three of zzso The zzso and structures predicted by the calculations agree very well with experimental zzso the average error in unfolding free energies is zzso zzso and zzso atoms in the predicted structures zzso onto the experimental structures with zzso zzso zzso zzso We have also tested the method on a series of zzso derived from zzso zzso The predicted relative zzso of the zzso show excellent agreement with previously published experimental zzso A critical step in our procedure is to use energy zzso to relax zzso zzso initially selected from a zzso zzso Our results show that zzso methods can predict interaction zzso that are in good agreement with experimental zzso
