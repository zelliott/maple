zzso zzso were designed for recovery of zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts from zzso zzso zzso The products were cloned and zzso constructed in a zzso display zzso zzso coli zzso was transformed with the zzso and upon zzso zzso of the predicted molecular weight could be detected in culture zzso by Western zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso displaying a zzso zzso were diluted into an excess of zzso carrying a human zzso zzso and then panned on plastic coated with zzso zzso Rapid enrichment of zzso carrying the zzso zzso through three rounds of selection demonstrated the successful display of an authentically folded pig zzso at the viral zzso The data demonstrate that zzso display techniques can be applied successfully to zzso zzso and that expression of zzso pig zzso in bacteria can be zzso These techniques offer the opportunity to generate authentic zzso zzso zzso for basic and applied zzso
