zzso is a newly identified nuclear protein that interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor I zzso The crystal structure of human zzso at zzso resolution shows it to be a member of the functionally diverse zzso zzso The structure comprises two zzso zzso with an zzso zzso bound within the cavity of the zzso zzso These findings suggest an zzso role for zzso most likely in biological zzso reactions involving zzso and provide compelling evidence that zzso requires the participation of the metal zzso for its interaction with zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the interaction with zzso in DNA zzso zzso of iron by heavy metals thus provides a novel zzso for these metals to directly influence gene zzso The structure suggests an interesting new role of iron in biology and that zzso may be involved in novel mechanisms of gene zzso
