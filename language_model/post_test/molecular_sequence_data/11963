zzso DNA zzso the putative mouse zzso for human zzso protein zzso a candidate contraceptive zzso was cloned and zzso The entire open reading frame zzso acids 18 to zzso of the mouse zzso zzso with the exception of the signal zzso zzso acids 1 to 17), was placed under the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso system to zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso A zzso tag, which was zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso provided the means for zzso of zzso by immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso zzso The level of purity of zzso thus obtained was determined by zzso gel zzso to be zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso previously generated against human or zzso zzso showed that zzso shared significant zzso similarity with its zzso zzso The position of zzso in the mouse zzso was next mapped through segregation analysis of an zzso zzso panel of 96 zzso zzso zzso gene symbol for zzso was localized in the zzso portion of mouse zzso 9 in a region that exhibits zzso with human zzso the region to which zzso zzso symbol for human zzso was previously zzso These zzso by combined zzso and gene mapping techniques established the cloned zzso to be the mouse zzso of zzso
