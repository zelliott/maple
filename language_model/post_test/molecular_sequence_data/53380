The influence of zzso structure on zzso has been investigated by constructing a series of zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso expressing the 14 zzso acid zzso zzso from human zzso 14 zzso at different positions on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of a zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso inserted into the zzso loop of the S protein revealed that, although the inserted zzso was free at its zzso it adopted a zzso distinct from that previously found when a similarly zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso loop of the S zzso Adjustment of the site of zzso within the zzso loop resulted in the isolation of a zzso in which zzso at the zzso of the zzso was much zzso zzso analysis confirmed that in this case the zzso was presented as a closed zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso presenting the zzso zzso as a closed loop had a significantly enhanced ability to bind to intact zzso particles compared with zzso raised against zzso presenting the same sequence as peptides with free zzso These results demonstrate that the mode of presentation of an zzso on a zzso carrier can dramatically affect its zzso zzso
