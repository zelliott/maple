zzso binding proteins play a crucial role in transporting zzso across the zzso zzso to zzso receptors within the insect zzso zzso In this study, the general zzso binding protein 2 gene was cloned from the antennae of zzso zzso using reverse zzso zzso and rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by Ni zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso is expressed mainly in adult zzso with expression levels differing with zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso as a fluorescent probe demonstrated that the zzso protein has binding affinity to a broad range of zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso the zzso component of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the most abundant plant zzso in essential oils extracted from host plants, had high binding affinities to zzso and zzso strong zzso responses from the antennae of zzso
