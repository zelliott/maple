The zzso fungus zzso commune has thousands of mating types zzso in part, by numerous zzso zzso and their G zzso zzso zzso combinations of zzso and receptors zzso by different mating types regulate a zzso of sexual development leading to mushroom formation and zzso A complex set of zzso interactions zzso the likelihood of zzso for example, a single zzso can activate more than one zzso and a single zzso can be activated by more than one zzso The current study demonstrates that the sex zzso and receptors of zzso when expressed in zzso zzso can substitute for zzso zzso and zzso and induce the zzso zzso response zzso through the zzso G zzso zzso of active zzso zzso requires some, but not all, of the zzso machinery used by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The specificity of interaction among zzso pairs in zzso was reproduced in zzso thus providing a powerful system for exploring molecular aspects of zzso interactions for a class of zzso receptors common to a wide range of zzso
