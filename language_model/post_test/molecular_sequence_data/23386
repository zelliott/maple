The marine zzso zzso zzso is a potential indicator zzso for evaluating marine environmental zzso The zzso zzso machinery of zzso zzso has been studied as a model of response to stress conditions and compared to the zzso coli zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were cloned into expression zzso and zzso was zzso It was found that zzso zzso possesses a unique organization of the zzso gene cluster zzso which is present exclusively in marine zzso zzso In zzso experiments showed that suppression of the zzso coli zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein was weak or zzso while suppression of the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins was zzso These results suggest higher zzso of the zzso zzso than the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso machinery of zzso zzso were zzso to zzso and their efficient cooperation with the zzso coli zzso in the zzso zzso reaction and in stimulation of zzso zzso activity was zzso Compared to the zzso coli system, the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso exhibited about zzso lower zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso protein was at least twofold higher than that of the zzso coli model zzso but its stimulation by the zzso zzso and zzso was significantly (10 zzso zzso These results indicate that, despite their high structural identity zzso zzso and similar mechanisms of action, the zzso zzso of closely related zzso zzso and zzso bacteria differ zzso
