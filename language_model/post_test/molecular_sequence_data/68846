zzso zzso was used to examine the importance of five zzso zzso acids localized in the putative zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the rat alpha 2 zzso The zzso were introduced into a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso rat alpha zzso which was zzso to zzso a zzso zzso and the effect of these zzso on zzso function was assessed by screening the altered zzso for their ability to zzso zzso resistance when expressed in otherwise zzso zzso The expression of the alpha zzso containing certain zzso at positions zzso and 925 was able to zzso zzso resistance to zzso cells while the expression of rat alpha zzso containing zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso was zzso In particular, zzso acids in each of these positions were zzso with zzso to evaluate the importance of the zzso side zzso The ability of rat alpha zzso containing zzso and zzso to zzso zzso resistance to zzso cells indicates that neither the negative charge nor the zzso side chain is absolutely essential for overall function in this zzso In contrast, the inability of rat alpha zzso carrying zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso resistance suggests that the naturally occurring zzso acid may be more critical structurally and/or functionally for the zzso Other more conservative zzso introduced to further characterize the role of particular zzso acid side chains include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
