In order to find new zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso channels, we examined the effects of zzso from zzso zzso on zzso zzso currents with the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso currents in cultured zzso zzso and zzso currents recorded from zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso channels were selectively inhibited by zzso zzso zzso No zzso activity was observed on zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We zzso and zzso three novel zzso peptides from this zzso which are related to previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and were named zzso zzso toxin zzso 1, 2 and zzso The mode of action of zzso on zzso zzso channels was studied in more zzso zzso inhibited zzso currents with an zzso of approximately 200 zzso and zzso current zzso was slowed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso also caused a zzso zzso dependence of zzso peak zzso and a shift of the zzso zzso to more positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso slowing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were accelerated by zzso as zzso from zzso tail current zzso zzso zzso channels, in which the zzso region between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso channel was replaced by the corresponding zzso domain, were sensitive to zzso Apparently, zzso can act as a gating modifier of zzso zzso
