zzso zzso of zzso or peptides that mimic complex bacterial zzso zzso represent alternatives to the classical zzso zzso vaccines developed so zzso zzso a better understanding of the molecular basis ensuring appropriate mimicry is required in order to design efficient zzso zzso zzso This study focuses on the following two unrelated sets of mimics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso known to mimic the average solution zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso three zzso selected upon screening of zzso zzso libraries with two protective zzso zzso zzso zzso of the A zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso By inducing zzso zzso upon zzso in mice when appropriately presented to the immune system, the zzso and peptides zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso were qualified as zzso of the native zzso zzso studies based on transferred zzso zzso experiments revealed that both kinds of zzso had an average zzso when bound to the zzso that was close to that of their free zzso Most interestingly, zzso transfer difference zzso experiments showed that the characteristic turn zzso adopted by the major zzso of zzso and zzso as well as of zzso are clearly involved in zzso zzso These latter experiments also showed that the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was a key part of the zzso recognized by the protective zzso Finally, by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso coupled to zzso information, models of zzso interaction were zzso Most interestingly, only one model was found compatible with experimental data when large zzso fragments were zzso into one of the zzso zzso This newly made available system provides a new contribution to the understanding of the molecular mimicry of complex zzso by peptides and short zzso
