In a recent zzso outbreak in Taiwan, zzso 71 was the culprit of encephalitis causing rapid clinical deterioration and death among young zzso 

Since knowledge of zzso 71 zzso infection in the central nervous system is still zzso the purpose of the present case study was attempted to uncover the zzso of the zzso 

We performed a detailed pathological examination, zzso and molecular studies on a case of zzso infection with a rapidly fatal zzso In addition, the whole zzso of the virus was zzso to determine the genetic relationships to other zzso and two other zzso strains (a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and to provide the genetic basis of its zzso of the new zzso zzso zzso 

zzso features of acute zzso were observed, with most prominent zzso in the spinal zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso on zzso zzso zzso was recovered from all zzso with inflammatory zzso zzso analysis showed that overall zzso and the two zzso strains shared zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso acid zzso It had only zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso identities with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The spinal zzso and brain stem were the main targets of zzso in the fatal cases in this outbreak, however, heart and zzso might also be zzso Since the zzso acid sequences in the zzso region are zzso zzso zzso among the three zzso strains as compared to other zzso and zzso these zzso zzso strains might share the same mechanisms of zzso and the mechanisms might be different from those in zzso
