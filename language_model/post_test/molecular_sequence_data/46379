zzso of zzso templates by viral zzso proteins is one of the key steps in the replication process of all zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, including primary zzso elements that are recognized by the viral zzso zzso are not well zzso Here, we used zzso zzso zzso with membrane zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso viral zzso system to investigate how viral zzso proteins recognize the zzso zzso zzso of the Red zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso proteins bound specifically to a zzso zzso element zzso located in the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso which also zzso with the zzso zzso complexes that contain viral and host zzso The zzso interaction recruited zzso to the membrane zzso zzso zzso fragments failed to interact with the zzso proteins supplied in zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso interacts with the zzso proteins coupled with their zzso Thus, the initial template recognition mechanisms employed by the zzso differ between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso elements are primary zzso of the differential replication zzso
