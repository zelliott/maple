zzso and zzso are two zzso of the family zzso that contain viruses that can cause acute zzso in zzso zzso zzso are genetically highly diverse but limited studies of the genetic diversity of zzso zzso have been zzso In this study we characterized zzso zzso detected in our laboratory from outbreaks or sporadic cases of acute zzso in children from different geographical locations and in adults involved in a cruise ship outbreak investigation and a nursing home zzso Based on significant differences of partial zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso the 25 strains were grouped into 12 genetic zzso including 9 potential new zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso gene of selected strains representing five potential new clusters supported this zzso Four strains zzso zzso Cruise zzso and zzso had zzso zzso acid zzso identity to each other and to the published sequences in the zzso zzso was almost identical to zzso whose zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso and distance analyses of the zzso region of the four new strains showed that zzso and zzso represent two new zzso and zzso and Cruise zzso belong to two new clusters within the zzso zzso Thus, based on the zzso sequences we propose to zzso the currently known zzso into nine genetic clusters within five zzso including one zzso that is represented by an animal zzso the zzso enteric zzso zzso
