Fast zzso channel zzso is thought to involve binding of zzso zzso in the zzso cluster zzso in zzso of the rat brain type zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed zzso and single channel currents from zzso channels with zzso within and adjacent to zzso clusters in zzso zzso of zzso by a series of zzso acids disrupted zzso to different zzso The degree of disruption was closely correlated with the zzso of the zzso acid at position zzso These zzso dramatically zzso the zzso state and also significantly slowed the entry into the zzso state, consistent with the idea that zzso forms a zzso interaction with a putative zzso during the fast zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso at position zzso or zzso in zzso lacking zzso did not restore normal zzso indicating that precise location of zzso is critical for its zzso zzso of zzso disrupted zzso zzso with large effects on the stability of the zzso state and smaller effects on the rate of entry into the zzso zzso zzso of several other zzso zzso did not destabilize the zzso state at zzso zzso indicating that the effects of zzso at zzso and zzso are zzso The double zzso zzso slowed zzso zzso at all zzso and accelerated recovery from zzso at negative membrane zzso Some of these zzso in zzso also affected the zzso to first zzso indicating zzso between zzso and channel zzso Our results show that the zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso cluster and the adjacent zzso are unique in contributing to the stability of the zzso state, consistent with the designation of these zzso as components of the zzso particle responsible for fast zzso of zzso zzso
