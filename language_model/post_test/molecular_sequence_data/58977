In the zzso zzso zzso the products of at least 15 genes are involved specifically in zzso transport from the zzso apparatus to the plasma zzso Previously, we have shown that three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso components of a zzso complex which zzso to the tip of the zzso the zzso site of zzso in zzso zzso zzso in three more of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to disrupt the zzso integrity of the zzso complex, indicating that these genes may zzso some of the remaining components of this zzso To examine this possibility, we cloned and zzso the zzso and zzso zzso disrupted them, and either zzso zzso them zzso or prepared zzso zzso zzso to them for zzso zzso zzso we zzso zzso the remaining unidentified zzso of the zzso complex for zzso zzso The genes zzso these components were identified by comparison of predicted zzso acid sequences with those obtained from zzso zzso of the zzso complex zzso In addition to zzso zzso and zzso the complex contains the proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso Since these seven proteins function together in a complex required for zzso and not other zzso trafficking steps, we have named it the zzso
