The functioning of Arctic soil zzso is zzso important for global climate, and basic knowledge regarding their zzso processes is zzso zzso zzso is the major limiting zzso in these zzso and its availability is strongly dependent on zzso However, microbial communities driving this process remain largely zzso in Arctic soils, namely those catalyzing the zzso step of zzso zzso zzso Eleven Arctic zzso were analyzed through a zzso approach, zzso determination of gross zzso rates, qualitative and quantitative marker gene analyses of zzso zzso zzso and bacteria zzso and enrichment of zzso in laboratory zzso zzso were the only zzso zzso detected in five out of 11 zzso and outnumbered zzso in four of the remaining six zzso The zzso identified showed great zzso diversity and a zzso association with the soil properties, reflecting an overall distribution associated with zzso type and with several zzso parameters zzso zzso the different gross zzso rates between zzso were associated with five distinct zzso zzso representing the great majority of known zzso diversity in soils, which suggests differences in their zzso zzso This was supported by selective enrichment of two of these zzso in cultures with different zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso provided the first direct evidence for zzso zzso by an zzso from an zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso are functionally zzso and that the selection of distinct zzso populations by the environment can be a zzso for zzso activity and N availability in zzso
