While the zzso zzso of diverse lineages of the zzso tuberculosis complex are available, zzso between gene prediction methods are still a challenge for unbiased protein zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis gene zzso is an example, where the most used zzso from two independent institutions zzso Institute and Institute of zzso zzso differ up to zzso in the number of zzso open reading zzso and zzso of the genes contained in both zzso have different start zzso Such differences emphasize the importance of the identification of the sequence of protein products to validate each gene zzso including its sequence coding zzso 

With this objective, we submitted a culture zzso sample from zzso tuberculosis to a zzso zzso mass zzso analysis and applied refined zzso prediction to perform comparison of two gene zzso From a total of 449 proteins identified from the zzso data, we validated 35 zzso peptides that were specific to one of the two zzso representing 24 different zzso From those, 5 proteins were only zzso in the zzso zzso In the remaining zzso the observed differences were due to differences in zzso of zzso start zzso 

Our results indicate that, even in a less complex sample likely to represent only zzso of the bacterial zzso we were still able to detect major differences between different gene zzso zzso This gives hope that zzso zzso techniques can be used to improve and validate gene zzso and in particular for zzso of zzso automatic gene zzso
