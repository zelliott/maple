A total of zzso unique zzso zzso clusters from two zzso libraries have been zzso Most significantly, only zzso zzso of the zzso unique clusters matched zzso (of zzso clusters in the zzso zzso zzso database, indicating that our zzso set is complementary to the existing zzso in the public database and will be invaluable in assisting the zzso of genes based on the upcoming zzso zzso zzso zzso search showed that zzso of our unique clusters matched zzso known or predicted proteins in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso representing approximately zzso unique zzso zzso clusters has been generated and used to profile the gene expression patterns across six different embryonic stages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of expression data using zzso zzso revealed that genes coding for zzso proteins displayed similar expression patterns, confirming that the coordinate gene expression is important for zzso Our results demonstrate that the combination of zzso technology with the zzso model system can provide useful information on how genes are coordinated in a genetic network to control zzso zzso and can help to identify novel genes that are important for zzso
