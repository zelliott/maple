zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso included among the most zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is divided into three zzso zzso zzso and zzso These classes are distinguished by zzso characters such as location of zzso canals, persistence of ligament zzso in zzso number and type of cement zzso in zzso number and size of zzso zzso host zzso and zzso To understand better the zzso relationships within zzso and between zzso and zzso we zzso the nearly complete zzso zzso genes of nine species from the three classes of zzso and four species of zzso from the classes zzso and zzso zzso relationships were zzso by zzso analyses of these new sequences and others previously zzso The analyses showed that zzso is the sister group to a zzso including zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a slower rate of evolution at the zzso level, as evidenced by shorter branch lengths for the zzso We found statistically significant support for the zzso of zzso represented in our analysis by species from the zzso zzso which includes the classes zzso and zzso zzso also appears as the sister group to zzso
