zzso necrosis factor zzso is initially zzso as a zzso zzso zzso protein that is further zzso to yield the soluble zzso zzso By using a zzso in zzso translated zzso precursor we detected a zzso zzso processing activity present in crude membrane preparations of zzso cells able to generate a zzso active zzso A similar processing pattern was obtained using zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, while a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor (a natural zzso zzso did not affect the in zzso zzso processing, zzso preparations containing high zzso of zzso zzso completely blocked this zzso The zzso sequencing of the reaction products obtained with either membrane preparations or zzso showed that zzso occurs in both cases between zzso and zzso These results together with cellular expression and zzso of zzso suggest a potential role for this zzso as an accessory zzso processing zzso
