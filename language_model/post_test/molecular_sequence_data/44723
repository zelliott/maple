zzso in zzso zzso is influenced by a number of environmental cues, including the nutritional status of the growing zzso zzso formation is normally observed when the fungus is exposed to zzso However, carbon limitation can induce zzso in zzso submerged in an zzso liquid zzso A zzso was previously isolated that could zzso in submerged culture without imposing zzso limitation and the gene responsible for this zzso zzso has now been zzso zzso exhibits sequence similarity to members of the sugar zzso gene zzso with greatest similarity to zzso zzso of zzso zzso with this structural zzso we find that zzso transport activity is altered in the zzso However, growth of the zzso in media containing alternate carbon sources does not suppress zzso in submerged zzso The properties of the zzso suggest that zzso is required for expression of zzso transport activity, zzso regulation of gene zzso and general carbon repression of zzso
