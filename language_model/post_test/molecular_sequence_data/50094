zzso the most zzso gene of the zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor with important functions in limb patterning and zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso expansions or zzso are believed to act by dominant negative or zzso mechanisms and are predominantly associated with zzso zzso Here, we describe two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that cause zzso zzso within the zzso Both are associated with distinctive limb zzso in which zzso of specific zzso zzso and zzso bones is the most constant feature, exhibiting overlap with zzso types D and zzso We investigated the binding of synthetic zzso proteins to zzso DNA targets in zzso No consistent differences were found for the zzso zzso compared with the wild type, but the zzso zzso (which resides at the 47th position of the zzso exhibited increased affinity for a target containing the core recognition sequence zzso but decreased affinity for a zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso indicates that this mixed gain and loss of affinity may be accounted for by the relative positions of zzso groups in the zzso acid side chain and target zzso
