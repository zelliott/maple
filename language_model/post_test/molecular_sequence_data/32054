Blood donors exhibiting a weak D or DEL zzso expression may be zzso zzso by standard zzso hence permitting incompatible zzso to zzso zzso zzso methods may overcome these technical zzso Our aim was to estimate the frequency of zzso zzso among the apparently zzso Polish donor population and to characterize its molecular zzso 

Plasma pools collected from zzso consecutive Polish donors typed as zzso were tested by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso for the presence of zzso markers located in zzso 4 and zzso 7 and zzso zzso individuals were characterized by zzso or zzso sequencing and zzso 

Plasma zzso strategy revealed 63 zzso donors harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among 47 cases available for zzso 27 were shown to express the D zzso 

1) Plasma zzso strategy is a reliable and cost-effective tool for zzso zzso 2) Only zzso of zzso Polish donors carry some fragments of the zzso zzso all of them were C or zzso 3) Almost zzso of the detected zzso zzso may be potentially zzso when zzso to a zzso zzso
