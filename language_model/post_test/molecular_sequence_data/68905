We developed a parallel zzso zzso gel zzso zzso protocol to maximize the detection of zzso zzso in the DNA sequence coding for the mature insulin zzso and in zzso site zzso The melting zzso of zzso 2 to 22 and zzso zzso sequences were zzso using two programs, zzso and zzso The data obtained from computer analysis were used to select zzso for amplification by zzso chain reaction and optimal zzso zzso The ability of this protocol to detect zzso changes at the zzso locus was assessed by studying amplified DNA of a patient with zzso whose zzso zzso were known and by screening the zzso gene for zzso in a population of unrelated zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that this zzso protocol is sensitive since it detected zzso sequence zzso reported to be zzso by means of parallel zzso zzso previously characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso locus of zzso zzso It is also simple as perpendicular zzso zzso gels are not zzso Application of this protocol will facilitate the search for molecular defects underlying the zzso of insulin resistance observed in genetic syndromes of severe insulin resistance as well as in other zzso zzso In addition, its ability to detect several regions of the zzso gene displaying a number of common zzso sites and being zzso will contribute to linkage studies in families with diabetic and/or zzso zzso
