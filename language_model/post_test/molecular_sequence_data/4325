A zzso zzso in the zzso envelope zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso known to be zzso converted from zzso of the zzso egg envelope zzso with the acquisition of egg zzso To characterize the protein core of zzso zzso zzso from zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and peptides isolated from the zzso were zzso for zzso acids to design zzso zzso for zzso chain zzso By reverse zzso chain reaction with a zzso zzso from the zzso of an zzso female zzso a specifically amplified band was obtained and zzso The upstream and downstream sequences of the zzso region were completed by zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends, zzso The zzso referred to as zzso zzso comprises zzso base pairs and contains one open reading frame with a sequence for 460 zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso has a close similarity with that of zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso is expressed in zzso particularly in the zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso strongly suggested that zzso is generated at least by processing of the zzso portion of zzso with zzso
