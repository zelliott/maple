Heat shock proteins zzso play essential protective roles under stress conditions by preventing the formation of protein zzso and degrading zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene product, is a representative member of a family of zzso that zzso protein zzso by interacting with early unfolding zzso The zzso crystal structure of the zzso zzso reveals a system of zzso patches, canyons, and zzso which may stabilize partially unfolded zzso The presence of a well zzso yet zzso zzso in each zzso zzso suggests a still unproven zzso function of the zzso A flexible extended zzso between the A and P zzso may play a role in zzso flexibility and zzso zzso The zzso sandwich of the zzso zzso shows structural similarity to zzso a zzso belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso sequence alignment indicates that zzso zzso can be divided in three classes based on variations in the P domain that dramatically affect both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
