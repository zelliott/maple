zzso is involved in a variety of biological zzso but the exact role of zzso in zzso responses is not clearly understood in higher zzso Here, we investigated zzso a hot pepper zzso zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso was rapidly induced by various zzso zzso including dehydration, and its zzso in transgenic zzso zzso plants zzso strongly enhanced tolerance to drought zzso zzso experiments with marker proteins revealed that zzso resides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso inhibited trafficking of an zzso zzso zzso from the zzso to the plasma membrane and reduced zzso levels in zzso and transgenic zzso This zzso reduction of zzso was inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso it in zzso Similar to zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso localized to the zzso and its zzso reduced the zzso protein level and inhibited trafficking of zzso from the zzso to the plasma membrane in zzso In addition, reduced expression of zzso zzso resulted in the increased level of zzso in zzso We propose that zzso and zzso play a critical role in the zzso of plasma membrane zzso levels by zzso zzso trafficking to the plasma membrane and subsequent zzso degradation as a response to zzso in transgenic zzso zzso
