A novel zzso has been isolated from pig zzso zzso by 3' and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends and designated zzso zzso protein zzso The open reading frame of this zzso covers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which show zzso identity with human zzso at the level of the primary protein zzso The zzso zzso sequence comprises eight zzso and seven zzso is approximately 22 zzso in size, determined by sequencing, and maps to pig zzso zzso zzso dot zzso and Northern zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso is strongly expressed in zzso zzso but is not present in heart, liver, zzso zzso muscle, or zzso A search for functionally significant protein motifs revealed consensus sequences for zzso zzso II zzso and zzso We observed a unique zzso acid sequence pattern consisting of the zzso zzso near the zzso portion of the zzso which is similar to the zzso zzso
