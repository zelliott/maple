zzso of zzso for the zzso alpha 7 zzso zzso identified two different sequences zzso zzso and zzso coding for the variable region between the III and IV zzso repeat zzso near the putative zzso zzso zzso of a mouse alpha 7 zzso clone established that the zzso and zzso regions are derived by mutually exclusive alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of alpha 7 zzso indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso were present in equal amounts in mouse skeletal zzso and adult zzso However, in adult skeletal muscle, the zzso zzso was exclusively zzso zzso acid sequence zzso in the zzso segment suggest that alpha 3 and alpha 6 are also alternatively spliced at this zzso We identified alternatively spliced zzso in a human alpha 6 zzso clone that zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the alpha 7 zzso domain indicated that this region was also alternatively spliced and like alpha 3 and alpha 6 could exist as the A or B zzso In mouse skeletal and cardiac muscle the B form of alpha 7 was strongly zzso However, we identified alpha zzso in zzso and adult skeletal muscle but not in cardiac zzso High levels of alpha zzso were detected in zzso zzso but in zzso zzso only the alpha zzso zzso was zzso These results indicate that alternative zzso of alpha 7 zzso is zzso regulated during development and generates zzso zzso chains with structurally and presumably functionally unique zzso and zzso zzso
