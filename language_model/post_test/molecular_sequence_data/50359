A fast method is described for searching and analyzing the protein structure zzso It uses secondary structure followed by zzso matching to compare protein structures and is developed from a previous structural alignment method based on dynamic zzso Linear representations of secondary structures are derived and their features compared to identify equivalent elements in two zzso The secondary structure alignment then zzso the zzso zzso which compares only zzso within aligned secondary structures and with similar buried areas and zzso zzso The initial secondary structure alignment improves accuracy and provides a means of filtering out unrelated proteins before the slower zzso alignment zzso It is possible to search or sort the protein structure zzso very quickly using just secondary structure zzso A search through zzso structures with a probe protein of 10 secondary structures required zzso CPU hours on a Sun zzso zzso combined secondary structure and zzso zzso with a zzso on the secondary structure score to remove pairs of unrelated proteins from further analysis, took zzso CPU zzso The method was applied in searches on different classes of proteins and to cluster a subset of the zzso into structurally related zzso zzso were consistent with known families of protein zzso
