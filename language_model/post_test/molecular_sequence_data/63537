zzso zzso zzso are small viral messages that are zzso by zzso zzso zzso viruses to allow for the translation of certain viral zzso zzso zzso two such zzso zzso via a premature termination zzso This zzso process involves the viral zzso zzso zzso terminating zzso zzso synthesis prematurely at internal zzso signals during copying of the viral zzso The zzso zzso zzso generated by the termination events then serve as templates for zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso structure in the viral zzso located just upstream from the termination site, is a critical component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed the role of this zzso structure in zzso efficient zzso zzso zzso Our results include the zzso zzso we define the minimum overall zzso stability required for an operational zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that the distribution of stability within an zzso structure affects its zzso zzso we establish that an zzso zzso structure can act as an effective zzso zzso zzso we prove that the zzso zzso structure forms and functions in the plus zzso zzso we provide evidence that a specific zzso zzso protein factor is not required for zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can be controlled artificially through zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso These findings provide important new insights into the premature termination mechanism and present a novel approach to regulate the zzso zzso
