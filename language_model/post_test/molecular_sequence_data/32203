The zzso of proteins zzso to zzso zzso via a zzso zzso membrane anchor zzso domain, to exert their zzso or zzso zzso In zzso both zzso family members, zzso and zzso contain an zzso In zzso the MA is necessary for the zzso of protein to zzso and for its zzso zzso zzso is highly similar to zzso but its zzso and function are not clearly zzso Here, we report on comparative analysis of zzso and zzso to decipher the molecular basis for their zzso zzso We show that these two proteins zzso to distinct zzso zzso zzso predominantly to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso are required for the targeting of zzso to zzso The zzso positively charged zzso present in zzso are absent in zzso which allows for its zzso to zzso The MA in both proteins is required for the correct targeting and zzso activities of these zzso Interestingly, a functional nuclear zzso signal was identified in the zzso region of zzso and in the absence of the MA, zzso accumulated in the zzso The functional implications of these findings are zzso
