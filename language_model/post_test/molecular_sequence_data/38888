We have reported zzso of the zzso zzso major coat protein zzso that enable high copy display of zzso and zzso zzso such as human growth hormone and zzso on the surface of zzso particles zzso zzso Weiss zzso Wells zzso zzso High copy display of large proteins on zzso for functional zzso J zzso zzso zzso Here, we explore how an zzso zzso zzso zzso could evolve the ability to efficiently display a protein fused to its zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso back to the zzso zzso zzso identifies a limited set of zzso zzso responsible for the high copy protein zzso These zzso zzso acids zzso a zzso zzso face on the zzso alpha zzso thought to be in contact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso combine to promote high copy protein display, which was further enhanced by zzso of the zzso between the zzso coat and the fusion zzso These data are consistent with a model in which protein zzso zzso allow for better packing of the fusion protein into the zzso zzso The high tolerance for zzso coat protein zzso observed here suggests that zzso zzso coat proteins could readily evolve new zzso
