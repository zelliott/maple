zzso is identified as a product of the gene zzso in a patient with zzso zzso syndrome of the Finnish zzso However, its precise zzso and function are not yet fully zzso 

To clone the rat zzso of zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was zzso To zzso the zzso and expression of zzso zzso analysis with a specific zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso and zzso protection zzso were zzso 

zzso acid sequences of rat and human zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso The domain structure of zzso is also highly zzso between rats and zzso The rat zzso was detected only in kidney zzso along zzso zzso walls, and its zzso was always identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal matured and fetal rat zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso pattern was clearly distinguished from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression for zzso was first detected in the fetal rat zzso at zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso expression decreased just after injection of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the zzso pattern of zzso shifted from a linear to a zzso pattern in both zzso zzso 

zzso is localized in slit zzso in the matured zzso and is identical with zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the development of zzso not only in zzso zzso zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso
