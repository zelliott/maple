Two related zzso initiation zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso were recently characterized for their capacity to bind specifically to zzso and inhibit its zzso Here, we determined the zzso zzso tissue distribution, zzso structure, and zzso zzso of zzso and human zzso and zzso Mouse zzso and zzso consist of 117 and 120 zzso acids and exhibit zzso 5 and zzso identity, respectively, to their human zzso zzso zzso is expressed in most zzso but is most abundant in zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle, while zzso zzso is zzso zzso The structures of the mouse zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso gene consists of three zzso and spans approximately 16 zzso In addition, two zzso zzso exist in the mouse zzso The zzso gene spans approximately 20 zzso and exhibits an identical zzso organization to that of zzso with the protein coding portion of the gene divided into three zzso There are no zzso for zzso The zzso locations of zzso and zzso were determined in both mice and humans by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso and zzso map to zzso 8 zzso and 10 zzso respectively, and human zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
