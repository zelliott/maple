Human pancreatic zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso of a completely zzso active site zzso acid were zzso All zzso proteins were shown by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to be zzso and the site of attachment was shown to be zzso by zzso mapping in conjunction with zzso Treatment of these proteins with zzso F demonstrated that they contained a single zzso zzso and yielded a protein product with a single zzso zzso zzso which could be zzso zzso of the crystal structure to a resolution of zzso A confirmed the location of the zzso group as zzso and showed that the zzso protein had essentially the same zzso as the native zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso and zzso zzso proteins were the same while the zzso values for zzso and zzso were zzso times lower than the zzso zzso The decreased zzso values for the zzso confirm that zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso activity of zzso presumably as the zzso zzso
