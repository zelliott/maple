To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso dominance, the expression patterns of genes that are zzso expressed in dormant zzso buds of pea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso We isolated two zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose corresponding genes were named zzso and zzso from a zzso library of dormant zzso buds using the differential display zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains 87 zzso and is rich in zzso zzso in the zzso terminal zzso A search of the protein databases failed to find any sequences similar to zzso protein except for the zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso mainly accumulated in dormant zzso buds and that its amount rapidly decreased after zzso of the terminal zzso In zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso was localized in the zzso zzso zzso and leaf zzso in dormant zzso buds that were competent to grow out but whose growth was temporarily zzso That is, the expression of the zzso gene is closely associated with the dormancy of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains 98 zzso acid zzso and is not similar to those of previously characterized zzso zzso zzso accumulated in dormant zzso zzso roots, mature leaflets and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in not only the dormancy of zzso buds but also the zzso state in various zzso
