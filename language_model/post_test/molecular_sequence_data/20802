Rice is a poor source of zzso such as iron and zzso To help clarify the molecular mechanisms that regulate metal zzso from leaves to developing seeds, we conducted suppression zzso zzso analysis in flag leaves of two rice zzso Flag leaves are the major source of zzso metals for developing zzso We isolated 78 sequences zzso in flag leaves at the grain filling stage relative to the zzso exertion zzso zzso expression of selected genes zzso 7 transport zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by quantitative zzso We show that zzso expression is zzso by natural zzso and induced zzso processes zzso zzso application, high zzso cold and zzso and its expression is not affected in the presence of zzso (a zzso zzso under zzso zzso Salt induction of zzso expression is abolished by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso This result and the presence of zzso elements in the promoter region of the zzso gene suggest an zzso zzso Using four different rice zzso we show that zzso zzso is higher and earlier in flag leaves and zzso of zzso plants, which have higher seed zzso of Fe, zzso and zzso We suggest that zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso factor and its function could be related to Fe, zzso and zzso acids zzso from green zzso to zzso
