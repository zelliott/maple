The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso from bacteria, collaborate with zzso to zzso zzso protein zzso but employ distinct mechanisms of zzso zzso How zzso and zzso coordinate zzso zzso with zzso is not zzso Here, we define zzso zzso loop zzso between middle domain zzso zzso 1 and 2 that are unexpectedly critical for zzso and zzso collaboration with zzso Surprisingly, the zzso and zzso MD zzso loop does not contact zzso but makes zzso contacts with zzso domain 2 zzso Thus, the MD does not invariably project out into solution as in one structural model of zzso and zzso zzso These zzso contacts as well as those between MD zzso 2 and zzso are different in zzso and zzso zzso contacts dampen zzso activity and must separate for protein zzso We demonstrate that zzso requires zzso more zzso than zzso requires zzso for protein zzso Thus, we reveal key differences in how zzso and zzso coordinate zzso zzso with zzso which likely reflects differential tuning for zzso and bacterial zzso
