Several zzso species have had their zzso completely zzso including four strains of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Nevertheless, little is known about the zzso sequences that control zzso initiation in these zzso zzso with the objective of investigating the promoter sequences of zzso zzso 23 zzso start sites zzso of distinct genes were zzso A pattern that resembles the zzso promoter zzso element was found upstream of the zzso However, no zzso element was zzso Instead, an zzso periodic signal was zzso About half of the zzso defined promoters contained the motif zzso which was identical to the zzso element usually found in zzso zzso The defined promoters were zzso to build zzso scoring zzso in order to scan putative promoters upstream of all coding sequences zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Two hundred and one signals were found associated with 169 zzso Most of these sequences were located within 100 zzso of the start zzso This study has shown that the number of zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso is more frequent than expected by chance, indicating that most of the sequences detected are probably biologically zzso
