The zzso of zzso zzso zzso is regulated in response to stimuli that affect the zzso potential of the zzso To further investigate the mode of regulation of the gene zzso zzso this zzso zzso regulatory zzso in a strain containing a zzso gene fusion were zzso The zzso strains expressed zzso under zzso conditions, whereas the zzso did zzso Furthermore, the zzso were not induced in response to the presence of iron zzso zzso or to the zzso cycling compound, zzso The zzso however, did respond to these zzso In zzso cloning was used to isolate the zzso regulatory elements from the zzso zzso and zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso region with either of the zzso zzso regulatory element resulted in the zzso expression of active zzso zzso zzso and restriction analysis revealed the presence of an zzso zzso element in the promoter region of one of the zzso zzso This zzso caused the displacement of the zzso region of zzso and the formation of a functional hybrid promoter consisting of the zzso region from zzso and zzso from zzso The second zzso (from zzso was similarly zzso and an zzso element was zzso The zzso site of zzso (in zzso was 6 zzso zzso upstream from the zzso site (in zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso was lower than in zzso This difference was almost eliminated in an zzso background, suggesting that the sequence zzso might be essential for negative regulation by zzso
