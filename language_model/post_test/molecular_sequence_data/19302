zzso are frequently used to describe the geometry and also the zzso composition of protein active zzso Here, the concept of graph alignment as a novel method for the structural analysis of protein binding pockets is zzso Using zzso zzso techniques, one is able to identify both zzso areas and regions of difference among different binding zzso Thus, using multiple graph zzso it is possible to characterize functional protein families and to examine differences among related protein families independent of sequence or fold zzso zzso zzso are described for the efficient calculation of multiple graph alignments for the analysis of zzso zzso representing protein binding zzso Additionally, it is shown how the calculated graph alignments can be analyzed to identify structural features that are characteristic for a given protein family and also features that are zzso among related zzso The methods are applied to a substantial high-quality subset of the zzso database and their ability to successfully characterize and zzso 10 highly populated functional protein families is zzso Additionally, two related protein families from the group of zzso zzso are examined and important structural differences are detected automatically and zzso
