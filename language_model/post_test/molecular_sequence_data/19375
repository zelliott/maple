zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as its sole source of carbon and zzso In our previous studies, we cloned and characterized genes zzso zzso for the conversion of zzso to zzso in zzso In this study, we analyzed a zzso obtained by zzso zzso and identified and characterized new genes zzso a putative zzso zzso essential for the zzso of zzso in strain zzso This putative ABC zzso consists of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that all the zzso genes are required, probably as a set, for zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, the zzso cells deficient in this putative ABC zzso showed zzso higher zzso degradation activity and greater zzso of the toxic dead-end product zzso zzso zzso higher sensitivity to zzso itself, and zzso higher zzso of zzso compounds than the zzso zzso These results strongly suggested that zzso are involved in zzso zzso by controlling membrane zzso This study clearly demonstrated that a cellular factor besides zzso zzso and zzso regulators is essential for zzso of zzso compounds in bacterial zzso
