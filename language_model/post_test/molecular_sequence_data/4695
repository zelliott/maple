The role of the zzso sensor positive charges in fast and slow zzso of the rat brain zzso sodium channel was investigated by mutating the second and fourth zzso positive charges in the zzso segments of all four zzso zzso Both zzso zzso (by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed in a zzso zzso the sodium channel alpha zzso To determine if fast zzso altered the effects of the zzso on slow zzso the zzso were also constructed in a channel that had fast zzso removed by the incorporation of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patton, zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso shifted the zzso fast zzso in the negative direction, with the largest effects resulting from zzso in zzso I and zzso These shifts were in the opposite direction compared with those observed for zzso The effects of the zzso on slow zzso depended on whether fast zzso was intact or zzso When fast zzso was zzso most of the zzso resulted in positive shifts in the v of slow zzso The largest effects again resulted from zzso in zzso I and zzso When fast zzso was intact, the zzso in zzso II and III resulted in negative shifts in the v of slow zzso zzso of the fourth charge in domain I or II resulted in the appearance of a second component in the zzso dependence of slow zzso that was only zzso when fast zzso was zzso These results suggest the zzso regions of all four zzso of the sodium channel are involved in the zzso dependence of zzso but to varying zzso Fast zzso is not strictly coupled to zzso but it derives some independent zzso sensitivity from the charges in the zzso zzso Finally, there is an interaction between the fast and slow zzso zzso
