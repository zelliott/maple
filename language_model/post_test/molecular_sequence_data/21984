The genes zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain and cloned into zzso coli strain zzso Four zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso containing zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso containing zzso were constructed and transformed into zzso coli strain for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequences of these zzso were analyzed and a putative zzso zzso sequence for the zzso active site was zzso The four zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso from the corresponding zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of pH and zzso zzso concentration on the zzso zzso were found to be zzso A kinetic model for the synthetic reactions of zzso was developed based on the zzso random rapid equilibrium zzso The kinetic parameters including the maximum reaction zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso The study on zzso zzso reported in this article are important to the proposed zzso for production of zzso zzso zzso that are used as precursors for in zzso DNA zzso There is a significant advantage of using zzso zzso of zzso as compared to the chemical method that has been in commercial zzso
