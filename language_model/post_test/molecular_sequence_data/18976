The Block 2 region of the zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been identified as a target of protective immunity by a combination of zzso and zzso population zzso zzso studies in small animals and zzso monkeys were used to determine the efficacy of zzso zzso derived from this region of zzso as a potential vaccine zzso zzso zzso zzso monkeys were zzso three times with a zzso zzso derived from the Block 2 region of zzso of the zzso challenge strain, zzso of zzso zzso using an zzso suitable for use in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso infected with zzso zzso using zzso from the zzso monkeys showed that the zzso Block 2 zzso induced significant zzso responses to whole malaria zzso zzso Block 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no significant differences in zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso animals were challenged with the virulent zzso zzso zzso isolate and monitored for 21 zzso Two out of four zzso animals were able to control their zzso during the follow-up period, whereas two out of two controls developed zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso measured by zzso were zzso higher in protected animals than in unprotected zzso In addition, zzso zzso mapping of serum zzso from zzso zzso showed distinct differences in zzso zzso between protected and unprotected zzso
