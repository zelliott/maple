zzso zzso is ubiquitous at the cell surface, where it is expressed predominantly on zzso of either the zzso zzso family or the zzso zzso zzso family, and has been proposed to function as a zzso for a number of zzso growth zzso Although little is known about functional differences between individual members of the zzso gene family, zzso in both the zzso gene zzso and the human gene for zzso strongly suggest that at least some zzso do function in cellular growth control and zzso In particular, deletion of the human zzso gene is responsible for zzso syndrome, and its associated zzso and zzso tissue zzso increased risk of zzso tumors during early childhood, and numerous visceral and skeletal zzso We have identified and zzso by sequencing of zzso clones and products of rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso an zzso that encodes a zzso member of the zzso gene family zzso that is most related zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso is detected as a zzso and zzso transcript in adult and zzso mouse brain total zzso and in zzso zzso results zzso transcript primarily to restricted regions of the developing central nervous system, zzso and kidney in patterns consistent with a role in the control of cell growth or zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso to zzso of the human zzso deletions of which are associated with human zzso syndrome, a zzso disorder with a pattern of defects that shows significant overlap with the pattern of zzso zzso
