zzso channels have been zzso as approximately parallel zzso of zzso zzso containing between N zzso 4 and 8 zzso per zzso zzso models were generated by in zzso restrained molecular dynamics zzso simulations, and were refined by 60 zzso MD simulations with water molecules present within and at the mouths of the central zzso The zzso zzso were stabilized by networks of zzso between zzso water molecules and zzso zzso Channel zzso were predicted on the basis of pore radius profiles, and suggested that the N zzso 4 bundle formed an zzso zzso whereas pores with N zzso or zzso 5 zzso per bundle were zzso zzso zzso calculations suggested that the N zzso 6 pore is zzso whereas pores with N zzso or zzso 7 zzso per bundle were predicted to be somewhat less zzso
