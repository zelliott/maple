A locus on human zzso zzso contains at least five tightly clustered genes which are unrelated by sequence zzso and apparently unrelated by zzso The genes for a putative zzso zzso zzso 1), a zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso the previously cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso and a protein of unknown function are found within 40 zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the former four genes are located within a 12 zzso region including a zzso island associated with the putative zzso zzso Three of the genes are widely zzso whereas the genes for the zzso and zzso are highly tissue zzso The distance between the zzso units of the gene upstream of zzso and zzso is only 199 zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso transcripts creates a zzso unit which zzso with the zzso oriented zzso zzso The selective advantage of this unusual gene zzso may involve zzso zzso and zzso events not yet zzso Given the current estimate of about 100,000 genes in the human zzso our findings support the notion that genes are not evenly zzso
