Development of zzso in mice infected with zzso zzso virus zzso requires expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are resistant to zzso zzso expression and therefore do not develop zzso zzso The zzso gene determines the zzso to zzso zzso We zzso the open reading frame of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso It differs by only one zzso zzso one zzso acid in the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of susceptible zzso and zzso zzso We excluded that the resistance of zzso mice to zzso zzso resulted from the absence of zzso zzso zzso by infecting zzso zzso zzso F1 zzso Therefore it is possible that the zzso acid that defines the zzso zzso is responsible for resistance of zzso mice to zzso zzso expression and to zzso zzso
