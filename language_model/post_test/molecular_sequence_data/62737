A group of zzso has been isolated and characterized from zzso fly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Members in this group appear to zzso proteins with zzso signal peptides at the zzso The mature putative proteins are small, basic proteins with calculated molecular weights that ranged from zzso to 10 zzso and zzso points from zzso to zzso zzso analysis indicated a strong selection for zzso that generate zzso acid changes within the coding zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that these genes are expressed only in the first zzso larvae, a critical stage that determines if the interaction between a specific zzso fly zzso and a specific wheat zzso is zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that multiple copies of similar genes are clustered within a short region on zzso zzso This is the same arm in which two zzso genes have been zzso
