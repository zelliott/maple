A flexible zzso zzso library incorporating the zzso site has been zzso DNA cut by any currently commercially available restriction zzso that generates a zzso zzso 3' zzso can be zzso into a specific clone of the zzso The zzso zzso recognizes a zzso zzso zzso zzso The central zzso are not zzso and form a zzso 3' zzso when cut by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso formed is not part of the zzso recognition zzso it is possible to generate a library of 256 different clones by introducing the zzso site, 151 of the possible zzso library have been isolated, including all 13 zzso clones in which the zzso formed by zzso zzso is complementary to those formed by currently available restriction zzso Of these 13 zzso zzso zzso of six clones results in zzso cohesive ends and should facilitate in zzso tandem gene zzso The zzso site is adjacent to the four zzso corresponding to the factor zzso recognition zzso Hence the zzso library could facilitate the expression of a fusion protein that could be zzso zzso by factor zzso
