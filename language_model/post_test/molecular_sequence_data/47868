A calcium binding protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 15 zzso is the zzso agent for zzso and has a very low sequence zzso zzso zzso with other known zzso Almost complete sequence specific resonance assignments for zzso zzso and zzso spins in zzso were obtained using double and triple resonance zzso zzso zzso interpretation of the nuclear zzso enhancements, chemical shift zzso and of hydrogen exchange rates threw valuable light upon the secondary structure of this zzso zzso is found to have two zzso zzso each of which consists of two pairs of zzso zzso Though this protein has a very small sequence zzso with zzso the zzso arrangement of the zzso and zzso in zzso resemble zzso
