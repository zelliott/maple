The zzso zzso system in zzso is comprised of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso previously called zzso protein zzso This work reports the cloning of the full-size zzso zzso zzso from soft coral zzso zzso its zzso and properties of the zzso zzso The zzso was zzso converted to zzso by simple incubation with zzso The zzso properties of this zzso zzso are determined to be practically the same as those reported for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso of proteins with only three of the zzso zzso having the zzso consensus zzso There is weak sequence zzso with the zzso zzso but only as a result of the necessary zzso loop zzso In combination with zzso zzso addition of only one zzso is sufficient to release the zzso as a zzso for the zzso for zzso This combination of the two proteins generates zzso with higher reaction efficiency than using free zzso alone as the zzso for zzso This increased quantum yield, a difference of zzso zzso and markedly different zzso zzso that a zzso complex might be zzso
