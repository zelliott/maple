In zzso zzso variation at the zzso zzso locus is a major zzso of natural variation in flowering zzso We have identified a zzso like protein zzso zzso with unknown function from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was increased in wild alfalfa under continuous cold conditions and the gene was expressed in all zzso including roots, zzso leaves and flowers, and weakest in flowers under zzso zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic zzso plants resulted in late flowering zzso under long day conditions or treated with zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was localized in the zzso zzso profiling of floral regulatory genes in zzso transgenic zzso showed enhanced expression of the flowering zzso zzso zzso C and decreased expression of one key flowering time genes zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso delays flowering time by regulating flowering genes expression under long day zzso
