We have recently described the isolation of zzso zzso zzso that bind selectively to zzso zzso forms of the prion zzso zzso from a number of zzso zzso These zzso inhibit the zzso of zzso forms of zzso in a zzso in zzso conversion zzso Here we identify the minimal portions of two of these zzso that retain binding zzso We determine their secondary structures by a combination of modeling and solution zzso Finally, we identify an internal site for zzso of a zzso synthetic zzso and use the zzso zzso in the detection of abnormal forms of zzso in zzso
