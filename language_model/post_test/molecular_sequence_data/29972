A method to enrich large size DNA fragments obtained by zzso with rare cutting restriction zzso was developed and applied for the isolation of a 150 zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso gene zzso The zzso DNA is rendered single stranded at the ends by zzso a strand specific zzso into an zzso plug containing zzso The plug is melted and solution zzso is then performed with a bridge zzso containing specific sequences from the end of a desired zzso linked to a common probe zzso The common probe sequence is zzso to a zzso zzso and the resulting zzso hybrid is retained onto a solid zzso containing zzso and specifically released by zzso zzso zzso of greater than 350 fold have been achieved zzso Such directed zzso of large DNA fragments without cloning can considerably zzso mapping and gene zzso in a complex zzso and facilitate the construction of zzso from defined regions of the zzso
