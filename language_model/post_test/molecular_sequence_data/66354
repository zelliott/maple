Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor 1 alpha in zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso analyses revealed that the genetic organization is unique for each of the zzso The number and size of the intervening sequences vary in these closely related zzso which suggests that complex genetic zzso gave rise to the zzso factor 1 alpha gene zzso zzso sequence data from restriction fragments isolated from the zzso and 3' ends of zzso and zzso confirmed the presence of a second intervening sequence in these zzso These data along with zzso zzso mapping revealed a region at the 3' end of the three genes which was predicted to be transcribed but zzso zzso zzso containing 19 bases were zzso to zzso to this unique trailer region in the zzso factor 1 alpha zzso These zzso were used as zzso in standard Northern analysis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells of several zzso zzso It was determined that all three genes were expressed in the cell zzso types zzso However, the accumulated level of transcript derived from each gene varied zzso with zzso zzso present in approximately twofold greater quantity than the zzso transcript and up to zzso greater quantity than zzso The level of zzso and zzso zzso varied little among the cell zzso types zzso whereas zzso zzso was present in twofold greater quantity in zzso than in either zzso or zzso cells which had been induced to undergo zzso to zzso These data suggest that there is differential expression of the genes zzso zzso factor 1 alpha in zzso zzso At least one zzso zzso shows a zzso pattern of transcript zzso
