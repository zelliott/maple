zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso involved in zzso zzso in zzso plants, and zzso zzso imposed by the specific function of zzso have severely limited sequence divergence in this zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso family recognizable across all zzso zzso We have determined the structure of the functional human zzso zzso which spans 22 zzso is divided into 10 zzso and maps to zzso The zzso portion of zzso 1 is zzso and contains potential binding sites for several zzso zzso zzso extension studies reveal zzso zzso initiation sites in liver, zzso zzso and zzso 250 and zzso zzso upstream from the translation start site and a second major site at zzso zzso zzso expression of human zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the absence of zzso and zzso patterns, a zzso sequence in the promoter region, and initiation of zzso zzso at more than one site indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso region, zzso 1, and a portion of zzso 1 show the characteristics of a zzso island, with the zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso responsive zzso motifs were present in this region, suggesting regulation by zzso via a mechanism similar to that associated with other genes involved in cholesterol zzso zzso of the human zzso gene structure with structures of other zzso and zzso zzso gene families shows that 7 of the 9 zzso zzso are located at unique zzso More than 80 zzso locations exist in zzso and zzso zzso gene families, and it seems very unlikely that all these zzso could have been present in the primordial zzso zzso
