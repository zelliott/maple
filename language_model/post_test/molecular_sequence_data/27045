zzso zzso are zzso zzso present in all organisms, that catalyze the reduction of zzso bonds in zzso By applying a zzso force to a zzso zzso the chemical mechanisms of zzso zzso can be examined in detail at the zzso zzso Here we use zzso zzso zzso to explore the chemical evolution of zzso zzso by probing the chemistry of eight different zzso zzso All zzso show a characteristic zzso mechanism that is detected when the zzso bond is stretched at low forces, but at high forces, two different chemical behaviors distinguish zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso reduce zzso bonds through a zzso transfer reaction zzso whereas zzso zzso show both zzso substitution zzso and zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso structures identifies the evolution of the binding groove as an important factor controlling the chemistry of zzso zzso
