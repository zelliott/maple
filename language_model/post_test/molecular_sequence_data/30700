The dominant zzso zzso results in a toxic gene product that leads to the zzso zzso of a small number of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso as well as changes in zzso gene dosage can delay or block the time of onset of the zzso zzso The zzso gene has been cloned and a partial complementary DNA reveals that the gene encodes a novel protein that may act as a membrane zzso Because the zzso loss of specific sets of zzso often as a result of dominant zzso is characteristic of several human neurodegenerative diseases, the analysis of the zzso gene and its zzso may provide a means of understanding the mechanisms underlying some of these human zzso
