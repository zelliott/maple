zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are the major zzso involved in the zzso of secondary zzso which have diverse activities, including roles as zzso factors in plant zzso zzso These zzso are activated by zzso at the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is also required for primary metabolism zzso zzso zzso In the zzso sequence of the cereal zzso pathogen zzso zzso we identified a gene zzso zzso to the zzso genes found in other zzso zzso The deletion of zzso in zzso zzso generated zzso zzso that were zzso for zzso unable to zzso zzso hypersensitive to zzso stress and significantly reduced in zzso to barley zzso zzso To zzso the zzso effects of zzso we also characterized deletion zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso (for zzso and zzso zzso in zzso iron zzso The zzso strain zzso showed no differences in zzso and zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced spot zzso symptoms, as produced by the zzso strain, when zzso on wounded barley leaves or when zzso was zzso The zzso strain showed a slightly reduced zzso compared with the zzso strain, but exhibited significantly higher zzso than the zzso zzso Our results suggest that an unknown zzso factor, presumably zzso by zzso or zzso which are activated by zzso is directly responsible for high zzso of zzso zzso on barley zzso zzso
