The role of zzso stalk zzso in modulating stalk zzso and shedding of membrane proteins remains zzso despite reports that proteins expressed in zzso cells undergo accelerated zzso We have constructed stalk zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a type I zzso that is vigorously shed when expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, stalk zzso did not significantly inhibit zzso Introduction of an zzso zzso directly adjacent to the native stalk zzso site resulted in a zzso zzso displacement of the zzso site, from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso stalk with a zzso sequence known to be heavily zzso produced a zzso zzso in which this zzso stalk was partially zzso incomplete zzso may have been due to membrane zzso Relative to levels of zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso release of zzso were enhanced compared with zzso zzso zzso was zzso at an zzso bond, 14 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso of zzso characteristics of regulated zzso zzso significantly blunted for zzso as was a formerly zzso transient stimulation of zzso release by 3, zzso These data indicate that zzso stalk zzso zzso but does not inhibit zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso stalk directs zzso at least in part, by an alternative shedding zzso which may resemble an activity recently described in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
