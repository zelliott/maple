zzso is a zzso which is zzso almost exclusively by zzso zzso IV in rabbit zzso zzso membrane zzso In order to delineate the mechanism of the transport of an intact zzso across the zzso zzso we studied the characteristics of the zzso of zzso in membrane zzso in which the activity of zzso IV was completely inhibited by treatment with zzso zzso In these zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso was found to be zzso but was greatly zzso by an inwardly directed zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso appeared to be an active process, because the time course of zzso exhibited an zzso zzso The process was also zzso being zzso by an zzso membrane zzso Under the zzso conditions there was no zzso zzso of zzso in the incubation medium when zzso zzso membrane zzso were zzso Analysis of zzso contents revealed that the zzso inside the zzso was predominantly zzso than zzso in the form of intact zzso These data indicate that the zzso of zzso from zzso in the presence of an inwardly directed zzso zzso represents almost exclusively zzso of intact zzso zzso transport of the zzso was also zzso in the presence of an inwardly directed zzso or zzso zzso but only if zzso was added to the zzso Under these conditions, zzso an zzso for zzso zzso and zzso was expected to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso but not by free zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso is the mechanism of zzso zzso in rabbit zzso zzso membrane zzso
