The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key branch point reaction in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this report, we describe the cloning of the zzso zzso The DNA sequence analysis revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso These are the first studies on a zzso of an zzso representative for the zzso zzso acid zzso Unlike in most other bacteria zzso so far, in zzso zzso the zzso gene is not adjacent located to the gene zzso zzso The zzso was zzso expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso coli and zzso to zzso Rate dependence on all zzso followed zzso zzso The apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso was zzso zzso The zzso also zzso in zzso the reverse reaction with apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso of 38 zzso The zzso showed a wide range of temperature for optimal activity zzso degrees C to 58 degrees zzso It was zzso after 15 zzso at 60 degrees zzso Its activity was not affected by addition of zzso (10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso
