zzso zzso zzso zzso produces three proteins recognized by zzso zzso against the S component of zzso zzso zzso and two proteins recognized by zzso zzso against the F component of this toxin zzso zzso of these proteins and cloning of the corresponding genes provided evidence for the presence of two zzso The first one, zzso zzso zzso consisted of two zzso open reading zzso zzso and zzso coding the class S and the class F zzso zzso The second one coded for a zzso and consisted of two zzso units, the first one zzso an zzso zzso a class S zzso and the second one zzso two zzso open reading frames identical to zzso and zzso class S and class F zzso respectively, from zzso from the reference strain Smith zzso It appears that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should not be confused with zzso from zzso zzso (another isolate of zzso zzso which had zzso identity with zzso and zzso from zzso The zzso of these five proteins led to six possible synergistic combinations between F and S zzso Two of these combinations zzso and zzso had zzso activity on rabbit skin, and all six were zzso on zzso zzso Only three were zzso on rabbit zzso the two zzso combinations and the combination zzso
