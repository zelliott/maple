ALS is a terminal disease of motor zzso that is characterized by zzso of zzso deposits in affected zzso zzso deposition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accounts for zzso of the familial ALS zzso zzso However, understanding the molecular link between zzso and disease has been difficult, given that more than 140 different zzso zzso have been observed in zzso zzso In addition, the molecular origin of sporadic ALS zzso is zzso By zzso the zzso acid sequence of zzso we identified four short segments with a high propensity for zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso in these segments do not reduce their propensity to form zzso The atomic structures of two zzso segments from the C zzso zzso and zzso reveal tightly packed zzso with zzso zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso Based on these structures, we conclude that both zzso segments are likely to form zzso if available for zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso impaired nucleation and zzso growth of full-length zzso confirming that these segments participate in zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that improper protein maturation and incompletely folded states that render these zzso segments available for interaction offer a common molecular zzso for zzso and zzso
