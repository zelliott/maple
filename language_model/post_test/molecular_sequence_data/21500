During limb zzso in zzso the zzso cells give rise only to structures zzso to the level of zzso This zzso identity can be regulated by zzso expression of Meis zzso or the three finger protein zzso 1 which acts at the cell zzso It has been suggested that Meis acts by regulating the zzso of zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso 1 promoter and selected two candidate sites for binding Meis zzso The sites were zzso in various combinations in promoters expressing a zzso reporter zzso The promoter activity was zzso by zzso zzso cells, a cultured zzso limb cell line that expresses both zzso 1 and Meis 1 and zzso The activity of the promoter was inhibited by zzso after zzso at Meis site 1, but not at Meis site zzso The promoter zzso were zzso into zzso limb zzso and the wild type promoter was more active in a zzso zzso than in a zzso zzso zzso The wild type promoter was significantly more active than a zzso zzso 2) zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso but the promoters were equivalent in zzso zzso zzso The separate site 1 or site 2 zzso were not significantly different from wild type in zzso zzso zzso thus contrasting with the site 1 results in zzso zzso These data provide strong support for the hypotheses that the zzso 1 promoter is regulated on the zzso zzso and that Meis zzso directly regulate the promoter on this axis during limb zzso in addition to cultured zzso
