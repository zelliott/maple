zzso the zzso of tumor cells to zzso cell death following chemotherapy is of importance to the outcome of cancer zzso Although the tumor zzso gene zzso is required for efficient induction of zzso by zzso agents, it is not the only zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms zzso zzso following chemotherapy via zzso or zzso pathways remain zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cell death gene zzso in zzso and human zzso zzso cells during zzso regardless of their zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso ICE gene zzso zzso in these tumor zzso The zzso induced by zzso treatment or zzso ICE zzso can be suppressed by the zzso ICE inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that ICE may mediate zzso induced by chemotherapy, and its induction could represent a novel approach for the effective treatment of zzso zzso
