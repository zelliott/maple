zzso factors containing the zzso have been shown to be important regulators of zzso gene expression in the zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso chain reaction zzso strategy, we have searched for similar factors that may be expressed in adult human pancreatic zzso This approach resulted in the amplification of sequences zzso the zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso (also called zzso The isolation of zzso zzso zzso revealed the expression of two zzso of this zzso factor termed zzso and zzso that are generated by alternative zzso Human zzso and zzso are composed of 360 and 265 zzso zzso respectively, of which the 225 zzso acids at the zzso are zzso The sequence of human zzso shows zzso zzso acid identity with mouse zzso zzso zzso showed low levels of expression of both zzso and zzso zzso in all adult human zzso zzso We also isolated and characterized the human zzso gene zzso and a related zzso zzso The human zzso zzso localized to human zzso 6 in the region of the zzso complex, spans about 7 zzso and consists of five zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and has been localized to human zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso amplification of human DNA indicated the presence of other zzso genes as has been previously noted in the zzso Two zzso which can be typed using zzso were identified in zzso which will facilitate genetic studies of this zzso
