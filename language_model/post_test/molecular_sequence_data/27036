zzso oxide zzso which is an important component of immunity to zzso zzso has both zzso and immune regulatory zzso We examined the way that this zzso interacts with zzso tuberculosis in zzso by screening for bacterial zzso that alter growth in mice that are unable to produce zzso NO zzso zzso the dominant source of NO during zzso We found that very few bacterial genes appeared to be specifically required for resistance to NO in zzso Instead, zzso in several zzso factors caused greater zzso in the absence of zzso Among these were zzso incapable of transporting the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso has been implicated in NO defense, this result indicates that zzso has other roles during zzso We additionally found that zzso transport is required for zzso in mice lacking zzso zzso Thus, zzso is important for resisting an zzso mechanism of zzso
