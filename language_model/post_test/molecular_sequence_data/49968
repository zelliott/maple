zzso of the structure of a leader zzso to control formation of an intrinsic termination signal is a common mechanism for regulation of gene expression in zzso zzso of the S box genes in zzso organisms is induced in response to limitation for zzso We previously zzso that zzso availability is monitored by binding of a regulatory factor to the leader zzso and suggested that zzso or zzso zzso could serve as the zzso zzso In this study, we show that efficient termination of the S box leader region by bacterial zzso zzso depends on SAM but not on zzso or other related zzso We also show that SAM directly binds to and zzso a zzso change in the leader zzso Both binding of SAM and zzso zzso termination were blocked by leader zzso that cause zzso expression in zzso zzso of SAM zzso in zzso zzso resulted in delay in induction of S box gene expression in response to zzso zzso consistent with the hypothesis that SAM is the molecular zzso in zzso These results indicate that SAM concentration is sensed directly by the nascent transcript in the absence of a zzso zzso
