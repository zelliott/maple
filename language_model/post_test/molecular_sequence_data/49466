Analysis of complex protein samples by two-dimensional zzso zzso is often more difficult in the presence of a few zzso zzso In zzso proteins such as zzso mask proteins of lower zzso as well as significantly limiting the amount of protein that can be loaded onto the immobilized pH zzso zzso In this paper the zzso a zzso zzso system, has been used to zzso human plasma of the highly abundant protein zzso under native and zzso zzso A three step protocol incorporating a charge separation to collect proteins with an zzso point greater than zzso and two size zzso to isolate proteins larger and smaller than zzso was zzso When the zzso depleted zzso were zzso on pH zzso zzso gels, proteins that were masked by zzso were revealed and proteins not seen in the zzso plasma sample were zzso zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso analysis confirmed the identification of the protein that lies beneath zzso to be zzso protein alpha zzso The liquid zzso from the zzso zzso were also zzso by liquid zzso mass zzso to confirm the proteins were separated according to their size and charge mobility in an electric zzso
