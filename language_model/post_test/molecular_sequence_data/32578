As demonstrated in this study, a zzso zzso separation platform not only is compatible with the zzso membrane protein preparation zzso but also achieves both the largest zzso membrane zzso coverage and the most comprehensive analysis of the zzso zzso to zzso By using a zzso false discovery rate for total zzso zzso a total of zzso distinct zzso proteins are identified from the zzso fraction with an average of zzso peptides leading to each protein zzso Among proteins identified from the zzso zzso 407 proteins are predicted to contain at least two or more zzso zzso using zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso Only four additional membrane proteins are identified in the soluble and zzso zzso affirming the utility of zzso extraction for enriching the membrane zzso By combining zzso results obtained from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso a single zzso zzso analysis yields the identification of zzso distinct zzso zzso corresponding to zzso theoretical zzso zzso coverage or zzso of proteins predicted to be expressed during zzso growth in rich zzso
