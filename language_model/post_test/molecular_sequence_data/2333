zzso zzso infected with zzso virus zzso can be activated to express zzso zzso by the introduction of the zzso Z zzso indicating that this protein has a pivotal role in virus zzso We examined the target specificity of the Z zzso in short-term zzso zzso and found that the most responsive target to Z zzso was the divergent zzso repeat promoter, located within the zzso zzso H zzso In contrast, target plasmids containing the cat gene linked to zzso viral promoters were not activated by zzso with the Z zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso from chemically induced zzso cells and from zzso cells zzso with zzso repeat zzso and Z showed that Z zzso increased the level of correctly zzso stable zzso zzso The zzso repeat gene zzso gives rise to a highly abundant zzso species after chemical induction of zzso virus zzso but no protein product had been previously zzso Using zzso zzso raised against a synthetic zzso from the zzso open reading frame, we demonstrated that the zzso gene encodes a protein product that is found in nuclear patches zzso with zzso A series of deletions introduced into the upstream sequences of the zzso revealed two separate zzso zzso The minimal promoter region between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso cap site and an upstream region between zzso and zzso were both independently capable of zzso Z zzso However, the minimal region, which was activated by Z zzso in zzso cells, was poorly responsive in zzso whereas the response of the zzso region to Z zzso was zzso zzso In its human host, zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso This dual lifestyle may have led to the evolution of multiple zzso signals that enable the Z zzso to interact with both zzso promoter and zzso zzso
