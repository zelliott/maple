zzso are zzso zzso zzso implicated in the regulation of tumor zzso zzso and cell zzso The 13 human zzso genes are clustered at zzso (3 zzso and zzso (10 zzso and share common zzso We show here that a zzso region on mouse zzso 13 contains at least 15 zzso genes compared with the three zzso genes within zzso zzso at human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso have characteristics of functional zzso and fall into three groups on the basis of similarity to zzso zzso or zzso The genes map between the mouse zzso of the zzso zzso interacting protein and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso in a region that contains the markers zzso and zzso They have the zzso structure typical of human zzso zzso zzso with identical zzso zzso Most show restricted patterns of zzso with common sites of synthesis being the zzso and immune zzso Compared with human, this larger mouse zzso repertoire probably reflects the need to regulate a larger zzso repertoire arising from differing evolutionary pressures on the zzso and immune zzso
