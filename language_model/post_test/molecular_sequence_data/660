zzso relationships between 22 spring zzso of carp virus zzso zzso from Austria collected between 1994 and 2007 were determined based on the partial zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso analyses located all Austrian zzso except one in zzso zzso One isolate collected in 2007 was placed within the zzso zzso zzso More importantly, the study also revealed 3 distinct clusters within zzso Id, designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso Id was supported by high zzso zzso The genetic zzso could neither be linked to host species nor to geographic zzso of fish zzso Furthermore, no clear link could be established between the pathological zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso division of the zzso was zzso zzso from the zzso cluster were mainly sampled in Austria in the 1990s and up until 2003, whereas all viruses from the zzso zzso were isolated after zzso
