A zzso zzso clone containing the most zzso 115 zzso of zzso arm zzso has been previously zzso This clone is of particular interest as it spans a potential candidate region for the Huntington disease zzso The zzso was zzso into a zzso zzso and a high-resolution restriction map extending to within 13 zzso of the zzso was zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso to human zzso spreads gives a peak of zzso on zzso but also an increase in the number of signals close to several other zzso Where possible, these results were investigated further by the zzso of zzso from the zzso to zzso cell hybrids containing single human zzso This analysis indicates that the most zzso 60 zzso of zzso arm zzso is zzso to zzso regions on zzso zzso zzso and zzso The extent of this zzso makes it less likely that the zzso for zzso disease is located within the zzso zzso zzso
