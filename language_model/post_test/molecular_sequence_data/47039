An improved method is presented for the preparation of zzso quantities of zzso zzso suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray zzso structural zzso zzso zzso transcripts are processed with a zzso zzso to yield zzso products that are then readily zzso by zzso exchange zzso liquid zzso This procedure eliminates the need for zzso zzso gel zzso which is the most zzso step in the standard procedure for large-scale production of zzso by in zzso zzso The zzso processing of the zzso zzso transcripts also substantially improves the overall yield and purity of the desired zzso zzso
