We previously identified four nuclear genes zzso in zzso zzso zzso in which zzso resistance to caffeine and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and found to be identical to the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso to zzso which encodes an zzso zzso zzso The zzso associated with caffeine resistance, zzso contains a zzso exchange that results in a zzso exchange in the zzso zzso export zzso domain of the gene zzso Due to this zzso the modified protein can not be exported from the nucleus back into the zzso and thus accumulates in the zzso The activity of zzso is shown to be necessary for manifestation of the caffeine resistance caused by zzso in the genes zzso and zzso We also cloned two genes that zzso caffeine resistance when carried on a zzso zzso One of them turned out to be a truncated zzso of zzso which codes for a zzso of the 26 S zzso The putative product of the other zzso designated zzso has a structure highly similar to that of MFS zzso It contains two groups of six zzso spanning zzso each, with the zzso motifs zzso PET and zzso in the fifth and sixth zzso These results are all consistent with our earlier hypothesis, which suggested that the zzso genes are functionally zzso in a complex zzso zzso zzso and zzso may also zzso parts of this zzso
