zzso represents a critical zzso in cell biology responsible for the overall zzso of zzso interactions and the triggering of cellular zzso zzso such as zzso activity, cellular zzso or zzso are frequently linked to the zzso state of a zzso This study explores the impact of zzso on the import and zzso of peptides into zzso Specifically, zzso import sequences such as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the nuclear zzso sequence from zzso large zzso were assembled into defined zzso zzso by fusing them to the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso peptides typically displayed between zzso and zzso enhancements in cellular import and zzso zzso properties in relation to their zzso zzso These peptides were not toxic to zzso zzso zzso results and zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso were the peptides most efficiently routed into zzso Their mechanism of import was subsequently examined on zzso viable cells using a combination of zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso These studies revealed that zzso zzso peptides bind to zzso zzso on the cell surface, are zzso at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, via a zzso pathway, and accumulate into zzso zzso zzso A fraction of these zzso peptides access the zzso and accumulate in the nucleus of zzso This study concludes that the zzso of proteins harboring zzso zzso chains may profoundly influence their ability to enter and be routed into zzso
