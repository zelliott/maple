The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso and 9 zzso common to the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso appeared during zzso in round zzso Two zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso pairs zzso of the human zzso gene zzso region cloned upstream of the zzso zzso gene were zzso into mouse zzso zzso of zzso activity in male and female transgenic mice showed that zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was sufficient to direct expression only in zzso Cell zzso experiments showed that zzso a zzso zzso zzso does not zzso the zzso zzso Using gel zzso zzso four zzso binding regions zzso were identified using zzso and liver nuclear zzso The zzso protein binding on zzso was selectively zzso by a probe containing a zzso protein DNA recognition zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed in zzso germ cells bound zzso zzso of the zzso motif in zzso abolished the zzso Moreover, binding of the high mobility group domain of zzso induced a bend within zzso Together, our results showed that zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter bind Sox proteins and contain zzso elements essential for the zzso specificity of zzso
