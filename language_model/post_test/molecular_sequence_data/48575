zzso virus B zzso family zzso zzso zzso has been studied in New World primates as a model for human zzso C virus infection, but the distribution of zzso and its relatives in nature has remained zzso Here, we report the discovery of a novel and highly divergent zzso virus in an Old World zzso the black-and-white zzso zzso zzso in zzso The new virus, zzso zzso zzso clusters zzso with zzso and recently described zzso infecting African bats and North American zzso and it shows evidence of ancient zzso with these other zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso from blood plasma from three of nine zzso monkeys yielded near-complete zzso zzso zzso two distinct viral zzso The viruses contain an exceptionally long zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately half of which codes for a protein with no discernible zzso to known zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein may serve a zzso function, similar to the zzso of other viruses within the family zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso reflecting an unusual degree of structural plasticity and zzso These findings shed new light on the natural history and evolution of the zzso and on the extent of structural variation within the zzso
