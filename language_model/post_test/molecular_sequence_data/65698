zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso are composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A 1095 zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells was expressed in zzso coli, and shown to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed a mass of 40 zzso 2 zzso corresponding to 40 zzso Da for the translated zzso whereas the zzso activity was assigned to a zzso zzso revealed closest relationships to zzso or zzso zzso at zzso and zzso identity zzso zzso respectively, with little similarity ( approximately zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso a single zzso zzso replacing zzso that is zzso in zzso zzso determines the zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed narrow specificity for zzso and did not zzso zzso zzso zzso or 3- and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was not zzso As zzso zzso zzso zzso also does not accept zzso zzso as a starter zzso the zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso is a key step in zzso zzso formation, zzso zzso from primary into secondary branch zzso and holds promise for zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso revealed expression of the zzso in all zzso of zzso plants, particularly in the flower and zzso mainly associated with vascular zzso This expression correlated with the pattern reported previously for expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
