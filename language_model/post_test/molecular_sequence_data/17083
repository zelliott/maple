zzso zzso zzso was investigated in a color variety of goldfish zzso zzso and its molecular basis zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified from an zzso strain of the zzso of which A1 and B1 displayed a large zzso difference on both native and zzso zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to zzso A1 and B1 were cloned and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso individuals, and their deduced zzso acid sequences were zzso zzso zzso acid variation occurred between zzso A1 and zzso with significant differences in zzso zzso theoretical molecular weight zzso and zzso point zzso No potential zzso sites were observed in the two zzso acid zzso which excluded the possibility that zzso difference might cause zzso variation among the zzso zzso Further analysis suggested that the distinct zzso mobility of the two zzso A1 and B1 by zzso resulted from their zzso difference, while the difference by the native PAGE could be explained by their zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso DNA fragments containing the zzso zzso were amplified and subjected to zzso analysis in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data revealed characteristic zzso patterns for each zzso zzso and demonstrated that the zzso zzso A1 and B1 could be used as a zzso marker zzso The initial work relating to the goldfish zzso zzso will benefit the understanding of the evolutionary and functional significance of zzso zzso in zzso
