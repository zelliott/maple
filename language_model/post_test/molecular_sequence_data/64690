zzso is a major target of zzso in type 1 zzso zzso responsive T cells recognize zzso within regions represented by zzso acids zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso are largely zzso and not well zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso display and zzso modeling to characterize the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso from a human type 1 diabetic zzso This zzso competes for zzso binding with zzso from the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes and therefore binds a region close to common zzso zzso zzso of peptides obtained after screening zzso zzso libraries with zzso zzso identified a consensus binding sequence of zzso The predicted surface on a three-dimensional zzso model of the zzso zzso domain of zzso was analyzed for clusters of zzso zzso and aromatic zzso and zzso acids contributing to the zzso investigated using zzso zzso zzso of each of zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso binding by zzso zzso of these zzso also inhibited binding of serum zzso from zzso zzso type 1 diabetic zzso This study identifies a region commonly recognized by zzso in type 1 diabetes that zzso with dominant T cell zzso
