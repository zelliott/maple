zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recently cloned and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso can be zzso zzso by zzso in 50 zzso zzso zzso pH zzso in a zzso manner at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso can be prevented by the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso slightly lower than its zzso zzso However, metals such as zinc and cadmium, which are zzso competitive zzso for zzso do not protect the zzso against zzso The protein has been labeled by using zzso in the presence or absence of zzso and the protein is fully zzso when zzso zzso group is modified per zzso of zzso zzso maps of the modified protein have been zzso The protected zzso has been identified and zzso and the zzso zzso acids have been zzso The modified zzso acid is zzso This zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not in bacterial species where it is replaced with zzso We therefore zzso zzso from zzso coli and showed that this zzso is not sensitive to zzso by zzso The zzso is presumably zzso zzso by zzso blocking the zzso zzso binding zzso Multiple sequence alignment procedures were used to try to identify potential zzso of the zinc atom that is essential for zzso activity and thus to delineate the active site zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
