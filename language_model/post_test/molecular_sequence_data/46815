We have isolated a zzso clone of the human zzso gene containing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region and the complete zzso zzso zzso The gene has eight zzso which span about 6 zzso on zzso zzso The zzso promoter has neither a zzso zzso box nor a zzso box motif but is zzso zzso Several putative zzso elements were identified, including three zzso sites, a zzso element, a zzso box, a zzso box, and an zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region showed that the core zzso promoter, consisting of 113 zzso zzso of the first zzso start site, was sufficient for zzso zzso This region contains only one of the zzso sites as well as the zzso element and zzso site, and although it is zzso rich, it does not contain any of the other putative zzso zzso In contrast, the mouse zzso promoter, while displaying a high degree of zzso with the human promoter, contains both zzso and zzso box zzso suggesting that, at least at the level of zzso zzso these genes may be zzso zzso
