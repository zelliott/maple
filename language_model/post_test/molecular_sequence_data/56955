zzso of zzso analysis, including the cloning and manipulation of large fragments of DNA, have opened new strategies for uniting molecular evolutionary zzso with zzso zzso We have begun the development of a physical map of the zzso of zzso zzso based on large DNA fragments cloned in zzso zzso A library of zzso zzso clones with average insert sizes of zzso zzso containing approximately zzso copies of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been constructed and zzso zzso zzso of the clones have zzso exceeding 50 zzso and approximately zzso have zzso exceeding 80 zzso A sample of 186 randomly selected clones was mapped by in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso A method for identifying zzso zzso clones containing zzso of zzso zzso genes has also been developed using zzso with specific zzso obtained from zzso zzso by means of the zzso chain zzso This method proved successful for nine of ten genes and resulted in the recovery of 14 zzso The zzso patterns of a sample of zzso clones containing repetitive DNA were also zzso A significant fraction of these clones zzso to multiple zzso sites but not to the zzso which is a pattern of zzso that is very rare among clones derived from zzso zzso The materials and methods described will make it possible to carry out a direct study of molecular evolution at the level of zzso structure and organization as well as at the level of individual zzso
