Strategies to expand regulatory T cells hold therapeutic potential for zzso T zzso zzso Recently, we reported that the requirements for T cell zzso signaling in conventional T cell and regulatory T cell proliferation are zzso Using zzso mice that display defective T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we hereby demonstrate that zzso zzso is required for zzso conventional T cell proliferation but not for zzso regulatory T cell zzso This led us to zzso that in conjunction with zzso pharmacological zzso of T cell zzso zzso zzso might offer a novel therapeutic strategy to expand regulatory T cells while simultaneously zzso conventional T cell zzso Indeed, using the zzso inhibitor zzso A to inhibit signaling downstream of zzso we found that zzso A attenuated zzso zzso proliferation but permitted zzso regulatory T cell expansion zzso and zzso Furthermore, the combination of zzso A and zzso was superior over either zzso A or zzso zzso in protection against the T zzso zzso zzso disease mouse model, experimental zzso zzso Thus, a combination of zzso signaling zzso and zzso might be a beneficial strategy in expanding regulatory T cells and zzso conventional T cell proliferation in zzso zzso
