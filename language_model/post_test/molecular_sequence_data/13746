We isolated expressed sequence tags zzso on the long arm of zzso zzso The zzso were mapped by zzso using a zzso zzso mapping zzso Of a total of 55 zzso 30 mapped back uniquely to zzso 21, 7 mapped back to other zzso including zzso 21, 8 mapped back to zzso other than 21, and 10 could not be assigned using this zzso The 30 zzso zzso markers so isolated represent useful zzso zzso A rapid zzso method was used to delineate the expression pattern of these 30 pairs in different zzso
