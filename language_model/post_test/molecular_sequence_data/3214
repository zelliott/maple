We have recently described the presence of a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso zzso with an increased zzso frequency zzso in the lungs of zzso zzso zzso zzso In four out of 11 independent zzso zzso zzso the high zzso frequency was found to be zzso with the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of two additional zzso zzso mismatch repair genes and the zzso by zzso of deficient zzso of these two putative zzso zzso mismatch repair genes zzso and zzso We also describe the zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso genes responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso Seven out of the 11 zzso strains were found to be defective in the zzso system (four zzso two zzso and one zzso In four cases (three zzso and one zzso the genes contained zzso zzso The fourth zzso strain showed a zzso zzso zzso after the 10th zzso of the zzso zzso and a 54 zzso deletion between two eight zzso direct zzso This zzso involving domain II of zzso was found to be the main one responsible for zzso zzso The second zzso strain presented a zzso zzso equivalent to zzso in zzso coli zzso a zzso known to be essential for its zzso zzso Finally, the zzso strain had three zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso binding site of the deduced zzso zzso showing defective mismatch repair zzso Interestingly, cells carrying this zzso zzso exhibited a fully active zzso zzso zzso The results shown here indicate that the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso genes and that their zzso results in a zzso zzso
