The zzso zzso mustard zzso zzso and its zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso are both zzso In this study, both zzso were shown to rapidly zzso the zzso consensus binding sequence incorporated in a zzso zzso The reaction was essentially complete within 10 zzso under the conditions employed in this study and zzso of the zzso were zzso at least once using 500 zzso HD and 1 zzso zzso Progressive zzso of the consensus sequence was zzso by a decrease in zzso factor zzso Under reaction conditions which zzso approximately zzso of the zzso at least once, the binding of cloned human zzso was reduced by 93 and zzso by HD and zzso respectively, compared with control zzso The interference with binding is a result of zzso of the DNA and not damage to the zzso factor by mustard or its zzso zzso zzso with zzso factor binding would be expected to have a profound influence on the ability of the cell to function normally and to respond to DNA damage and may contribute significantly to the skin damage produced by these zzso
