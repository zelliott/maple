zzso type I zzso cells form the major surface for gas exchange in the zzso To explore how type I cells differ in gene expression from their zzso zzso type II cells, we analyzed zzso regulation of zzso a gene expressed by adult type I but not type II zzso In zzso zzso patterns of zzso expression in lung and brain suggest active gene zzso We cloned and zzso zzso zzso pairs of the zzso promoter that can drive reporter expression in lung zzso cell zzso zzso analyses identified regions important for lung cell zzso The base pair zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso differential regulation in lung zzso cells compared with zzso zzso alignment of this zzso with type zzso zzso protein B and C promoters shows similar consensus elements arranged in a different zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso cell line nuclear zzso zzso zzso factor I zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to characterize zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso The zzso site binds factors with binding properties similar to zzso zzso nuclear zzso proteins but different from zzso or zzso zzso with a zzso expression zzso moderately zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these three binding sites showed reduced zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso several regulatory sequences involved in type II cell gene regulation are also present in the zzso promoter, suggesting that genes of the peripheral lung zzso may be regulated by similar zzso
