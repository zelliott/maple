A distinguishing characteristic of cells of the zzso lineage is the expression of the zzso zzso zzso that zzso the synthesis of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a library constructed from the pigmented zzso melanoma cell line zzso zzso of zzso in mouse zzso zzso led to synthesis and expression of active zzso and, unexpectedly, to stable production of zzso zzso was zzso and stored within zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso detected a zzso zzso transcript in nine of nine zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso transcripts of the same size and abundance were detected in a subset (three of zzso of zzso zzso melanoma cell lines, suggesting that zzso events are important in regulating zzso zzso Two zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso and zzso that are specifically located within zzso and are zzso with zzso activity, did not react with zzso mouse zzso expressing human zzso supporting the conclusion that these zzso zzso are distinct from the zzso zzso coded for by zzso
