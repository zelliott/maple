zzso the only known zzso zzso to employ zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and protein zzso with zzso zzso zzso Here, however, we describe a novel zzso zzso containing a remarkably divergent zzso zzso zzso displays a 15 zzso acid zzso in its zzso domain and the zzso and essential zzso zzso which interacts with zzso in all other known zzso zzso is zzso by zzso Despite these zzso zzso is biologically zzso It has a subtle role in growth, so that zzso cells are gradually lost from the population when they are zzso with parental cells, and zzso analysis identified several genes that are either zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The best zzso of these, zzso 1, is a marker of the zzso transition and it is zzso during growth and early development of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins occurs by mutual zzso zzso interactions and zzso triggers zzso nuclear zzso Despite its zzso zzso domain, the zzso protein sediments at the size expected for a zzso and it is zzso enriched in the zzso Moreover, these properties are retained when the predicted site of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso These observations suggest a zzso mode of zzso of zzso that does not rely on zzso zzso zzso zzso
