zzso of the zzso zzso is an important mechanism of synaptic zzso Here, we show that the C zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by protein zzso C and that zzso is the major zzso zzso This zzso also occurs in human embryonic kidney zzso cells by addition of zzso zzso Our zzso experiment revealed that the zzso of zzso in zzso drastically reduced the affinity for zzso zzso protein zzso a synaptic zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso of zzso zzso in zzso controls the zzso of zzso receptors at zzso zzso and consequently contributes to synaptic zzso
