zzso DNA can be isolated from the plasma of healthy subjects and from patients with zzso The aim of this study was to detect zzso zzso in DNA extracted from the plasma of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso and plasma DNA were extracted from 14 patients with zzso cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected using a zzso chain reaction zzso that uses zzso zzso to amplify zzso zzso These results were confirmed with another zzso chain reaction zzso that creates an zzso restriction site in the absence of a zzso zzso followed by direct sequencing and additional cloning zzso 

Seven patients zzso had a zzso 12 zzso zzso within their primary zzso and identical zzso were found in the plasma DNA of 6 patients zzso zzso DNA was not detected in the plasma specimens of 7 patients whose tumors tested negative for zzso zzso or in healthy control zzso Similar results were obtained using all three molecular biological zzso 

zzso abnormalities can be detected in circulating DNA extracted from the plasma specimens of patients with zzso zzso If these results are confirmed in larger studies, genetic analysis of plasma DNA may have clinical applications in the zzso
