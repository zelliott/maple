We have used a rat model of zzso zzso cancer to identify a gene that shows decreased or lost expression in five of eight independently transformed rat zzso surface zzso cell lines compared to the normal zzso zzso zzso we refer to this gene as zzso zzso on transformation 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso The most abundant transcript of the gene is approximately 6 zzso This sequence contains a zzso open reading frame and, within the 3' untranslated region, 22 near-perfect zzso repeats and zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from the open reading frame contains seven zzso motifs of the zzso type, as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene maps to the short arm of zzso one in the zzso zzso shows a limited distribution of expression in normal rat zzso including zzso which shows abundant zzso Furthermore, examination of DNA derived from multiple species indicates that the gene is widely zzso
