Based on cultural and zzso tests, a total of 84 strains zzso clinical and 12 environmental zzso from the Caribbean zzso Europe, and the Indian zzso were identified as members of the zzso zzso complex zzso They were further characterized with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system, and this was followed by selective amplification of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gave zzso results; 63 were identified as zzso zzso 5 were identified as zzso zzso and 24 remained zzso by both zzso Fourteen zzso gave zzso results, as they were zzso positive but gave negative results by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a detailed molecular analysis of all zzso zzso zzso zzso strains plus 5 zzso zzso zzso was performed by zzso analysis zzso of the zzso gene and zzso zzso gene zzso The results confirmed the reported zzso of zzso zzso as only 6 of 19 zzso zzso gave zzso results compatible with published zzso zzso profiles while the rest of the zzso were grouped in four previously unpublished zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing showed that only 8 of 19 zzso zzso were related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the rest being related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have characterized a significant number of MAC zzso which were not identified by the zzso test, zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, all of them were identifiable by zzso zzso (they were zzso negative and zzso zzso and could be tentatively identified as zzso zzso based on previously published zzso It is noteworthy that the majority of such zzso zzso of zzso were from the Indian zzso with 12 of 14 being environmental zzso Our study confirms the marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso and shows the utility of in-house zzso zzso to detect this group of zzso which would otherwise have been missed by the zzso system in a routine clinical zzso zzso
