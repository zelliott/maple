The structure of human zzso releasing factor zzso has been determined by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso in a zzso system of zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and 37 degrees zzso Nearly complete resonance assignment was achieved by using standard two-dimensional zzso zzso restraints for structure calculations were obtained by qualitative analysis of zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso were obtained from the distance restraints by distance zzso followed by refinement using molecular dynamics and were completed with zzso hydrogen exchange zzso The structure of zzso in this zzso comprises an extended zzso zzso connected to a zzso zzso between zzso 6 and zzso The first half of the zzso zzso zzso is clearly zzso The five zzso zzso are predominantly zzso
