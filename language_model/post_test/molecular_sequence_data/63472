This tutorial review looks at the design rules that allow peptides to be exploited as building blocks for the assembly of zzso These design rules are either derived by copying nature zzso zzso or may exploit entirely new designs based on zzso derivatives zzso zzso zzso zzso We will examine the features that can be introduced to allow zzso to be controlled and directed by application of an zzso applied zzso such as zzso light or zzso zzso zzso the applications of designed zzso zzso systems in biotechnology zzso cell culture, zzso and technology zzso zzso will be zzso
