We cloned the part of the bovine zzso gene which contains the zzso region, zzso 1, zzso 2 and zzso 1 to analyze its promoter zzso The zzso zzso region of the bovine zzso gene consisted of three zzso and two zzso and its organization was similar to that of the zzso rat and sheep zzso zzso The zzso region of the bovine zzso gene from the zzso start site to zzso position zzso was zzso + zzso zzso and contained three potential binding sites for the zzso factor zzso but no zzso or zzso This region showed high zzso zzso with that of the sheep zzso zzso but relatively low zzso zzso zzso with the same region of the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso The position from zzso to zzso within the zzso region of the bovine zzso gene showed major promoter zzso However, this region was able to function properly only in collaboration with the region at zzso to zzso of zzso 1 of the bovine zzso zzso
