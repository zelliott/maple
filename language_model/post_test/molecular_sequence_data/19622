zzso approaches aimed at detection of a zzso of zzso in the environment routinely rely on zzso zzso zzso zzso genes amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso with broad zzso The general method of sampling and zzso DNA has been to clone then sequence the zzso zzso However, the number of clones required to adequately catalog the majority of zzso in a sample is zzso zzso zzso target sequences to a universal zzso zzso gene zzso may provide a more rapid and comprehensive view of zzso community zzso This study investigated the breadth and accuracy of a zzso in detecting diverse zzso zzso gene sequence types compared to zzso using three environmental zzso urban zzso subsurface soil, and subsurface zzso zzso products generated from universal zzso zzso zzso zzso were classified by using either the zzso method or by zzso to a novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso zzso The three clone libraries comprised zzso high-quality zzso zzso zzso of the clones could not be placed into a known zzso and were considered zzso The zzso results confirmed the majority of zzso zzso and additionally demonstrated greater zzso diversity extending into zzso not observed by the cloning zzso zzso matching operational zzso units within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were uniquely detected by the zzso were verified with specific zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso richness detected by the array corresponded well with zzso richness predictions zzso from clone libraries except in the water community where zzso richness predictions were greatly zzso It was concluded that although the zzso is unreliable in identifying novel zzso zzso it reveals greater diversity in environmental samples than sequencing a typically sized clone zzso Furthermore, the zzso allowed samples to be rapidly evaluated with zzso a significant advantage in studies of microbial zzso
