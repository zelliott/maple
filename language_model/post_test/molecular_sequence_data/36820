A zzso zzso doesn't form hairpin or interior loop and forms a double zzso of 12 base pairs including the four successive zzso base pairs, zzso in the zzso zzso base pairs, zzso and zzso are nicely incorporated in zzso duplex maintaining the regular zzso zzso There exist the good overlapping between base pairings, zzso and zzso so as to stabilize the zzso base pair zzso zzso bond networks involving water molecules in the major and minor grooves to stabilize this mismatch base pairing zzso are observed and its zzso features are zzso
