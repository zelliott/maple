A zzso zzso designated zzso that specifically kills zzso cells was zzso to zzso and shown to be identical with zzso zzso The specificity to zzso cells stemmed from the ability of zzso A to competitively antagonize the zzso effects of zzso zzso 6 and zzso zzso further zzso with the zzso zzso of acute phase proteins by zzso human zzso cells and with the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso A competition binding zzso indicated that zzso did not interfere with the binding of zzso to its zzso on zzso cells, suggesting that it may act by intervening in the signal zzso zzso of the growth zzso Indeed, zzso addition of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells was followed by sustained zzso of zzso gene until cell death occurred, while zzso alone caused a transient increase zzso This altered response to zzso stimulation was accompanied by a moderate increase in zzso protein zzso Thus, in this study, we identified the zzso growth zzso zzso as being zzso A of zzso zzso It is shown that zzso A is an zzso of zzso functions and that it zzso the zzso signaling zzso
