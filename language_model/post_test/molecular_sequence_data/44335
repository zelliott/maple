Many plasma membrane proteins destined for zzso are concentrated into zzso pits through the recognition of a zzso motif in their zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of isolated zzso complexes binds specifically, but rather zzso to proteins bearing the zzso zzso We now zzso using peptides with a zzso probe, that this binding is strengthened significantly when the zzso complex is present in zzso zzso indicating that there is zzso between zzso interactions and coat zzso zzso with a zzso at the zzso position of the zzso ring, but not other zzso also increase the affinity of the zzso complex for the zzso zzso zzso is the first protein known (in any zzso to interact with zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso recruitment can be coupled to zzso coat assembly and suggest a mechanism for regulation of membrane traffic by zzso products of zzso zzso
