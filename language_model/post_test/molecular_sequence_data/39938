zzso of the European white birch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important cause of hay zzso The main zzso is zzso v 1, member of the zzso class 10 zzso zzso zzso To establish the number of zzso v 1 genes and the zzso diversity within a single tree, zzso amplification, cloning and sequencing of zzso genes was performed on two zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were attributed to putative genes based on sequence identity and zzso zzso Information on zzso was derived by comparison with zzso zzso sequences available in zzso zzso of zzso families is accompanied by a high risk for the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso We screened for and excluded these artifacts, and also detected putative artifact sequences among database zzso 

zzso different zzso sequences were recovered from zzso zzso and assigned to thirteen putative zzso zzso zzso suggests that three genes were transcribed in zzso tissue and seven genes in zzso The zzso of three other genes remains zzso In total, zzso different zzso v zzso zzso were identified in the three zzso of which nine zzso were entirely zzso zzso with high and low zzso are zzso by different genes and one birch zzso grain has the genetic background to produce a mixture of zzso with varying zzso zzso diversity is even higher in the zzso zzso hybrid, consistent with the presence of two zzso 

zzso of the major birch zzso zzso v 1 are zzso by multiple zzso and we propose to name them zzso The present characterization of the zzso v 1 genes provides a framework for the screening of specific zzso v 1 genes among other zzso zzso zzso or zzso species, and for future breeding for trees with a reduced zzso zzso towards zzso and zzso should anticipate that patients are exposed to a mixture of zzso v 1 zzso of different zzso even if zzso originates from a single birch zzso
