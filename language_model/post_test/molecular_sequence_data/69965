zzso zzso are zzso second zzso which are generated during zzso zzso of zzso The model zzso zzso zzso is an effective topical tumor promoter in zzso zzso mouse zzso We now report that zzso of zzso zzso examined contain an zzso zzso in the 61st zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso affect the zzso expansion of activated zzso zzso To explore further the zzso zzso expansion of activated zzso cells, we have examined the zzso effect of zzso in the skin of transgenic zzso mice, which harbor a zzso zzso By 9 weeks of promotion, zzso of the zzso mice developed zzso zzso and by 15 weeks these mice developed zzso 20 zzso Because fatty acids are known to participate in signal zzso zzso and since cellular zzso could cleave the fatty acid side chains present in zzso we have examined the tumor promoting activity of zzso acid to verify the specificity of promotional activity of zzso zzso acid did not function as a tumor zzso These data zzso zzso as an zzso of the zzso expansion of zzso zzso cells, and support a mechanism zzso an increase in zzso zzso could contribute to the zzso expansion of cells containing a zzso zzso
