The identification of zzso zzso in zzso A zzso patients is important as a basis for genetic diagnosis and also for the assessment of clinical zzso 

We analyzed 36 inversion negative zzso zzso cases zzso unrelated and 8 zzso by multiplex zzso and the zzso sensitive gel zzso zzso technique, followed by DNA zzso The zzso of each of these zzso was assessed using various prediction zzso 

We found 17 zzso 5 zzso 3 zzso and 2 nonsense zzso out of which 16 were zzso and 11 zzso All novel substitution zzso were found to be deleterious using the prediction zzso We also encountered a double zzso (1 novel and 1 zzso zzso in a family with a strong family zzso A zzso zzso in zzso state was also detected in a female zzso with very low factor VIII levels, probably due to extreme zzso 

High zzso in zzso profile has been observed in the present zzso The outcome of this study would enable us to give an accurate diagnosis in all affected families by direct zzso zzso
