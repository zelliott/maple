zzso organisms are essential in removing fixed nitrogen pollutants from zzso zzso sewage zzso They can be zzso zzso for agricultural zzso and can also produce the greenhouse gas zzso zzso zzso Therefore a more comprehensive understanding of this process has become increasingly important regarding its global environmental zzso Even though bacterial zzso sequencing projects may reveal new data, to date the zzso abilities and features in zzso bacteria are still poorly studied and zzso The present review evaluates current knowledge on the zzso trait in zzso bacteria and addresses the likely existence of unknown zzso zzso In addition, current molecular tools to study zzso gene diversity in pure cultures and environmental samples seem to be highly zzso and additional novel approaches for the detection of zzso zzso bacteria appear to be crucial in zzso the real diversity of zzso
