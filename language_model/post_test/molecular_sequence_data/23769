The integral membrane protein zzso b zzso b) is the zzso core of the human zzso zzso zzso an zzso complex that zzso a cascade of zzso oxygen species important in the elimination of infectious zzso This study reports the generation and characterization of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that recognize the zzso zzso of the zzso b zzso Each of the zzso specifically detected zzso by Western zzso analysis but did not react with intact zzso in zzso zzso zzso display mapping identified core zzso regions recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that zzso zzso and zzso efficiently compete with Cascade zzso zzso zzso (a previously zzso zzso zzso for binding to zzso zzso supporting zzso display results suggesting that all three zzso recognize a common region of zzso Energy transfer experiments also suggested the spatial proximity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding sites to the zzso zzso zzso while indicating a more distant proximity between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the ability of zzso zzso to markedly inhibit zzso production in a zzso manner, with more moderate levels of zzso observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A combination of zzso predictions, available experimental data, and results obtained with the zzso reported in this study was used to generate a novel zzso model of zzso
