The zzso sequence of a mixture of zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso zzso from bovine zzso zzso prepared by zzso from zzso gels, was determined by zzso zzso zzso A sequence of 23 zzso acids was zzso This showed zzso identity with that of the N zzso of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso A lesser degree of identity with other members of the zzso family was also zzso In order to confirm that the sequence was derived from the zzso molecules a rabbit zzso was raised against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso obtained showed high zzso activity against both the zzso and zzso in zzso Each activity could be specifically zzso with the appropriate zzso The zzso reacted specifically with both zzso and zzso of bovine zzso zzso on zzso this binding was blocked by the zzso zzso but was unaffected by zzso The identity of zzso and zzso in these preparations was confirmed by zzso with two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso raised against the whole zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind to the zzso space of zzso profiles by zzso zzso on zzso frozen zzso One of the two zzso zzso zzso also reacted with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to have identical one-dimensional zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and zzso reacted with a zzso zzso of 19,000 Mr derived from zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
