zzso zzso are precursors for the production of zzso which participate in many essential zzso including the formation of the zzso zzso Despite the importance of conversion of zzso to vitamin A zzso many questions remain concerning the mechanisms that promote this process, including the zzso of zzso We use the zzso visual system as a genetic model to study zzso formation from zzso In a screen for zzso that affect the zzso of zzso we identified a class B scavenger zzso SANTA zzso We demonstrate that SANTA MARIA functions upstream of vitamin A formation in zzso and zzso which are outside of the zzso The protein is zzso and functionally coupled with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso Another class B scavenger zzso zzso functions upstream of SANTA MARIA in the zzso of zzso enabling us to propose a zzso involving multiple zzso cell types and proteins essential for the formation of zzso
