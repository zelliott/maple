zzso genes in viral zzso is a complex zzso Due to the biological necessity of them being constrained in zzso zzso viruses in particular tend to code in overlapping reading zzso Since one zzso acid is zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso up to three genes may be coded for simultaneously in one zzso Conventional hidden zzso model zzso zzso zzso may typically find it difficult to identify multiple coding regions, since in general their zzso do not allow for the presence of overlapping or zzso zzso Comparative methods have therefore been restricted to likelihood ratio tests on potential regions as to being double or single coding, using the fact that the zzso forced upon zzso zzso will result in zzso sequence zzso zzso these same constraints, we present an zzso based zzso program, which allows for coding in zzso zzso and overlapping reading zzso to zzso two zzso aligned viral zzso Our method does not insist on zzso gene structure between the two zzso thus making it zzso for the zzso comparison of more zzso related zzso 

We apply our method to 15 zzso alignments of six different zzso zzso Given sufficient evolutionary distance between the two zzso we achieve sensitivity of approximately zzso and specificity of approximately zzso We additionally zzso three zzso alignments of the more zzso related zzso and zzso as well as of two different zzso zzso attaining results of approximately zzso sensitivity and approximately zzso zzso We subsequently incorporate prior knowledge by zzso the gene structure of one sequence and zzso the other conditional on zzso Boosting accuracy close to perfect we demonstrate that conservation of gene structure on top of zzso sequence is a valuable source of information, especially in zzso related zzso 

The zzso code is available from the zzso
