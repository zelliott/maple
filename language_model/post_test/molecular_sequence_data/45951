The defensive skin zzso of zzso are a rich source of zzso zzso Here we describe a rapid technique for skin zzso zzso zzso cloning from a surrogate zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed from zzso skin zzso from each of the Chinese frogs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso using a zzso primer designed for a consensus zzso sequence in the zzso untranslated region of previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso were found to zzso the zzso peptides zzso 1 and 2 from each of the species zzso The presence of predicted zzso structures in skin zzso was confirmed by zzso mass zzso and automated zzso zzso This experimental approach can thus rapidly zzso parallel zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso without harming or sacrificing donor zzso
