zzso zzso expresses a surface zzso called zzso Different zzso of zzso are zzso by a gene family spread over at least 15 zzso zzso Only one zzso called zzso supports the production of zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso zzso populations from individual rats exhibited high degrees of diversity with respect to the zzso genes attached to the zzso zzso This diversity could have been generated primarily in the rats zzso zzso the rats may have been infected by zzso zzso organisms that were already different at the zzso zzso To investigate this issue, we examined the zzso locus in zzso zzso from rats that had been exposed to few of the microbes at a specified time, which produced a bottleneck in the microbial zzso Some of the rats with bottlenecks produced zzso zzso populations in which a single zzso sequence resided at the zzso locus in 80 to zzso of the organisms, showing that zzso zzso can zzso within a rat without generating the very high levels of zzso diversity previously zzso From the degree of diversity observed in the zzso zzso the maximum rate of switching appeared to be zzso event per zzso These data also suggest that the infectious dose is as low as one zzso that rats that share a cage readily zzso each other, and that the doubling time of zzso zzso in zzso is approximately 3 zzso In addition, we found that zzso with zzso zzso zzso organisms from a population highly zzso at the zzso locus reproduced this zzso By contrast, shifts in population structure occurred in rats given zzso zzso zzso organisms, suggesting that a small fraction of these zzso
