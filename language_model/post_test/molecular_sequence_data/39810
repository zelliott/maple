The zzso studies on immune recognition of carbohydrates have been paved by the zzso advances in identifying the precise sugar structures recognized by the immune system, in analyzing the cellular and zzso components bearing the receptors for zzso and production of the biological relevant zzso zzso by synthetic zzso In our current studies on natural zzso zzso we have found that the zzso as well as the development of natural killer T cells zzso is guided by the information provided by zzso metabolism pathways in zzso presenting cells zzso Based on genetic data and cellular zzso zzso we propose a neutral zzso zzso zzso as one of the candidates recognized by zzso cells under zzso conditions such as cancer and zzso zzso New zzso approaches might be explored by interfering with zzso metabolism or by directly supplementing rationally designed zzso
