Over the past 5 years, the availability of dozens of whole zzso sequences from a wide variety of zzso lineages has revealed a very large amount of information about the dynamics of zzso loss and gain through zzso history, as well as the evolution of zzso zzso zzso in these advances is a great deal of information about the structure and evolution of surrounding zzso Here, we review the wealth of ways in which structures of zzso zzso as well as their conservation and change through evolution may be harnessed for evolutionary and zzso zzso First, we discuss uses of zzso length zzso and positions in sequence assembly and zzso and for improving alignment of zzso zzso Second, we review uses of zzso in evolutionary studies, including the utility of zzso as indicators of rates of sequence evolution, for zzso about molecular evolution, as signatures of zzso and zzso and for zzso rates of zzso zzso We conclude with a discussion of zzso methods utilizing zzso sequences and zzso
