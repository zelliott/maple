A common genetic zzso zzso of the human zzso hormone zzso zzso gene was recently zzso The zzso molecules have higher zzso in zzso but shorter zzso in zzso which apparently is related to the zzso of zzso function observed in individuals zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso We have now studied whether additional zzso in the zzso promoter sequence could contribute to the altered physiology of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso retrieved from human zzso DNA by zzso contained eight zzso changes, as compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The finding was consistent in DNA samples of different ethnic zzso zzso zzso with various lengths of the zzso and zzso promoter zzso driving the zzso zzso reporter zzso were zzso into an immortalized mouse zzso cell line, zzso known to express the zzso zzso zzso and into a zzso human embryonic kidney cell line, zzso zzso zzso expression levels of the zzso promoter zzso were on average zzso higher in zzso ( P zzso zzso zzso zzso 29), and zzso higher in zzso zzso cells ( P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the respective zzso zzso Numerous qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the two cell lines in responses of the two promoter sequences to stimulation with 12- O zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso promoter has higher zzso activity, and differs in response to hormonal zzso as compared with the zzso zzso The altered promoter function of the zzso gene provides evidence for differences in regulation of the zzso and zzso zzso which may contribute to the differences observed in zzso function between carriers of the two zzso zzso The findings also suggest a novel evolutionary mechanism zzso zzso changes resulting in altered zzso of a gene product may be compensated for by additional zzso in the zzso promoter zzso changing zzso of the same zzso
