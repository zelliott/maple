Alternative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is controlled by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a binding site for zzso zzso By using a transient expression alternative zzso zzso combined with promoter zzso we have demonstrated that the promoter can also control zzso zzso arguing for zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso We now report that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso in zzso and that their effect requires an intact zzso zzso Most importantly, we show that sensitivity to these zzso proteins critically depends on the promoter structure, suggesting that the zzso machinery zzso their recruitment to the zzso
