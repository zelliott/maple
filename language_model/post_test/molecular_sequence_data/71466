To study zzso zzso zzso zzso contribution to zzso metabolism within human liver zzso and to initiate an investigation of zzso protein zzso we developed a zzso zzso targeted to a zzso zzso within that zzso The zzso was found to be highly sensitive and zzso for zzso on zzso Although many zzso studies have described the absence or low expression of zzso in human zzso in the present investigation, we have found this not to be the zzso We zzso zzso zzso expression in a panel of 28 zzso and found zzso ranging from 2 to 82 zzso zzso with a mean value of 25 zzso zzso Five zzso ( approximately zzso displayed relatively high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no sex-related differences, although the highest level was observed in a zzso zzso donor given several zzso A marked diminution in zzso was found in individuals aged 56 or older zzso zzso zzso but there were no age-related trends in mean zzso zzso We suggest that zzso represents a significant portion of total zzso in human zzso The exquisite sensitivity of this zzso zzso quantities are detected easily on zzso may explain our detection of zzso in zzso of zzso versus its detection in a limited number of zzso by certain other zzso The zzso also was found to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human liver zzso by 68 to zzso The utility of this zzso for determining human liver zzso zzso contribution to the zzso of zzso was zzso
