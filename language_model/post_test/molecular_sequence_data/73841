The zzso zzso zzso zzso are 12 zzso acid zzso whose zzso is dependent on the ABC zzso zzso The zzso are zzso as 36 and 38 zzso acid precursors that terminate in a zzso box zzso is zzso a is an zzso zzso and X is the zzso zzso zzso zzso processing of the zzso precursors includes at least 5 zzso zzso processing of the zzso box includes zzso of zzso removal of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso steps involve zzso zzso that remove the zzso In this report, we have investigated the role of zzso modification in the generation of functional zzso Wild type, zzso and zzso forms of zzso have been expressed in zzso and assessed for their abilities to serve as sources of functional zzso We have found that although modification of the zzso box is necessary, it is not sufficient to generate zzso zzso The zzso terminal zzso are also zzso zzso of these sequences reduces zzso levels of zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso box processing and membrane zzso but are not zzso for the zzso zzso and fail to interact with zzso These results suggest that the zzso terminal precursor sequences play a direct role in the generation of functional zzso
