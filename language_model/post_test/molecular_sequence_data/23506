zzso play an integral and essential role in photosynthesis and zzso in plants and zzso A collection of zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso was characterized for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso under different light conditions, and the molecular basis of their zzso zzso The zzso zzso or zzso zzso were also deficient in zzso but had approximately twice the zzso content of the wild zzso White zzso grew in the dark but were unable to survive in the light, even under very low light conditions on zzso zzso zzso crosses and zzso tests revealed that all individual white zzso in the collection are zzso of a single zzso zzso and the white zzso was closely linked to a marker located in the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso zzso gene from each of the zzso revealed nonsense, zzso zzso and zzso site zzso Transformation with a zzso copy of the zzso zzso gene was able to complement the zzso zzso Together, these results show that all the white zzso examined in this work are affected in the zzso zzso zzso
