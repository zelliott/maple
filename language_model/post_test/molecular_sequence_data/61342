zzso a human liver zzso encodes a protein that bound to a zzso zzso binding site, zzso The sequence of zzso matched that of zzso a zzso factor that bound to a Ras responsive element zzso very different from the sequence with which we isolated zzso We therefore examined the binding of zzso to different zzso It bound to the zzso zzso and to the zzso with similar affinities zzso zzso but did not bind to a consensus zzso binding zzso The zzso protein contains four zzso the zzso two of which retained specific DNA binding to both zzso A zzso of the zzso site functioned as an zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Thus zzso could function as a downstream zzso in the zzso signaling zzso through different zzso zzso zzso A longer human zzso zzso contains zzso and there are close zzso in both chicken and zzso arguing that it plays important zzso The ability of zzso factors such as zzso to bind diverse sequences gives them the potential to regulate previously zzso zzso
