zzso exposure to zzso a potent zzso has been the generally accepted factor responsible for the development of human zzso Recent reports documenting the detection of zzso DNA in human zzso suggest the possibility that this known tumor virus may be an additional factor involved in the development of some zzso 

A detailed analysis was performed by zzso chain reaction and DNA sequencing of the genetic characteristics of zzso viral DNA detected in samples taken from multiple sites of a human zzso 

A single virus zzso was detected within the tumor that zzso a novel variable region at the zzso of the large zzso zzso The viral regulatory region was predominantly zzso in sequence zzso zzso of the zzso typical of natural zzso 

These data confirm previous reports from several laboratories showing an association of zzso DNA with human zzso and provide the first evidence of a novel virus zzso present in separated regions of a zzso
