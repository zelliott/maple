The zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso disorder with zzso zzso The zzso syndrome gene zzso which contains zzso in a majority of zzso patients, encodes a protein of unknown function, although it has been strongly implicated in zzso zzso There is also some evidence that it interacts with molecules that regulate zzso zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated by zzso methods that the single behavioral zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients is the zzso to orient correctly in a spatial zzso of zzso We considered using the social zzso zzso zzso a model for zzso zzso an excellent system for zzso the function of the zzso zzso We first identified the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and found that the zzso acids that are altered in human disease were zzso Given that several proteins involved in zzso orientation zzso to the zzso of cells undergoing zzso we tested whether the zzso gene product did the zzso We produced an zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso and generated zzso either with multiple zzso insertions of the fusion gene or multiple copies of a zzso zzso carrying the fusion zzso In both cases, the zzso protein was dispersed equally through the zzso and zzso of cells zzso in zzso However, we observed differential enrichment of zzso in the zzso of cells treated with the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso protein may play a role in zzso In light of these results, we discuss how zzso might function during zzso
