zzso constitute a major threat to the health of animal and zzso To date the zzso zzso in the zzso family comprises five established members, namely canine distemper virus zzso zzso distemper virus zzso zzso virus zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso In addition, zzso candidates infecting aquatic zzso were recently zzso The present review on the biology of zzso focuses on knowledge gained by our group in studies on zzso and zzso The aims of these studies were: zzso to investigate the biological properties of the recently recognized zzso which was found to be the primary zzso of zzso with high mortality in seals in Western Europe, zzso to extend our knowledge of the biological properties of zzso The zzso particle is zzso The zzso zzso core contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso of negative sense of 15 to 16 zzso in zzso The zzso is organized in six zzso units or zzso Overall, the studies of the zzso of zzso revealed a genetic map principally fitting with that determined for other zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences have been determined for five zzso genes named in zzso with the zzso structural proteins of other zzso in the order: zzso (The figures in zzso zzso zzso lengths of the genes of the Danish zzso zzso The L gene zzso approximately zzso zzso remains to be zzso The six genes are likely to code for at least eight distinct zzso The zzso zzso protein was found to consist of 523 zzso acids in zzso The following gene of the zzso map zzso the P protein of zzso zzso acid zzso Similar to other zzso the P gene of zzso was shown to have additional coding capacity for two distinct proteins V zzso zzso zzso and C zzso zzso zzso The results presented provide evidence for editing at transcript of the zzso P gene by zzso of zzso G zzso at a specific zzso The edited version of the zzso was found to zzso the zzso V zzso The three zzso proteins of zzso were predicted to consist of 335 zzso zzso zzso and 607 zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso M, zzso and H genes of zzso were aligned with corresponding sequences of other established members of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
