The central zzso stability of zzso and its synthetic zzso zzso alpha 6, C delta zzso and zzso zzso was studied in zzso using a newly developed, regionally dissected rat brain zzso time course incubation zzso zzso slice viability was estimated as the ability of the brain slice to take up or release zzso acid after high zzso zzso zzso demonstrated stability of zzso up to 5 zzso of zzso suggesting tissue viability over this zzso The estimated zzso of peptides based on the results obtained in our incubation protocol suggest that the peptides studied are zzso at different rates in the individual brain regions zzso A good correlation exists between the high zzso activity of neutral zzso zzso zzso and the rapid degradation of zzso and zzso alpha 6, C zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso substitution combined with zzso zzso appears to improve resistance to zzso metabolism in zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso of zzso forming an zzso bond between the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso acid did not improve zzso stability in any brain region zzso The present study has shown that the brain slice technique is a valid and unique approach to study zzso metabolism in small, discrete regions of rat brain where zzso zzso and receptors are zzso and that specific structural modifications can improve zzso zzso
