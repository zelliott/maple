zzso virus zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso DNA viruses and causes progressive zzso zzso in zzso Although transport of zzso to the nucleus is an important step in zzso infection, the mechanism of this process has remained zzso The outer shell of the zzso zzso comprises the major zzso protein zzso which possesses a putative nuclear zzso signal zzso and zzso particles zzso consisting of zzso zzso exhibit a zzso structure and zzso functions zzso attachment and zzso zzso similar to those of zzso zzso We have now investigated the mechanism of nuclear transport of zzso with the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso entered the nucleus of most zzso or zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso was preserved during transport to the nucleus as revealed by zzso zzso of cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso containing packaged zzso The nuclear transport of zzso in zzso cells was dependent on the addition of zzso alpha and beta and was prevented by wheat germ zzso or by zzso to the nuclear pore zzso The nuclear entry of zzso composed of zzso with a zzso zzso was greatly zzso compared with that of zzso in both intact and zzso zzso Unlike zzso the zzso zzso did not bind to zzso alpha or zzso Limited zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of zzso was exposed on the surface of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso bind to cellular zzso via the zzso of zzso and are transported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore zzso
