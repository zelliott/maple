Three zzso genes -- zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso -- from the zzso zzso iris (New Zealand zzso zzso were isolated by zzso chain reaction zzso The genes were similar to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso The sequence similarity between the genes ranged from zzso to zzso The greatest disparity, zzso was found over a zzso region located at zzso zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of the three zzso The zzso iris zzso gene family contains at least eight zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the three genes showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed at low levels in zzso eggs and zzso stages and at high levels in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso it was not detected in the zzso stages and at high levels in the zzso and zzso zzso The structure and expression of the three zzso genes are zzso
