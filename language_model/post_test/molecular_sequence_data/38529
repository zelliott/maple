DNA zzso plays a critical role in controlling states of gene activity in most zzso organisms, and it is essential for proper growth and zzso zzso of zzso are established by de zzso zzso and maintained by maintenance zzso zzso The zzso family of de zzso DNA zzso has recently been characterized in zzso Here we describe DNA zzso genes from both zzso and zzso that show a high level of sequence similarity to zzso suggesting that they zzso plant de zzso zzso Relative to all known zzso zzso these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA zzso zzso zzso The N zzso of these zzso contain a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in several zzso zzso proteins and in DNA repair zzso such as zzso and they may be involved in zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso provides a possible link between DNA zzso and zzso zzso
