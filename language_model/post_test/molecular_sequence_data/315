The diagnosis of mature zzso zzso zzso remains difficult in a number of cases, especially zzso zzso of zzso lymphoma, for which discriminating criteria or zzso are often zzso To identify new surface zzso we developed an original zzso approach based on mass zzso analysis of plasma membrane zzso derived from chronic zzso zzso of single zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso small cell zzso zzso and mantle cell zzso zzso A straightforward selection process for zzso candidate zzso identification was further constructed in order to propose potentially useful and relevant zzso zzso of the lists of the proteins identified in each pathology combined to highly stringent zzso validation criteria for protein identification allowed to propose zzso a membrane zzso with zzso activity, as a discriminating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on 158 patients and 30 controls, showed that an zzso zzso stained significantly higher zzso than zzso and zzso circulating cells zzso which zzso zzso zzso in zzso Our results indicate that a medium or high zzso expression level may exclude the diagnosis of zzso and high zzso expression levels zzso zzso equal or superior to 2 times the value obtained with zzso allows zzso diagnosis to be suspected with zzso specificity zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso This study is one of the first where zzso strategies allowed to identify a potentially useful zzso
