The high molecular mass protein complex zzso in the zzso of the malaria zzso consists of three distinct zzso with estimated sizes in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a number of zzso including a new zzso zzso that is specific for the zzso complex, it was shown that the zzso complex is zzso during zzso and transferred intact to the ring stage in newly invaded zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso have already been identified and zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this report, we describe the identification of the gene for zzso in both these zzso zzso zzso sequences were obtained from zzso zzso proteins and used to generate zzso zzso and search malaria sequence zzso In a parallel approach, zzso zzso was used to identify a clone coding for zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequences of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes for zzso were completed and zzso They both contain nine zzso and there is a high degree of similarity between the deduced zzso acid sequences of the two zzso The zzso zzso gene is a single copy gene located on zzso 9, and is transcribed in zzso
