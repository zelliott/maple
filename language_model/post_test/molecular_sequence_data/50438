Recent studies of the zzso tumor zzso locus zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso have identified a high frequency of zzso zzso zzso Due to the geographic location from which the samples were obtained and the substitution observed, the zzso was suggested to be attributable to zzso B1 zzso zzso To determine the zzso of this phenomenon, we have examined zzso zzso from 107 geographically and ethnically diverse zzso The frequency of zzso gene zzso was evaluated by using zzso methods, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and DNA zzso The zzso rate observed in tumors from zzso regions zzso was more than double the rate observed in zzso regions zzso but lower than the 50% frequency previously zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred at a much lower frequency than previously reported (2 of 107 samples zzso These results suggest that changes in DNA zzso zzso may not represent primary zzso effects but instead represent genetic changes related to tumor zzso High zzso levels may facilitate the generation of these zzso changes, but not by inducing a specific zzso gene zzso at zzso zzso as previously zzso
