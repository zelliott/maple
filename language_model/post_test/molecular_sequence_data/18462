While screening a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso soils, nine zzso were identified coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso are zzso related to a number of zzso zzso classes found in zzso diverse groups of zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso when the zzso was grown in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene product, zzso zzso zzso to zzso An zzso motif was identified directly upstream of zzso An zzso gene fusion lacking the zzso site showed a drastic reduction in promoter zzso Very low zzso activity levels were observed when the zzso fusion was mobilized into an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso confirming the important role of zzso The zzso sites are not found upstream of other zzso zzso zzso However, they contained consensus sequence motifs that can serve as possible target sites for certain zzso zzso zzso In support of this zzso the zzso genes responded zzso to different zzso stress zzso The zzso genes identified in zzso zzso zzso are found to be zzso highly among all known zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso The versatile ecological zzso of zzso zzso strains is apparent if sequence conservation is seen together with their involvement in zzso zzso
