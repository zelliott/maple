The zzso C virus zzso protein 3 zzso possesses a zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso activities reside in the zzso zzso In this study, an zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso by conventional zzso zzso characterization of the zzso activity of zzso is presented with regard to its binding and strand release activities on different zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso the zzso was shown to perform unwinding activity starting from an internal zzso region of at least 3 zzso and moving along the duplex in a 3' to zzso zzso In addition, data are presented suggesting that binding to zzso reduces the affinity of zzso for zzso and increases its affinity for duplex zzso Furthermore, we have zzso the capacity of zzso to specifically interact with and resolve the zzso zzso structure zzso I) within the zzso 46 bases of the viral zzso Finally, our analysis of zzso zzso unwinding under single cycle conditions by addition of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso led to two zzso zzso zzso zzso acts zzso zzso most of the zzso zzso zzso activity may not be directly coupled to zzso of the zzso along the zzso zzso zzso
