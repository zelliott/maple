The beta 1 and beta 2 zzso are the zzso large chains of the zzso network zzso and the plasma membrane zzso zzso protein complexes, zzso zzso beta 1 and beta 2 zzso have been generated in zzso zzso It was found that, in the absence of all the other zzso zzso beta 1 and beta 2 interact with zzso and drive the efficient assembly of zzso zzso In addition, beta 2 zzso and zzso complexes compete for the same zzso binding zzso The appearance of the zzso coats is the same as the zzso structures formed with native zzso zzso It is proposed that the principal function of the beta zzso is to initiate coat formation, while the remaining zzso of the zzso complexes have other roles in coated pit and coated zzso zzso
