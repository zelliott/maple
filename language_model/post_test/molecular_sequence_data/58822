zzso zzso receptors of type 1 zzso are zzso at the protein and zzso levels in human heart zzso No data are available for the transplanted human heart, which frequently exhibits functional zzso The aim of the present study was the zzso of zzso zzso zzso content in zzso zzso from patients after heart zzso For the determination of zzso zzso we used a novel quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction with low zzso zzso based on an internal zzso zzso standard, zzso zzso of zzso chain reaction products in zzso plates, and zzso by zzso zzso zzso Right zzso zzso from 16 patients after heart transplantation zzso zzso ejection fraction 67 zzso zzso were compared with 12 patients with normal cardiac function zzso zzso ejection fraction 62 zzso zzso A zzso lower zzso zzso content was found in zzso from the 16 patients after heart transplantation than in the 12 controls zzso zzso 200 zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso controls, 368 zzso zzso P zzso zzso When zzso zzso content was related to the zzso expressed zzso zzso a zzso decrease was detected zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso controls, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No association between the extent of zzso zzso and clinical or zzso variables was zzso In the human heart zzso zzso is zzso after zzso heart zzso The decrease in zzso zzso is not associated with altered zzso zzso This may partially reflect a loss of zzso nerves and thus altered nervous control of the zzso
