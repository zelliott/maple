The zzso box or zzso zzso domain is a zzso motif found within a zzso of zzso zinc finger zzso The function of a zzso box is unknown, but it is predicted to form zzso that may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zinc finger zzso zzso is an alternatively spliced human zzso zzso of the zinc finger zzso factor, zzso zzso and zzso contain 13 zzso zinc finger zzso but only zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso A bone zzso zzso library was screened for proteins interacting with the zzso zzso box domain and zzso zzso protein associated with zzso was zzso zzso is a novel zzso that encodes a zzso domain and zzso region but no zinc finger zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso box domain of zzso is necessary for association with zzso By zzso zzso analysis, the zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient for interaction with the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso each zzso in zzso via a zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence that the zzso box is a protein interaction domain that mediates both zzso and zzso zzso
