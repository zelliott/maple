A useful strategy directed to the isolation of a required gene with a high zzso content is zzso Using a zzso zzso probe, deduced from the zzso zzso of a zzso it is possible to obtain a zzso of DNA containing its zzso gene by zzso zzso Furthermore, the cloning of a desired gene can be accomplished in two steps by using an zzso deduced zzso from an internal zzso zzso from a consensus zzso or zzso from a DNA sequence adjacent to a zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso This method, which could be applied to a zzso zzso or zzso zzso library, has been successfully used for cloning several genes from different biological zzso
