The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso related inhibitor zzso represents a key regulator of the zzso events occurring during zzso barrier formation and hair development, as zzso by the severe zzso zzso zzso skin condition zzso syndrome zzso caused by zzso in its zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 zzso zzso as a zzso zzso is rapidly zzso zzso thus generating a number of potentially zzso fragments that are zzso Here, we show that zzso generates three classes of transcripts zzso three different zzso zzso which differ in their zzso zzso In addition to the previously described 15 domain zzso zzso encodes a shorter zzso zzso composed of only the first 13 zzso as well as a longer zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso between the 13th and 14th zzso zzso We demonstrate that variable amounts of zzso alternative transcripts are detected in all zzso zzso active zzso Finally, we show that in differentiated cultured human zzso all zzso alternative transcripts are translated into protein and that the zzso precursors generate distinct zzso zzso zzso fragments from a similar zzso zzso Since several data indicate a biological role for the zzso zzso we zzso that the alternative processing of the zzso zzso zzso represents an additional mechanism to further increase the structural and functional diversity of the zzso zzso zzso
