zzso composition of biological zzso differs between the zzso and zzso zzso The type 4 zzso zzso are zzso zzso that generate such membrane zzso zzso zzso a zzso in budding zzso is involved in the zzso recycling zzso zzso is implicated in zzso zzso formation, but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso region of zzso directly binds to zzso an zzso protein that is also required for zzso zzso The zzso region was mapped to the zzso acids zzso region of zzso and a zzso zzso lacking this region was defective in zzso recycling of a zzso zzso We isolated zzso point zzso that reduced the interaction with zzso The zzso sites were clustered within a small region zzso zzso of zzso Although these point zzso did not exhibit clear zzso combination of them resulted in zzso growth, defects in zzso recycling of zzso and defective zzso of zzso to zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the interaction of zzso with zzso plays an important role for zzso function in the zzso recycling zzso
