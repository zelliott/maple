zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that contains an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso Upon binding zzso zzso zzso zzso can become activated and zzso cellular targets, such as zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of protein translation by the zzso in either a general or an zzso zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso represents a crucial host cell defense mechanism against viral zzso zzso can circumvent zzso function by zzso of zzso zzso zzso that bind to and zzso zzso We present here a zzso characterization of the interactions between human zzso and two viral inhibitor zzso zzso (from zzso zzso and zzso (from human zzso zzso zzso confirmed that both zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso affinities of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso A single zzso domain from each zzso zzso mediates the interaction with both zzso of zzso The binding sites on inhibitor zzso and the zzso of zzso have been mapped by zzso chemical shift zzso experiments, which indicate that zzso of zzso employ similar surfaces of interaction as zzso Finally, we show that zzso binding and zzso are zzso regions other than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are required for zzso
