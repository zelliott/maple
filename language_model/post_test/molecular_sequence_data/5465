zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso reduces the zzso of zzso cholesterol, and zzso zzso in zzso In this study, a full-length zzso clone zzso the zzso was isolated from mouse zzso using a zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso According to sequence analysis, the zzso encodes a zzso of 197 zzso acids zzso that zzso the translation at zzso and contains an zzso zzso zzso zzso It also has zzso zzso sequences in the zzso that are involved in the zzso of zzso at an zzso zzso Moreover, the mouse zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso that interact with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso that may act as a potential zzso targeting zzso According to the deduced zzso analysis, mouse zzso shares a high level of zzso identity with pig zzso human zzso and rat zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso particularly showed a high degree of expression in zzso This suggests that the zzso in zzso may have more than just an zzso zzso
