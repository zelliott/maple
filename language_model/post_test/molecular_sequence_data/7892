A zzso approach was used to identify zzso regions of the zzso regulator zzso zzso of the deduced protein sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed eight blocks of high sequence zzso separated by regions with little or no zzso The largest zzso block contains the zzso domain, a DNA and protein binding domain zzso in a small family of zzso zzso zzso The functional properties of the zzso domain from the zzso zzso gene and the human zzso zzso zzso leukemia 1) gene were compared in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated that the different DNA binding properties of zzso and zzso are due to differences within their respective zzso zzso zzso expression experiments indicated that proteins containing the zzso zzso domain function in zzso zzso and that sequences outside of this domain are important in zzso
