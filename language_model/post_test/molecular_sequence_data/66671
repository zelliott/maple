A zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso converts starch into zzso zzso with high zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso with those of other typical zzso revealed that several zzso acids are deleted or zzso with others at several zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso site of the zzso were replaced by several zzso acids through zzso zzso The replacement of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso strongly enhanced the zzso activity in the neutral pH zzso On the other hand, all zzso obtained on replacing zzso with the above zzso acids showed significant decreases in the zzso zzso Taking into account both the kinetic parameters and zzso values of the side chains of the three basic zzso zzso the zzso state of the zzso groups in their side chains at zzso zzso seems to enhance the hydrogen bonding interaction between these basic zzso acids and the zzso zzso of linear zzso The enhancement of the interaction may play an important role by helping the zzso reach zzso zzso hence increasing the zzso activity and zzso zzso
