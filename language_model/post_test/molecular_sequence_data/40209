zzso zzso are crucial zzso responsible for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso We characterized two alternative zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 gene zzso from the zzso migratory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso of the two zzso zzso and zzso consists of zzso zzso that include a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso and zzso zzso regions at zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The two zzso differ only in one zzso consisting of 177 zzso that zzso 59 zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequences within this alternative zzso region are zzso identical between the two zzso Both zzso were expressed in all the zzso zzso However, zzso was predominately expressed in the zzso whereas zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso Our zzso gene zzso study resulted in a dramatic reduction in the levels of the corresponding zzso in the locust zzso injected with zzso of zzso or either of its two zzso zzso and zzso zzso 95, 88 and 51% of zzso were observed in the zzso injected with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso resulted from the injection of zzso zzso were similar to those from the injection of zzso zzso whereas the zzso injected with zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that both zzso of zzso zzso 1 are essential for insect growth and zzso
