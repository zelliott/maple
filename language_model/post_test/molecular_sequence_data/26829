Huntington disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a zzso zzso domain in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso expansion above zzso results in disease associated with zzso zzso into inclusion zzso It has been hypothesized that expanded zzso zzso adopt multiple potentially toxic zzso that belong to different zzso zzso Here, we used atomic force zzso to analyze the effect of a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso formation and the stability of a zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso whereas other zzso zzso had widely varying effects on zzso These results suggest that expanded zzso zzso adopt multiple zzso in solution that can be readily distinguished by zzso zzso which has important implications for understanding the structural basis for zzso toxicity and the development of zzso zzso for zzso
