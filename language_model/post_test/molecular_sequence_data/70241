We have used synthetic zzso to study a zzso zzso binding motif in zzso zzso binding protein zzso as well as its zzso We zzso an 11 zzso zzso based on the consensus sequence zzso which is found in all the zzso zzso zzso The synthetic zzso was found to be zzso bound to the zzso alone or the zzso attached to the zzso of zzso and not the zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso had strong affinity to bind to zzso In zzso translation of rabbit zzso zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso resulted in stimulation of zzso synthesis by zzso as compared to translation in the presence of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but in the absence of the zzso
