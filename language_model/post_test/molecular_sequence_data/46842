Human zzso zzso gene encodes for two zzso class I zzso zzso and B, originating from spliced messages zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso open reading frame zzso contains four zzso sites and the zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso sites, sharing similar zzso and zzso with zzso zzso but with an zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso To characterize the zzso and B zzso in the infected body zzso B cell zzso zzso cells and in the zzso envelopes, zzso zzso zzso recognizing only zzso protein or both zzso and B proteins were zzso These zzso reacted with the infected cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressed the zzso and B proteins independently on the plasma zzso zzso recognized multiple proteins with molecular weights ranging from 23 to 72 zzso from the zzso cells and zzso cells and the 72 to 68 zzso zzso proteins from the zzso zzso The zzso is the zzso protein affinity zzso from the infected zzso zzso zzso with zzso show that these proteins contain both zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the multiple proteins recognized by the zzso represent the precursor and product forms of zzso and B zzso and the 72 to 68 zzso zzso proteins represent the zzso zzso mature forms of these zzso
