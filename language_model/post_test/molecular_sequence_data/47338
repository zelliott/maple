Previous observations of reduced zzso zzso binding in zzso brain regions from bipolar affective disorder subjects imply zzso zzso protein zzso function may be altered in this zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso activity was determined in zzso and particulate zzso of zzso brain from bipolar disorder patients and matched zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly higher zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso from bipolar disorder brain compared with matched zzso In zzso zzso particulate zzso and in the zzso and particulate zzso of other brain regions, smaller but statistically zzso increments in zzso zzso activity were zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso activity was also significantly higher zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of bipolar disorder brain compared with zzso zzso zzso values for zzso zzso zzso of this zzso were significantly lower zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and particulate zzso of zzso zzso from bipolar disorder subjects compared with zzso These findings suggest that higher zzso zzso protein zzso activity in bipolar disorder brain may be associated with a reduction of regulatory zzso of this zzso reflecting a possible zzso response of this zzso zzso to increased zzso zzso signaling in this zzso
