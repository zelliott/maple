zzso oxide zzso is a cellular zzso which is zzso in bacteria and human zzso cells and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The aims of this study were: zzso to investigate whether NO zzso zzso zzso in zzso 248 of the zzso gene in cultured human zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso to compare NO zzso to that of zzso zzso a strong zzso Two approaches were zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso using zzso technology on zzso zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso cells were either exposed to 4 zzso zzso zzso an agent that spontaneously releases NO into the zzso or zzso with the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which has a sensitivity of 1 zzso zzso showed that 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso numbers of G zzso A transitions in zzso 248 of zzso while zzso zzso was not detected in either zzso cells or cells exposed to 4 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso reaching zzso zzso of 24 and 96 times that of zzso control cells at zzso zzso of 4 and 8 zzso zzso by contrast, 4 zzso zzso induced no zzso zzso in this zzso nor were any observed in cells zzso with zzso zzso We conclude that if NO is at all zzso in these cells, it is significantly less so than the zzso zzso zzso
