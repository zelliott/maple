Prior studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for the growth and development of the zzso zzso In this report, we describe the cloning and partial characterization of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso the zzso was amplified from adult zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and codes for a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 54 zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso revealed significant zzso to the protein zzso zzso zzso particularly, to the zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso found in the zzso of zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso and could be inhibited by zzso zzso studies showed that approximately zzso of 48 zzso from healthy Indian patients living in a zzso zzso endemic area were zzso with zzso In contrast, only zzso of zzso from patients with clinical zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso Additional studies are needed to zzso the role, if any, of zzso zzso zzso in protective immunity to zzso
