The major core zzso factor in zzso II zzso machinery is zzso a complex consisting of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and 13 to 14 zzso factors zzso Previously we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso possess zzso zzso Whether zzso DNA binding directs zzso to a specific core promoter element or zzso zzso binding to established core promoter elements is not zzso Here we analyzed the mode of zzso DNA binding and show that this complex binds DNA with high zzso The DNA length required for optimal binding is approximately 70 zzso Although the complex displays a weak sequence zzso the zzso composition is less important than the length of the DNA for high affinity zzso Comparative expression profiling of zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso revealed common core promoter features in the zzso genes that include a zzso and an zzso Further examination of the zzso gene from this group showed diminished zzso activity and zzso occupancy in zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that DNA binding by zzso zzso the association of zzso with the core promoter of a subset of zzso
