Two new zzso zzso and zzso have been cloned from the zzso zzso for zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and degradation, respectively, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each gene codes for a specific zzso which, based on sequence data, belongs to a large family of zzso zzso which constitutes 12 zzso zzso zzso and zzso show an unusually high similarity zzso identical zzso for totals of 425 and zzso zzso zzso zzso This allowed the construction of zzso and zzso crossover hybrids by using a natural restriction site overlapping zzso This site is located within the large zzso loop which connects the putative zzso 6 and 7 and in particular the zzso and the zzso halves of the zzso Both hybrids have close to normal transport activities but essentially the zzso zzso and kinetic properties of the zzso zzso This result zzso essential zzso binding and recognition sites to the zzso halves of the proteins in this important class of zzso zzso
