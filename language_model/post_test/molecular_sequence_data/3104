The extent to which the zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso strain zzso in the zzso of zzso grass can provide fixed nitrogen to the plant was assessed by evaluating zzso plants grown in the greenhouse and zzso plants taken from the natural zzso The zzso consisted of either zzso bacteria or zzso zzso strain zzso In zzso conditions, plants zzso with strain zzso zzso test zzso grew better and accumulated more nitrogen with a lower zzso signature after 8 months than did plants zzso with the zzso strain zzso control zzso zzso or zzso chain zzso zzso zzso transcripts were retrieved from test but not from control zzso zzso zzso transcripts were zzso The zzso could not be zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso can contribute combined zzso to the plant in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected also in zzso plants taken from the natural environment, from which zzso zzso zzso also could not be zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso indicated a high potential of strain zzso for biological zzso fixation in association with zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences predicted that zzso grass zzso including zzso zzso are ecologically dominant and play an important role in zzso in natural grass zzso
