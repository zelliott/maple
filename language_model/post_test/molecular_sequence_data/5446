We have taken an zzso trap approach to identify genes that are expressed in zzso cells and zzso of zzso We conducted a molecular analysis of two zzso zzso strains that have reporter gene expression in embryonic zzso strain 197 and zzso This analysis has determined that zzso encodes a collagen type IV zzso zzso The zzso locus is located adjacent to the previously described zzso which encodes collagen zzso and in the opposite zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are structurally very similar to one another, and to zzso type IV zzso In early development, zzso and zzso are transcribed in the same zzso pattern, primarily in the zzso and fat body zzso Our results suggest that both the zzso and zzso collagen IV chains may contribute to basement zzso in zzso This work also provides the foundation for a more complete genetic dissection of collagen type IV molecules and their zzso function in zzso
