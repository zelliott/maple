zzso E virus zzso is a major human pathogen in much of the developing zzso It is a zzso zzso virus with a zzso zzso zzso consisting of three open reading zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these, zzso encodes the major zzso protein of the virus and zzso encodes a small protein of unknown zzso Using the zzso zzso system and traditional zzso techniques, we have studied the zzso binding activities of zzso and zzso two proteins zzso in the 3' structural part of the zzso Since the zzso zzso from zzso has been zzso to contain secondary structures at the zzso and 3' ends, we used these two terminal regions, besides other regions within the zzso in this zzso zzso were designed to test for interactions between the zzso zzso fusion zzso with zzso and zzso hybrid proteins in a zzso cellular zzso We show here that the zzso protein contains zzso binding zzso The zzso protein specifically bound the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this protein showed that its zzso binding activity was lost when deletions were made beyond the zzso 111 zzso zzso zzso mapping of the interacting zzso revealed that a zzso zzso region at the zzso end of the zzso zzso was responsible for binding the zzso zzso This zzso region included the zzso zzso zzso zzso across zzso Our results support the requirement of this zzso sequence for interaction with zzso and also indicate an increase in the strength of the zzso interaction when an additional 44 bases downstream of this zzso region were zzso zzso predictions and the location of the zzso binding region within the zzso zzso indicate that this interaction may play a role in viral zzso
