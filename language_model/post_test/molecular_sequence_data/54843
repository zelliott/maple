zzso receptors zzso are important components of the innate immune zzso Compared with other zzso such as zzso there is less data on the expression and function of zzso which binds to zzso zzso Because there is no data on the zzso protein expression of zzso in lungs of zzso dog and zzso and pulmonary diseases are the major cause of economic losses, we studied zzso expression in lungs using Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso We characterized a mouse zzso zzso to detect zzso in lung extracts from zzso dogs, and zzso The zzso zzso used to raise the mouse zzso zzso had significant zzso with zzso zzso acid sequences from these zzso Light and electron microscopic zzso localized zzso in airway zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso in all three zzso These data are of potential importance for the understanding of pulmonary immune responses in these veterinary zzso
