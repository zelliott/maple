A zzso clone exclusively induced by aluminum (Al) was isolated from root zzso of wheat zzso zzso zzso by the differential display zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence exhibited zzso to the zzso resistance zzso proteins that is known as a member of the zzso cassette (ABC) protein zzso Thus this gene was named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced as a function of Al concentration in the range from 5 to 50 zzso which is in the range of Al content in natural acid soil zzso The concentration required for the induction was lower in the zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso zzso was associated with the events caused by Al toxicity rather than Al zzso zzso was significantly induced by the exposure to zzso zzso and zzso red, which are known as zzso of calcium zzso Furthermore, decreasing of calcium zzso in growth medium caused stimulation of the gene zzso These results suggested that the induction of zzso is caused by the breaking of calcium zzso which occurred at early stage of Al zzso
