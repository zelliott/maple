Many zzso proteins that are involved in the differential regulation of gene expression are composed of multiple discrete zzso Association of the zzso zzso zzso motif with zzso zzso such as the paired box or the zzso domain, has led to the definition of structurally and functionally related zzso of regulatory zzso The zinc finger, which is the second major zzso zzso motif characterized to date, defines large zzso families in higher zzso we have isolated more than 100 zzso finger zzso zzso and in this study we show that at least 10 of these clones share extensive sequence zzso in a region of more than 200 zzso acids in the zzso zzso portion of the predicted zzso which is connected to variable finger zzso We refer to this element as a zzso boxes zzso zzso zzso with human zzso DNA indicates that the zzso boxes domain is evolutionary zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that the corresponding genes are zzso expressed in the course of early zzso zzso
