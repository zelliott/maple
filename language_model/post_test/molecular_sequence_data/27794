Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are essential for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso We have previously shown that the genes zzso these zzso zzso and zzso form an zzso and that the area immediately upstream from the zzso gene is necessary for the expression of both the zzso and zzso zzso We have now studied the upstream promoter and the downstream zzso regions of this zzso more zzso We have shown that the major zzso initiation site zzso of the zzso is located 475 base pairs zzso upstream from the zzso gene and that there is an open reading frame that encodes for a zzso of 115 zzso acids between the zzso site and the zzso start zzso for the zzso zzso zzso from the stop zzso for the zzso gene is a potential hairpin structure immediately followed by an zzso termination site, zzso An additional zzso termination site, zzso is present about 110 zzso downstream from zzso and is stronger than zzso By comparing our DNA fragments with those prepared from this region of the zzso coli zzso by zzso et zzso we have located the zzso zzso on the physical map of the zzso coli zzso We have shown that the orientation of the zzso zzso is zzso and that the zzso is located zzso to 140 zzso zzso minutes) zzso from the zero position of the zzso coli zzso zzso
