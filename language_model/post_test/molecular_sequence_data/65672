zzso zzso produces zzso zzso weight zzso compounds, to obtain iron under conditions of iron zzso To identify genes associated with the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso O, we screened clones with zzso random insertions for those showing decreased production of zzso Among 6,000 clones screened, nine such clones were zzso These clones contain the zzso inserted in zzso zzso zzso zzso that is a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso There is an another zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream to zzso We named these two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B, zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso showed a decreased production of zzso The expression of an zzso fusion was zzso modulated by the presence of iron, and the regulation was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the expression of the zzso genes was still not fully zzso in the zzso condition, even in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that some other unknown factors are involved in the regulation of the zzso We also demonstrated that the zzso genes are important for zzso of the pathogen in a mice zzso
