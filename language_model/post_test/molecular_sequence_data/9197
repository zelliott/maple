Human zzso zzso zzso is a major component of zzso secretions, possessing multiple important biological zzso Here we have established three methods to purify zzso in human saliva for comprehensive characterization of zzso by high-resolution zzso mass zzso zzso Among the three zzso methods, the affinity method based on the zzso specific interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso providing the highest purity zzso with high zzso zzso we employed zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso to analyze the zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso zzso from saliva of various races and genders is zzso with the same molecular weight of zzso which is zzso lower than the calculated value based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso of the first 15 zzso zzso acids zzso and the subsequent formation of zzso acid at the new zzso zzso zzso More importantly, five zzso bonds in zzso were identified zzso and effectively localized by tandem zzso in conjunction with complete and partial reduction by zzso zzso zzso Overall, this study demonstrates that zzso zzso combined with affinity zzso and partial reduction is a powerful method for rapid zzso and complete characterization of large proteins with complex and overlapping zzso bond zzso
