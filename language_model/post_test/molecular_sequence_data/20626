zzso zzso channel zzso a background leak zzso channel, has been strongly implicated as the target of several general and local zzso Here, using the zzso and single-channel zzso technique, we investigated the effect of zzso a local zzso on the human zzso channel zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells by an zzso expression zzso zzso at clinical zzso produced zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso value of 180 zzso by reducing the single-channel open probability and stabilizing the closed zzso We have identified a zzso placed unique aromatic couplet zzso and zzso in the vicinity of the protein zzso A zzso site, zzso in the zzso domain zzso of zzso that is critical for the action of zzso Furthermore, the zzso state of zzso was found to have a regulatory role in zzso zzso of zzso It is interesting that we observed strong zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso for the binding of zzso to zzso Studies with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso revealed that single zzso of zzso was capable of zzso partial zzso by zzso but complete zzso zzso the cooperative interaction between both the zzso upon binding of zzso Based on our zzso we propose a model that explains the unique zzso and provides a plausible paradigm for the zzso action of zzso on zzso
