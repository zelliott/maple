The zzso effects of zzso include infection of the central nervous system zzso which can result in cognitive and motor zzso zzso zzso virus zzso infection of zzso zzso provides an excellent model of zzso zzso We have achieved a zzso infection of the zzso using a stock of virus obtained by serial passage of zzso zzso Since the envelope genes of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso important in viral zzso and the zzso inherent in these viruses provides a molecular footprint of viral zzso we analyzed the viral zzso sequences resulting from this serial zzso zzso zzso sequences were analyzed by direct zzso amplification of DNA isolated from zzso from infected zzso zzso sequence comparison reveals that serial passage of zzso zzso resulted in divergence from the donor stock of zzso Furthermore, an enrichment of unique zzso zzso which is maintained through the serial passage was found in the diseased zzso
