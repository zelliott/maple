A new zzso zzso zzso has been cloned in zzso zzso zzso that is expressed in all zzso zzso of the plant, mainly in the zzso but not in flower zzso zzso expression is established early during zzso development and is not regulated by zzso zzso similarity besides the spatial and zzso expression patterns allow to define a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and the gene zzso zzso of the zzso sense zzso under the control of the zzso cauliflower mosaic virus promoter zzso the zzso structure by increasing both zzso length and flower proliferation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso features to the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression overcomes the increase in flowering time and zzso number produced under zzso zzso while the flowering time is not affected in zzso zzso These results are discussed in terms of a possible role for zzso in promoting zzso zzso
