The infectious zzso disease virus zzso a member of the zzso family, is the zzso agent of an immune depressive disease that affects zzso and wild avian zzso The expression strategy of zzso includes the synthesis of a zzso zzso containing the zzso precursor zzso The zzso is zzso processed rendering three zzso zzso We have carried out a systematic analysis, using a series of plasmids zzso zzso containing either deletions or single zzso acid zzso to identify the processing zzso The results obtained showed the existence of two sites, zzso and zzso that are essential for the processing of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso These sequences are highly zzso among zzso strains form zzso 1 and zzso A secondary zzso processing site was detected in a zzso acid stretch located upstream of the zzso zzso zzso using versions of the zzso zzso processing site containing conservative and zzso zzso acid zzso demonstrated that the specificity of the zzso is dictated by the zzso AA zzso
