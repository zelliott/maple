The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso has been suggested to be implicated in mental disorders in both humans and other zzso We have isolated a canine bacterial artificial zzso zzso clone containing zzso revealed the coding and surrounding DNA sequence of canine zzso and designed primer sets for zzso sequencing of the zzso A zzso scan in 10 dogs revealed five single zzso zzso in the zzso coding zzso By random sequencing of zzso of the zzso a zzso zzso repeat was zzso We found evidence for at least four extended zzso in six dogs of the same zzso The zzso zzso of the gene was confirmed by zzso in zzso zzso and radiation hybrid zzso This work provides a starting point for zzso scans and association studies on dogs with zzso zzso
