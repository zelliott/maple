Many proteins of the zzso gene family are zzso channels, whereas others, like the bacterial zzso or zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso converted these zzso into zzso zzso as did the zzso of another, zzso zzso zzso in zzso We show here that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not replacing it with zzso zzso or zzso rather abolished zzso and zzso zzso Surface expression was unchanged by these zzso zzso zzso transport could be restored in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by additionally zzso the gating zzso suggesting that wild type proteins transport zzso only when zzso are supplied through a zzso zzso zzso Each zzso unit of the zzso protein was found to be able to carry out zzso exchange independently from the transport activity of the neighboring zzso zzso or zzso transport was partially zzso from zzso zzso but still depended on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso channels altered their gating but failed to convert them into zzso zzso Noise analysis indicated that zzso switches between silent and transporting states with an apparent zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the idea that zzso exchange of the zzso zzso and -5 proteins relies on zzso delivery from an zzso zzso zzso at position 268 zzso of zzso and that the strong zzso of currents arises from the zzso zzso transfer from zzso to zzso
