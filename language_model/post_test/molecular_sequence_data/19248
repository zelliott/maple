zzso proteins zzso play important roles in the regulation of zzso function in zzso We describe zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso along cortical zzso as patches of zzso zzso zzso is expressed mostly in the expanding zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso exhibit various growth zzso with loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly altered in cells either zzso zzso or where it had been zzso by zzso interference zzso The cortical zzso were more sensitive to treatment with zzso drugs when zzso was zzso but more resistant when zzso was eliminated in cells expressing zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso may play a role in regulating directional cell growth and cortical zzso organization by zzso zzso
