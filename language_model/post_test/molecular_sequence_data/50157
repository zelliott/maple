A regulatory cascade zzso zzso type III zzso and zzso genes was delineated in zzso zzso zzso zzso a bacterial pathogen of zzso Four zzso regulatory genes were zzso zzso and zzso zzso the sensor zzso and response regulator, respectively, of a zzso signal zzso system; zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso and zzso encodes an alternative zzso zzso zzso analysis, expression studies using gene zzso and genetic reconstruction of each step in zzso coli were used to delineate the following zzso zzso activates zzso and also positively zzso the zzso zzso In turn, zzso is required for full zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso controls expression of all known zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso and all downstream zzso genes were regulated by pH and salt zzso zzso with zzso deletions in zzso were still partially virulent on corn but were unable to sense the chemical or zzso signals that induce zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicated that zzso 57 is the probable zzso site and that it is needed for zzso These findings suggest that both zzso and an alternate mechanism are involved in the zzso of zzso in zzso
