We have previously reported an observation that the regulatory sequence of the human zzso zzso type 18 zzso elicits only zzso and zzso zzso activities in transgenic mice zzso et zzso zzso (1992) zzso We have now extended the study to other transgenic mice carrying an entire or a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Extremely low levels of zzso transcripts were detected in various zzso of the mice only by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso On analysis of the zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was clearly observed, therefore suggesting a possible explanation for low level zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso transgenic zzso
