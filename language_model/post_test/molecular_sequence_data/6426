A point zzso in the zzso zzso has been identified as a cause of diabetes and zzso We report two zzso with and zzso transition at zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso gene and focus our investigations on other zzso of the anomaly, particularly muscle and zzso 

zzso zzso has been studied in zzso by invasive and zzso methods, including muscle biopsy zzso of the proportion of zzso zzso in comparison to blood cells, measurement of respiratory chain complex activities and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and zzso examination of zzso zzso and visual evoked zzso were performed in five zzso 

This zzso previously described in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso episodes zzso was expressed more abundantly in muscle than in zzso blood zzso This low expression in blood cells could hamper the diagnosis for some zzso In addition, despite poor clinical zzso muscle was found to be highly zzso zzso red fibers and zzso zzso were observed in muscle zzso zzso zzso showed decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes, and zzso in zzso data further confirmed the zzso of muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso production was zzso Finally, in both families, an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed without consequences on visual zzso 

In diabetes secondary to zzso zzso zzso zzso muscular and zzso zzso are zzso These two locations of the disease, which are easily investigated by simple methods, can help in the diagnosis of this new type of zzso
