zzso responsiveness in peripheral zzso is variable in patients with resistance to zzso hormone zzso One cause of this may be differential interaction of zzso zzso of zzso hormone zzso beta zzso zzso with zzso auxiliary proteins zzso We used gel shift mobility zzso to examine the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso beta s with zzso X receptors zzso and zzso zzso Some zzso showed reduced zzso but retained zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso beta formed zzso complexes with multiple zzso in nuclear extracts of rat zzso but zzso zzso showed zzso altered zzso with each zzso With liver nuclear zzso all zzso with impaired zzso also showed impaired zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso with zzso and zzso are differently affected by zzso zzso Our results suggest that multiple zzso are expressed in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso beta zzso with zzso may account, in part, for the variable tissue responsiveness in zzso
