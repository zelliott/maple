zzso is a U2 zzso protein complex essential for zzso zzso Although evidence that zzso contains the zzso proteins zzso 49, zzso zzso and 155 has zzso a zzso association between all of these proteins has yet to be directly zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which completes the cloning of the putative zzso complex zzso Using zzso to zzso 130 and other putative zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso and 155 are present in a protein complex in nuclear extracts and that these proteins associate with one another in zzso U2 zzso Moreover, zzso 155 and 130 interact with each other zzso or zzso within this complex, and zzso 49 and 145 are known to interact directly with each zzso Thus, together with prior work, our studies indicate that zzso 49, zzso zzso and 155 are indeed components of zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso 49 and 145 are zzso by essential zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso 130 and 155 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are also zzso Recently, the zzso proteins were found in zzso zzso zzso which functionally zzso for U2 zzso in the minor zzso This high level of zzso together with the prior observation that the zzso proteins interact with zzso very close to the branch site, suggest that the zzso complex plays a critical role near or at the zzso zzso zzso
