zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which has an estimated zzso of approximately 1 in 100,000 zzso cause zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of the zzso gene and the zzso correlations have not yet fully been zzso We report a compound zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a Chinese twin family with zzso zzso and zzso We also describe the gene zzso associated with the zzso of these children with zzso zzso and zzso The whole coding sequence of the zzso gene was analyzed by direct zzso and the identified changes in the sequence were tested for benign zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso screening of the zzso and sequencing 200 zzso from normal zzso Analysis of the zzso gene of the affected twin revealed a compound zzso zzso including a novel zzso zzso zzso which is predicted to result in a zzso to zzso substitution at zzso zzso and a known nonsense zzso zzso predicted to result in an zzso to stop zzso at zzso zzso Analysis of 200 normal zzso did not identify the same change in healthy zzso This is the first report of a zzso gene zzso in the Chinese Han zzso Our study provides further evidence that zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso zzso and hypothyroidism, demonstrates genetic zzso of the zzso and increases our understanding of zzso correlations in zzso zzso
