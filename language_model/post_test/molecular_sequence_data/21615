Previous researches showed that zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is the first regulatory point in zzso We zzso certain interactions between the environmental stress factors and the regulatory sequences of zzso in zzso zzso zzso LA zzso zzso walking approach was performed for isolation of zzso promoter and zzso zzso The obtained zzso acid sequences and the corresponding protein structure of zzso were analyzed and predicted using various zzso zzso Finally, we presented some hints for the regulation mechanisms of zzso at the molecular level according to the zzso zzso 

LA zzso zzso walking results showed that the isolated sequences are the promoter and zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated several candidate motifs of the promoter exhibiting zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as some typical zzso universally discovered in promoter zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the structure of zzso was also predicted and aligned along with many counterparts at the protein zzso Low zzso of zzso was found in zzso while a relatively zzso zzso was predicted to be involved in the zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso analysis classified the zzso into a cluster with other zzso These results implied that zzso may share similar regulation mechanisms among algae with respect to their zzso while the diversity in zzso among zzso along with the predicted zzso motifs in zzso promoter from zzso may zzso the fine tuning differences between zzso and other zzso 

By means of computer techniques, we found in zzso that two interesting zzso motifs of zzso promoter may involve in zzso zzso and salt regulation zzso and that the diversity of zzso protein mainly lies in the zzso among zzso These results indicate some hints for regulation mechanisms of zzso in zzso
