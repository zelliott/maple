In zzso c zzso the zzso part of zzso II is outside the membrane and contains a copper center called zzso We have expressed this domain of the zzso zzso zzso in a soluble zzso Data obtained by quantitative zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso show that the center contains two copper atoms probably in a mixed zzso zzso Its zzso spectrum is similar to that of the copper center A in nitrous oxide zzso The zzso spectrum suggests that the center in the soluble protein is closely related to the native zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso However, it seems likely that the copper center in the soluble domain is more exposed to the zzso milieu than in the intact complex because its zzso and zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso At alkaline pH one of the zzso in the site acquires zzso character, indicating that it may be coordinated to a new zzso The zzso of this zzso change is about zzso The zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso
