We investigated the nature of the zzso modification of the zzso forms of the small zzso integral membrane zzso zzso zzso designated zzso of respiratory zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso protein expressed in cells infected with zzso virus or with a zzso zzso virus revealed two zzso zzso protein species, zzso and zzso which contained zzso zzso zzso zzso migrated zzso on zzso gels, which suggested modification by zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso was established from three lines of zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso in a cell line zzso zzso defective in the ability to add specific zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso chains required the addition of zzso which is a component of the zzso repeating unit; zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso with zzso which zzso the beta zzso linkage between zzso and zzso of the repeated zzso zzso and zzso zzso was selected by zzso zzso zzso zzso which has specificity for zzso The presence of zzso as a component of zzso human zzso A and B and bovine zzso virus particles was demonstrated by zzso affinity zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso was selected by zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso may associate to form complexes within infected cells and virus zzso To identify zzso zzso acid zzso among the human and bovine zzso zzso that may function as signals for zzso zzso the zzso sequences of the zzso protein genes of a human zzso B virus zzso and a bovine virus zzso were determined and compared to those of a human zzso A virus zzso a zzso B virus zzso and a bovine virus zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the human and bovine zzso virus zzso proteins indicated that a central zzso region and the presence of potential zzso zzso sites on either side of the central zzso region were zzso features that may be required for the zzso modification of zzso
