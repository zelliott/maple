Cystic zzso in humans and livestock animals is caused by infection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso A number of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are known to exist, with the zzso cluster zzso and zzso zzso being responsible for the majority of humans zzso A zzso vaccine has been developed for use in livestock to prevent infection with zzso zzso The vaccine is based on the zzso zzso which is expressed in the early zzso stage zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso was originally cloned from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the protein has been found to be zzso by members of a small family of related genes in this zzso Reliable information has not been available about the likely efficacy of the zzso vaccine against zzso other than zzso In this study, zzso DNA cloning techniques were used to characterize seven zzso gene fragments from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Three proteins appear to be zzso by these zzso zzso differences were found between the zzso related proteins from the zzso zzso compared with the zzso protein from the zzso zzso These differences suggest that the zzso proteins from the zzso zzso may have different zzso zzso compared with the current vaccine zzso Data presented in this study have implications for future vaccine design and provide the information that would enable a zzso zzso vaccine to be developed against zzso zzso should this be considered a desirable addition to the available tools for control of zzso zzso zzso
