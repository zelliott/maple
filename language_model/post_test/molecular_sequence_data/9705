The crystal structure of the complex between the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso DNA has been zzso The specific zzso domain contains three zzso of which two form a zzso zzso zzso The recognition of zzso DNA by the zzso is zzso through zzso contacts and zzso between protein and zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso motif makes four zzso contacts with the major groove, and the zzso makes three zzso contacts with the minor zzso The DNA zzso adopts a zzso zzso zzso made possible by a stretch of seven zzso base pairs at one end and a zzso sequence towards the other zzso zzso contacts zzso salt bridges and 16 hydrogen zzso of the protein with the DNA backbone allow the protein to probe and recognize the zzso DNA zzso The zzso domain forms a zzso in the zzso Each zzso binds a separate zzso end, zzso that the zzso plays a role in zzso necessary for the simultaneous zzso of both zzso zzso
