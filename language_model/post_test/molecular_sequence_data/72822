We previously reported the cloning of a human zzso zzso which encodes a small zzso protein belonging to the zzso zzso Here we describe a mouse zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Mouse zzso is zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso identical at the zzso acid level compared to human zzso The mouse zzso gene is comprised of two zzso and a single zzso Northern zzso of tissue zzso indicates that the zzso gene is predominantly expressed in zzso
