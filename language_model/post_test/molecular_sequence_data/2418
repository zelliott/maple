zzso and growth factors have been chemically coupled to different toxins to produce zzso molecules that selectively kill cells bearing appropriate zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso produced using conventional chemical zzso techniques have several zzso zzso The smallest binding unit of an zzso is an zzso zzso which consists of a light and heavy chain variable zzso Recently, active single chain zzso fragments of zzso have been produced in zzso coli by attaching the light and heavy chain variable zzso together with a zzso zzso Here we describe the construction and expression in zzso coli of a single chain zzso toxin fusion zzso zzso in which the variable regions of zzso a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso are joined in zzso linkage to zzso a modified form of zzso zzso lacking its binding zzso zzso was very zzso to two zzso zzso human cell lines but was not zzso to zzso zzso
