To understand how fruit development is controlled, we have begun experiments to identify DNA sequences and proteins that regulate gene expression during tomato zzso zzso fruit zzso We have focused on the zzso gene because its zzso is responsive to zzso hormone and is activated at the onset of fruit zzso We report here that sequences required for zzso and zzso regulated zzso gene expression in transgenic tomato plants are contained on a zzso zzso restriction zzso which includes sequences 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3' to the zzso In addition, we have identified a zzso factor that specifically interacts with DNA sequences that flank the zzso zzso This zzso activity is low in zzso fruit and increases during fruit zzso This factor also binds to the zzso region of another zzso gene which is zzso expressed during tomato fruit zzso These data suggest that the DNA zzso may be involved in the regulation of gene expression during fruit zzso
