The zzso zzso syndrome results from the zzso of the zzso zzso gene in non zzso zzso To determine its mechanisms, we examined in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso factors binding to the human zzso gene zzso Three binding sites were identified in the zzso promoter and proteins were studied by zzso zzso One of them is a binding site for zzso proteins in zzso cells but is bound in zzso cells by zzso distinct from these zzso The remaining two binding sites bound yet unidentified proteins and were both functionally active in zzso zzso We also showed that zzso cells lacked a factor required for zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Altogether, our results indicate that zzso gene expression in zzso cells is achieved without several of the zzso factors and provide a preliminary characterization of some factors involved in this zzso They also reveal that zzso cells are deficient in proteins involved in the regulation by zzso and zzso
