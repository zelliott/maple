We report on a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso with enhanced activity toward zzso zzso was identified in a zzso zzso coli zzso isolate zzso zzso and is a zzso zzso acid substitution zzso of zzso By molecular typing of zzso zzso coli strains previously isolated in the same hospital ward, we were able to identify a putative zzso zzso zzso of zzso which had a zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso To reproduce the natural evolution of zzso we selected for zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso gene in zzso both in clinical isolate zzso and in zzso zzso zzso strain zzso These experiments yielded zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which zzso higher levels of resistance to zzso than to zzso zzso zzso had a level of low activity toward zzso which may explain its absence from clinical zzso We conclude that the selection of zzso could have occurred in zzso following treatment with zzso and was likely facilitated by the zzso zzso
