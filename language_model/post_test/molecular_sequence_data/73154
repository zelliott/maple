This work examines the functional properties and zzso gene zzso of 15 zzso T cell clones derived from five patients with systemic lupus zzso All these clones proliferated and zzso zzso when zzso in zzso by zzso (but not zzso B zzso Individual T cell clones used diverse zzso genes and did not show skewing toward the preferential usage of zzso charged zzso zzso T cell clones supported zzso B cell zzso as characterized by the production of zzso zzso syndrome A, and zzso zzso zzso zzso This T cell help was zzso through the production of zzso zzso especially zzso Although stimulation of the zzso clones was blocked by zzso class II zzso the T cell clones did not zzso nor did they support zzso zzso production by zzso class zzso normal B zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso clones derived from the same patients provided help selectively to B cells zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso T cells from systemic lupus zzso patients are triggered to provide help following zzso interactions with zzso presented in the context of zzso class II molecules expressed on zzso B cells regardless of their zzso
