zzso zzso zzso were derived against the zzso culture form of zzso zzso and 14 were selected which bound to the surface of living zzso in zzso zzso These zzso bound to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso (both zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso but not to zzso of other species of zzso to zzso forms of several species of zzso or to zzso and were thus life cycle zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso analysis with these zzso showed that the zzso of expression of the surface zzso during transformation from zzso to zzso forms was similar to that of zzso or zzso zzso repetitive protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso appearing at the cell surface as early as 8 h after initiating zzso All zzso zzso detected broad bands of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso analysis of whole zzso zzso and were specific for zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and gel zzso and was shown to be an zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso showed an abundance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of peptides produced by zzso zzso zzso matched zzso acid sequences predicted by the zzso sequence of a gene described in the accompanying paper by zzso et zzso zzso No sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso or to any other protein was zzso However, its stage and zzso zzso surface zzso zzso acidity and zzso of expression during transformation from zzso to zzso forms indicate that the zzso is an analog of zzso described in zzso zzso zzso
