zzso zzso protein A zzso is a member of a rapidly expanding family of zzso proteins that are expressed during pregnancy by the rat zzso according to specific zzso zzso Although the factors involved in the zzso expression of the zzso and growth hormone genes themselves have been extensively zzso essentially nothing is known of the factors responsible for the zzso expression of these new family zzso In this paper we describe the isolation of zzso zzso zzso analyze a portion of the zzso zzso sequence of this gene and use the recently described rat zzso cell line, zzso in transient zzso studies to show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence is sufficient to specify zzso expression of the zzso zzso
