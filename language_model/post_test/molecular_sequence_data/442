zzso of neurotransmitter receptors can modify their activity and regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved not only in zzso development, but also in synaptic function and zzso Here we demonstrate that group I zzso zzso receptors zzso which zzso zzso signaling by zzso to zzso signal zzso zzso are zzso by zzso In zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso within the domain of the zzso that interacts with the scaffolding protein zzso Using a novel zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso domain of both zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso and that zzso of zzso with zzso decreases the amount of zzso zzso Furthermore, kinetic binding analysis, by surface zzso zzso indicates that zzso of zzso enhances its association with zzso Homer protein complexes in the zzso density, and their disruption by an zzso short zzso zzso zzso have been shown to regulate the trafficking and signaling of the zzso and impact many zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso provides a novel mechanism for potentially regulating a subset of zzso zzso
