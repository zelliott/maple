The expression of the gene zzso detected at low level in rice zzso zzso zzso grown for 3 days at 29 degrees C, is strongly induced by treatments at 4 degrees zzso At zzso temperatures of 10 and 15 degrees C, its expression in rice zzso is already zzso but this effect cannot be zzso by other stresses or zzso zzso We demonstrate by transient expression that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso function in zzso is demonstrated zzso its zzso in zzso zzso plants zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants show a significant increased cold and freezing zzso measured as membrane or zzso II zzso stability and as whole plant zzso Finally, in zzso transgenic plants, the expression of genes participating in different zzso pathways is affected, suggesting that zzso represents a master switch in cold zzso
