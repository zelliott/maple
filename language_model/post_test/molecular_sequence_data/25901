The distribution and properties of zzso brain zzso zzso zzso differ not only from those of the guinea pig brain, but also from that of the rat zzso In guinea pig zzso the zzso 1 is the dominant zzso zzso zzso brain contains mainly the zzso 2 zzso and the distribution of the rat brain zzso is intermediate between the two zzso In competition experiments it has been established that zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso have relatively high affinities to zzso brain zzso The zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso also show high affinities to the zzso zzso Kappa 1 binding sites measured in the presence of 5 zzso represent zzso of zzso binding in zzso brain zzso The zzso 2 zzso in zzso brain resembles more to the zzso zzso than the delta zzso of zzso zzso but it differs from the zzso zzso in displaying low affinity toward zzso and zzso zzso From our data it is evident that the zzso zzso zzso are already present in the zzso brain but the differences among them are less pronounced than in zzso zzso
