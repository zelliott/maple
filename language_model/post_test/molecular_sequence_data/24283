The zzso zzso zzso of zzso modulated by the coordinated actions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulates the cellular response to a wide variety of zzso It is established that protein zzso possess discrete sets of zzso and that zzso recognition is often dictated by the presence of consensus zzso zzso Here, we have extended this concept to the zzso and demonstrated that zzso is a consensus zzso recognition motif for zzso We have shown that zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso and that the zzso recognition site within zzso zzso is similar to the site of zzso previously identified within the insulin zzso A zzso zzso of zzso formed a stable interaction with zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso of wild type or zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Finally, mouse zzso zzso deficient in zzso displayed subtle changes in zzso zzso including zzso of zzso The closely related zzso family member, zzso which does not match the consensus zzso site, was not recognized as a zzso These data illustrate that zzso may be an important zzso regulator of zzso signaling and that it may be possible to derive consensus zzso recognition motifs for other members of the zzso family, which may then be used to predict novel zzso zzso
