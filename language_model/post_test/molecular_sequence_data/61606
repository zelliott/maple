The genes for zzso factor zzso and four zzso factor super family members zzso are tightly linked on zzso 16, with only 325 zzso separating zzso and zzso We used Northern zzso and zzso to show that these two genes are expressed independently of one zzso We then used a novel zzso promoter prediction method based on the interaction among zzso factor binding sites zzso to identify a putative promoter region for the zzso zzso Our method predicted a promoter region in the last zzso of the upstream zzso zzso We zzso amplified the predicted promoter region and used a zzso zzso to show that the region was able to drive the zzso zzso DNA decoy experiments indicated that 214 zzso zzso neighboring the zzso box markedly inhibited zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of the region revealed a typical zzso box zzso and multiple potential zzso factor binding sites, providing further evidence for this being a functional promoter for zzso This work provides the first evidence of a promoter from one gene located in an zzso of zzso
