We have generated a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that reacted specifically with all zzso zzso lines expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was suitable for zzso typing of freshly isolated blood zzso zzso Analysis of available zzso acid sequences of zzso molecules indicated that the alpha 1 domain does not contain the zzso zzso zzso Since zzso is associated with a unique zzso zzso at position 167 that points towards the zzso binding groove, we propose that zzso of the alpha 2 domain zzso is a critical part of the zzso zzso
