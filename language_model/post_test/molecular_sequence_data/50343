A 21 zzso protein zzso from bovine brain zzso was previously described as a zzso zzso binding zzso however, its accurate biological function remained still zzso In order to get further information about its potential biological role, an extended prediction of its secondary and three zzso structures was zzso We describe here a process which permitted us to discover a structural zzso between the 21 zzso protein and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This process is based on comparing the 21 zzso protein with all the proteins presenting a slight zzso by using the zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso According to the observed similarity between the zzso of zzso zzso and the 21 zzso zzso we built a model which was shown to possess a potential binding site for zzso Moreover, the model obtained presents three-dimensional zzso structure similarity with zzso zzso These results suggest two main zzso zzso the 21 zzso protein may belong to the zzso family; zzso the binding of a zzso could imply a modification of the zzso structure of the 21 zzso protein that can promote the transfer of zzso zzso to the plasma zzso Meanwhile, zzso of these hypotheses has been in part performed zzso the 21 zzso protein binds zzso as well as, to a lesser extent, zzso
