To evaluate if potential defects in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene could contribute to zzso to type 2 diabetes zzso we have screened 151 type 2 zzso patients for zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso Both a single substitution zzso to zzso at position 18 and a zzso deletion zzso at position 26 of zzso 3 have been detected in five type 2 zzso patients and in one control zzso The evolution time of diabetes was longer in patients with these zzso than in patients without zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso years, p zzso zzso These zzso generate a cryptic site that may have functional significance in the correct mechanism of the zzso zzso In the process of zzso amplification of the zzso gene we also unexpectedly amplified the zzso zzso zzso we decided to further characterize and completely sequence zzso zzso of this zzso zzso Our results suggest that two previously reported zzso zzso partial sequences may be identical copies of the zzso gene inserted in two different zzso locations and provide information about the alternative zzso and zzso zzso The data obtained are also important in order to avoid zzso amplification of the zzso zzso in the process of screening for zzso zzso in diabetic zzso
