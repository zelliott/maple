zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso have been obtained at two different pH conditions by zzso diffusion using sodium zzso as zzso and zzso as an zzso At pH zzso the zzso have the symmetry of the zzso space group zzso or zzso (a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, gamma zzso 120 degrees zzso at pH 6-7, the zzso have the symmetry of the zzso space group zzso (a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso In both cases, there is probably one zzso of zzso alpha in the zzso zzso At least one of the crystal forms zzso to a resolution higher than 3 A using the laboratory X-ray zzso the zzso are suitable for crystal structure zzso
