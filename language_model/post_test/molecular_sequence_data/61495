zzso zzso of zzso C, zzso and Y zzso were previously reported to be zzso at the zzso acid zzso There is evidence that zzso affects the zzso of zzso zzso We identified genes indispensable for zzso of zzso C, zzso and Y zzso downstream of the capsule synthesis genes zzso The genes were zzso with the zzso zzso as shown by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso were designated zzso and zzso The protein zzso of zzso zzso and Y showed sequence zzso to members of the zzso family of bacterial zzso whereas no sequence zzso with any known protein in the different databases was found for the zzso C protein zzso In zzso zzso and Y zzso several zzso lineages either lacked zzso or zzso was zzso by zzso of zzso For zzso C zzso we observed in zzso phase variation of zzso which resulted from zzso zzso in zzso zzso This finding explains the observation of naturally occurring zzso zzso C zzso Our report is the first description of sequences of zzso acid zzso genes that have not been cloned from either other bacterial or zzso zzso
