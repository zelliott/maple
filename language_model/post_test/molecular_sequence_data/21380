An zzso zzso zzso zzso II, was zzso from zzso zzso and designated as zzso The deduced internal zzso acid sequence of the novel zzso has a high degree of sequence identity with the zzso II from zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso exhibits characteristics comparable to that of zzso I, as well as zzso zzso Similar to zzso I, the novel zzso has a specific activity of zzso zzso against zzso The zzso retains about zzso of its maximum activity after zzso of incubation at pH zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as the zzso ethanol concentration increased by zzso during simultaneous zzso and zzso when supplemented with low doses of zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report involving a zzso zzso zzso zzso The present paper provides new insight into the role of zzso II in cellulose zzso
