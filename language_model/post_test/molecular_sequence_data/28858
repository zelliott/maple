Genome sequencing projects produce large amounts of information that could be translated into potential protein zzso Such amounts of material continuously increase protein database zzso At present, 22 times more protein sequences are available in the zzso and zzso databases than 8 years ago in zzso One of the methods of choice for protein identification makes use of specific zzso zzso followed by zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Since 1993, when this technique was first demonstrated, the conditions required for a correct identification have changed zzso zzso 4-5 peptides with an uncertainty of 2-3 Da were sufficient for a correct identification in 1993, zzso peptides with less than 60 zzso mass error are now required for human and zzso coli zzso This evolution is directly related to the continuous increase in protein database sizes, which causes an increase in the number of false positive matches in identification zzso Use of an information complement deduced from the primary protein zzso in the process of identification by zzso mass zzso can help to increase confidence in the identification zzso In this article, we propose the exchange of zzso hydrogen atoms with zzso atoms to provide an alternative information zzso The exchange reaction with zzso techniques has shown an average zzso of zzso zzso exchange on zzso zzso This level of exchange was sufficient to single out one or more peptides from a list of potential candidate proteins due to the dependence of zzso exchange on the zzso primary zzso This technique also has clear advantages in the identification of small proteins where direct protein identification is impaired by the limited number of zzso zzso Then, information related to primary sequence obtained with this technique could help to identify proteins with high confidence without any expensive tandem mass zzso zzso
