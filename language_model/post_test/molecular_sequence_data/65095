zzso protein zzso is an zzso adapter protein that binds to the zzso zzso Recent work suggests that signaling through these molecules is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso muscle is the major site of zzso zzso disposal but there have been no reports of zzso function in this zzso Using zzso of mouse skeletal muscle zzso we discovered a novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is different from the zzso form by inclusion of a novel zzso zzso zzso This zzso encodes a zzso sequence that shows very high similarity with zzso 25 of the human zzso of zzso zzso To understand the function of zzso in zzso zzso regulation, zzso zzso were zzso with either zzso or a truncated zzso devoid of all three zzso zzso zzso which prevents zzso association with zzso zzso with zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso had no effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso stimuli that work through zzso mechanisms for the regulation of zzso zzso These data demonstrate the existence of a novel zzso zzso expressed in skeletal muscle, and suggest the involvement of the zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
