To study the role of zzso zzso zzso in early zzso development, we cloned zzso for six different zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso at different stages of development and describe here a novel zzso called zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso acids including a putative signal zzso of 22 zzso At the zzso end of the zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso domain containing a segment that is 38% identical with a rat zzso sequence between zzso zzso Following this domain is an zzso zzso a putative zzso site for zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso lacks a zzso zzso zzso or hinge region, typically found in other zzso between the zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso domain is composed of four tandem repeats that are zzso identical to a sequence zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso gene is zzso expressed during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso pairs was zzso in the zzso stage zzso induced in zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso and then zzso in zzso zzso In comparison, other zzso zzso genes that we have cloned show a different zzso zzso In zzso zzso the only zzso gene expressed was found to be zzso type IV zzso which was also expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and two different membrane zzso was first detected in the zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and the novel zzso reported here play a role in zzso early zzso
