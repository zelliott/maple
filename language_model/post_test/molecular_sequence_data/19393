zzso leader zzso adds a short zzso the spliced leader zzso to zzso to generate zzso ends of zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso also adds a new cap to the zzso a zzso zzso zzso that replaces the typical zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and not zzso zzso zzso are present in the same zzso Previous studies using zzso systems to compare the overall translation of zzso versus zzso zzso led to different zzso Here, we examine the contribution of zzso and zzso sequence and other zzso elements to in zzso zzso translation and stability in zzso zzso Although zzso of all zzso zzso have a zzso the zzso cap does not support translation as well as an zzso However, when the zzso cap and zzso are present together, they zzso interact and translation is zzso indicating both zzso elements are necessary to promote efficient zzso The zzso by itself does not act as a zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso interacts with the zzso cap enhancing translation and plays a greater role in zzso translation of zzso zzso In general, recipient zzso sequences between the zzso and zzso and the 3' zzso do not significantly contribute to the translation of zzso zzso Overall, the combination of zzso cap and zzso contribute to zzso translation and stability in a manner typical of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso but they do not zzso enhance zzso translation or stability compared to zzso without the zzso zzso
