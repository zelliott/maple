The zzso zzso gene zzso required for zzso production by zzso zzso is located between the zzso zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso We have cloned and zzso the zzso regions from three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso species zzso zzso that belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these sequences revealed portions of predicted zzso with high similarities to the zzso zzso While zzso zzso species zzso coded for a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to zzso zzso of zzso indicating that these zzso possess another as yet unidentified zzso zzso By means of zzso expression cloning using zzso zzso we isolated the responsible zzso gene from zzso zzso on the basis of this zzso zzso has been cloned from zzso zzso by zzso zzso Both zzso showed only a limited level of zzso sequence similarity to zzso and zzso The existence of zzso in a zzso zzso suggests that this gene existed in the zzso zzso before the divergence of producers from zzso in the evolution of zzso zzso
