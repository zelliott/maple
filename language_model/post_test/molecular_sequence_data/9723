Exposure of zzso cells to stressful stimuli results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a family of protein zzso related to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are activated by specific zzso zzso zzso zzso one of which, zzso has been characterized zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are important for embryonic zzso Loss of function of either gene zzso zzso closure, a zzso movement in which the edges of the embryonic zzso move together over the zzso There is evidence that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also required for zzso closure, suggesting that zzso or zzso may regulate zzso and zzso We have identified zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso functionally zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is activated by stress and by the zzso zzso zzso directly zzso and activates zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso of zzso and functions in a zzso signaling zzso involving zzso and the zzso zzso
