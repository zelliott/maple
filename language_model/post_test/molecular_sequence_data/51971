A novel method for identifying DNA point zzso has been developed by using mismatch repair zzso The high specificity of the zzso coli zzso protein has permitted the development of a reliable and sensitive method for the detection and characterization of point zzso in the human zzso The zzso protein is involved in a repair zzso that can convert zzso or zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso formed by zzso between two amplified zzso DNA samples or between specific DNA zzso and target DNA are zzso at the zzso zzso strand by zzso zzso As little as zzso of the zzso sequence can be detected by the mismatch repair zzso zzso zzso method in a mixture of normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are only present in zzso of the normal cell zzso By using different zzso the zzso also can determine the zzso sequence of the zzso We have applied this method to detect zzso zzso in human zzso
