zzso syndrome zzso is a human zzso syndrome characterized by the early onset of a large number of clinical features associated with the normal aging zzso The complex molecular and cellular zzso of zzso involve characteristic features of zzso instability and accelerated zzso zzso The gene involved zzso was recently zzso and its gene product zzso was zzso characterized as a zzso zzso play important roles in a variety of DNA transactions, including DNA zzso transcription, repair, and zzso We have assessed the role of the zzso gene in zzso by analyzing the efficiency of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell lines that carry zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured in zzso cells by zzso incorporation and in zzso by using a zzso template containing the zzso zzso II zzso pol zzso zzso major late zzso With both of these approaches, we find that the zzso efficiency in different zzso cell lines is reduced to zzso of the zzso in cells from normal zzso This zzso can be zzso by the addition of normal cell extracts to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso to the in zzso zzso zzso markedly stimulates zzso pol zzso zzso carried out by nuclear zzso A zzso domain (a direct repeat of 27 zzso zzso also appears to have a role in zzso enhancement, as revealed by a zzso zzso reporter zzso This is further supported by the lack of stimulation of zzso when zzso zzso lacking this domain was added to the in zzso zzso We have thus used several approaches to show a role for zzso in zzso pol II transcription, possibly as a zzso zzso A deficit in either global or regional zzso in zzso cells may be a primary molecular zzso responsible for the zzso clinical zzso
