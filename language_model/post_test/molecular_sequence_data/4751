To assess the clinical significance of minimal residual disease zzso detection by zzso chain reaction zzso we analyzed samples from 26 patients with mantle cell zzso zzso who had undergone bone zzso transplantation zzso at the zzso Cancer zzso The zzso zzso and zzso rearranged zzso heavy chain genes zzso provided molecular markers for detection and follow-up of zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification in 19 of the 26 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso gene sequencing analysis showed zzso zzso in zzso that are characteristic of an zzso driven process suggesting that, in zzso the final zzso transformation occurs in a mature B zzso Of the 19 patients with a zzso zzso marker, 17 underwent zzso 1 an zzso and 1 a zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso All patients had zzso zzso in the bone zzso zzso at the time of zzso irrespective of any history of zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso with zzso zzso eradicated zzso zzso in only two zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with a poor zzso More than half of the patients undergoing zzso zzso had relapsed by the time of restaging at 2 years after zzso zzso In four zzso patients in whom no residual zzso was zzso including the zzso and the zzso zzso only one patient zzso zzso of zzso detection after zzso was also associated with a high probability of zzso although one patient did not have zzso zzso in peripheral blood or zzso before zzso at zzso zzso We conclude that zzso amplification of zzso markers is a feasible and sensitive method to assess zzso and its clinical significance in patients with zzso Moreover, zzso amplification provides a tool to evaluate modifications of zzso and stem cell collection procedures that may be required for the management of this otherwise incurable zzso
