Among the isolated zzso species of soil, one zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a relatively large amount of zzso This zzso has been zzso to apparent zzso by column zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The active zzso requires zzso metal zzso and has an optimum pH of zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso This zzso is an zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and is relatively unstable at low zzso The zzso of the zzso is zzso during gel zzso under zzso conditions but is 28,000 during zzso gel zzso in sodium zzso zzso These results suggest a structure consisting of two zzso The zzso of the zzso can be zzso with zzso The yield of zzso zzso from the zzso is zzso and that of one zzso zzso obtained from the zzso digest is zzso indicating that the native zzso is composed of two identical zzso and probably has two active zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso under conditions that zzso bovine pancreatic zzso The specific activity zzso of zzso of zzso zzso is zzso times that of bovine zzso The zzso acid content of zzso zzso relative to bovine zzso is higher in zzso and lower in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence shows a high degree of zzso with a consensus sequence derived from zzso of three zzso zzso
