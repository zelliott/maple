The zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso contains four WW zzso which are pivotal for the zzso recognition zzso Indeed, this domain is implicated in several zzso complexes zzso involved in human diseases including zzso zzso Alzheimer's Disease and Huntington zzso WW zzso are highly compact zzso binding zzso that interact with short zzso zzso The four WW zzso present in zzso belong to the Group I type, which binds zzso with a zzso motif characterized by a zzso zzso consensus zzso where zzso can be any zzso zzso the zzso interaction results from a direct binding of zzso domain with the zzso motif of zzso Here, we report a structural analysis of the zzso interaction by fluorescence, CD and zzso zzso Indeed, we studied the in zzso interaction between zzso domain and zzso an zzso zzso encompassing a zzso of the zzso protein including the zzso zzso In addition, we evaluated the zzso and the interaction with zzso of a site specific zzso of zzso zzso that has been reported in both zzso syndrome and zzso zzso Based on our results, we propose an extended zzso zzso motif for the zzso recognition motif zzso which includes these zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
