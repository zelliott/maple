Despite tremendous progress in understanding the mechanisms of zzso and alternative zzso an important and widespread step along the gene expression pathway, our ability to deliberately regulate gene expression at this step remains zzso The present study was performed to investigate whether a zzso zzso zzso that sequesters the zzso sequence zzso within zzso complex can regulate alternative zzso 

We constructed a series of zzso in which the zzso was inserted within zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso in a zzso zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso zzso of zzso is highly specific, and zzso stability of zzso complex as well as the location of zzso within this complex affects the efficiency of zzso zzso Finally, we have constructed an alternative zzso model zzso zzso in which zzso caused zzso skipping both in zzso and in zzso suggesting that a small zzso interaction can zzso alternative zzso 

These findings provide the ability to control zzso pattern at will and should have important implications for zzso zzso and biomedical zzso
