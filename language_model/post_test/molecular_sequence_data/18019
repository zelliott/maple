Recent investigations have shown that, in zzso the zzso are located within the zzso zzso rather than on the zzso side of this membrane as found in zzso and red zzso To examine possible mechanisms involved in targeting this protein to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso was zzso This gene encodes an open reading frame of 177 zzso acids that is highly similar to known zzso zzso zzso is expressed as a zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso The genes for the alpha zzso of zzso are not zzso with zzso nor located anywhere near zzso No evidence of zzso or zzso extensions or interior modifications involved in directing the zzso zzso into the zzso of the zzso could be zzso These data suggest that a novel mechanism may be involved in directing zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
