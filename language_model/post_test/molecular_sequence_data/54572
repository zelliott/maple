To investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso expression patterns of kidney in mice with zzso 

Sixty zzso male mice were randomly divided into the zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups, zzso group, model group, and control zzso Except the control group, all mice were established with zzso method combined with zzso zzso method to build zzso model, and the corresponding drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso per day) were zzso on the 7th zzso On the 22nd day, the blood zzso acid concentration was zzso and zzso with obvious changes in kidney was screened with zzso 

The zzso acid in the model group was higher than that in the control group, and the levels of the zzso acid were reduced after being treated with zzso the differences among groups were significant zzso Compared with the control group, 32 kinds of zzso expression changes were detected on the 15th day after being treated with high-dose zzso by zzso expression profile zzso Among them, zzso could inhibit the expression of human zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso might have inhibited the inflammatory zzso 

zzso could significantly reduce the serum zzso acid zzso its effect on zzso might be through affecting zzso zzso
