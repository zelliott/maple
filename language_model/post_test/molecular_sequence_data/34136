The zzso protein is one of the factors controlling translation initiation in zzso This protein is zzso by the zzso zzso which, in several higher plants, is located in the zzso zzso Line 2 zzso an zzso barley zzso was the first to be proposed as an zzso gene zzso zzso 157 zzso in higher zzso This zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso and was made genetically stable by zzso with a zzso nuclear zzso In the present work, genetically stable zzso plants were zzso as females by zzso plants in order to regain the zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso carrying a first leaf blade with a darker green stripe on a typical zzso background was observed in the zzso zzso The T 157 C transition was confirmed in zzso from the zzso background, whereas a second transition (A 178 zzso was also found in the darker zzso Two clearly different levels of zzso syndrome were observed in the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Those of the greener group carried both zzso These results suggest a zzso effect of the second zzso and support the involvement of the zzso zzso gene in zzso syndrome, confirming zzso as the first zzso of this gene reported in higher zzso
