De zzso design of proteins provides an attractive approach to uncover the essential features required for their zzso Previously, we described the design and crystal structure determination of a zzso complex of zzso zzso a protein patterned after the zzso class of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000, 97, zzso The overall structure of zzso which contains a zzso zzso metal site, agrees well with the intended zzso However, access to this zzso site is blocked by a pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which prevent facile entry of metal zzso and small zzso We have now taken the next step in the eventual construction of a zzso active zzso by engineering an active site cavity into zzso through the replacement of these two zzso zzso with smaller zzso The crystal structure of the zzso form of zzso indeed shows a zzso access channel to the zzso zzso In the crystal structure, water molecules and a zzso zzso zzso zzso which forms a zzso bridge between the metal zzso occupy the zzso Furthermore, the zzso form of a zzso of zzso zzso is shown to bind zzso zzso and small aromatic zzso
