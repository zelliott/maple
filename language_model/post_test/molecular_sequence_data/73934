Recently, we have reported the cloning of the germ zzso nuclear orphan zzso germ cell nuclear factor zzso In this study, we characterize the zzso response elements by an zzso mobility shift zzso chain zzso DNA binding site selection zzso zzso binds with the greatest affinity to response elements containing zzso zzso zzso response zzso zzso to which it binds as a zzso zzso is also able to bind as a zzso to a single core motif zzso albeit with a lower zzso zzso analysis supports the specific requirements of the zzso sequence and the core motif of the zzso for optimal binding of zzso An zzso zzso zzso was raised that causes zzso of the zzso complex in zzso Based on the sequence of the zzso we located a putative zzso referred to as zzso in the zzso zzso region of the mouse zzso 2 zzso which is induced during the same stage of zzso as zzso The ability of zzso to cause a zzso of an zzso complex with nuclear extracts from different zzso correlated with the zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was unable to cause zzso zzso of a zzso reporter zzso however, an zzso fusion protein could induce zzso through several zzso including zzso
