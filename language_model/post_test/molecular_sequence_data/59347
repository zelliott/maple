To investigate a possible role for zzso of the zzso sodium channel in patients with essential zzso 

A zzso study screening essential hypertension patients and zzso controls for the presence of a genetic zzso in the zzso sodium channel zzso in the Japanese zzso 

An institutional teaching zzso 

zzso Japanese patients with essential hypertension and 51 zzso controls were zzso The zzso patients were consecutive samples from our hypertension zzso It was required that they had had a previous history of zzso blood pressure higher than 160 zzso or zzso higher than 95 zzso Secondary hypertension was excluded by clinical presentation or appropriate laboratory zzso zzso subjects were patients visiting our zzso clinics without evidence or a history of zzso It was required that they had zzso blood pressures less than 160 zzso and zzso blood pressures less than 90 zzso and that they were aged above 60 zzso 

zzso DNA from each subject was zzso from whole blood and was used as the template for zzso chain reaction amplification of the zzso portion of the zzso sodium channel zzso zzso DNA segments were screened for genetic zzso by direct zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso sodium channel zzso 

No significant genetic zzso was detected in any of the zzso and zzso subjects, except for a zzso found in three subjects zzso zzso and one zzso 

zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso sodium channel zzso were not identified in an zzso cohort of patients with essential hypertension from the Japanese zzso
