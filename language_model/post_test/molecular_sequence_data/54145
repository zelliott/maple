The plant zzso zzso protein functions as an zzso zzso to zzso a target protein for its degradation or zzso zzso Here, we report functional roles for zzso which encodes a zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso expressed zzso protein has zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso in zzso caused severe growth zzso and a zzso zzso zzso seeds did not produce primary roots, and their shoot development was significantly zzso zzso plants expressing the zzso zzso transcript zzso these zzso zzso The abnormal zzso were partially rescued by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso seeds in the dark also recovered the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and oxidized proteins were higher in the zzso zzso compared with the wild zzso zzso transcript levels were increased upon zzso salt and drought zzso plants zzso the gene grew better than the wild type under high zzso These results indicate that zzso is a regulator that reduces zzso oxygen species zzso stress and cell zzso
