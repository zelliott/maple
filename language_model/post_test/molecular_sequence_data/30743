Genome segment 2 of zzso virus zzso 1 from South zzso zzso was zzso from a preparation of all ten zzso zzso This zzso was used as a template to make a full-length DNA copy of segment 2, which was then cloned into zzso The zzso insert was transferred into a bacterial expression zzso zzso zzso and, by means of in zzso zzso and translation systems, used to zzso a zzso of similar size to zzso (as analyzed by zzso The zzso insert was also transferred into a zzso virus zzso using zzso zzso The resulting zzso virus when zzso into zzso cells produced a protein that zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso by in zzso and in zzso techniques, using zzso zzso confirmed that they were virus zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso demonstrated that zzso segment 2 is zzso base pairs in zzso The positive sense zzso zzso zzso strand contains an open reading frame, coding for a zzso of 961 zzso zzso which is flanked by 3' and zzso terminal zzso regions of 37 and 17 zzso zzso zzso with published data shows that zzso segment 2 of zzso is identical in these characteristics to segment 2 of zzso from Australia zzso but differs from zzso of the five American zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, there is a higher level of zzso in both the zzso and the zzso acid sequence of zzso segment 2 and protein zzso respectively, between the two zzso of zzso and the American isolate of zzso than there is between zzso and the other American zzso The significance of this similarity is zzso
