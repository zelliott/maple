Blood zzso factor zzso is a vitamin K dependent zzso which in its activated form, factor zzso zzso in the zzso process by zzso factor X and/or factor IX in the presence of zzso and tissue zzso Three types of potential zzso modifications exist in the human factor zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso located zzso acid zzso 1 zzso zzso acid zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso acid sequence and zzso modifications of zzso factor zzso as zzso from the culture medium of a zzso baby zzso kidney cell line have been compared to human plasma factor zzso By use of zzso zzso acid analysis, zzso zzso and automated zzso zzso the protein backbone of zzso factor zzso was found to be identical with human factor zzso Neither zzso factor zzso nor human plasma factor zzso was found to contain zzso zzso In human plasma factor zzso the 10 zzso located zzso acid zzso were found to be fully zzso whereas 9 full and 1 partial zzso zzso were found in the corresponding positions of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso 145 and zzso were found to be fully zzso in human plasma factor zzso In the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso was fully zzso whereas zzso zzso 145 was only partially zzso zzso zzso Besides minor differences in the zzso acid and zzso zzso the overall zzso compositions were nearly identical in zzso factor zzso and human plasma factor zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
