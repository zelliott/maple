The complete zzso sequence of plum pox virus zzso strain SK 68 was determined from a series of overlapping zzso zzso The exact zzso zzso was determined by direct zzso zzso The zzso sequence was zzso zzso in zzso excluding a 3' terminal zzso zzso The large open reading frame starts at zzso position 147 and is terminated at position zzso zzso of zzso from other plum pox virus strains with those predicted for the SK 68 strain indicated the same zzso zzso zzso of sequences leads to the following zzso zzso The genetic organization of all four zzso strains is zzso containing one large zzso gene and two zzso regions at the zzso and 3' ends; zzso zzso comparison of the zzso sequence of zzso SK 68 with other zzso strains shows zzso zzso zzso differences among strains are spread in a uniform manner upon the zzso except for the zzso zzso and two zzso regions, which are more zzso (with a zzso and zzso zzso The stability of the zzso regions is probably linked to their role in zzso The sequence variation has little effect on the zzso acid sequence of the corresponding zzso as changes occur zzso in the third position of the reading frame zzso except in the case of the zzso end of the coat protein gene zzso average difference in zzso acid level, while in the case of coat protein it is zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
