Four adjacent genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso different type I signal zzso were isolated on a zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso Three of the zzso genes constitute an zzso and the fourth is the first gene of another zzso encompassing three zzso unrelated zzso A DNA zzso containing the four zzso genes zzso an zzso coli type I signal zzso zzso when cloned in a zzso zzso zzso of four different type I signal zzso genes seems, so far, to be a unique feature of zzso
