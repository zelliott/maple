In a search for genes involved in regulation of zzso zzso we cloned a novel zzso zzso channel zzso named rat zzso from pregnant rat zzso The gene shares approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso with mouse zzso and human zzso respectively, and was expressed primarily in rat zzso The transcripts were zzso at zzso Day 22 zzso to zzso zzso a functional involvement in zzso Western zzso analysis showed that rat zzso protein was present in zzso zzso and heart, but not in any other zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that rat zzso is localized in cell membrane and could not be removed by alkaline or PBS zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso green fluorescent protein in Chinese zzso zzso cells resulted in production of characteristic zzso currents that could be activated by zzso and zzso but inhibited by zzso acid, a zzso zzso The identification and characterization of rat zzso help decipher the contribution of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
