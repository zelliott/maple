zzso zzso II zzso complexes of zzso zzso were isolated and zzso zzso The zzso complexes contained three zzso proteins of 33 zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso and showed zzso activity of around 700 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso removed not only zzso and zzso but also a part of zzso from zzso zzso indicating that zzso binds to zzso zzso more loosely than those of other zzso zzso by zzso alkaline zzso or zzso completely removed the three zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso Each of the zzso zzso proteins bound directly to zzso independent of the other zzso zzso which is similar to the binding properties of the zzso proteins in a green zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the significant features of zzso zzso is that the oxygen evolution was not enhanced by zzso When zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso the zzso activity was zzso by the addition of zzso but no further stimulation was observed by zzso zzso zzso evolution of zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso or spinach instead of that from zzso also showed no enhancement by zzso whereas a significant enhancement of oxygen evolution was observed by zzso when the green zzso or higher plant zzso was zzso with zzso zzso instead of their own zzso These results indicate that the zzso intrinsic proteins instead of the zzso zzso zzso are responsible for the stimulation of oxygen evolution by zzso zzso comparison of major zzso intrinsic proteins revealed that zzso of zzso zzso is remarkably different from other organisms in that zzso zzso possesses extra zzso zzso exposed to the zzso zzso This may be related to the loss of enhancement of oxygen evolution by zzso zzso
