Peanut zzso is a significant health problem because of the frequency, the potential severity, and the zzso of the allergic zzso zzso zzso from patients with documented peanut hypersensitivity reactions and a peanut zzso expression library were used to identify clones that zzso peanut zzso One of the major peanut zzso zzso h I, was selected from these clones using zzso h I specific zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso h I clone identified a zzso zzso species on a Northern zzso containing peanut zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the cloned zzso revealed that the zzso h I zzso has significant zzso with the zzso seed storage protein family found in most higher zzso The isolation of the zzso h I clones allowed the synthesis of this protein in zzso coli cells and subsequent recognition of this zzso protein in zzso analysis using serum zzso from patients with peanut zzso With the production of the zzso peanut protein it will now be possible to address the zzso and zzso mechanisms regarding peanut hypersensitivity reactions specifically and food hypersensitivity in general
