Australian zzso White zzso zzso is an zzso temperature dependent disease of the zzso coral zzso zzso involving a zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso This report describes significant changes in the coral associated bacterial community as the disease zzso from the apparently healthy tissue of zzso affected coral zzso to areas of the colony affected by zzso zzso to the dead coral skeleton exposed by zzso In an effort to better understand the potential roles of bacteria in the formation of disease zzso the effect of zzso on the rate of zzso progression was tested, and both culture based and culture independent techniques were used to investigate the bacterial communities associated with colonies of zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using the zzso zzso of zzso Genes zzso technique, which allowed a library of zzso cloned bacterial zzso zzso genes to be zzso Interestingly, the bacterial communities associated with both healthy and disease affected zzso were very diverse and zzso associated communities were not characterized by a single dominant zzso Treatment with zzso had a significant effect on the rate of progress of disease zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that bacteria may play direct roles as the zzso agents of zzso A number of potential zzso agents of zzso were identified in both the zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso study an zzso closely related to zzso zzso the apparent zzso agent of juvenile oyster disease, was found to be significantly associated with disease zzso In the zzso study zzso zzso was consistently associated with zzso affected coral colonies and was not isolated from any healthy zzso The differing results of the culture based and zzso studies highlight the importance of using both approaches in the investigation of microbial zzso
