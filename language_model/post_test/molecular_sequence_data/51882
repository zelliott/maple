The development of easily zzso genetic markers in zzso will facilitate the zzso of desirable traits from wild species into adapted zzso We have used random amplified zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso molecular markers in a range of wild and cultivated zzso zzso From a total of sixty zzso zzso zzso 49 zzso zzso were identified between cultivated zzso zzso type zzso and a synthetic zzso (B zzso zzso created from a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The inheritance of zzso zzso both in the zzso and in the F1 progeny in a zzso zzso (B zzso zzso zzso has also been zzso The potential exploitation of zzso markers in zzso improvement programs is zzso
