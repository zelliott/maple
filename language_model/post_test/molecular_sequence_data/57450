Several examples of the introduction of a gene from one gene complex into another zzso are found when zzso zzso gene clusters are compared to those in zzso coli or zzso Here we describe the transcript pattern of one such cluster from zzso zzso zzso that includes the genes for 4 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Twelve transcript species covering the size range from 7,000 to 800 zzso were identified in zzso isolated from zzso and zzso zzso zzso and several of them were characterized by reverse zzso zzso A major species of 6,200 zzso with its zzso end at 181 zzso upstream of the initiating zzso of zzso contained the transcripts of all the 5 zzso Two further sets of transcripts having their zzso ends zzso 120 and 50 zzso upstream of the initiation zzso of the zzso and zzso genes were also zzso Thus, this zzso gene cluster in zzso is functionally organized as an zzso with additional regulatory features to allow for increased zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso
