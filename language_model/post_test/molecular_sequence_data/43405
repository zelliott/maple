In response to low ambient temperature, zzso cells as well as zzso change various zzso functions, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations are just beginning to be zzso We report here the isolation of a mouse zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and investigation of its role in zzso response of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso an zzso protein consisting of an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain and exhibited structural similarity to a class of zzso zzso proteins found in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was localized in the zzso of zzso mouse zzso When the culture temperature was lowered from 37 to 32 degrees C, expression of zzso was induced and growth of zzso cells was impaired as compared with that at 37 degrees zzso By suppressing the induction of zzso with zzso zzso this impairment was zzso while zzso of zzso resulted in impaired growth at 37 degrees C with zzso of zzso phase of the cell zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an essential role in zzso growth suppression of mouse zzso Identification of zzso may provide a clue to the regulatory mechanisms of cold responses in zzso zzso
