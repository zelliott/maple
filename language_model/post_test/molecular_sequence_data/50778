A method is described for efficient cloning of the large zzso segment of infectious zzso disease virus zzso after reverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA segments of zzso were prepared using reverse zzso and specific zzso zzso to the zzso region at the 3' end of the zzso zzso The resulting zzso segments were amplified using zzso DNA zzso and a pair of specific zzso Three separate primer pairs were used for amplification, each yielding a zzso zzso of the predicted zzso The amplified products were directly used for cloning into a cloning zzso zzso Three overlapping zzso zzso containing the entire coding region of the large zzso segment of zzso were zzso The identity of these clones was confirmed by zzso with zzso probe, as well as by sequence zzso By this method, approximately zzso zzso of the large zzso segments of two different strains of zzso were zzso and their complete zzso sequence was zzso
