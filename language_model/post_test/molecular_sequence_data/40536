Red zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso a zzso zzso virus with a zzso zzso encodes zzso and zzso zzso proteins that are required for viral zzso replication and suppression of zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso in zzso and zzso responsible for their zzso interactions using in zzso pull-down zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in combination with zzso zzso gel zzso using zzso zzso proteins showed that both zzso and zzso interactions are essential for the formation of the zzso complex, which has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found a good correlation between the accumulated levels of the zzso complex and replication levels and the suppression of zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that interactions between zzso zzso proteins play an essential role in viral zzso replication and in suppressing zzso zzso via the zzso zzso complex zzso
