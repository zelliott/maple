zzso zzso is an important human gastric pathogen for which the entire zzso sequence is zzso This zzso displays a uniquely complex pattern of binding to complex carbohydrates presented on host zzso surfaces and other zzso through zzso molecules zzso on the microbial cell zzso zzso and other zzso proteins are important targets for vaccine zzso The identification and characterization of zzso proteins expressed by zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the development of vaccines designed to interfere with bacterial colonization of host zzso However, identification of membrane proteins is difficult using a traditional zzso approach employing zzso We have used a novel approach in the identification of microbial proteins that employs a rapid zzso two-dimensional zzso separation followed by mass zzso and database zzso No zzso of bacterial zzso was zzso The entire process, from sample preparation to protein zzso can be completed in less than 18 hours, and the presence of proteins can be monitored after both the zzso and zzso zzso using mass zzso We were able to identify 40 proteins from a zzso zzso zzso zzso over one-third of these were membrane or zzso zzso A functionally characterized zzso membrane zzso the zzso zzso was found in this zzso The use of this rapid zzso zzso separation in zzso studies of zzso zzso is expected to speed up the identification of expressed zzso proteins and vaccine targets in this and other microbial zzso
