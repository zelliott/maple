zzso zzso zzso has been used to investigate the oriented liquid crystal phase of the hydrated zzso zzso Previous investigations have shown that the zzso axis is aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, while at reduced temperatures motion about the zzso axis is zzso zzso zzso samples incorporating different labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso permitted investigation of both the base and sugar zzso and ordering in the aligned zzso From zzso analysis of the zzso samples the orientation of the base zzso zzso bond with respect to the zzso axis was determined to be zzso zzso 90 degrees with a distribution of zzso total zzso 20 degrees, which is comparable to the orientation of zzso zzso 90 degrees, zzso total zzso 15 degrees, with an oriented fraction P zzso zzso found for the zzso symmetry axis of the zzso zzso The orientation of the sugar zzso zzso bond with respect to the zzso axis is zzso zzso 22 degrees with a distribution of zzso total zzso 15 degrees in agreement with the expected zzso sugar zzso The fraction of zzso was also investigated and from analysis of line shape cannot exceed zzso These results, though preliminary in nature, illustrate the application of this aligned phase for structural zzso
