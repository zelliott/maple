zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso that are believed to participate in signal zzso In zzso five different zzso have so far been identified, of which three, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed while the other two, zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a restricted tissue zzso We have identified two new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The human and mouse zzso acid sequences of these new zzso are the most divergent of the zzso zzso zzso They possess most of the zzso zzso in zzso family members but the zzso region lacks any zzso to the zzso domain of other zzso zzso They both exhibit significant zzso over the entire coding region to the protein zzso by the gene zzso involved in zzso sex determination, and zzso may represent its zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein lacks critical active site zzso and may not be zzso zzso Both genes are zzso expressed in human zzso with highest zzso levels for zzso occurring in the zzso liver, zzso zzso and zzso while zzso is highly expressed only in the zzso sample of the 50 zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso zzso arose through a series of gene zzso events that began before the initial divergence of the zzso and zzso zzso The discovery of these two new zzso highlights a zzso unknown complexity of the zzso family with zzso perhaps possessing different modes of zzso
