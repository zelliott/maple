Recent experiments using zzso typing have demonstrated that, in several regions of the human zzso zzso does not occur zzso but instead is concentrated in zzso of 1-2 zzso Moreover, the crossover asymmetry observed in a subset of these has led to the suggestion that hotspots may be short-lived on an evolutionary time zzso To test this possibility, we focused on a region known to contain a zzso hotspot in humans, zzso and asked whether zzso the closest living evolutionary relatives of humans, harbor a hotspot in a similar zzso Specifically, we used a new statistical approach to estimate zzso rate variation from patterns of linkage zzso in a sample of 24 western chimpanzees zzso zzso zzso This method has been shown to produce reliable results on simulated data and on human data from the zzso zzso zzso however, it finds very little support for zzso rate variation at zzso in the western zzso zzso Moreover, simulations suggest that there should be stronger support if there were a hotspot similar to the one characterized in zzso Thus, it appears that the human zzso zzso hotspot is not shared by western zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso rates can change between very closely related species and raise the possibility that rates differ among human zzso with important implications for zzso based association zzso
