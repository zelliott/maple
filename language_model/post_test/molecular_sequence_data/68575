Cystic zzso zzso patients bearing the premature translation termination zzso zzso zzso zzso present severe pulmonary and pancreatic disease, whereas patients carrying other nonsense zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show a severe pancreatic but mild pulmonary zzso zzso gene expression was found absent in respiratory zzso with zzso zzso and zzso which led to the hypothesis that the absence of the gene product in the lung is more favorable than the presence of an altered zzso We asked whether or not all the nonsense zzso characterized by mild pulmonary disease zzso do present the absence of zzso gene zzso We therefore investigated gene expression at the zzso level in respiratory cells obtained from zzso zzso from a patient zzso for the zzso zzso Gene expression was studied by amplification with zzso chain reaction of segments of the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso that was obtained by reverse zzso of zzso zzso analysis was performed by Northern zzso By comparing the data obtained from zzso zzso from zzso subjects and a zzso patient zzso for zzso zzso it is shown that no reduction of zzso gene expression is evident in zzso respiratory zzso We conclude that zzso nonsense zzso have zzso mechanisms of gene zzso
