zzso 1 of the zzso closed state of the zzso E1 channel domain was studied by zzso zzso labeling where zzso was zzso attached to a single zzso zzso in each zzso zzso A number of zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso were measured in the zzso state of the channel domain, including zzso zzso zzso zzso quantum yield, zzso zzso membrane zzso penetration depth, surface accessibility, and apparent zzso The data show that zzso 1 is an zzso zzso that is situated parallel to the membrane zzso A least squares fit of the various data sets to a harmonic function indicated that the zzso and angular frequency for zzso 1 are typical for an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per turn and 97 zzso zzso degrees, zzso that is partially bathing into the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed that zzso 1 is peripherally zzso with one face of the zzso dipping into the zzso zzso and the other face projecting toward the zzso Finally, our data suggest that the zzso boundaries of zzso 1, at least at the zzso region, remain unaffected upon binding to the surface of the membrane in support of a zzso pore model for this zzso
