zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with high zzso zzso zzso and a practical turnover zzso zzso zzso zzso allowing for zzso scale zzso This zzso represents one of the rare examples of zzso zzso promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed as a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso zzso as zzso form and of its close analog zzso in complex with the transition state analog were determined at zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso experiments was carried out to probe the role of individual zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer to carbon is zzso by a hydrogen bond network formed by the side chains of zzso and zzso with a water zzso serving as a zzso The intermediate zzso zzso formed during the zzso step is trapped by the same water zzso resulting in an overall zzso of water to the zzso zzso double zzso The zzso is caused by zzso crowding at the active site, mainly because of the side chain of zzso The zzso lower activity of zzso compared with zzso was traced down to zzso zzso which forms a zzso hydrogen bond with the zzso zzso zzso which competes with the critical zzso hydrogen bond and therefore reduces zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was restored to that of zzso by using either zzso zzso zzso or chain zzso
