Past evidence has indicated that zzso zzso as isolated from soil and as an occasional opportunistic zzso exists as a zzso We now demonstrate that the basis of zzso and diversity is a novel series of zzso zzso zzso zzso The structures from two strains were established by zzso partial acid zzso infrared and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fast atom zzso zzso of the native zzso and zzso zzso The structure of the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso was defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was further zzso at zzso of the terminal zzso by an incompletely defined zzso zzso of zzso The structure of the major zzso zzso of a second strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The other minor zzso from both strains were also zzso Both families of zzso from the two strains contain a novel zzso unit, representing the first example of such a unit among the zzso isolated to date from zzso Also, the more polar zzso products, zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso are characterized by branching of the zzso zzso the first instance of sugar branching in these zzso In the case of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso the branch consists of a terminal zzso unit, whereas in zzso and zzso they are zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
