The zzso of activated zzso to zzso zzso zzso seems to be zzso by zzso on zzso and its zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso However, neither treatment of zzso with an zzso zzso or zzso nor treatment of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso are able to inhibit completely the zzso zzso we have studied the zzso zzso complex zzso for its involvement in the zzso of activated zzso to zzso The following zzso point to a participation of zzso in the zzso of activated zzso to zzso a) zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso raised toward zzso b) zzso of zzso by peptides such as zzso and zzso c) zzso of zzso by zzso of the zzso complex with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso formation using zzso from a zzso patient which have almost no zzso in the surface membrane but a normal expression of zzso It is likely that zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso to zzso via zzso since zzso increases the zzso formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, the incubation of zzso zzso with zzso and an zzso raised against zzso zzso which stimulates zzso binding to the zzso surface results in an enlarged zzso zzso
