A zzso zzso belonging to the high mobility group family of proteins was zzso from the zzso zzso zzso on the basis of its association with a DNA zzso zzso zzso acid sequence alignment suggests that this zzso zzso is related to the zzso class of zzso zzso zzso with this zzso the zzso protein zzso to the nucleus, binds zzso DNA, and zzso DNA in the presence of zzso DNA zzso zzso While the zzso protein has no DNA zzso activity on its own, zzso experiments confirm that zzso associates with a zzso to 3' DNA zzso activity in nuclear zzso The in zzso role of the protein was investigated by constructing an zzso deletion zzso This strain has a severe growth zzso reduced zzso stability, and zzso that is hypersensitive to zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the data indicate that zzso is likely to be the zzso of zzso in higher cells and that it plays an important role in zzso zzso
