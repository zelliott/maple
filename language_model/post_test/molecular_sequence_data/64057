The zzso alternative zzso factor zzso has been described in members of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In these bacteria, zzso appears to play an important role in zzso rapid adaptation to and survival in stressful zzso zzso activity is regulated through a complex system of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We describe the zzso zzso structure for the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso and apply this sequence as well as other previously described zzso zzso sequences to probe the evolution and functional conservation of the zzso stress response system among different zzso zzso While zzso as well as two zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso average zzso acid zzso zzso respectively), the predicted zzso sequences of the other zzso proteins showed less conservation zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso structure varies among bacterial zzso zzso species differ in the numbers and identities of zzso genes zzso in their zzso We thus conclude that the zzso zzso system as represented by the zzso zzso has zzso in both its overall components as well as in the sequences of its individual zzso even among closely related bacterial zzso zzso evolution of this stress response system among various zzso may represent a strategy that enables bacteria to adapt cellular response and survival systems to a variety of stress zzso
