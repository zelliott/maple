zzso is a zzso motor protein that can move for several zzso along a zzso without zzso The two zzso motor zzso are thought to move zzso by operating in a zzso manner, although the mechanism of such zzso is zzso Recently, a approximately zzso acid region adjacent to the zzso motor domain zzso the zzso has been shown to be sufficient for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based upon its zzso acid zzso the neck is proposed to zzso through a zzso zzso To determine the accuracy of this prediction and to investigate the possible function of the neck region in motor activity, we have prepared a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the human zzso neck zzso zzso and analyzed each zzso for its respective secondary structure content and zzso zzso of our study show that a zzso containing zzso zzso displays all of the characteristics of a stable, zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso segment of the neck zzso approximately zzso has the capacity to adopt a zzso secondary zzso The zzso zzso of the neck region zzso zzso are not zzso nor do they contribute significantly to the overall stability of the zzso suggesting that these zzso mark the beginning of a hinge located between the neck and the extended zzso coiled zzso stalk zzso Interestingly, the two central zzso of the zzso segment in the neck contain zzso zzso zzso located within the zzso core, which we show destabilize the zzso zzso These zzso may enable a portion of the zzso to unwind during the zzso cycle, and we present a model in which such a phenomenon plays an important role in zzso zzso
