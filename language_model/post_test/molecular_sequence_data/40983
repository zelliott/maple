There are questions regarding the prevalence of zzso zzso leukemia zzso virus zzso in patients with prostate cancer and its association with the zzso zzso zzso We therefore investigated whether zzso infection could be found in patients with prostate cancer from the southern United States, and we sought to verify the association with the zzso 

zzso tissue specimens of 144 patients with prostate cancer from the southern United States were zzso for zzso by real time zzso chain reaction zzso discrimination and were screened for zzso zzso DNA by zzso zzso chain reaction specific for the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was found at an zzso frequency of zzso zzso was detected in 32 zzso of the 144 zzso Patients were significantly more likely to test positive for zzso in both tumor and normal tissue rather than either alone zzso zzso zzso A positive result for zzso was not significantly correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or clinical pathological parameters of prostate cancer, including zzso score zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is zzso in normal and tumor prostate tissue from patients with prostate cancer, independent of zzso The presence of zzso in normal tissue suggests that infection may zzso cancer zzso
