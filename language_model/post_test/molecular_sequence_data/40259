To enhance the heat stability of the zzso protein from zzso coli zzso so that it has comparable stability to zzso from zzso zzso with a zzso temperature zzso of zzso we used the zzso Profile of zzso zzso zzso to examine the zzso zzso zzso between the zzso of zzso and its native sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified seven zzso in zzso that were incompatible in terms of zzso angles and zzso These zzso were replaced with appropriate zzso zzso and the zzso proteins were evaluated for changes in stability by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso that were introduced at five out of the seven positions improved the stability of zzso The zzso values of single zzso and triple zzso zzso improved by zzso and zzso respectively, compared to that of the zzso protein zzso These analyses showed that zzso the stability of zzso is remarkably improved by slight zzso even though the stability of the zzso protein is considerably high, zzso remarkable improvements in the stability can be zzso explained based on the newly solved native structure, and zzso zzso is a powerful tool to examine zzso that improve protein zzso
