Gene products present in mouse zzso direct development until the zzso stage and may be important in later zzso Here, we demonstrate that expression of a specific maternal protein can be disrupted in mouse zzso using transgenic zzso zzso zzso An zzso promoter zzso was zzso to express zzso zzso directed against maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression results in reduced levels of zzso zzso and zzso activity in mouse zzso We also provide evidence for a novel mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of maternal zzso zzso is zzso This strategy should prove zzso to functional studies of other zzso maternal zzso in an in zzso zzso
