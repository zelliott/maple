The zzso of a zzso complex bridging two zzso zzso could act as a mechanical couple to do work on the zzso zzso resulting in zzso To test this, we prepared a series of modified zzso proteins and determined their effects on zzso membrane zzso When two zzso zzso zzso are introduced into the zzso region of zzso there is little or no effect on fusion, and the same change in zzso zzso only reduced the extent and rate of fusion by zzso The zzso of a flexible zzso between the zzso domain and the zzso zzso domain only moderately affected zzso however, fusion efficiency systematically decreased with increasing length of the zzso Together, these results rule out a requirement for zzso continuity and suggest that distance is a critical factor for membrane zzso
