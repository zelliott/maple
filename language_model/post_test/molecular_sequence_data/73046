A mouse zzso zzso a novel member of the von zzso factor type zzso module zzso was zzso The protein precursor of 956 zzso acids consists of a putative signal zzso two von zzso factor type zzso zzso connected by 10 zzso growth zzso zzso a potential zzso domain, and a unique segment, and it contains potential zzso zzso A sequence similarity search indicated the closest relation to the zzso cartilage zzso protein zzso Since they constitute a novel protein family, we introduce the term zzso for the new zzso reserving zzso as an alternative name for zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in a variety of mouse zzso including zzso zzso heart, and brain, as well as zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso human and rat zzso sequence tags indicate a high degree of zzso zzso A group of zzso bands was, after reduction, recognized specifically with an zzso against the zzso zzso fusion protein in media of the zzso cell zzso Assuming zzso this agrees well with the predicted minimum Mr of the mature protein zzso zzso of zzso in developing skeletal elements showed zzso in the zzso and the zzso layer of zzso zzso zzso binds both collagen zzso and zzso and because of the similar structure and complementary expression pattern, zzso is likely to perform similar functions in the zzso zzso assembly of other zzso
