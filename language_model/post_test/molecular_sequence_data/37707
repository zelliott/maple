Despite the recent zzso cloning of the zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso in the great majority of patients with zzso zzso kidney disease zzso the zzso mechanism for zzso formation is still zzso The finding, that the zzso and zzso proteins interact with each other through their zzso zzso suggests that both proteins are part of the same protein complex or signal zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen with the zzso zzso we isolated the zzso protein zzso The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by the fact that zzso a protein closely related to zzso failed to interact with zzso zzso experiments showed that in most cells zzso and zzso zzso in the cell body, but in some cells zzso and zzso also were sorted into cellular processes and zzso zzso we demonstrated an association between zzso and the zzso protein zzso which suggests a link between zzso and the zzso zzso We speculate that zzso is involved in the formation of zzso zzso which are dysfunctional without a zzso zzso zzso thus leading to zzso enlargement of zzso structures in the zzso liver, and zzso
