The zzso domain of abnormal zzso zzso protein zzso is identified as a member of a novel family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are present in proteins associated with zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso complex, and in zzso and zzso whose deficiencies are associated with zzso and zzso zzso syndrome, zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso thus represent good candidates for primary zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to function in zzso and to be a major zzso of cerebral cortical size in zzso Support for this hypothesis stems from associations between zzso in zzso and primary zzso and from the rapid evolution of zzso during recent zzso zzso The identification of the zzso domain family instead indicates possible roles for zzso in zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso zzso rapid evolution may thus reflect selective pressures on zzso function, rather than pressures on zzso during zzso
