Human zzso zzso zzso functions as a powerful zzso zzso capable of attacking a broad range of zzso To examine the cellular zzso of zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso complementary to the coding region of the zzso gene was cloned from the cell line zzso using an zzso based on the known zzso protein zzso The sequence of zzso demonstrated that it coded for the 173 zzso zzso of the 218 zzso acids that comprise the mature zzso zzso plus an additional 3' 60 base pairs prior to the zzso stop zzso suggesting the zzso zzso contains sequences for a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is not found in the mature zzso Northern analysis using zzso zzso as a probe revealed that zzso do not contain zzso zzso zzso transcripts despite the fact that this cell carries large amounts of this zzso Furthermore, resting and activated blood zzso also contained no zzso zzso zzso zzso although these cells also carry zzso zzso In contrast, bone zzso precursor cells contained zzso zzso suggesting the zzso gene is expressed in blood precursor zzso In this regard, evaluation of zzso cells, a human cell line with zzso lineage features, demonstrated zzso transcripts in resting cells and increased zzso zzso levels when the cells were induced toward the zzso lineage with zzso zzso However, when the zzso cells were induced toward the zzso lineage with zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were lost even though transcripts for zzso beta were zzso Together, these observations are consistent with the concept that the zzso gene is not expressed in the blood cells that carry the zzso but in bone zzso precursors that express zzso transcripts about the time of commitment to the zzso zzso
