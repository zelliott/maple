zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce targeted zzso modifications with high efficiency in cell types including zzso zzso zzso plants, and zzso A bottleneck in the application of zzso technology has been the generation of highly specific engineered zzso zzso Here we describe OPEN zzso zzso zzso a zzso publicly available strategy for constructing zzso zzso which we show is more effective than the previously published modular assembly zzso We used OPEN to construct 37 highly active zzso pairs which induced targeted zzso with high efficiencies zzso at 11 different target sites located within three zzso human genes zzso zzso and zzso an zzso plant gene zzso zzso and a zzso integrated zzso reporter zzso In zzso OPEN provides an zzso method for rapidly engineering highly active zzso zzso thereby enabling broader practice, development, and application of zzso technology for biological research and gene zzso
