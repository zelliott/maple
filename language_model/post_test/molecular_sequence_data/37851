The expression of the zzso transcribed zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are responsible for zzso acid zzso degradation in zzso coli, is driven by the zzso and Pa zzso zzso To study the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic and zzso approaches were zzso zzso zzso zzso showing that the zzso regulator binds specifically to the Pa and zzso promoters were zzso with in zzso experiments that indicated a zzso repression effect on the expression of zzso and zzso reporter zzso The region within the Pa and zzso promoters that is protected by the zzso zzso in zzso I zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso pair imperfect zzso sequence motif that was zzso through zzso analysis, to be indispensable for zzso binding and zzso zzso A zzso but not zzso specifically inhibited binding of zzso to the target zzso thus confirming the first intermediate of the zzso as the true zzso and zzso as the only bacterial regulatory protein described so far that responds to an zzso zzso zzso in the specific zzso regulation is zzso zzso by the zzso zzso protein and the integration host factor zzso These global regulators may adjust the zzso output from Pa and zzso promoters to the overall growth status of the zzso
