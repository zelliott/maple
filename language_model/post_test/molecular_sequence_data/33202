zzso hormone zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso physiology of birds and zzso by zzso zzso zzso from the anterior zzso zzso zzso can also directly inhibit zzso behaviors, possibly via action within the zzso Identification of the distribution of zzso zzso and fibers may provide us with clues to how the brain controls zzso activities of the zzso Here, we characterized the location and connectivity of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined the zzso zzso precursor zzso and further identified a mature zzso zzso zzso by mass zzso combined with zzso zzso The majority of zzso precursor zzso and zzso zzso cell bodies were localized in the intermediate zzso nucleus zzso in the zzso as determined by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fibers were observed in the nucleus of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus of the thalamus, zzso area, zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso nucleus of zzso median zzso and zzso zzso area in the zzso zzso region of the superior zzso central gray substance of the zzso and zzso zzso nucleus in the zzso and zzso nucleus in the zzso zzso fibers were observed in close proximity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso area, zzso zzso nucleus of zzso and central gray substance of zzso zzso zzso zzso might thus regulate several neural systems in addition to zzso zzso zzso
