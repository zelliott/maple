zzso proteins have been implicated in the zzso zzso of zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane of zzso The role of the target zzso zzso or its zzso in this process was investigated by screening a mouse zzso zzso library with rat zzso and human zzso zzso zzso Both positive clones isolated zzso a protein with zzso sequence identity to human zzso and which was therefore designated mouse zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso is located predominantly in the plasma membrane of zzso zzso incubated in the absence or presence of zzso Of zzso 1 to 5, zzso bound with the highest affinity to zzso 1 and 4 in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 4, and the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cells revealed that zzso reduced the amount of zzso bound to zzso 4 in a zzso zzso These results suggest that the binding of zzso to zzso 4 is inhibited by zzso in zzso
