zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are regarded as key regulators of zzso zzso zzso transcription, but the critical structural features of their zzso zzso remain ill zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are characterized by the presence of a highly zzso putative plant zzso zzso zzso type zinc finger, which is part of the functionally zzso zzso region 2 zzso Here we show that this region zzso to the zzso type zinc finger consensus and that it is essential for in zzso zzso of core zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso as well as for zzso zzso zzso finger zzso also reduced the zzso activity of the full-length zzso protein when tested on zzso reporter zzso zzso similar results were obtained on integrated reporters, which reflect a more natural zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso finger forms an integral part of the zzso core of the zzso domain of zzso
