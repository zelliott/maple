zzso bacteria are surrounded by two zzso In these bacteria, a class of high affinity transport systems for concentrating zzso from the medium into the cell, involves a binding protein located between the outer and inner zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso are thought to bind the zzso in the vicinity of the inner zzso and to transfer it to a complex of inner membrane proteins for concentration into the zzso We report evidence leading us to propose that a zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, and a mycoplasma, zzso zzso which are surrounded by a single membrane and have therefore no zzso region, possess an equivalent to the high affinity zzso zzso dependent transport systems, zzso zzso binding zzso dependent transport zzso The zzso zzso would be maintained at proximity of the inner membrane by zzso of their zzso zzso into this zzso
