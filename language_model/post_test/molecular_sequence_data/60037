zzso purple acid zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso the cells that zzso zzso The zzso is a target for drug design because there is strong evidence that it is involved in bone zzso 

The zzso A resolution structure of pig purple acid zzso has been solved by multiple zzso zzso The zzso comprises two sandwiched beta sheets flanked by zzso zzso The zzso shows internal zzso with the metal zzso bound at the interface between the two zzso 

Despite less than zzso sequence identity, the protein fold resembles that of the zzso domain of plant purple acid zzso and some zzso protein zzso The zzso regions of the zzso and plant purple acid zzso differ significantly, zzso The internal symmetry suggests that the zzso zzso evolved as a result of the combination of zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso provides a basis for zzso drug zzso
