zzso form a large zzso family of small proteins zzso zzso first discovered in zzso More recently, several types of bacterial zzso have been reported, among which zzso from zzso coli is an outer membrane zzso As part of our structural zzso effort on proteins from zzso coli, we have zzso zzso and solved the structure of zzso at zzso A resolution using remote zzso with zzso The structure of zzso the first of a bacterial zzso exhibits a classical fold formed by a zzso and a zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso binding zzso Its empty and open zzso however, is too narrow to accommodate zzso while the zzso chains of two fatty acids or of a zzso could be readily modeled inside the zzso zzso was reported to be expressed under stress conditions such as zzso or high zzso during which the cell envelope suffers and requires zzso These data, together with our structural zzso suggest a role for zzso in storage or transport of lipids necessary for membrane repair or zzso
