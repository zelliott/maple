zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso shrimp and is the type species zzso in the zzso the only zzso zzso known zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso using zzso full-length and truncated proteins were employed to examine the zzso acid binding properties of the zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso The zzso showed full-length N protein to bind to all synthetic zzso zzso tested independent of their zzso The zzso included zzso and zzso sense regions of the zzso zzso as well as a zzso sense region of the M zzso segment of zzso virus, a zzso zzso zzso zzso N protein also bound to zzso zzso prepared to zzso zzso gene regions and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the five N protein zzso with zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso localized the zzso binding domain to a 50 zzso acid zzso zzso sequence spanning zzso to zzso zzso to other zzso binding zzso the first 16 zzso portion of this sequence was zzso zzso To examine this domain in more detail, the 18 zzso zzso zzso encompassing this sequence was zzso and found to bind zzso acids similarly to the full-length N protein in zzso The data indicate a fundamental role for the zzso N protein zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso to form zzso Moreover, as the synthetic zzso formed zzso complexes in the presence of zzso the domain might also play some role in zzso interactions stabilizing the zzso structure of zzso zzso
