zzso possess zzso which are cells specifically differentiated to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has lost many of the genes that appear to be essential for bacterial zzso From the zzso of the pea zzso zzso zzso we previously identified two clusters of expressed sequence tags that display similarity only to bacterial zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that they are zzso in the zzso zzso In this study, in order to assess the possibility of lateral gene transfer, we determined the full-length sequences of these zzso and performed detailed structural and zzso zzso We further examined their expression levels in the zzso using real-time quantitative zzso 

zzso similarity searches demonstrated that these fully zzso transcripts are significantly similar to the bacterial genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rare zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks these zzso whereas many other bacteria, including zzso coli, a close relative of zzso possess both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis clearly demonstrated that the zzso zzso was derived from a zzso zzso closely related to the extant zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso zzso of various lineages of zzso The evolutionary origin of zzso was not fully zzso but it was clearly demonstrated that its zzso zzso domain is of bacterial zzso zzso quantitative zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso are expressed zzso and zzso higher in the zzso than in the whole body, zzso zzso is an zzso required for recycling zzso zzso which is a component of the bacterial cell zzso As zzso possesses a cell wall composed of zzso but lacks zzso a high level of expression of the zzso zzso in the zzso may be essential to maintain zzso Although the function of zzso is not well known, conspicuous zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso implies that this gene is also essential for zzso 

In this study, we obtained several lines of evidence indicating that zzso acquired genes from bacteria via lateral gene transfer and that these genes are used to maintain the zzso zzso zzso zzso
