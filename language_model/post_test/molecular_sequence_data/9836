zzso currents zzso and zzso zzso concentration zzso were measured in isolated gastric zzso from zzso zzso using whole cell zzso clamp and zzso 2, zzso After a conditioning train of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potential of zzso zzso was increased, returning to control values after approximately 85 zzso This enhancement was zzso dependent, with a zzso increase at approximately 600 zzso zzso During the conditioning train, zzso measured at 70 zzso which provides a measure of zzso zzso initially decreased with each successive pulse to a minimum of 56 zzso zzso of the first pulse in the zzso zzso the zzso current showed considerable zzso zzso of zzso activity with a zzso zzso or zzso did not affect the early zzso but did abolish current zzso A zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso II zzso had similar zzso zzso of currents measured in the presence and absence of zzso revealed a zzso delay between the start of the train and the onset of current zzso It was also observed that zzso current zzso potential of zzso zzso was reduced to 76 zzso zzso of control 5 s after the conditioning zzso this zzso recovered to 92 zzso zzso after 35 s and was not dependent on zzso zzso
