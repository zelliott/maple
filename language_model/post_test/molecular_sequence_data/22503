The von zzso zzso tumor zzso protein is the zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene cause a variety of tumors with complex zzso zzso Type 2A and type zzso zzso disease are characterized by a low or high risk of zzso cell zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis underlying the difference between disease types 2A and zzso we performed a detailed zzso analysis of the two most frequent type 2A zzso zzso H and zzso zzso in comparison to type zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso and zzso While none of these zzso affected the assembly of zzso complexes, the type 2A zzso proteins exhibited higher zzso at zzso zzso Moreover, the type 2A zzso proteins possessed higher binding affinities for the key cellular zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso with these results, type 2A but not type zzso zzso zzso proteins retained significant zzso zzso activity towards zzso in zzso We propose that this residual zzso zzso activity is sufficient to suppress zzso cell zzso in zzso
