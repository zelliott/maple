zzso zzso of emerging viruses are of zzso origin, with three-fourths derived from wild zzso Many of these zzso diseases are transmitted by zzso with important information about their zzso dynamics and zzso zzso One main reason for the gap in our knowledge is the lack of adequate cell culture systems as models for the investigation of zzso zzso viruses in zzso Therefore we established and characterized a new cell line, zzso using the kidney of a bank zzso zzso zzso the most abundant member of the zzso trapped in zzso 

zzso proved to be of zzso zzso expressing tight junctions as well as adherence junction zzso The zzso cells were analyzed for their zzso by several zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso and zzso disease virus zzso The cell line was susceptible for all tested zzso and most interestingly also for the difficult to zzso zzso 

In conclusion, the newly established cell line from wildlife zzso seems to be an excellent tool for the isolation and characterization of new zzso viruses and may be used as in zzso to study properties and zzso of these zzso
