The type II zzso zzso system zzso isolated from zzso zzso contains two zzso arranged zzso zzso and zzso zzso a restriction zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, two zzso recognition sites are present in the zzso promoter region, suggesting that they may influence the activity of the promoter through zzso zzso In this study, separate promoters for zzso and zzso were identified, and the regulation of the two genes at the zzso level was zzso DNA fragments containing the putative promoters were cloned in a promoter probe zzso and tested for activity in the presence and absence of the active zzso The level of expression of the zzso was zzso to zzso higher than the level of expression of the zzso The results also showed that the presence of zzso reduced the in zzso expression of the zzso promoter zzso up to zzso whereas the activity of the zzso promoter zzso was not zzso Based on zzso zzso it was shown that both of the zzso recognition sites within zzso are required to obtain complete repression of zzso zzso No regulation was found for zzso which appears to be zzso zzso
