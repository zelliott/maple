The protein called zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is an essential regulator of cell division in zzso and budding zzso where its deletion causes zzso zzso Its role in cell cycle control appears to be zzso through the zzso of protein zzso type 1 zzso in zzso zzso We have identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso which we designated zzso as it belongs to the zzso repeat protein zzso We showed by zzso pull-down zzso that the zzso gene product interacts with zzso that the zzso complex is present in zzso extracts and that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso zzso and overcame the zzso cell cycle checkpoint by promoting progression to zzso zzso breakdown zzso zzso results showing the appearance of zzso were observed when zzso were treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that zzso can regulate the cell cycle by binding to zzso and regulating its zzso
