The zzso zzso the A4 zzso found in the zzso core of senile plaques isolated from the cerebral zzso of patients with Alzheimer's disease, produces at least three precursors that resemble cell surface zzso A clone isolated from a human brain complementary DNA library contained the structural sequence for an A4 zzso zzso precursor with a zzso zzso inhibitor domain in which 208 zzso acids at the zzso terminal are replaced by 20 zzso acids derived from zzso sequences with zzso to the zzso repeat zzso This protein devoid of the zzso domain most likely represents a zzso form of the A4 zzso zzso zzso
