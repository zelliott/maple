zzso plays the key functions in zzso zzso It is believed that zzso exerts the common zzso functions in many zzso but also performs some specific functions correspondent with zzso where it is zzso To identify the zzso zzso zzso we carried out a systematic survey towards zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso zzso such as liver, kidney and zzso The zzso proteins were separated by zzso and identified by zzso zzso Total of 87 unique proteins were identified as the zzso ones, and some representatives were further verified through zzso zzso and Western zzso Because these zzso proteins are coded from nuclear zzso real-time zzso was employed to examine the zzso status of six typical genes found in the zzso combining of the expression data and the zzso images obtained from zzso zzso we came to the conclusion that the zzso zzso proteins were widely distributed among the mouse zzso Our investigation, therefore, indeed provides a solid base to further explore the biological significance of the zzso proteins with zzso
