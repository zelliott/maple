zzso is one of two essential zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso has recently been zzso yet it lacks the zzso zzso For this zzso region of zzso 230 zzso both the structure and function are zzso In the present study, using sensitive zzso detection and comparative protein structure zzso we identified, in this enigmatic region, two consecutive zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are followed by an apparently zzso zzso zzso we found that both zzso are related to domain V of the zzso zzso which is part of the bacterial DNA zzso III zzso Despite their common zzso to zzso zzso and zzso exhibit very little sequence similarity to each zzso This observation argues against simple tandem zzso within zzso as the origin of the zzso zzso Using the derived structural models, we analyzed zzso conservation and the surface properties of both zzso zzso zzso We detected a surface patch of positive zzso potential in zzso and a zzso surface patch in zzso suggesting their possible involvement in zzso acid and protein zzso zzso zzso is known to interact with the zzso zzso however, the region responsible for this interaction is zzso We propose that the zzso zzso is involved in zzso the zzso interaction and possibly also in binding zzso
