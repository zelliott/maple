We have identified zzso a plasma membrane protein previously defined by a zzso zzso as an alkaline zzso I zzso expressed in the plasma membrane of rat zzso and zzso with a restricted zzso zzso B10 complementary DNA zzso was cloned from a rat zzso library screened with a zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso Two distinct B10 clones with an open reading frame of zzso zzso were obtained that differed only by 12 bases in the coding zzso One B10 clone had a single base difference with zzso zzso which was recently cloned in rat fetal zzso zzso had 50% identity at the zzso acid level with the plasma cell zzso zzso an zzso cloned in the mouse and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity in liver plasma zzso and over zzso of the zzso activity in zzso zzso Most of the remaining activity in zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso directed to zzso zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso was found in the zzso rat liver plasma membrane zzso on a zzso zzso whereas most of the remaining zzso activity was associated with the zzso zzso which contained zzso By zzso B10 was localized to the zzso surfaces of zzso and zzso whereas zzso was present on the zzso surfaces of zzso zzso and rat zzso are a unique example of distinct molecules having similar zzso activity but different zzso location, and possibly different zzso
