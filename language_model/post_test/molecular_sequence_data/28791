The zzso of the zzso nervous system are zzso by several zzso proteins zzso including the zzso and zzso protein zzso The most prominent feature of zzso zzso and zzso proteins is a common and highly zzso zzso region consisting of three or four imperfect tandem zzso In this paper we report the cloning and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso This protein encompasses two zzso of zzso or zzso zzso acids with four tandem repeats that are highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso Both zzso share a common zzso terminal half, whereas the zzso zzso downstream of the repeat region is unique for each zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that both zzso are zzso expressed in the tail of zzso zzso zzso whereas a shorter version of zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso proteins of both zzso zzso were able to bind zzso The longest zzso however, was more effective at promoting zzso zzso indicating that sequences downstream of the repeat region affect the zzso assembling zzso These results demonstrate that zzso proteins are found in zzso zzso species, where they may support the stability of zzso
