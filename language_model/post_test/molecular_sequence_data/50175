This paper studies the problem of discovering zzso known as zzso that are common to a given collection of related zzso by proposing a greedy zzso for learning a mixture of motifs model through likelihood zzso The approach adds zzso a new motif to a mixture model by performing a combined scheme of global and local search for appropriately zzso its zzso In addition, a zzso zzso scheme based on zzso is presented for zzso the input zzso in order to zzso the global searching zzso The proposed method compares favorably over the well-known zzso approach and treats successfully several drawbacks of zzso 

Experimental results indicate that the zzso is advantageous in identifying larger groups of motifs characteristic of biological families with significant zzso In addition, it offers better diagnostic capabilities by building more powerful statistical zzso with improved zzso zzso
