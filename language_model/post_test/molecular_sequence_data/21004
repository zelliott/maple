zzso signaling plays important roles in embryonic development, tissue zzso and zzso In both normal and zzso zzso zzso family members are often expressed zzso although the significance of this is not zzso We recently showed that zzso and zzso are both required for the initiation of embryonic axis formation and that the two proteins physically interact with each zzso However, little is known about the mechanism or biological significance of zzso protein zzso Here we show in three zzso with zzso zzso mouse L cells, and human embryonic stem cells, that zzso zzso zzso complexes have more zzso zzso signaling activity than zzso zzso or zzso acting zzso We demonstrate that the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso axis formation and that zzso of specific zzso zzso is necessary for the interaction of zzso with zzso and for enhanced zzso signaling zzso These findings demonstrate a novel aspect of zzso zzso family member interaction that depends on zzso zzso
