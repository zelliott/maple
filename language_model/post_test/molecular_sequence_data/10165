A zzso zzso of zzso DNA coding for zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso respectively, were located directly adjacent to each zzso The zzso region contained two additional zzso zzso and zzso whose products exhibited similarity to integral membrane proteins of zzso transport zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso with deduced molecular masses of 52 and 81 zzso belong to different families of zzso zzso Both zzso were zzso in zzso coli and could be detected after protein gel zzso and activity zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by fast protein liquid zzso and identified by zzso zzso The zzso was zzso at 60 degrees C for at least 24 zzso and the temperature optimum was 75 degrees zzso The zzso for zzso zzso was calculated to 200 zzso The zzso released zzso from the zzso end of zzso zzso as well as from various zzso zzso was active on zzso zzso and on zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso The zzso gene was also expressed in zzso zzso and the zzso was mainly zzso during exponential growth but was efficiently released into the zzso after cultures entered the stationary zzso
