The zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso activities towards the zzso zzso resonance energy zzso zzso series zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso is zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso and at zzso and zzso in zzso did not affect the overall folding of the two zzso as indicated by their zzso stability, CD analysis and the zzso of the intrinsic zzso of the zzso The kinetic parameters for the zzso of zzso with systematic variations at position zzso showed that zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, played a role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso contributed to the flexibility of the zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid codes zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid codes zzso in zzso contributing to the distinct zzso zzso particularly with an zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso was inhibited less efficiently by zzso zzso which suggested that the aromatic ring of zzso was an important anchor for its interaction with zzso zzso The zzso groups of zzso and zzso did not contribute to the zzso profiles, since the zzso obtained in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso However, the zzso dependence curve of zzso zzso differed from that of zzso zzso and from zzso zzso These results provide insights into the zzso involved in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and how they select zzso peptides for zzso
