The mature, functional sieve tube, which forms the zzso for zzso distribution in higher plants, is dependent upon protein import from the companion cells for maintenance of the zzso long-distance zzso zzso Using zzso raised against proteins present in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso was cloned which zzso a putative zzso termed zzso zzso and zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with some expression occurring in zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was functionally equivalent to zzso zzso zzso zzso in a live cell nuclear displacement zzso The apparent equilibrium zzso constant for zzso binding to plant zzso zzso was lower than the previously characterized zzso zzso Moreover, the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso was significantly higher than that for zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso excess to zzso The data suggest that zzso filament formation is prevented within the zzso zzso These results are discussed in terms of the unique physiology of the zzso
