The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces two zzso zzso soldiers and zzso during development within its zzso Soldier larvae defend the zzso against competitors while zzso larvae develop into adult zzso As with other zzso insects, the distinct zzso and behavioral features of soldier and zzso larvae likely involve differential gene zzso In this study we used a zzso suppression zzso zzso zzso approach to isolate zzso expressed genes from zzso zzso soldier and zzso zzso We isolated 230 novel expressed sequence tags zzso from the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso were sequences with significant similarity to genes coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, three novel genes were isolated that resemble one another in conceptual translation and share the zzso spacing pattern of short scorpion toxins and insect zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of 20 zzso from the two libraries indicated that zzso were zzso expressed in one zzso or the zzso We conclude that our zzso strategy was effective in identifying a number of genes zzso expressed in soldier and zzso larvae and that several of these genes will be useful in characterizing zzso gene networks in zzso zzso
