zzso of an optimal promoter is necessary for efficient expression of foreign genes with zzso zzso Since a variety of powerful zzso zzso virus promoters and foreign zzso promoter systems have been described for use in zzso we have addressed the question of whether a general rule exists that allows the prediction of the optimal zzso zzso We have compared the expression properties of four zzso zzso the human blood zzso factor IX zzso the human blood zzso zzso S zzso the human von zzso factor zzso and the zzso B virus zzso middle surface zzso zzso with proteins that were reported not to be zzso the zzso large surface zzso zzso and the zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso gag zzso In addition, we have included in our study an internal control zzso the zzso virus zzso zzso to monitor possible side effects of the promoter system zzso Genes zzso the foreign proteins were placed either under control of a synthetic zzso virus zzso promoter zzso or under control of the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso The zzso proteins were more efficiently expressed when fused to the zzso zzso zzso comparison of the two promoters indicated that the expression level ranged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso higher with the zzso than with the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso was more efficiently expressed under the zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso gag zzso was expressed equally well from both zzso These data indicate that a careful prediction of optimal zzso gene combinations for the zzso virus expression system is zzso The choice of the optimal zzso system is based on a simple zzso zzso discriminating zzso and zzso zzso
