To zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso color vision in zzso we have cloned and zzso the red and green zzso zzso of cat zzso zzso horse zzso zzso gray zzso zzso zzso zzso deer zzso zzso and guinea pig zzso zzso These zzso were expressed in zzso cells and zzso with zzso The zzso visual zzso of the cat, zzso zzso zzso and guinea pig have zzso values at zzso zzso zzso zzso and 516 zzso respectively, which are precise to within zzso zzso We also zzso the zzso red zzso of goldfish zzso zzso which has a zzso value at 559 zzso 4 zzso Multiple linear zzso analyses show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shift the zzso values of the red and green zzso in zzso toward blue by 7, 28, 7, 15, and 16 zzso respectively, and the reverse zzso acid changes toward red by the same zzso The additive effects of these zzso acid changes fully explain the zzso color vision in a wide range of zzso species, zzso American zzso zzso zzso and pigeon zzso zzso
