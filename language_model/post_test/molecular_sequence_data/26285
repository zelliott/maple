A number of zzso zzso acid sequences show limited zzso to short regions zzso the known active site zzso of zzso zzso c zzso Otherwise no clear zzso is visible in linear alignments between this zzso and other zzso We have subjected eight zzso sequences to zzso cluster zzso Our results suggest that these zzso are evolutionary related and that they share many folding zzso
