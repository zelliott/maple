In this study, we attenuated a Chinese zzso zzso infectious zzso virus zzso strain, zzso by serial passage in zzso chicken zzso Based on sequence analysis of the zzso region, the zzso virus population contained zzso with a mixture of genetic zzso The zzso of the virus increased gradually during serial passage, but the replication capacity decreased in zzso The virus was partially attenuated at passage 40 zzso and zzso and was fully attenuated at zzso It lost zzso and kidney zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were found in the zzso region, primarily in the spike zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso occurred between zzso and zzso and all zzso in a virus passage showed the same zzso Other zzso that occurred between zzso and zzso however, were found only in some zzso of the virus zzso A zzso deletion in the zzso was observed in most zzso of zzso and zzso and might be related to virus zzso zzso and zzso The changes described in the zzso region of the virus are possibly responsible for virus zzso zzso decrease and tissue zzso changes; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other parts of the zzso may also be involved in those zzso
