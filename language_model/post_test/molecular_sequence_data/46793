The commonly accepted statistical mechanical theory is now multiply confirmed by using the weight zzso methods successfully recognizing DNA sites binding regulatory proteins in zzso Nevertheless, the recent evaluation of weight zzso methods application for zzso factor binding site recognition in zzso has unexpectedly revealed that the zzso scores correlate better to each other than to the activity of DNA sites interacting with zzso This observation points out that molecular mechanisms of zzso recognition are more complicated in zzso than in zzso As the extra events in zzso the following processes may be zzso zzso competition between the proteins and zzso core particle for DNA sites binding these proteins and zzso interaction between two zzso proteins recognizing a composed element compiled from two DNA sites binding these zzso That is why identification of the zzso DNA features zzso with affinity zzso of DNA sites interacting with a protein can pinpoint the molecular event limiting this zzso recognition zzso 

An approach for predicting site activity based on its primary zzso sequence has been zzso The approach is realized in the computer system zzso containing the databases on site activity and on zzso and zzso zzso zzso By using the system zzso an analysis of some sites was provided and the methods for predicting site activity were zzso The methods developed are in good agreement with the experimental zzso 

The database zzso is available at zzso and the mirror site, zzso zzso
