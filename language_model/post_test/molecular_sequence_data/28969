zzso alpha is a zzso acid protein that binds to the zzso 13 zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso of this region revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso alpha zzso The zzso motif is a known binding zzso for zzso binding zzso domain zzso The sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were aligned to the available zzso structures to generate a high quality structural zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso predicted by the model to be in close proximity to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso expected to form a zzso pocket near zzso are required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso alpha is a zzso domain zzso which recognizes the zzso motif of zzso zzso Furthermore, our date suggest that an interaction between zzso and the zzso pocket created by zzso and zzso of zzso alpha forms the basis for the specificity of zzso alpha for the zzso zzso zzso
