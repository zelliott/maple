Previous studies have provided evidence that a large proportion of zzso zzso lipids is taken up from the zzso air space by type II cells, incorporated into zzso bodies, and zzso Our goal was to characterize the clearance of zzso administered zzso zzso protein C zzso and to determine if zzso is taken up by type II cells and incorporated into zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso with zzso acid and retained its ability to enhance zzso zzso to an zzso zzso A mixture of 100 zzso zzso zzso with zzso and 10 zzso zzso was instilled into the lungs of spontaneously breathing zzso adult zzso At later times, the lungs were zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso as zzso per minute per zzso zzso in zzso body zzso increased up to 4 h zzso and began to decline after approximately 4 zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso and zzso are taken up promptly from the zzso air space and are incorporated into zzso bodies with time courses that do not differ zzso
