A repeating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso sequence zzso zzso has been recently identified in the zzso variable region of zzso T zzso zzso specifically expressed in the breast but not leg muscles of the avian orders of zzso and zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, two expression plasmids were constructed to produce chicken zzso zzso fragments of 47 zzso or 165 zzso zzso acids containing the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso and zzso by a highly effective zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso sequencing, mass zzso and zzso identification confirmed the authenticity of the genetically engineered zzso zzso In the presence of zzso transition metals had significant effects on the secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso as shown by circular zzso zzso in zzso buffer demonstrated zzso content comparable to previous data from rabbit fast skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and its fragments demonstrated zzso relationships between the zzso variable region and the zzso segment of the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso established that zzso to the zzso cluster zzso zzso structure changes in this zzso segment, further affecting other zzso structures of intact zzso as well as the function of zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that metal zzso to the zzso cluster zzso the overall zzso of zzso through structural relationships between the zzso variable region and other zzso of the intact zzso zzso zzso the zzso and/or muscle type specific zzso structure of zzso zzso may zzso the zzso of muscle zzso
