We have determined the primary zzso sites in the bone zzso protein zzso zzso for several of the zzso that could act on the protein during bone zzso and zzso zzso B, D, zzso zzso and zzso The time course of zzso zzso by each zzso was first determined by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso We then incubated human and bovine zzso with each zzso for a sufficient time to reduce the level of intact protein by at least zzso isolated the major zzso zzso and identified each by zzso sequence analysis and by zzso acid zzso Our results show that zzso has relatively few zzso sites and that these sites are located at the N and C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso and S readily cleave zzso at the zzso zzso zzso L also zzso at zzso zzso B also zzso at zzso and zzso D zzso only at zzso The zzso of the major peptides generated by zzso zzso was evaluated using the original zzso developed for the detection of zzso in human zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with native zzso while the zzso and the zzso fragments require zzso to zzso higher zzso to achieve the same level of displacement as the native zzso The zzso and zzso fragments are unable to significantly zzso the labeled native zzso zzso at any concentration zzso These results demonstrate the utility of peptides generated by zzso zzso in the mapping of the zzso zzso recognized by a given zzso zzso
