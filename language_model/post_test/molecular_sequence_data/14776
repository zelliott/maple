Safety of human therapeutic zzso is generally assessed in nonhuman zzso Whereas zzso shows identical zzso interaction and zzso function profile in both species, fundamental differences in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found between the two zzso zzso the main zzso cells against zzso and zzso bacteria and zzso do not express zzso but show higher levels of zzso in zzso zzso In humans, zzso and zzso adapted a silent zzso region with weak binding to zzso and zzso functions, zzso in contrast, zzso monkey zzso and zzso display strong zzso function as well as differences in zzso zzso arm zzso To balance this shift toward zzso the zzso zzso zzso shows strongly increased affinity for zzso In view of these findings, in zzso and in zzso results for human zzso and zzso obtained in the zzso monkey have to be cautiously zzso whereas zzso zzso effects of human zzso zzso are expected to be predictable for zzso
