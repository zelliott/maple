zzso C virus zzso core protein is believed to play critical roles in the virus zzso and zzso In zzso zzso core protein zzso with a signal zzso followed by E1 envelope zzso It has remained unclear whether zzso by host cell signal zzso zzso at the zzso junction to generate the complete form of core zzso which is anchored in the zzso zzso zzso is absolutely required for zzso within the signal zzso by host cell signal zzso zzso zzso to liberate the mature form of core zzso which is then free for trafficking to zzso zzso In this study, the possible sources of disagreement in published reports have been zzso and we conclude that a product generated upon zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso junction in zzso expression systems was incorrectly identified as mature core zzso Moreover, zzso of this zzso in the most relevant model of human zzso cells replicating a full-length zzso zzso was shown to abolish interaction of core protein with zzso droplets and production of infectious progeny zzso These results firmly establish that zzso liberation of mature core protein is absolutely dependent on prior zzso by SP at the correct zzso site to generate the complete form of core zzso consistent with this obligatory order of processing playing a role in zzso infectious zzso
