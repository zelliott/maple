zzso are a major source of natural products that provide rich opportunities for both chemical and biological zzso Although the vast majority of known bacterial zzso derive from zzso organisms, increasing evidence supports the widespread existence of chemically prolific bacteria living in zzso A strategy based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enrichment, and advanced zzso was used to characterize a unique zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene cluster and the structure of zzso determined from 30 zzso of compound, are related to those of the zzso group previously known only from zzso bacteria associated with zzso and marine zzso The presence of this natural product family in such highly dissimilar associations suggests that some bacterial zzso may be specific to zzso with zzso and encourages exploration of other zzso for drug discovery and better understanding of ecological interactions zzso by complex bacterial zzso
