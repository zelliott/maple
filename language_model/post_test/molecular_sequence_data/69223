zzso molecules consisting of parts from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were expressed in zzso cells and zzso zzso One zzso in which most of the central zzso loop was derived from the zzso while the zzso segments and the minor zzso loop came from the zzso was able to zzso zzso and to be zzso from zzso with normal apparent affinity for zzso and zzso This zzso also displayed normal sensitivity to zzso but was unable to undergo the transition from zzso to zzso zzso and to transport zzso The other zzso which consisted of the zzso two-thirds of zzso and the zzso one-third of zzso was unable to zzso from zzso but zzso from zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso These results can be explained in terms of a structural model in which the zzso zzso in the central zzso domain of the zzso are without major importance for the binding and zzso of zzso but are involved in the zzso zzso changes of the zzso whereas zzso in zzso segments on both sides of the central zzso domain are involved in formation of the zzso zzso The data zzso show that zzso sensitivity is dependent on zzso in the zzso one-third of the zzso zzso
