zzso syndrome zzso giant zzso have defective and/or deficient zzso zzso zzso complexes, causing absent zzso zzso defective interaction with von zzso factor, zzso zzso and a clinical bleeding zzso Recently several zzso have been described in the zzso zzso alpha gene in individuals exhibiting the zzso zzso We have studied a family with classical zzso and have excluded zzso at the zzso alpha locus by restriction zzso length zzso linkage zzso Analysis of the genes for two other components of the zzso zzso complex, namely zzso beta and zzso showed two different zzso zzso in the coding region of the zzso zzso an zzso transition in zzso 21 results in conversion of an zzso acid to zzso and an zzso change in zzso 45 converts an zzso zzso to zzso Three affected individuals are doubly zzso for these zzso which alter zzso zzso in or zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso create new recognition sites for the zzso zzso zzso therefore, this zzso was used to screen 60 normal subjects zzso zzso Neither zzso was detected in any subject other than direct relatives of the affected zzso Although low levels of zzso were zzso by both flow zzso and zzso analysis in an affected zzso zzso there was no evidence of zzso zzso We propose that expression of abnormal zzso prevents stable assembly of the zzso complex, causing zzso in the doubly zzso individuals in this zzso
