zzso and characterization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes was conducted in German zzso isolated from different sources from 2003 to zzso 

zzso German zzso from the National zzso zzso Laboratory Collection zzso with zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso were tested for zzso inhibitor zzso presence of zzso or zzso zzso class 1 and 2 zzso other resistance zzso and zzso and zzso sequences by zzso The zzso point of the zzso was zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso genes were mapped by zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso (10 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso B zzso + , 1 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso carried zzso (15 zzso and one zzso genes located on zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Seven of the zzso zzso zzso carried the zzso zzso Six zzso (five zzso zzso and one zzso zzso carried the zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were detected in two zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso in one zzso zzso B zzso and one zzso zzso located on zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso class 2 zzso 

Among the 22 zzso German zzso zzso investigated, the zzso and zzso zzso prevalence was still zzso however, it is slowly zzso Various zzso genes are linked to a variety of genetic elements capable of horizontal DNA zzso zzso their dissemination is likely and demands adequate risk management zzso
