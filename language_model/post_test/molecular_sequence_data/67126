zzso are an important cause of epidemic disease in zzso There are at least two zzso distinct zzso capable of infecting zzso zzso for the diagnosis of zzso infections in zzso include virus isolation and a number of different zzso We have compared 11 virus zzso collected from various species in different countries over several years using sequences from three different viral zzso During this study we used four different zzso protocols described for the diagnosis of zzso infections in zzso The protocols used included two based on portions of the DNA zzso zzso one targeting the zzso zzso and one targeting the zzso zzso zzso of the methods showed that the tortoise zzso protocols were all zzso zzso zzso of the obtained zzso were compared with one another and with sequences of zzso available in zzso The sequence alignments showed that the tortoise zzso were most closely related to members of the zzso zzso They also showed that the tortoise zzso could be clearly divided into two zzso
