The zzso of the zzso part of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in its free form and bound to zzso zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso zzso The zzso is considered to be a zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cascade leading to zzso zzso Earlier studies suggested a zzso zzso mechanism that involved a zzso zzso incorporation propensity of the zzso accompanied by a zzso folding zzso In order to support this proposed zzso standard protein zzso assignment and zzso techniques have been applied to the free zzso zzso and to the zzso bound to the zzso zzso which forms a zzso in order to obtain the structural characteristics of this folding transition in a zzso zzso We could assign the zzso of the free zzso at zzso K, and this formed the basis for zzso studies to identify zzso binding zzso Our zzso results show that the free zzso zzso is indeed zzso zzso zzso around the zzso and zzso sequences are involved in a highly dynamic binding of the free zzso to a zzso zzso formed by the zzso zzso zzso
