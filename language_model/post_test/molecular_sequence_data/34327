Before the era of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the treatment of choice in chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso some zzso treated patients were able to zzso therapy without disease zzso The aim of this project was to study the zzso effects of zzso in zzso patients in prolonged zzso and isolate biological markers predicting zzso Due to rarity of patients on zzso zzso a relatively small cohort of patients still on treatment zzso zzso median therapy duration zzso zzso or had discontinued zzso therapy but remained in zzso for zzso years zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso was analyzed with a comprehensive flow zzso panel and plasma zzso levels were measured with multiplex zzso zzso In addition, the zzso status of different zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso Median zzso absolute number and proportion from zzso in blood was higher in zzso patients as compared to zzso patients or controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso The proportion of zzso zzso was significantly increased in both patient groups and a larger proportion of zzso expressed zzso Most zzso patients had significant numbers of zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the majority of patients zzso a distinct zzso zzso gene zzso was observed residing in zzso zzso zzso Similar unique zzso pattern was not observed in zzso treated zzso zzso Plasma zzso and zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso zzso Despite the limited number of patients, our data indicates that zzso treated zzso patients in zzso have increased numbers of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a unique plasma zzso zzso These factors may relate to zzso effects of zzso in this specific group of patients and account for prolonged therapy responses even after drug zzso
