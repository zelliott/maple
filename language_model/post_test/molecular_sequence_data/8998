Brain zzso are individually rare but collectively common causes of zzso zzso Many forms of zzso occur sporadically and are associated with reduced zzso zzso pointing to a zzso role for de zzso zzso Here, we report a study of zzso syndrome, a zzso disorder characterized by distinct zzso features, zzso zzso and zzso migration zzso Using zzso sequencing of three zzso zzso we identified de zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso in one and two zzso zzso zzso of both genes in 15 additional affected individuals identified zzso zzso in all zzso including two zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results confirm that zzso zzso sequencing is a powerful approach to discover genes causing sporadic zzso disorders, emphasize the overlapping roles of zzso zzso proteins in development and suggest that zzso syndrome is the zzso zzso associated with zzso of these two zzso
