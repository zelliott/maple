The human zzso resistance protein 2 zzso symbol zzso is a zzso membrane zzso of zzso zzso acids which exports zzso zzso across the zzso membrane of polarized zzso A zzso protein composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso localized to the zzso membrane of polarized zzso canine kidney cells zzso indicating involvement of the zzso part of human zzso in zzso zzso When compared to other zzso family members, zzso has a zzso extension at its zzso with the last three zzso acids zzso zzso a zzso zzso In order to analyze whether this extension is required for zzso sorting of zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso and zzso truncated at their zzso These zzso were fused via their zzso to green fluorescent protein zzso and were zzso zzso into zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that full-length zzso was localized to the zzso membrane in zzso of zzso polarized cells, whereas it remained on zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso deletion of up to 11 zzso acids did not change this zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was largely impaired when zzso was zzso truncated by 15 or more zzso zzso Thus, neither the zzso zzso motif nor the full zzso extension were necessary for zzso sorting of zzso Instead, our data indicate that a deletion of at least 15 zzso zzso acids zzso the zzso of zzso to the zzso membrane of polarized zzso
