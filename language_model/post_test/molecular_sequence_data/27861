Many plasmids from zzso bacteria replicate via a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso most probably by a zzso mechanism zzso plasmids are referred to in this paper as zzso zzso Their plus and minus origins are physically zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso it is this feature that allows zzso of zzso replication zzso The zzso of foreign DNA into an zzso zzso may provoke a high frequency of zzso changes of zzso products to zzso forms, zzso loss, and decreased zzso copy zzso When an zzso zzso is inserted into the zzso both deletions and zzso may be zzso Both the mode of replication and the copy control mechanism affect the fate of inserted foreign material, usually selecting for its zzso Thus, after having tasted various morsels of DNA, the resulting zzso stays zzso The features of the zzso plasmids seem to be beneficial for their viability and zzso but not for their use as cloning zzso However, plasmids replicating via zzso zzso are being exploited to yield insights into the mechanisms of zzso and zzso
