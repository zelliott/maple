In this study we describe a novel zzso protein zzso which shares properties with several structural zzso proteins zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso is a soluble unfolded zzso with the high net positive charge, rich in zzso It possesses two zzso repeats around the sequence zzso separated by a zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso in zzso and, fused with the green fluorescent protein zzso is an excellent marker to follow zzso dynamics in zzso In a zzso transgenic zzso strain generated by the zzso technique, zzso fusion protein zzso to the zzso network through the cell cycle at the different stages of zzso We found particularly high zzso zzso in the young zzso zzso nervous system, precursors of eye zzso and adult zzso Moreover, from zzso zzso we have established two permanent cell lines presenting strongly fluorescent zzso during the whole cell zzso In these cells, the distribution of the zzso fusion protein reproduces zzso behavior upon treatment by the drugs zzso and zzso The zzso cell lines and fly strain should be of wide interest for biologists interested in in zzso analysis of zzso zzso
