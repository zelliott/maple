The generalized model of zzso chains is extended to describe the zzso transition in a system comprised of two chains interacting zzso The zzso of the model takes into account four possible types of interactions between repeated units of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis reveals when the energy zzso of zzso zzso interactions overwhelms the energy zzso of mixed zzso zzso zzso the correlation length rises zzso resulting in narrowing of the transition zzso In the opposite case, when zzso zzso behavior of the system is predicted where an intermediate plateau appears on the zzso zzso For the latter case, calculations of the number of junctions and the average length of zzso segments indicate zzso of zzso segments at the transition zzso Conceptual links are established with zzso oriented theories of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 25, zzso zzso providing a potential explanation for both favorable zzso formation and zzso zzso interactions from the same theoretical zzso
