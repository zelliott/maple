The zzso gene encodes a zzso factor that is a member of the zzso family of zzso control zzso In addition to playing a role in zzso zzso genes appear to be of importance in a number of diverse human diseases and zzso The zzso gene maps to human zzso region zzso and therefore is a potential candidate for human disorders linked to this zzso In particular, a zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso is frequently found in zzso zzso zzso Here, we cloned a zzso containing the full coding region of the human zzso gene and determined its zzso zzso The gene encodes a predicted protein of 520 zzso acids that is 47 zzso acids longer at the zzso end than the highly related zzso zzso The coding region of the gene is interrupted by seven zzso the positions and lengths of which are similar to those of the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso data for zzso boundaries of zzso zzso 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were determined and, together with previously published data for zzso 2, 3, and 4, provide the complete sequence information for zzso analysis of the human zzso zzso
