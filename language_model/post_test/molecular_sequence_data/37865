zzso zzso zzso which causes a zzso fragmentation at the final stage of zzso is a protein of about 40 zzso and exists as a complex form with the inhibitor zzso in living zzso There is sequence zzso of about 80 zzso acid zzso at the N zzso of zzso and zzso (called the zzso zzso Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain of zzso determined by zzso zzso zzso and the property of zzso zzso investigated by a surface zzso resonance zzso The zzso domain of zzso is an independently folded domain composed of one zzso and five zzso forming a single zzso The overall structure is zzso in the zzso zzso This domain can bind strongly to the isolated zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It suggests the function of the zzso zzso in the zzso system, that the zzso interaction through the zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso activity and in the correct folding of zzso On the basis of structural comparison with other protein complexes containing the zzso zzso the interaction mode of the zzso zzso is zzso
