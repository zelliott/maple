A portion of the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso regulation of zzso zzso The minimal zzso regulatory region contains three zzso zzso so-called iron responsive elements zzso that are recognized specifically by iron regulatory proteins zzso The structure of this regulatory region and its complex with zzso was zzso using a combination of zzso and zzso The data support the existence of an intrinsic zzso loop structure that is constrained by an internal zzso base zzso This particular structure is one of the zzso required for optimal zzso zzso zzso covers one zzso turn of the zzso and protects zzso zzso in each of the three zzso the zzso zzso and zzso in the hairpin zzso Two essential zzso contacts were identified by zzso zzso zzso modeling of one zzso reveals that zzso contacts several bases and the zzso backbone located on one face in the deep groove, but contacts also exist with the shallow zzso A zzso change of the zzso loop zzso by zzso binding was zzso by zzso zzso This effect is dependent on the loop structure and on the nature of the closing base zzso Within the regulatory region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in a zzso hairpin loop that requires the presence of the zzso structure located just downstream the zzso zzso site identified by zzso et zzso zzso R et zzso 1994, zzso J zzso These results provide indications of the mechanism by which zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso under iron depletion zzso
