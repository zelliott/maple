We have developed a new strategy for producing zzso zzso libraries that is zzso for zzso and zzso zzso where a few exceptionally abundant zzso zzso species account for a large fraction of the total zzso zzso Our method consists of a zzso zzso of the most abundant zzso the first step involves a novel use of zzso zzso H zzso to lower the concentration of zzso zzso zzso In the second step, a highly specific zzso is achieved through zzso with zzso from a zzso zzso zzso By applying this technique in skeletal muscle, we have constructed zzso zzso libraries that are effectively enriched for genes expressed at low zzso We further report on frequent premature termination of zzso in human muscle zzso and discuss the importance of this phenomenon in designing zzso zzso The zzso collections of zzso clones generated by our method are particularly well suited for expression zzso
