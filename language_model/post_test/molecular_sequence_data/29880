The zzso step in zzso acid zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso cholesterol 7 zzso (7 zzso The expression of this zzso is subject to feedback regulation by zzso and is thought to be zzso regulated with zzso in the cholesterol supply zzso including the low density zzso zzso and zzso A zzso and zzso Here we report the zzso of rat 7 zzso and the determination of a partial zzso acid zzso zzso derived from zzso sequence were used to clone a full-length zzso zzso 7 zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso revealed a 7 zzso protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso which represents a novel family of zzso zzso zzso zzso of a 7 zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells resulted in the synthesis of a functional zzso whose activity was zzso in zzso by the addition of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso for 7 zzso is found only in the zzso The levels of this zzso increased when zzso acids were depleted by dietary zzso and decreased when zzso acids were zzso zzso cholesterol led to an increase in 7 zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of 7 zzso paralleled the observed changes in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso acids and zzso are able to alter the zzso of the 7 zzso gene and that this control explains the previously observed feedback regulation of zzso acid zzso
