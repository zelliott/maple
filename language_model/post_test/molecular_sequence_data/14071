In zzso zzso channels, zzso responsible for zzso selectivity were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso found in each of the four repeats of the alpha zzso zzso were identified as the major zzso of selectivity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso in repeat I zzso repeat III zzso and repeat IV zzso decreased the channel affinity for calcium zzso zzso from the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso in repeat II failed to significantly alter zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of neighboring zzso in zzso and zzso did not affect the channel zzso further supporting the unique role of zzso zzso zzso in repeat III and zzso in repeat IV in determining zzso zzso Conservative zzso zzso and zzso preserved zzso zzso zzso which suggests that the interaction between zzso and the pore zzso sites is predominantly zzso and involves charge zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed additionally that polar zzso could achieve higher zzso affinity than small zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso calcium binding sites in channel zzso was investigated at the single-channel zzso zzso of zzso zzso in repeats I, II, and III did not affect single-channel properties measured with 115 zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso binding site zzso was found to significantly affect the single-channel zzso for zzso and zzso providing strong evidence that zzso is located in the narrow region of the channel outer zzso zzso zzso at zzso in repeat IV were used to probe the nature of zzso zzso interaction and zzso zzso interaction in the calcium channel zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso to the volume of the side chain at position zzso with small neutral zzso such as zzso and zzso producing higher zzso currents than the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso hindrance is a major zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more zzso zzso single-channel zzso decreased when small neutral zzso such as zzso were replaced by zzso ones such as zzso However, zzso charged zzso acids produced single-channel zzso higher than predicted from the size of their side zzso zzso zzso charged zzso at position zzso in repeat IV are required for zzso zzso zzso
