zzso is a cellular zzso zzso whose protein expression is zzso in several zzso and which also contributes to the zzso of zzso by acting as a zzso for zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain of human zzso has been determined at zzso zzso zzso The structure shows several differences compared with a lower resolution model of the same domain from mouse solved zzso especially in the functional zzso zzso of the sites of zzso that lower or abolish the binding of zzso to zzso proteins shows a distinct zzso of zzso on the zzso face of the zzso zzso amongst these are zzso in the C, zzso and F strands and the zzso zzso A similar analysis shows that the region responsible for zzso or zzso interactions of zzso is also on the zzso face and zzso partially with the zzso zzso This higher resolution structure of zzso will facilitate a more precise dissection of its functional regions in the context of zzso zzso cellular zzso and immune zzso
