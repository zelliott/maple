Often during flowering plant evolution, zzso protein genes have been lost from the zzso and transferred to the zzso Here, we show that substitution by a zzso divergent gene originally zzso the zzso or zzso zzso protein counterpart accounts for two missing zzso genes in diverse zzso The zzso gene is missing from the zzso zzso of many zzso and a transferred copy of this gene is not evident in the nucleus of zzso zzso or zzso Instead, these zzso contain a divergent nuclear copy of an zzso gene of zzso zzso The product of this gene from all three zzso was shown to be imported into isolated zzso but not into zzso The zzso gene is missing from the zzso and nucleus of all zzso zzso A divergent copy of the gene zzso its zzso counterpart zzso was identified in the nucleus of four zzso and one zzso The product of this gene from zzso and tomato was imported successfully into zzso We zzso that zzso was lost from the zzso zzso and zzso by a duplicated nuclear gene of zzso origin early in zzso evolution, whereas zzso loss and substitution by a gene of zzso origin occurred much earlier, in a common zzso of zzso and zzso
