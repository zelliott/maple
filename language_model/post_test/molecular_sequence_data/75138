We report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso clone for the beta zzso of human zzso zzso zzso from a human liver zzso zzso zzso library using zzso zzso We generated a zzso sequence of 24 zzso acids starting from the zzso of bovine heart mature E1 zzso The identity of the E1 beta zzso clone was confirmed by the similarity between the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso sequence and the known zzso acid sequence of bovine heart E1 zzso In Northern analysis of total zzso extracted from human heart, the E1 beta zzso clone zzso to a major zzso zzso and a minor zzso zzso zzso zzso
