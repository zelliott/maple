Latest research shows that small zzso peptides play a role in the innate defense system of zzso These peptides typically contribute to zzso defense by developing protective barriers around zzso seeds or between different tissue layers within plant zzso The zzso genes could also be zzso by zzso and zzso stimuli during active defense zzso The peptides display a broad spectrum of zzso zzso Their potent zzso characteristics have ensured that they are promising targets in the medical and agricultural biotechnology zzso 

A berry specific zzso sequence designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, was isolated from zzso zzso zzso encodes for a 77 zzso acid zzso that shows sequence zzso to the family of plant zzso zzso is expressed in a tissue specific, zzso regulated manner, being only expressed in berry tissue at the onset of berry zzso and zzso Treatment of leaf and berry tissue with zzso or zzso factors did not lead to increased expression of zzso under the conditions zzso The predicted signal zzso of zzso fused to the green fluorescent protein zzso showed that the signal zzso allowed zzso of its product in the zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli, had a molecular mass of zzso zzso as determined by mass zzso zzso zzso was extremely zzso and showed strong zzso activity against a broad spectrum of plant zzso zzso with very high levels of activity against the zzso disease causing pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not induce zzso changes on the treated zzso zzso but instead strongly inhibited zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso activity of zzso might be associated with altering the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso 

A berry specific zzso zzso zzso was isolated and characterized and shown to zzso a plant zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso activity against a broad spectrum of zzso probably altering the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso The expression of this zzso is highly regulated in zzso zzso hinting at an important defense role during zzso
