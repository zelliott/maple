We have zzso the zzso DNA zzso of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso group that were isolated over a zzso period from zzso samples obtained from a Canadian cheese zzso These six zzso infected the same two industrial zzso zzso strains out of 30 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso identical even though they were isolated 14 months apart, indicating that a zzso can survive in a cheese plant for more than a zzso The other four zzso were related but notably zzso The length of the zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso and they coded for 51 to 55 open reading zzso All five zzso possessed a 3' zzso zzso site that was 11 zzso zzso Several structural proteins were also identified by zzso liquid zzso mass zzso confirming zzso zzso Comparative analyses suggested that the most recently isolated zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in part, from older zzso zzso zzso and zzso The organization of the five distinct zzso was similar to the previously zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group, and from these zzso a core zzso was determined for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
