We used zzso zzso derived from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in an amplification reaction to isolate a DNA segment containing a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso By using the zzso sequence of this fragment, a zzso zzso was zzso and used to screen a zzso library of zzso zzso DNA for fragments containing zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing zzso was zzso and the zzso sequence of a zzso region containing zzso was zzso No zzso expression was detected in zzso coli or several other zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso into a zzso coli shuttle zzso zzso and transformed into several zzso zzso zzso of zzso was demonstrated in all zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso which possesses the zzso gene zzso for the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso was able to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso when carrying the zzso gene on a zzso A zzso carrying both zzso and zzso was constructed and transformed into three zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both genes were expressed in the zzso The zzso zzso activity of the zzso strains carrying the zzso zzso were compared with that of the zzso zzso strain from which it was zzso
