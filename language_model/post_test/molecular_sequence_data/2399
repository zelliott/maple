Within the human zzso leukemia virus type I promoter, there are three copies of a zzso repeat zzso called the zzso element zzso that both contributes to zzso promoter activity and mediates induction by the viral zzso zzso We have identified and separated three nuclear proteins that interact with the zzso The zzso protein designated zzso bound more avidly to a zzso zzso than to a zzso zzso while the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound equally well to either zzso zzso has been zzso to near zzso and binding activity was localized to a protein of 35 to 43 zzso The zzso zzso activated zzso from the human zzso leukemia virus type I promoter in zzso The zzso zzso fraction contained zzso zzso factor binding activity and showed a cooperative interaction with the zzso factor zzso on the zzso zzso zzso
