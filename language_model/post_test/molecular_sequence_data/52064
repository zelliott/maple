We recently constructed a humanized zzso zzso zzso by separate zzso coli expression of each zzso arm followed by directed chemical zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to zzso the zzso activity of human zzso zzso in zzso against the human zzso cell line, zzso which zzso the zzso product of the zzso zzso Our zzso zzso strategy is to install as few zzso zzso as possible into a human zzso in order to recruit zzso affinity and biological properties comparable to that of the zzso parent zzso This strategy proved very successful for the zzso arm of zzso zzso In contrast zzso zzso binds to T cells via its zzso arm much less efficiently than does the zzso zzso which contains the variable zzso of the zzso parent zzso zzso Here we have constructed additional zzso fragments containing zzso zzso arms with selected zzso acid replacements in an attempt to improve zzso binding to T zzso One such zzso zzso zzso was created by replacing 6 zzso in the second zzso loop of the zzso heavy chain variable domain of zzso zzso with their counterparts from the zzso parent zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to T cells zzso much more efficiently than does zzso zzso and almost as efficiently as the zzso zzso This improvement in the efficiency of zzso binding of the humanized zzso is an important step in its development as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
