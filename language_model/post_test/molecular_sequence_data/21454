zzso family zzso members play key roles in regulating growth, zzso and zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We analyzed the full zzso of zzso zzso and identified five novel zzso families, V to zzso We characterized the zzso organization and zzso location of the novel zzso family zzso In contrast to previously identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes had intervening zzso at almost the same positions as zzso insulin zzso We performed reverse zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso in different zzso and zzso stages to observe their zzso and spatial expression zzso The newly identified zzso genes were expressed in diverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in the brain and zzso zzso in fat zzso zzso gene was expressed in both brain and zzso of zzso zzso High level of zzso gene expression in the zzso cells may suggest its function in zzso The presence of a short zzso domain and an extended A chain domain, and high expression of zzso gene in the fat body cells during zzso stages suggest its zzso growth zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso genes originated from a common ancestral zzso similar to the zzso insulin zzso and evolved into a diverse gene family with multiple zzso
