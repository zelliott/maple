A zzso signal recognition particle zzso that is related to the zzso involved in zzso in bacteria and zzso cells is used for the zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso into the zzso zzso A zzso component of the zzso mechanism is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso that are targeted to the zzso zzso To investigate the in zzso roles of zzso we characterized zzso zzso and zzso zzso having a zzso zzso zzso in the corresponding gene zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso accumulates to much higher levels in leaf tissue than in roots and zzso Interestingly, it is present at similar levels in zzso and green leaf tissue and was found to bind the zzso bodies of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a substantial loss of leaf zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso zzso a more moderate zzso zzso Both zzso caused the loss of various zzso and the zzso zzso zzso complexes and were zzso zzso By contrast, levels of the zzso components of the zzso protein transport zzso were not zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso were zzso and reduced in zzso but the zzso bodies in zzso zzso appeared zzso These results demonstrate the zzso of zzso for the zzso not only of the zzso but also for the assembly of the other zzso components of the zzso zzso
