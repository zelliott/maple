The export of primary photosynthesis products from zzso into the zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is an integral membrane protein localized at the inner envelope of zzso In order to study the expression of the major zzso envelope protein gene zzso which is assumed to function as the zzso we have isolated corresponding zzso clones from zzso A full-length clone was zzso and shown to be highly zzso to the zzso gene from zzso zzso on the zzso level is restricted to green zzso is light dependent and cannot be induced by zzso in zzso The presence of a zzso gene argues for the existence of different zzso systems responsible for import and export of carbohydrates in zzso and zzso
