The genetic zzso leading to zzso zzso of a zzso protein fusion in a zzso zzso strain zzso of zzso coli were zzso The zzso zzso was found to zzso two altered zzso one is in the zzso gene zzso zzso nitrate zzso where zzso was changed to zzso zzso and the second zzso is in the promoter region zzso of the zzso gene apparently affecting the binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of an zzso gene into zzso restored zzso repression of zzso and restored the ability of the cells to reduce zzso However, when either the zzso or the zzso zzso was introduced into an otherwise zzso background, only slight zzso zzso of zzso was zzso When both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were combined simultaneously in an otherwise zzso background, the specific activity of zzso expression was comparable to that of the original zzso strain zzso Furthermore, a genetically confirmed fur zzso double zzso was also similarly zzso in zzso zzso zzso The data presented suggest that the zzso in zzso zzso affects the zzso site in the zzso promoter, while having no effect on zzso or Arc zzso zzso Also, a second putative zzso site that zzso the zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso
