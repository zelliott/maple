To clarify the relationship between the zzso acid variations of the zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso and the zzso receptors that are used as the second zzso for zzso we evaluated zzso acid site variation of zzso between the zzso strains zzso zzso and the zzso strains zzso zzso from 21 sequences of zzso zzso Our analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso loop and zzso 440 in the C4 region were associated with usage of the second zzso The zzso at zzso 440 is clearly associated with the usage of the second zzso The zzso acid at position 440 was a basic zzso acid in the zzso zzso and a zzso and smaller zzso acid in the zzso zzso while the zzso loop of the zzso strains was more basic than that of the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso 440 in the C4 region, which is close to the zzso loop in the three-dimensional structure, is critical in determining which second zzso is zzso Analysis of zzso frequency suggests that, in almost all cases, the difference at zzso 440 between basic zzso acids in the zzso strains and zzso zzso acids in the zzso strains could be due to a single zzso zzso These findings predict that the evolutionary changes in zzso acid zzso 440 may be correlated with evolutionary changes in the zzso zzso One possibility is that a change in electric charge at zzso 440 compensates for a change in electric charge in the zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso at position 440 can be useful to predict the cell zzso of a strain of zzso zzso zzso
