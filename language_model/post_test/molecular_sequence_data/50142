An important zzso question regarding the bacterial zzso system is the fate of target zzso replaced by zzso zzso during zzso The aim of the present study is to address the potential role of zzso system in zzso quality control, focusing on truncated zzso that are expected to arise from zzso zzso zzso We found that significant amounts of truncated zzso and zzso were produced from genes lacking a zzso zzso in zzso zzso These truncated zzso hence truncated zzso were no longer observed in the presence of zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso system zzso degradation of zzso zzso by presumably removing the stalled zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso proteins indicated that truncated zzso could be produced even from a gene with an intact zzso zzso although less zzso zzso that zzso truncated proteins and zzso zzso may be produced from virtually all zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso system not only promotes the degradation of incomplete zzso but also zzso the synthesis of incomplete zzso by zzso the degradation of truncated zzso that are produced in zzso
