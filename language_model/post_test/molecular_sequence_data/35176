zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso stain of plane trees, a lethal disease able to kill mature trees in one or two successive growing zzso The pathogen is a zzso zzso and has a negative impact on anthropogenic and natural populations of plane zzso zzso sawdust produced during pruning and sanitation zzso can contribute to disease zzso The goal of this study was to design a zzso real-time quantitative zzso zzso to detect a zzso zzso airborne zzso Airborne zzso traps zzso were placed in an urban setting in the city of Florence, Italy, where the disease was zzso zzso and zzso minor groove zzso zzso zzso were designed to target zzso zzso and internal transcribed zzso 2 zzso zzso The detection limits of the zzso were zzso zzso and 2 zzso of zzso DNA for zzso and zzso zzso zzso detection directly from zzso demonstrated specificity and high sensitivity for zzso zzso detecting DNA zzso as low as zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso per zzso Airborne zzso traps were able to detect the zzso zzso zzso within 200 m of the closest symptomatic infected plane zzso The combination of airborne zzso and real-time quantitative zzso zzso provides a rapid and sensitive method for the specific detection of a zzso zzso zzso This technique may be used to identify the period of highest risk of pathogen spread in a site, thus helping disease zzso
