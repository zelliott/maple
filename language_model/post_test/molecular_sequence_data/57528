The X-ray crystal structure of the complex of the zzso domain of the human 55 zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso with human zzso beta has been determined at zzso A zzso The complex has three zzso molecules bound zzso to one zzso beta zzso The zzso fragment, a very zzso end to end assembly of four similar folding zzso binds in the groove between two adjacent zzso beta zzso The structure of the complex defines the orientation of the zzso with respect to the cell membrane and provides a model for zzso zzso zzso The novel fold of the zzso zzso structure is likely to be representative of the nerve growth factor zzso zzso family as a zzso
