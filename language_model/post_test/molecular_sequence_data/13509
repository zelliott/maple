Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso genes has proven to be important for detection of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso To improve the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we carefully determined the precise restriction map of the zzso zzso gene region, developed a suitable C zzso probe zzso and evaluated relevant restriction zzso in combination with the zzso zzso For the latter purpose, we selected 75 B cell zzso with proven expression of zzso zzso protein chains in order to be sure that each zzso contained at least one zzso rearranged zzso zzso zzso Our extensive Southern zzso analyses with the zzso probe in zzso and/or zzso zzso revealed that combined zzso zzso detected zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso of the 75 patients and zzso of the 98 rearranged zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso single zzso allowed detection of zzso in only zzso and zzso of the patients, and zzso and zzso of rearranged zzso zzso We conclude that the use of the zzso probe in combined zzso zzso is superior to zzso and zzso single zzso This zzso combination is zzso for zzso studies in approximately zzso of zzso
