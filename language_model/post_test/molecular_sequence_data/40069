Gene transfer to zzso in zzso has been shown to be an effective approach for treating zzso associated with zzso arthritis zzso and related joint zzso However, the efficiency and duration of gene delivery has been limiting for successful gene therapy for zzso The transient gene expression that often accompanies zzso gene delivery can be prolonged by integration of zzso DNA into the host zzso We report a novel approach for zzso gene therapy to zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso to bring about zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and human zzso cells were zzso with a zzso expressing zzso zzso and a zzso containing the zzso and an zzso zzso zzso were cultured with or without zzso selection and the number of zzso colonies or zzso cells determined, zzso zzso rescue, zzso zzso and DNA sequence analysis were performed to reveal integration sites in the rabbit and human zzso For in zzso studies, zzso gene plasmids and a zzso expressing zzso zzso were zzso injected into rabbit zzso Joint sections were used for zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso cells were isolated to measure zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso of a zzso expressing zzso zzso with a zzso containing the zzso and zzso increased the frequency of zzso expression in rabbit zzso zzso and primary human zzso zzso zzso rescue and DNA sequence analysis of zzso junctions revealed integration at zzso zzso zzso sequences in the rabbit zzso and zzso query detected integration at previously characterized integration sites in the human zzso zzso higher levels of zzso expression were detected in zzso in rabbit knees after zzso injection of zzso gene plasmids and a zzso expressing zzso zzso 

The ability of zzso zzso to facilitate zzso integration in zzso cells and increase zzso expression in the rabbit zzso suggests that, in combination with more efficient DNA delivery methods, this zzso system could be beneficial for treatment of zzso arthritis and other joint zzso
