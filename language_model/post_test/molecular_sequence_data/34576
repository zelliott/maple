zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is native to the arid and zzso regions of central zzso It was introduced into the United States in 1966 as zzso zzso and released as a perennial forage shrub in zzso zzso zzso is a perennial native to the United States, whereas zzso zzso is an introduced annual species that became a zzso To assess both the breeding potential and the possibility of genetic contamination, relationships among the 3 zzso species were analyzed using random amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso sequence zzso site zzso marker sequences of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso random zzso yielded zzso zzso bands from 9 plants of zzso zzso 20 plants of zzso zzso and 7 plants of zzso zzso zzso and 55 zzso zzso markers were identified for zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas 80 zzso markers were specific to zzso zzso Based on the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso the 3 species always grouped into 3 distinct clusters in a zzso zzso The same relationships were found among the 3 zzso species based on zzso DNA sequence zzso Using a set of 7 zzso markers that can identify each zzso species, we did not find a single zzso hybrid from artificial zzso among the 3 zzso zzso In zzso studies, zzso of 1 species zzso in green only when they were zzso by zzso DNA of the same zzso zzso by zzso DNA of another species was not zzso In FISH studies using zzso (for zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso as zzso there were 1, 1 and 3 zzso sites and 2, 1, and 1 zzso sites in each zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that these 3 zzso species are so zzso distinct that gene zzso among them would be extremely zzso
