Recently, it has been shown that zzso zzso are implicated in several zzso pathways controlling the cellular zzso In particular, during brain development, the zzso part of zzso zzso is specifically zzso and the resulting 11 zzso acid zzso stimulates the growth and activity of zzso zzso The zzso structure of bovine and human zzso has revealed that their zzso and zzso parts are accessible and exposed to the zzso suggesting that they may be involved in specific interactions with cellular zzso We have chemically zzso the two peptides corresponding to these terminal parts and studied their structure in solution by circular zzso and zzso zzso both of them are zzso The zzso zzso is composed of a series of turns, leading to a hook zzso The zzso zzso displays a globally zzso zzso similar to that observed in the whole zzso it is characterized by an zzso feature with a zzso cluster located on one zzso These structural features zzso previous zzso and zzso experiments and give new insights on the roles of both zzso zzso
