Recent studies on the structural composition of zzso zzso heads have shown a zzso of unidentified proteins occupying the periphery of the zzso zzso nucleus, forming a layer of condensed zzso These proteins are the zzso zzso zzso and can be zzso into zzso and zzso zzso The present study focused on identifying the major zzso zzso zzso which we localized to the zzso layer of bovine zzso and cloned by zzso a bull zzso zzso zzso The isolated clones zzso a protein of 122 zzso acids that bears zzso similarity with zzso zzso and contains a predicted zzso fold zzso The novel zzso zzso of the protein contains a potential zzso nuclear targeting zzso zzso we identified this prominent zzso component as a novel zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses of zzso zzso expression showed that it is zzso and is also present in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso intimately associates, temporally and zzso with zzso zzso While the molecular features of zzso are common to nuclear zzso it is never seen zzso within the nucleus of the zzso Considering its zzso and molecular zzso we have zzso roles of zzso in zzso assembly and zzso zzso
