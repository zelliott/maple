The red coral zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso species from the Mediterranean Sea and the adjacent coastline in the Atlantic zzso zzso of genetic variation using zzso have shown that populations of zzso zzso are characterized by strong differentiation at the local scale but a study of the zzso of this species was still zzso Here, we used seven zzso zzso zzso together with sequence data from an zzso of the zzso factor 1 zzso zzso to investigate the genetic structure of zzso zzso across its geographical range in the western Mediterranean Sea and in the zzso zzso The zzso sequences were also used to zzso the consequences of demographic fluctuations linked with past environmental zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso highlighted three to seven genetic groups with the distinction of North African and zzso zzso this distinction appeared significant with zzso and differentiation zzso zzso and zzso data extended the isolation by distance pattern previously observed for this species at the western Mediterranean zzso zzso sequences confirmed the genetic differentiation observed between most samples with zzso A statistical zzso network of zzso zzso provided no evidence of high sequence divergence among regions, suggesting no long-term zzso Selective neutrality tests on zzso and zzso were not significant but should be interpreted with caution in the case of zzso because of the low sample sizes for this zzso Our results suggest that recent zzso environmental fluctuations had a limited impact on the genetic structure of zzso zzso
