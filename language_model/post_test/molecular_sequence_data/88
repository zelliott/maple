zzso acid zzso is an important building block in a wide spectrum of compounds varying from primary zzso to secondary zzso zzso acid zzso from zzso requires zzso of the zzso side chain by two zzso which can occur via a zzso zzso or a zzso pathway, with zzso as a key zzso The zzso route requires zzso zzso zzso to convert zzso to zzso Using a functional zzso approach, we identified an zzso zzso zzso zzso which exhibits zzso identity to bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso in zzso stable isotope zzso and transient expression in zzso flowers reveal that zzso is capable of zzso zzso to BA in zzso zzso zzso and zzso labeling studies show that this zzso step occurs in the zzso raising a question about the role of zzso zzso in BA zzso
