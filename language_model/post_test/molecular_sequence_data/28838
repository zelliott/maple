zzso syndrome zzso represents a pathological model of the evolution from zzso B zzso zzso to zzso B cell expansion, which may culminate in the development of a zzso zzso zzso The different zzso of this process are usually marked by the appearance of zzso activated B cell zzso which are commonly zzso and with zzso factor zzso zzso However, the zzso able to trigger B cell proliferation is still zzso A similar zzso mechanism exist in mixed zzso another zzso disease that often zzso to zzso zzso zzso and in which zzso C virus zzso infection has been demonstrated to play an zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso variable region genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared them with those of our previous reported zzso zzso to derive clues on the zzso that sustains zzso The results obtained showed remarkable zzso between the zzso zzso regions of the zzso expressed by both zzso These zzso zzso a) the specific combinations of heavy and light variable region zzso b) the limited length of zzso regions zzso c) the zzso with zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso in which common zzso zzso are present that possibly determine the zzso zzso In conclusion, although there are significant differences between SS and zzso zzso diseases, they share many molecular zzso which suggest an zzso zzso or molecular mimicry among the agents that zzso these zzso
