To test the hypothesis that broad spectrum zzso may be developed as zzso useful in detecting the consequence of combined environmental stresses in a wide variety of zzso and organisms, a stretch of 16 zzso zzso zzso a zzso portion of heat shock 70 zzso was identified, against which specific zzso could be zzso This stretch of zzso was zzso prepared and used as a zzso for zzso preparation by zzso to zzso zzso zzso injecting into a zzso collecting its blood, and zzso an zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso was found to react with many zzso protein zzso 70s in every species tested so far, including two species of fish and one zzso two zzso and one plant zzso To relate the zzso of this zzso preparation to heat shock proteins known to be induced by environmental stress, a Western zzso zzso method was used to study several organisms under zzso or stressed zzso zzso heat treatment caused a rise in the zzso or zzso and/or zzso zzso In addition, in some species chemical stresses were also found to be zzso in the form of an increased zzso of these zzso
