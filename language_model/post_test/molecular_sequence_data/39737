zzso zzso zzso of teak trees growing in dry zzso and moist zzso forests of zzso zzso Reserve were zzso A species of zzso dominated the zzso zzso of zzso irrespective of the location of the host zzso Internal transcribed zzso sequence analysis of 11 different zzso zzso zzso from teak and one from zzso zzso showed that they fall into two groups, which are separated by a relatively long branch that is strongly zzso The results showed that this fungus is not host restricted and that it continues to survive as a zzso in teak zzso possibly by exploiting zzso leaves as well as the zzso Although the zzso zzso of a teak tree growing about 500 zzso from the forests was also dominated by a zzso zzso it separated into a different group based on internal transcribed zzso sequence zzso Our results with an zzso zzso zzso reinforce the earlier conclusions reached by others for zzso zzso zzso zzso that this fungus is not host specific, and the species concept of zzso needs to be zzso
