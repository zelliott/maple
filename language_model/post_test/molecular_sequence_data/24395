The zzso important for zzso binding and zzso of human zzso zzso were mapped with zzso zzso zzso grouped on the basis of their specificity and ability to neutralize zzso activity, and zzso scanning zzso zzso The binding properties of nine zzso were zzso using zzso zzso having zzso zzso at targeted, zzso zzso The results were correlated with the zzso zzso zzso Of six zzso that bound either at or adjacent to the zzso zzso chain binding site defined by the zzso zzso only three had measurable zzso zzso Two of these inhibited zzso complex formation, suggesting that zzso hindrance of zzso binding constitutes their mechanism of zzso However, two zzso that bound to sites remote from the zzso binding site on zzso also inhibited zzso complex formation and demonstrated potent zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may employ mechanisms other than zzso blockade to inhibit directly the binding of zzso by zzso limiting their usefulness as tools to define precise zzso interaction zzso
