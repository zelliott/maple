To study some essential elements of a zzso promoter of zzso zzso a series of promoter zzso incorporated into upstream of a zzso zzso gene were constructed from a known zzso zzso promoter, zzso promoter, by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso technique and then zzso into zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso * zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso zzso The corresponding zzso activities of altered promoters were measured by the zzso zzso The results showed that a zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso start site of zzso had no ability to enhance or inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso promoter, even it was modified to the zzso zzso zzso However, there was almost no zzso zzso activity from the zzso deletion of the zzso original zzso Moreover, altered spacing between zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso box in the zzso promoter region affected zzso efficiency dramatically, which also happened in another zzso promoter, zzso zzso Those above suggested that besides the zzso additional unknown zzso promoter zzso or zzso might be required for the zzso binding to the promoter and initiation of zzso Furthermore, the distance between the zzso and the zzso box should be fixed to 22 or zzso for the zzso zzso
