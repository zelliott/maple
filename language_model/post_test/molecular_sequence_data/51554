zzso the sequence of the zzso zzso gene in men with impaired responsiveness to zzso in order to identify the molecular basis of their zzso 

Blood samples were used as the source of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene were amplified by zzso chain reaction and zzso 

zzso were obtained from three patients and five normal fertile zzso Patients were all 46 zzso and were zzso with ambiguous external zzso zzso and zzso 

Total cellular DNA was zzso from peripheral blood zzso zzso of zzso zzso designed to flank the individual zzso of the zzso zzso gene were zzso The specific regions of the zzso zzso were amplified from the samples of cellular DNA by zzso chain zzso zzso DNA was zzso zzso and compared to the published zzso 

In all three patients point zzso in the zzso zzso gene were detected but no defects were detected in samples from normal zzso In two of the patients, an identical single zzso change from G to T was zzso This zzso was within the zzso for zzso acid zzso and would change it from zzso to zzso zzso acid zzso is found within an area of the steroid binding domain thought to be involved in zzso zzso Within the repetitive sequence of zzso I patient 1 had 21 zzso zzso and patient 2 had zzso In the third patient a single change of G to A would result in incorporation of zzso in place of a zzso zzso zzso at position 607 within the second zinc finger of the DNA binding zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso gene of the mother of the third patient revealed her to be zzso for the same zzso 

Patients 1 and 2 are unrelated although they have an identical point zzso in their zzso zzso zzso A patient with complete zzso zzso syndrome has been reported to have a zzso at the same position causing the zzso acid substitution of zzso for zzso Therefore we confirm that the nature of the zzso acid change in the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso as well as its location within the zzso can have a profound effect on the zzso severity of zzso zzso Studies on zzso receptors from individuals with a wide range of degrees of zzso resistance may enable us to construct a map of the key zzso acids in the different zzso of the zzso
