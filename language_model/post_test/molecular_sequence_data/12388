The main functions of the zzso zzso zzso involve its specific interaction with short and linear zzso peptides bound to the major zzso complex zzso zzso In the absence of a zzso structure for zzso and for the zzso complex, several attempts to characterize the structural components of the zzso interaction have been zzso However, this subject is still zzso In this paper a computer-based zzso model for a zzso complex zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso was zzso The complex surface shows a high zzso between the zzso structure and the zzso zzso The mapping of zzso involved in the zzso interaction shows close agreement with zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Davis zzso zzso zzso Rev zzso zzso Moreover, the results are consistent with a recent zzso analysis of zzso sequences using three zzso indexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso Res zzso zzso the zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso complex provides a framework to generate testable hypotheses about zzso zzso Thus, starting from this model, the role played by each loop that forms the zzso binding site of the zzso is zzso
