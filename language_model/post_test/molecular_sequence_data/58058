zzso differs only slightly in structure from the zzso drug zzso and both compounds bind with comparable affinity to the zzso zzso protein zzso the major zzso zzso for the zzso Despite these similarities, zzso is a potent zzso of both the zzso and toxic effects of the zzso Here, we present a structural analysis of this zzso Although zzso and zzso differ greatly in zzso we have found that the three-dimensional structures of their complexes with zzso are essentially zzso zzso half of each zzso is in contact with the zzso zzso and half is exposed to zzso the exposed region includes the two sites where the compounds zzso These results indicate that the profound differences in the pharmacology of these two compounds are not caused by any difference in their interaction with zzso Rather, these effects arise because relatively minor changes in the exposed part of a bound zzso have a strong effect on how zzso complexes interact with zzso their putative zzso zzso In addition, zzso complexes with zzso proteins from several species all inhibit zzso zzso Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the complex with respect to zzso zzso among these proteins suggests a small number of surface zzso near the bound zzso that may play a critical role in interactions between the zzso complex and zzso
