A library of zzso zzso DNA was established in the direct selection zzso zzso Six clones carrying a gene coding for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by colony zzso with an zzso probe based on the zzso zzso acid sequence of this zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso acids with the expected zzso sequence and absence of zzso zzso was zzso The deduced protein had a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso We propose to name this zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a significant zzso acid zzso with zzso of several remotely related bacterial zzso This zzso was most pronounced corresponding to the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso whereas the central region was zzso
