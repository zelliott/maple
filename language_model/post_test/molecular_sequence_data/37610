A novel zzso zzso zzso from the family of zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso A zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso a predicted zzso of zzso zzso acids was zzso The new zzso tentatively named zzso zzso exhibits all features characteristics of a zzso zzso zzso including the highly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Z shares only zzso overall zzso with previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso and has an unusually short zzso which may indicate that it is a member of a putative new zzso within the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso clones covering the zzso and human zzso Z genes were zzso They comprise six zzso and five zzso spanning a zzso region of zzso DNA, zzso zzso zzso Z was mapped to zzso 2, a region with zzso zzso to a region of human zzso 20 to which human zzso Z has been mapped zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso start sites were identified for the zzso zzso Z gene and together with the absence of a zzso box, a high zzso content, a zzso island and the presence of several zzso sites in the promoter region, zzso zzso Z may be classified as a zzso zzso
