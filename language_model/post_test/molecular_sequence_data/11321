A zzso display system for the selection of peptides binding to zzso expressed human zzso zzso 1 on the surface of insect cells has been zzso It could be shown that zzso particles displaying the natural zzso zzso hormone bind selectively to cells expressing this zzso and that these zzso exhibit biological activity on mouse zzso melanoma zzso zzso cells were superior to other cell lines tested and have been used to select zzso from a small library, in which critical zzso zzso were kept, whereas the zzso regions where allowed to zzso zzso One zzso displaying little similarity with native hormone was found that binds to the zzso also in its free form with an affinity of 7 zzso It showed a remarkable selectivity for this zzso because it binds to the other zzso zzso zzso with a maximum affinity of 21 zzso This is the first time zzso display has been used successfully with zzso receptors lacking an zzso binding zzso
