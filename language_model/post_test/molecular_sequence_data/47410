zzso cells of rice zzso zzso zzso zzso produce two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using a bacterial expression system, eight zzso genes constructed with various combination of zzso and zzso zzso fragments were zzso and each zzso zzso protein was zzso Four of the eight zzso zzso having region c (one of the four regions having zzso base sequences between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso showed the same zzso characteristics as that of native zzso which had high temperature optimum at 50 degrees zzso The other four zzso proteins carrying region c of zzso showed the zzso type zzso which were a low temperature optimum at 25 degrees C and zzso to a higher zzso zzso zzso The zzso region c is involved in the decision of the characteristic of zzso or zzso
