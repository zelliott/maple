zzso is a human natural zzso which interacts specifically with the zzso zzso structure Gal alpha zzso beta zzso zzso the zzso zzso This zzso constitutes approximately zzso of circulating zzso in human serum and is produced, upon zzso by zzso of circulating B zzso zzso is also present as zzso zzso in body zzso such as zzso milk and zzso The zzso source for the constant production of zzso seems to be the zzso zzso found on many bacteria of the gastrointestinal zzso Whereas zzso is abundant in humans, apes and Old World zzso it is absent from New World zzso zzso and zzso zzso The latter group of species zzso however, large amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso It is estimated that zzso appeared in ancestral Old World primates less than 28 million years ago, possibly as a result of an evolutionary event which exerted a selective pressure for the suppression of zzso zzso expression by zzso of the gene for the zzso alpha zzso zzso This also resulted in the loss of immune tolerance to the zzso zzso and the production of zzso The zzso role of this zzso is not clear as zzso It may participate in the protection against gastrointestinal zzso In addition it seems to contribute to the removal of normal and zzso zzso red cells by interacting with the few hundred cryptic zzso zzso which are exposed de zzso in the course of red cell aging, thereby zzso these cells for zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been found to be zzso expressed on human cells and the interaction of zzso with such zzso may result in zzso zzso zzso data suggest such a mechanism in zzso zzso zzso has been found to interact with therapeutic zzso proteins expressing zzso zzso but so far there is no indication that it affects the zzso in the circulation and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the seminal fluid and in the zzso fluid may serve as a simple means for assessment of damage to the zzso tract barrier or the zzso zzso Studies on the interaction of zzso with zzso expressed zzso zzso on human cells may zzso the possible role of zzso in human zzso zzso
