The zzso zzso is a bacterial plasma membrane protein belonging to the zzso zzso zzso The boundaries of zzso zzso can be clearly determined by means of a method involving zzso zzso and their zzso to zzso The results for 37 zzso zzso around putative zzso zzso 9 indicate that the zzso from zzso to 275 and from 296 to zzso form water zzso zzso while zzso from 276 to 295 and from 299 to zzso are embedded in the zzso This method is generally useful for determination of the zzso regions of a zzso membrane zzso
