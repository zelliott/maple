A full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso was cloned from an adult stage zzso expression library in an zzso using rabbit immune serum against the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity to zzso of zzso zzso During development in the zzso host zzso zzso was detected in zzso juveniles and adults and was exclusively localized to the zzso cell zzso zzso serum of a rabbit infected with zzso zzso detected zzso zzso starting from the sixth week of zzso zzso zzso of mice infected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed calcium and zzso activity by a mobility shift during zzso PAGE in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso A zzso mouse zzso zzso detected the native protein as a major component of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and as a strictly zzso zzso in tissue zzso of adult and juvenile zzso Comparative sequence analysis of zzso from zzso and zzso present in the zzso database revealed sequence signatures specific to these zzso proteins and thereby indicates their origin from a single zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso located zzso and a zzso located domain similar to zzso light chain type zzso Independent structure predictions of the two zzso suggest that they will fold according to the already determined structures of the zzso motif and the zzso light chain type 1 zzso
