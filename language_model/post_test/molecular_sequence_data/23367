The zzso is one of the nearest living relatives of zzso However, a zzso species such as zzso or zzso is typically used as the zzso in current zzso comparative sequence zzso Such studies are complicated by the fact that zzso zzso have undergone a zzso zzso event, as well as individual zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the value of zzso zzso sequence by complete sequencing and analysis of the zzso gene cluster of the Indonesian zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso has 49 zzso cluster genes organized in the same three ordered zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the 54 zzso cluster genes in zzso In contrast, zzso and tandem zzso have generated two zzso zzso clusters comprised of at least 97 zzso Additionally, zzso zzso are far more prone to zzso gene conversion events than zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso plasticity may be a feature of zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso provides the ideal zzso sequence against which zzso zzso can be zzso We therefore present zzso zzso as a candidate for zzso zzso
