zzso is a zzso zzso involved in a copper zzso system of zzso coli and has high zzso zzso activity but little or no zzso activity toward various organic zzso However, its activity toward zzso of organic zzso was found to be considerably increased by the removal of the zzso zzso segment that covers the zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the study presented here, zzso at zzso to construct a second zzso hydrogen bond between the backbone zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the type I copper are shown to result in positive shifts in the zzso potential of this copper center and enhanced zzso activity in zzso zzso enhancement of the activity of zzso zzso has been identified only in the zzso zzso because zzso zzso limit the incorporation of copper zzso into the zzso copper zzso The activities of both zzso and zzso zzso were also enhanced by zzso to break down the hydrogen bond between the zzso group of zzso that is coordinated to the type I copper and the zzso group of zzso that is located in the outer sphere of the type I copper zzso A zzso effect of the positive shift in the zzso potential of the type I copper center and the increase in zzso activity has been achieved by the double zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso circular zzso and resonance zzso zzso indicate that the characteristics of the zzso bond were only minimally zzso by zzso involving formation or disruption of a hydrogen bond from the zzso groups to the type I zzso This study provides widely zzso strategies for tuning the activities of zzso zzso
