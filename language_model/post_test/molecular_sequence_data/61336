zzso occupies a central role in cellular zzso and is of particular importance for the zzso production of zzso in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso In these organisms zzso zzso plays a key regulatory role, and is unique in responding to zzso zzso as zzso zzso The determination of the first zzso zzso zzso crystal structure in the zzso is zzso A comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso reveals fewer differences than the previous comparison of zzso coli zzso and rabbit muscle zzso zzso zzso changes related to the zzso transition can therefore be distinguished from those that are a consequence of the inherent wide structural divergence between bacterial and zzso zzso The zzso transition involves significant changes in a tightly packed array of eight alpha zzso at the interface near the zzso zzso At the other interface the zzso transition appears to be accompanied by the zzso of a zzso zzso beta sheet adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso makes contacts to the zzso zzso domain and bridges both zzso A comparison of the zzso sites of the zzso and zzso zzso reveals the structural basis for the different zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso adopt very different zzso in the two zzso and zzso and zzso that are a feature of zzso zzso provide probable zzso for the zzso group of the zzso zzso These differences offer an opportunity for the design of drugs that would bind to the zzso zzso but not to those of the zzso zzso
