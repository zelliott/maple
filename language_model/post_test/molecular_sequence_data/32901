zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the white shrimp zzso zzso was obtained from zzso by a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso zzso using zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence of Homo sapiens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso region, and a zzso zzso region containing the zzso A zzso The molecular mass of the deduced zzso acid zzso sequence zzso zzso was zzso zzso long with an estimated zzso of zzso It contains a putative zzso zzso which is zzso by the unusual stop zzso zzso and forms the active site with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences showed that white shrimp zzso is more closely related to zzso and zzso than to zzso and zzso of various zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso The respiratory bursts of shrimp increased significantly after a zzso zzso injection in order to kill the zzso and then induced increases in the activities of zzso and zzso to protect cells against damage from zzso However, zzso activity increased as a result of zzso expression of zzso zzso which was induced by the increase in zzso
