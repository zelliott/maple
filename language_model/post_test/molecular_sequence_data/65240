Multiple zzso zzso zzso is a clinically variable and genetically zzso zzso characterized by mild to moderate short stature and early onset zzso Some forms of zzso result from zzso in the gene zzso the cartilage structural protein zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso affect zzso zzso within the zzso of the single zzso of zzso These zzso cause the protein to zzso and prevent its zzso from the zzso both in zzso and in zzso More recently a single zzso zzso has been identified within the zzso of the zzso but its affect on the structure and/or function of zzso is zzso In this paper we describe the characterization of two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso and show that both zzso and zzso prevent the zzso of zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso does not prevent the zzso of zzso zzso nor does it disrupt the structure of this domain or inhibit its binding to type II or type IX zzso zzso despite extensive zzso analysis the disease mechanism of zzso remains unresolved and care should be taken in counseling for these types of zzso in zzso
