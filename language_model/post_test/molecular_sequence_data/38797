zzso rates were determined between zzso zzso of varying zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso an integral membrane zzso Polar zzso reacted most rapidly with zzso zzso However, a very zzso zzso also reacted more rapidly with exposed zzso than with membrane zzso Moreover, this zzso zzso usually reacted more slowly with membrane sites than did more polar zzso These results are consistent with the notion that zzso exchange reactions involving buried zzso of zzso zzso are very slow in the membrane interior, such that the competing rates of reactions which occur when normally buried zzso sites make zzso excursions to hydrated regions of the interface can be zzso
