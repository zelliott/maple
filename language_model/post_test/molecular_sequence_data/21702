The zzso regulator gene zzso shows zzso expression in zzso and other zzso relevant zzso and is assigned the major function of programming zzso zzso zzso However, the expression of this gene in zzso outside the immune system raises a question about its possible function beyond the zzso deletion zzso We detected zzso in mouse zzso and the expression of zzso protein was remarkably high in zzso germ zzso zzso results indicate that zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso could be detected in zzso with heavy zzso on the principal zzso zzso Mouse zzso stained zzso for zzso before zzso but stained positively for zzso zzso after zzso In the zzso the levels of zzso correlated zzso with zzso B2 zzso zzso zzso zzso spiked with zzso human zzso exhibited zzso zzso B2 degradation in the presence of zzso zzso which was inhibited by zzso indicating the operation of zzso zzso Thus, this study identifies a correlation between the presence of zzso and zzso breakdown of zzso zzso which leads us to speculate that zzso B2 could be a target of zzso zzso zzso zzso
