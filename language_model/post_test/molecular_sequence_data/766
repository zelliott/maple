zzso comprises two species inhabiting warm zzso forests in East zzso Japan zzso zzso and South Korea zzso zzso A survey of zzso zzso DNA and zzso sequence repeats zzso variation in zzso was carried out to determine the population history of a plant zzso around the East China Sea zzso zzso and zzso revealed lower genetic divergence between China and Japan relative to the other zzso in line with zzso zzso zzso dating suggests that zzso zzso zzso at the zzso boundary from the Japanese zzso whereas the latter migrated into China during the zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso segregation of Chinese and Japanese populations likely occurred during the zzso zzso zzso and neutrality tests indicated that Chinese populations expanded their range during the Late zzso probably during a cold period, whereas those from Japan showed no significant population zzso We conclude that the current distribution and differentiation of components of presently isolated warm zzso forests in China, Japan and Korea likely resulted from a combination of relatively ancient zzso and immigration events, and those from Japan were particularly sensitive to range fragmentation and long-term zzso isolation throughout the Late zzso
