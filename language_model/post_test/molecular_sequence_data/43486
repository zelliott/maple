Human zzso is unique since it is the only tissue in the body that zzso at regular zzso In addition, abnormal zzso bleeding is one of the most common manifestations of zzso diseases, and is a prime indication for zzso Here, we report on a novel human zzso zzso bleeding associated factor zzso whose strong expression in zzso was associated with abnormal zzso zzso In normal human zzso this gene was zzso expressed before and during zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso was expressed in the zzso without any significant zzso expression in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence of zzso showed zzso with and structural features of the members of zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene is located on human zzso 1 at band zzso Thus, zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso and an zzso tissue factor whose expression is associated with normal zzso and abnormal zzso zzso
