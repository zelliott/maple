zzso zzso switch genes zzso zzso are potential zzso and may zzso be regulated by, or be zzso regulated with, zzso zzso zzso To identify these zzso a zzso library was prepared from blood zzso cells that had been cultured for 2 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso Eight zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso and DNA zzso and zzso One zzso zzso corresponded to the zzso zzso Another zzso zzso was zzso zzso to a zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of stem cell proliferation (the zzso zzso zzso and, less closely, to other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Whereas zzso zzso to zzso DNA blots indicated a small zzso of zzso zzso simple patterns of bands indicated that most zzso including zzso zzso corresponded to zzso zzso The 3' zzso sequence of zzso zzso was zzso zzso to the 3' zzso sequences of certain zzso genes zzso zzso zzso that zzso zinc finger proteins zzso zzso zzso This degree of evolutionary conservation suggests an important function for the 3' zzso zzso The 3' zzso regions of some zzso contained the zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso each formed zzso in zzso zzso Previous studies of zzso zzso from zzso cells indicate that this is due to zzso stabilization of zzso zzso Our results reveal the power of zzso enrichment in zzso what would appear to be significant zzso zzso
