There has been no structural information about the core protein of salmon zzso cartilage zzso although its zzso activities have been zzso Internal zzso acid sequencing using zzso revealed that the salmon zzso was zzso zzso walk sequencing based on the zzso acid information determined that the salmon zzso zzso is comprised of zzso zzso predicted to zzso zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso It exhibited significant similarities to predicted zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso and human zzso zzso 2 zzso whose zzso acid identities were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as in zzso zzso Neither the putative zzso zzso attachment domain enriched with zzso zzso acid and zzso nor the putative zzso zzso attachment domain with repeating zzso acid sequence containing zzso found in zzso zzso were observed in zzso however, random zzso (or zzso sequences predicted to the sugar chain attachment sites were zzso Based on zzso analysis and zzso acid analysis after zzso the ratio of zzso attached to sugar chains was calculated to be approximately zzso of total zzso that is, 46 of 123 zzso zzso
