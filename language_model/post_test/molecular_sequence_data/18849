zzso are members of the zzso family of plants that can transfer single or multiple activated zzso to a range of plant zzso resulting in the zzso of plant zzso Although the activities of many zzso and their products have been recognized for a long time, only in recent years were some zzso genes identified and few have been functionally characterized in zzso Korean zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso has been well known as a popular mysterious medicinal herb in East Asia for over 2,000 zzso A total of zzso zzso unique sequences have been found from a zzso expressed sequence tag zzso library, and these sequences zzso zzso responsible for the secondary zzso zzso Finally, twelve zzso zzso zzso were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in zzso zzso In this study, we classified the candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso into proper families and groups, which resulted in eight zzso families and six zzso zzso We also investigated those gene candidates zzso for zzso by analysis of gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso roots and different zzso from zzso zzso using quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso For zzso zzso most of zzso zzso levels were higher in leaves and roots compared with flower buds and zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso roots treated with zzso increased as compared with the zzso zzso and zzso which belong to the zzso family genes expressed in zzso zzso roots, were especially sensitive, showing zzso and zzso expression increases upon zzso zzso zzso
