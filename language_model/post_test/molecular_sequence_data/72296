The coding region of the zzso gene of zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso It resembles the zzso coding region of other zzso zzso in possessing a segment of zzso short tandem repeats at a defined location, but in zzso there has been recent serial zzso of a repeat into which a zzso zzso had earlier been zzso As a result of the duplication, there is a total of as many as six zzso zzso in the segment of repeats, a number larger than for any other species yet zzso In zzso there has been a comparable but independent addition of zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso have eliminated an otherwise zzso zzso zzso 75 located close to but outside the segment of zzso In zzso this elimination probably occurred by gene zzso Also zzso the gene of zzso has added zzso zzso to the segment of repeats but has not yet lost zzso zzso It is proposed that the gain and the loss of zzso zzso are parts of a zzso program of zzso zzso
