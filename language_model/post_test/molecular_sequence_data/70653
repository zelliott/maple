zzso membrane zzso carry targeting information in zzso zzso Two distinct targeting motifs in these regions, zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified and zzso zzso evidence suggests that the zzso complexes zzso zzso and zzso recognize this information in zzso tails of zzso zzso Here we report two different in zzso analyses zzso beads and surface zzso zzso which revealed specific interaction between the zzso tail of zzso and zzso but not so with zzso We also noted requirement of the zzso motif of the zzso tail in binding to the zzso zzso Our data and others which indicated the binding of zzso to the zzso II zzso of zzso tail suggest that the zzso tail of zzso interacts with zzso at the zzso network zzso and zzso at late zzso zzso We propose that this sequential interaction between the zzso targeting signal and distinct zzso along its transport zzso is responsible for the critical sorting of zzso membrane proteins and/or the potential zzso system of zzso zzso
