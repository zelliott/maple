A novel strain of zzso zzso was isolated from soybean grain dust from Kansas and found to be toxic to larvae of zzso zzso zzso potato zzso The strain zzso zzso two zzso zzso a zzso crystal composed of a zzso zzso protein of approximately 30 zzso zzso transfer and gene cloning experiments demonstrated that the 73 zzso protein was zzso on an 88 zzso zzso and that the protein was toxic to the larvae of Colorado potato zzso zzso The sequence of the 73 zzso zzso as deduced from the sequence of its gene zzso was found to have regions of similarity with several zzso zzso crystal zzso the zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso zzso (or zzso protein of zzso zzso and the zzso 130 zzso protein of zzso zzso While zzso zzso cells harboring the zzso gene from zzso zzso significant amounts of the 73 zzso zzso zzso zzso coli cells did zzso The zzso zzso zzso cells produced zzso zzso that were toxic to zzso zzso
