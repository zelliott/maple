The human blood group i and I zzso are determined by linear and zzso zzso structures, zzso In zzso the fetal i zzso is converted to the adult I zzso by zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may result in the adult i zzso in zzso However, the I gene responsible for blood group I zzso has not been fully zzso We report here a novel human zzso zzso designated zzso The genes for zzso zzso in zzso zzso (also presented in this zzso and zzso consist of 3 zzso and share the second and third zzso Bone zzso cells zzso expressed zzso zzso During zzso differentiation using zzso cells, zzso was markedly zzso with zzso decrease in zzso Moreover, zzso expressed the zzso transcript, but zzso was below zzso zzso By molecular genetic analyses of an adult i pedigree, individuals with the adult i zzso were revealed to have zzso zzso with zzso in zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with each zzso zzso zzso failed to express I zzso These findings indicate that the expression of the blood group I zzso in zzso is determined by a novel zzso not by zzso or zzso
