zzso are zzso zzso that are zzso In human zzso cells, zzso zzso A4 actions are zzso by interaction with a G zzso zzso To explore functions of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso we cloned and characterized a mouse zzso zzso zzso When expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells, the mouse zzso showed specific binding to zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso and with zzso activated zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso was most abundant in zzso In addition to zzso and zzso zzso zzso stable zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding in zzso to zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso application of zzso zzso and novel zzso zzso stable zzso to mouse ears markedly inhibited zzso zzso in zzso as assessed by both light zzso and reduced zzso activity in skin zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an analogue of aspirin triggered zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were each as potent as zzso applications of the zzso zzso Thus, we identified zzso zzso which is highly expressed on zzso zzso and showed that both zzso and zzso stable zzso inhibit zzso zzso in the mouse ear model of zzso These findings provide direct in zzso evidence for an zzso action for both zzso zzso and zzso stable zzso and their site of action in zzso
