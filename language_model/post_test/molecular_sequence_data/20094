Two human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso novel zzso have been identified in individuals from the Brazilian Bone zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of zzso 2 for zzso zzso showed two and five zzso zzso in zzso and zzso compared with closely related zzso zzso These zzso result in a change of zzso acid zzso in zzso at position 74 zzso zzso zzso and in zzso at positions 47 zzso zzso zzso 57 zzso zzso zzso and 74 zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, sequence analysis of zzso 2 and 3 for zzso showed a single zzso leading to a single zzso acid change at position 151 (His zzso zzso These three novel zzso may have originated from other zzso zzso by gene zzso However, it is also possible that zzso has evolved from one of the zzso of the zzso group through a point zzso
