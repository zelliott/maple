The gene zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned by using two synthetic zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from the sequence of the gene differs from that reported by Bruschi and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein sequencing confirmed the correctness of the zzso zzso The gene sequence indicates zzso zzso to be zzso as a precursor protein with an zzso signal sequence of 24 zzso
