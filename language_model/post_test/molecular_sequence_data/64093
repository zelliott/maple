zzso 3 is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso In the present study, zzso zzso two zzso of zzso 3 have been cloned and the zzso organization of the human zzso 3 gene is zzso The gene spans zzso zzso on zzso zzso and contains 16 zzso The major transcript of zzso 3, designated zzso zzso has an open reading frame that is zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso for zzso zzso were evident throughout the brain and in the majority of zzso zzso A second transcript containing an insert that adds 90 zzso to the third zzso of the gene was also zzso This transcript, designated zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 504 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was limited to several zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the spinal zzso and substantial levels of this transcript were not evident outside of the central nervous zzso zzso sequence comparisons between different zzso zzso protein zzso reveal that these proteins are most zzso in their zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is further diversified by the presence of zzso within this zzso
