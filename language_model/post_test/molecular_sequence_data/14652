Patients with insulin resistance and early type 2 diabetes exhibit an increased propensity to develop a diffuse and extensive pattern of zzso Typically, these patients show elevated serum levels of the zzso zzso product zzso and zzso data from our group revealed zzso deposition in early zzso of these zzso Moreover, in zzso studies suggest that zzso could promote zzso This study examined whether zzso promotes vascular inflammation and zzso development in a mouse model of zzso zzso mice on a high fat diet were treated with zzso or control injections for 12 weeks and the effect on zzso size and plaque composition was zzso zzso treatment significantly increased zzso blood levels by zzso without having an effect on zzso or insulin levels, nor on the zzso zzso In these mice, zzso deposition in zzso plaques was significantly increased compared with zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso mice contained significantly more zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso positive area; P zzso zzso and more vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso positive area; P zzso zzso Finally, zzso deposition measured by zzso zzso in the zzso arch was significantly higher in the zzso group compared with zzso Our results demonstrate that elevated zzso levels promote inflammatory cell zzso and zzso development in zzso mice without having zzso zzso These data obtained in a mouse model of zzso support the hypothesis that zzso may have an active role in zzso in patients with diabetes and insulin zzso
