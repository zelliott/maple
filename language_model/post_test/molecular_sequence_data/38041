zzso proteins may function as adapter or scaffold proteins in signal zzso zzso We reported previously that several zzso zzso bind to protein zzso C zzso and facilitate zzso of zzso to zzso zzso der zzso van der zzso zzso van zzso and van zzso zzso zzso zzso 345, zzso an event that boosts the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The present work investigated whether bound zzso would affect zzso zzso Using zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso in a convenient, newly developed in zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso proteins zzso zzso activity in a zzso fashion up to zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was unrelated to their mutual zzso estimated by zzso from zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with a defective zzso zzso site, showed the same zzso activity as zzso zzso As zzso proteins are zzso we tested several other zzso zzso which turned out to stimulate zzso activity in a similar fashion, whereas neutral or basic proteins did zzso These effects were not restricted to the zzso zzso but were also found for classical zzso Together, the results suggest that the stimulation of zzso activity by zzso proteins is zzso and solely due to the zzso nature of these zzso quite similar to that known for zzso zzso
