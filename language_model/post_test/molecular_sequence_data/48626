The aim of the present study was to provide a preliminary insight into the diversity of zzso pathogens circulating at the domestic zzso interface in zzso For this, feeding and zzso ticks were analyzed by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso for the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso and subsequent sequencing for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A total of 382 zzso encompassing 5 species from 4 zzso were collected in zzso 2010 from different areas of zzso of them, 40 were zzso ticks and the remainder was collected from naturally infested zzso zzso zzso horses or zzso zzso species analyzed included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Four zzso of the spotted fever group of zzso concern were identified for the first time in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Other zzso pathogens such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso of veterinary importance were also identified, including zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings show a wide distribution of very diverse bacterial and zzso pathogens at the domestic zzso interface in Romania, with the potential of causing both animal and human zzso
