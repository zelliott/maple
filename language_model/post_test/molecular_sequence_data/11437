During their zzso zzso stage, African zzso are coated with one of zzso zzso surface zzso zzso that define different zzso zzso zzso types zzso The zzso zzso genes are located near zzso of large zzso and are expressed without zzso in the zzso zzso We have cloned and examined the zzso zzso zzso gene and its upstream expression site associated gene zzso I) which are separated by zzso zzso Within this zzso zzso region is an zzso sequence that serves as a strong promoter for a zzso reporter gene in transient zzso zzso This zzso sequence is similar, but not zzso to the promoter for another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were used to detect zzso synthesis from this zzso promoter in zzso zzso expressing an unrelated zzso We propose that this sequence is a specific promoter for the zzso zzso zzso that occurs in about zzso of the zzso population during the zzso stage of the zzso life zzso
