The complete organization of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the structure of zzso zzso of its zzso zzso region have been zzso This gene spans over 70 zzso and contains 11 zzso The first ten zzso and part of the last zzso zzso the zzso domain of the zzso while the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by the remaining part of the last zzso The gene encodes a zzso zzso acids long zzso contrary to a previous report of zzso zzso zzso zzso extension experiments and zzso chain reaction zzso mapping allowed definition of the zzso initiation site, which is located zzso zzso upstream from the initiation zzso The zzso zzso region is thus unusually zzso The promoter region which is different from the zzso zzso zzso promoter, contains two putative zzso boxes at positions zzso and zzso and a zzso box consensus sequence at position zzso A consensus sequence corresponding to a zzso responsive element is found at position zzso Seven zzso consensus sequences are also found in the zzso zzso region of the zzso Southern zzso experiments demonstrated an zzso zzso zzso within the human zzso zzso gene locus using zzso zzso The cloning of the human zzso gene and the determination of the organization and structure of its zzso zzso region allow the study of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso conditions are described for the direct zzso sequencing of all the zzso of the zzso This information should facilitate the study of pathological zzso of the zzso
