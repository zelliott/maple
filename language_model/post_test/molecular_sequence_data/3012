A zzso gene zzso from a marine zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso consists of a zzso open reading frame that encodes 469 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The domain structure of the zzso zzso consists of a signal zzso of 22 zzso acid zzso followed by a zzso domain which belongs to family 26 of the zzso zzso a zzso region with one array of zzso and six repeats of zzso and a novel zzso module zzso at the C zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso but not other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was capable of binding specifically to zzso The analysis using truncated zzso lacking either the zzso or zzso region indicated that the region zzso the zzso was located between zzso 376 and zzso zzso studies on the zzso revealed that the zzso and the maximum amount of protein bound to zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, comparison of the zzso properties between proteins with and without the zzso strongly indicated that the zzso of zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso
