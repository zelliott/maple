The zzso element zzso in the 3' untranslated region of unstable zzso mediate their rapid zzso ARE binding proteins zzso have been described that either stabilize or otherwise degrade zzso by recruiting the zzso a complex of zzso zzso We have identified zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso that was isolated in association with the ARE of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with the zzso zzso and the human zzso and enhances the zzso and zzso of zzso An alternatively spliced zzso of zzso that localized to the zzso had a more pronounced effect on zzso zzso than full-length zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso is essential for its zzso zzso zzso recognition by zzso may be zzso through its zzso interaction with the zzso zzso and zzso A model is presented to describe the action of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
