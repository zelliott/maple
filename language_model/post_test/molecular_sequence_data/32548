zzso is a zzso protein that plays an important role in the zzso release triggered by action zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso performs its functions through interaction with the zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso complex revealed that zzso binds to zzso core complex in an zzso zzso with its zzso 48 - zzso However, the functions of the zzso sequences are zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that the zzso 71 - 77 of zzso is indispensable for its binding to the zzso zzso Moreover, this interaction can be impaired by abolishing the positive charges in the zzso 71 - 77, which suggests that the positive charges in the zzso 71 - 77 are important for the interaction between zzso II and the zzso zzso
