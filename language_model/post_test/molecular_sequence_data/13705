The growth of zzso methods for the detection of zzso acid from various biological samples reflects recent advances in biotechnology development especially in the areas of zzso infections and cancer zzso The target DNA is detected by zzso techniques derived from Southern's zzso However such zzso based on the use of zzso zzso DNA zzso bring with them the associated problems of handling radioactive zzso In order to overcome these difficulties, a number of zzso detection methods have recently been zzso These new, alternative probe zzso procedures and zzso detection methods are easy to use in routine zzso performed in research laboratories as well as for medical applications, and can reach the level of sensitivity found in classical zzso zzso The techniques investigated include zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso probe zzso The target zzso are transferred onto zzso or nylon zzso and further fixed by heat or zzso zzso zzso zzso on the target DNA is finally revealed by the use of zzso zzso For all these techniques the detection limit is 10 zzso zzso of a zzso zzso target zzso However for the zzso zzso with zzso and with zzso the detection limit drops to zzso zzso of the target zzso In the present paper we shall compare several of these DNA zzso and detection procedures and show that the detection threshold can vary by as much as a factor of 20 from method to zzso This is the first time that various zzso methods for label and detection of DNA are compared and evaluated in order to determine the best zzso
