zzso zzso zzso zzso is a chronic zzso liver disease of unknown zzso and zzso of zzso transport might contribute to its zzso In this study, we aimed to isolate and identify new molecules associated with zzso With zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso patients as zzso we screened the zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso in zzso in normal zzso zzso revealed that the expression of zzso zzso zzso significantly increased in zzso zzso compared with control groups including normal zzso zzso or zzso other than zzso Interestingly, the zzso expression of zzso was correlated with the severity of zzso and zzso acid treatment may significantly improve the recovery of zzso In addition, zzso of zzso was found in zzso of zzso zzso was isolated and analyzed with mass zzso which indicated zzso membrane protein 2 zzso as the zzso Further studies showed that zzso recognized zzso zzso and vice zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited similar zzso pattern and displayed similar zzso zzso Together, the identity of zzso is zzso suggesting that zzso may assist in the differentiation of zzso and predict a poor outcome in patients with zzso 

This manuscript describes the expression of a specific zzso named zzso The zzso recognized by zzso may assist in the differentiation of primary zzso zzso zzso and predict a poor outcome in patients with zzso Through zzso zzso we confirm the identity of zzso as zzso membrane protein 2 zzso The clinical relevance of the manuscript is well regarded since markers are rare and usually not successful for zzso diagnosis and zzso
