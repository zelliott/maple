A new zzso species from pig small zzso has been zzso In an attempt to isolate zzso zzso strains carrying the putative zzso gene zzso for zzso zzso a zzso gene probe was used to screen pig zzso zzso A number of zzso were obtained and primary characterization showed that they were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth occurred at 45 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C and the DNA zzso content was 46 zzso Cell wall analysis together with zzso zzso and analysis of the zzso zzso sequence revealed that the new zzso represent a previously zzso zzso species closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The name zzso zzso is proposed for this species and the type strain is zzso
