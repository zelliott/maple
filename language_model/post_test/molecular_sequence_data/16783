To investigate the use of different molecular analyses that can identify distinct strains of human zzso zzso in zzso fixed and zzso wax embedded archival tissue samples to see whether it is possible to differentiate between the members of the zzso tuberculosis complex zzso zzso M zzso M zzso M zzso or M zzso and/or zzso in a high number of zzso This would be of interest for identifying individual infection traits and zzso by different zzso zzso 

Forty nine archival tissue samples with clinically and/or zzso suspected tuberculosis infection were subjected to molecular DNA zzso 

The molecular analysis revealed the presence of M tuberculosis complex DNA in 20 samples, whereas acid fast zzso could be detected by zzso zzso in only eight zzso All zzso positive samples were further zzso by zzso and seven cases provided M tuberculosis specific signatures, whereas M zzso specific signatures were obtained in four zzso The analysis of zzso zzso and zzso partial gene sequences confirmed the presence of M tuberculosis in six cases and M zzso in one zzso The amplification and sequencing of four further genetic regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso six zzso M tuberculosis strains belonging to genetic groups 2 or zzso 

This study provides clear evidence that archival zzso wax embedded material can be used for further studies on the strain identification of M tuberculosis complex strains and can therefore unequivocally be used for the study of the epidemiology and evolution of tuberculosis zzso
