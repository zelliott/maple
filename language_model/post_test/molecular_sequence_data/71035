zzso zzso is a protein abundant in the zzso central nervous system and in zzso tissue involved in zzso zzso Human zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The protein was zzso in three steps: zzso heat zzso of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso column in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on a zzso column in the presence of zzso The protein was then supplemented with calcium and zzso against neutral zzso The final yield was zzso zzso of zzso homogeneous zzso zzso zzso per liter of bacterial zzso The identity and purity of the protein were confirmed by zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso gel zzso in the absence and presence of calcium and zzso zzso zzso The entire expression and zzso protocol takes only 3 days and is easy to scale up and zzso It was designed to minimize degradation and zzso
