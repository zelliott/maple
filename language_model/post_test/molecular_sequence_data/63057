Some zzso target potentially zzso bacteria by exploiting zzso zzso factors as zzso For example, zzso have been identified that exhibit specificity for zzso capsule producing zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we have characterized the zzso zzso zzso using a number of molecular zzso The absolute requirement for zzso capsule expression for zzso was demonstrated using different zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso particles were shown to have an zzso head and a long zzso tail zzso The zzso is zzso zzso in length with defined zzso and tail regions that exhibit significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso was used to confirm the presence of a number of hypothetical proteins in the zzso zzso E1 particle and demonstrate that a number of zzso proteins are modified zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso E1 is significantly related to other zzso belonging to the same zzso zzso zzso set, and we demonstrate a role for zzso DNA modification in determining host zzso
