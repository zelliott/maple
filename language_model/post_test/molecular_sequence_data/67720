zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso represent a serious threat for wounded and burn zzso Three international zzso zzso clones zzso clone zzso are responsible for a large proportion of zzso infections with zzso zzso but other emerging strains with high epidemic potential also zzso 

We zzso a Multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats zzso analysis zzso protocol and used it to investigate the genetic diversity of 136 zzso zzso from four military hospitals and one zzso zzso zzso zzso other than zzso zzso represented zzso zzso with a majority being zzso zzso The zzso protocol designed for zzso was also efficient to cluster zzso zzso zzso Fifty-five percent of zzso zzso zzso belonged to the two international clones I and II, and we identified new clones which members were found in the different zzso Analysis of two zzso systems helped define two zzso complexes and provided zzso information to help trace back their zzso 

The increasing occurrence of zzso zzso infections in the hospital calls for measures to rapidly characterize the zzso and identify emerging zzso The zzso zzso protocol can be the instrument for such zzso In addition, the investigation of zzso systems may give important keys to understand the evolution of some highly successful zzso zzso
