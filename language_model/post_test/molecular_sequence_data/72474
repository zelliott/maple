From a zzso head zzso library, we isolated 9 zzso zzso each of which encodes a different member of zzso zzso Seven of them zzso have more than zzso zzso acid identity to the corresponding members of zzso zzso zzso The other two proteins zzso and 4) show low sequence similarity to any of the known zzso zzso However, both contain all zzso acids zzso in known zzso In addition, zzso has strong zzso activity, when zzso in zzso coli zzso These results indicate that zzso are novel members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also supported this zzso
