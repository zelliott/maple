zzso zzso is not random along zzso rather, there are preferred regions for initiation called zzso Although the general properties of zzso hotspots are known, the requirements at the DNA sequence level for the determination of hotspot activity are still zzso The sequence of six known hotspots in zzso zzso was compared to identify a common zzso region zzso They reported that the locations of zzso sequences zzso to mapped zzso break zzso sites along three zzso zzso III, zzso We report here that a deletion of zzso at zzso a hotspot used to identify the zzso has no significant effect on zzso In the absence of zzso zzso formation occurs at a high frequency and at the same sequences as in zzso zzso In cases where the deletion of sequences containing the zzso motif has been shown to reduce zzso we propose that it may be a reflection of the location of the zzso rather than the loss of zzso per zzso
