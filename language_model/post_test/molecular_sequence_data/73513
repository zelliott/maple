A main structure of the zzso zzso tail is a structure known as the outer dense fibers whose molecular composition as well as their function are still mostly zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of new zzso zzso that identifies a highly variable gene locus zzso outer dense fiber zzso zzso of zzso is restricted to zzso and more specifically to round zzso zzso starts in step 6 zzso which zzso with zzso of the major outer dense fiber protein gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 45, zzso and with the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified isolated outer dense fibers zzso and detected at least three protein bands in the molecular mass range of zzso to 70,000 Da in total zzso protein zzso zzso of several protein bands zzso with the presence of several transcripts and the isolation of slightly different zzso zzso whereas Southern zzso zzso does not indicate the presence of multiple zzso Computer analyses of the structure of the zzso zzso protein revealed an overall zzso structure with two regions identical to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso
