zzso are considered as important animal reservoirs for many zzso viruses to zzso The viral zzso analysis was performed to study gut and lung zzso of 30 zzso bats collected in Yunnan Province and 26 reads were noted to group A zzso zzso Further zzso screening on bat samples and in zzso viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel zzso named as zzso in one of 30 zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene of this strain zzso was closely related to that of an zzso zzso strain from Argentina and the zzso sequence similarity was zzso while its zzso gene was a rare zzso type and obtained the maximum sequence identity zzso with that of a human strain from zzso The present study highlights the potential role of bats as reservoirs for zzso
