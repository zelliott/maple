Despite the negative impact that many zzso larvae have on zzso very little attention has been paid to their zzso Their often extremely similar zzso characteristics have probably contributed to this zzso which has also meant that they are very difficult to identify in the zzso zzso methods can overcome this challenge and are particularly useful for the identification of larvae to enable management of zzso species occurring zzso with zzso zzso However, the invasive collection of DNA samples for such molecular methods is not compatible with subsequent zzso zzso or fitness zzso Two zzso DNA sampling and DNA analysis methods suitable for the identification of larvae from closely related zzso species were developed zzso Using the zzso and zzso zzso as sources of DNA, zzso larvae of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by multiplex zzso based on the difference in size of the resulting zzso zzso This study also showed that small quantities of zzso can be used reliably even 7 days after zzso This stability of the DNA is of major importance in ecological studies where zzso rarely allow daily zzso The approach developed here is readily zzso to the study of any zzso insect species for which zzso identification of zzso stages is zzso
