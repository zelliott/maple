Previously we have shown that two members of the newly named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso bone zzso and zzso bound first to a cell surface zzso and then to complement Factor H thereby blocking the zzso activity of the alternative zzso of zzso Another member of this family, zzso zzso protein 1, is shown in this paper to be very similar to zzso in that it can bind strongly to Factor H zzso approximately 1 zzso and block the zzso activity through either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of Factor H to zzso localized to the cells surface was demonstrated by zzso cell zzso zzso overlapping zzso analyses suggests that both zzso zzso protein 1 and zzso interact with cell surface zzso through their zzso zzso Similar fragments of bone zzso like the intact zzso did not functionally interact with zzso All three proteins are shown to act in conjunction with Factor I, a serum zzso that, when zzso to appropriate zzso stops the zzso zzso by digesting the bound zzso in a series of zzso zzso These results show that at least three members of this family zzso membrane zzso zzso activity zzso or zzso upon cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso The required order of the assembly of the complex suggests that this zzso activity is limited to short zzso zzso
