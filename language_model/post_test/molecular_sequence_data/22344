A potential role in zzso bond formation in the zzso proteins of zzso organisms has recently been attributed to a new family of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Members of this family are characterized by a molecular mass of about zzso and by two zzso zzso each zzso a zzso active site zzso We report on the functional and structural characterization of a new member of this family, which was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed the high zzso efficiency of this zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have suggested that its two active sites have similar functional properties, zzso that each of them zzso partial activity to the zzso This similarity was confirmed by the analysis of the zzso crystal structure, which points to similar geometrical parameters and zzso zzso for the two active zzso The results demonstrated that zzso is the most zzso of all zzso proteins so far zzso Thus, further experimental studies on this zzso are likely to provide important information on the zzso zzso
