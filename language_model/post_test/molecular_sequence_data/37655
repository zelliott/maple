zzso restriction zzso of the zzso repeat unit of the German zzso zzso zzso reveal significant zzso sequence zzso This zzso is probably caused by structural differences within the zzso zzso regions zzso of the zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in three zzso strains show that individuals from different populations may have different zzso zzso patterns, whereas individuals within populations exhibit relatively similar zzso zzso We suggest that zzso restriction zzso zzso within zzso zzso DNA will be a valuable tool for measuring zzso parameters within and between natural zzso zzso
