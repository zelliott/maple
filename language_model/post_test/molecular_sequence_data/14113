Major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso presentation normally requires a protein zzso to be zzso in the zzso of the zzso presenting cell zzso zzso protein zzso could gain access to the class I presentation zzso if the protein is introduced into the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso which release the protein zzso from zzso zzso have been employed to deliver protein zzso for the recognition by class zzso zzso T zzso zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An alternative approach is to deliver a gene that encodes the protein zzso In this case, the zzso is zzso with a gene which zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of protein zzso targeted for zzso induction in zzso follows a different strategy and generally requires an zzso carrier of zzso nature, such as zzso zzso complexes, and/or zzso zzso zzso that are responsible for scavenging the zzso play an important role in zzso zzso An optimal zzso zzso vaccine must contain other zzso activities in addition to its activity in delivering zzso to the class I zzso Attempts to zzso viral infection and to improve zzso immunity have been successful by delivering the zzso zzso zzso in zzso These animal model studies should be of great value in the development of potential vaccine zzso
