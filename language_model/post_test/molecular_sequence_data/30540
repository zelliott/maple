We have cloned and zzso a zzso of zzso base pairs in length zzso the 275 zzso acids of zzso 33, the third largest zzso of human zzso zzso zzso The DNA was isolated by screening of a human zzso zzso zzso library with zzso designed on the basis of the zzso acid zzso analysis of the bovine zzso The zzso 33 zzso acid sequence is highly zzso between zzso zzso and zzso Overall, zzso of the zzso acid zzso are identical with the zzso zzso zzso 3, and zzso of the zzso acids are identical in the two major zzso regions at zzso zzso and zzso zzso 33 is also zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso 33 showed no obvious zzso with bacterial zzso zzso or with any of its zzso zzso
