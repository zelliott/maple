The role of zzso as zzso cells zzso for other T cells was zzso zzso zzso human zzso clones were shown to present zzso to class II major zzso complex zzso T cells of a different fine zzso resulting in zzso production and cell zzso Furthermore, zzso and activated zzso T cells could produce zzso and zzso as a result of the addition of zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The functional response of T cells to zzso in the absence of zzso was amplified by the addition of zzso zzso zzso and was inhibited with zzso specific to class II zzso or to the zzso zzso zzso performed in zzso suspension cultures using zzso medium prepared with zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso responses to zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso require the interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules with class II zzso complexes on different cell surfaces zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso which occurs by the binding of zzso with class II zzso complexes on the same cell surface (at the zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso high expression of surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso without proliferation or zzso zzso a pattern observed in the induction of zzso zzso by zzso The results are discussed in terms of the role of class II zzso molecules on activated zzso which enable these cells to function as zzso zzso in the development of zzso regulatory zzso
