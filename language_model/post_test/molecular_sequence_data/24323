zzso v 5 is one of three major zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso v 1), zzso zzso v zzso and zzso 5 zzso v zzso zzso v 5 is related by high zzso acid sequence identity to zzso proteins including proteins from zzso zzso insects, zzso and zzso The crystal structure of zzso v 5 has been solved and refined to a resolution of zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso between the zzso proteins can be rationalized in terms of hydrogen bonding patterns and zzso interactions defining an zzso sandwich core zzso A small number of consensus zzso are zzso exposed (including two adjacent zzso and located in an zzso cavity that forms a putative active zzso The site has no structural resemblance to previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso from a large number of different yellow zzso zzso and paper zzso are known and patients show varying zzso of zzso to the related zzso zzso The structure of zzso v 5 allows a detailed analysis of the zzso that may participate in zzso zzso findings that are useful for the development of a vaccine for treatment of insect zzso
