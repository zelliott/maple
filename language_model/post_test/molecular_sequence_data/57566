The zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that is needed for synthesis of green zzso zzso We subjected the zzso zzso zzso region to zzso analysis in zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify DNA sequence elements involved in its zzso control, and identified two functionally distinct zzso zzso I contained potential zzso binding sites and was required for full level zzso transcription, but not for zzso regulation in the presence of element zzso zzso II contained putative zzso binding sites zzso a zzso element and was sufficient for zzso regulation of zzso zzso of the zzso binding sites eliminated zzso regulation, whereas zzso of the zzso element led to elevated levels of zzso zzso II was also sufficient to induce zzso in zzso zzso when the zzso zzso regulatory gene zzso was expressed from the zzso zzso As zzso and zzso possess similar DNA binding zzso the zzso interaction in zzso is probably zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a direct zzso of zzso but zzso regulation may also involve interactions with zzso and a member of the zzso class of DNA binding zzso
