Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of zzso regulation of the zzso zzso however, studies suggest that it consists of a complex feedback loop that involves multiple mechanisms acting at both the level of the zzso and the zzso In the present study, we address zzso regulation of the zzso gene in immortalized zzso cells and investigate the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Using transient zzso zzso in the zzso mouse zzso cell line, zzso we demonstrate that zzso stimulate expression of an zzso zzso reporter gene in a zzso zzso zzso of either of two zzso zzso response elements at zzso and zzso within the zzso region of the zzso zzso gene promoter zzso this zzso and zzso zzso binds directly to the zzso ARE in zzso zzso induction of the zzso reporter gene is also dependent upon the zzso zzso loop present in the zzso cells, as well as an zzso element at zzso of the zzso zzso However, zzso regulation of other genes remains unaffected by zzso In addition, zzso stimulate expression of a mouse zzso zzso reporter zzso and thus may indirectly augment the response of the zzso gene to zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in mouse zzso zzso act directly on the zzso zzso gene to stimulate expression by a mechanism that is dependent upon zzso as well as acting zzso potentially through a second mechanism that may be dependent upon induction of zzso zzso
