We have isolated zzso and zzso clones after transformation by zzso virus zzso of human fetal bone zzso cells between weeks 8 and 13 of zzso These clones were characterized for zzso zzso chain zzso the status zzso versus germ line) of the heavy zzso chain, zzso and zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso transcripts by using specific variable zzso zzso V zzso and V zzso zzso covering the almost complete zzso zzso zzso B cells could already be identified in the zzso bone zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso being zzso Nevertheless, at this stage, most of the clones had zzso characteristics of zzso cells, as indicated by the presence of zzso transcripts zzso functional or zzso in the absence of L zzso The zzso of gene zzso were compatible with the classical scheme zzso A rapid expansion of the expressed repertoire occurred between the weeks 8 and 11, with zzso of the zzso clones having the characteristics of mature B zzso V gene family usage was analyzed for the three zzso and compared with the pattern of expression observed at 30 weeks of gestation and in adult zzso The zzso pattern was rapidly acquired for the H and zzso zzso with the major zzso being zzso and V zzso zzso When the expression of the repertoire was zzso the pattern of V usage correlated fairly well with the estimated number of zzso zzso but differed noticeably for the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and V zzso zzso are not regulated by similar zzso
