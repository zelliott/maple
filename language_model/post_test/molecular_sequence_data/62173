The zzso zzso was found repeated 15 times in tandem on the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso strain zzso The corresponding region was zzso by zzso from 54 clinical strains belonging to the same zzso and zzso and others from this laboratory collection belonging to different zzso and zzso Each strain produced a single amplification product whose size was variable among zzso revealing that the locus was zzso zzso sequence determination of selected zzso products showed that the zzso was due to the precise expansion or reduction in the number of zzso zzso Analysis of this locus in a few strains showing the same zzso pattern showed that it was also zzso These results suggest that this method could be valuable to increase the zzso power of current zzso zzso typing zzso
