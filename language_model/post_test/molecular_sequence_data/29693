The zzso of zzso infections has increased dramatically, which has necessitated additional and prolonged use of the available zzso zzso Increased resistance to the commonly used zzso agents, primarily the zzso has been reported, thus zzso the discovery and development of compounds that would be effective against the major human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has proved to be a fertile area for zzso development, and steps which might provide good targets for novel zzso development zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso could be an effective target for drug development since the zzso zzso zzso of zzso have been successful in agricultural zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso has been isolated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Both copies of the zzso zzso zzso gene have been disrupted by using short zzso regions of the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene was not required for growth, but zzso zzso showed several altered zzso They were demonstrated to be slowly growing, with doubling times at least twice that of the wild zzso They were also shown to be significantly more sensitive to an zzso zzso and to selected cellular zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also slightly resistant to the zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso were shown to be significantly less zzso in a mouse model system and failed to produce germ tubes upon incubation in human zzso On the basis of these zzso zzso of zzso would be effective against zzso zzso
