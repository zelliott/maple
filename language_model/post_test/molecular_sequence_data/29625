Cancer of the zzso zzso is still the leading cause of death among women with cancer in developing zzso Although infections with human zzso are necessary, other molecular zzso that are needed at the cellular level for development of these tumors remain largely zzso zzso is a key regulator located within the zzso signaling cascade whose zzso constitute an important event in colon zzso In many zzso increased levels of the zzso protein have been found, associated with its nuclear and/or zzso zzso To search for possible zzso of this zzso we examined the expression and zzso of the zzso protein in tumors from the zzso zzso and cell lines derived from zzso zzso was found accumulated in the zzso and/or zzso of 12 out of 32 zzso In zzso increased levels of this protein were observed in 9 out of 20 tumors zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis showed no zzso in zzso 3, 4 and 6 of the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso of zzso are frequent in these tumors and suggest that they may play an important role in the development of cancer of the zzso zzso They also indicate that higher protein levels and abnormal zzso may result from several different zzso
