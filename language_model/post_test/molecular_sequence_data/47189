zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso has zzso and zzso zzso zzso rapidly increases zzso expression by zzso through zzso zzso A minimal DNA sequence required for zzso and zzso zzso promoter activity spans zzso to zzso zzso This region zzso a functional zzso box and contains E box, zzso zzso protein zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factor related binding zzso In this study we compared minimal promoter sequences of zzso to zzso zzso without or with zzso in each potential regulatory element, by reporter gene expression and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso of the E zzso element reduced zzso promoter activity by 50% and eliminated the zzso zzso effect of zzso In contrast, zzso in the zzso or zzso elements also reduced zzso promoter activity without fully eliminating the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity, and this effect was eliminated by mutating the zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso site or zzso of zzso did not correlate with zzso or zzso promoter zzso By zzso mobility shift zzso prominent gel shift complexes occurred with zzso nuclear extracts and zzso zzso spanning the E zzso zzso and zzso zzso These gel shift complexes were depleted by specific binding site zzso and were enhanced by zzso Increased binding by extracts from zzso cultures was blocked by zzso zzso These results identify several elements as integral binding sequences for both zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso They further reveal that multiple sequences within this cluster form a basic zzso unit where nuclear factors can accumulate in a protein zzso way and enhance zzso expression by zzso in response to zzso
