Two zzso libraries were prepared from zzso of normal and zzso zzso black tiger shrimp zzso zzso A total of zzso expressed sequence tag zzso clones were zzso zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso were zzso They predominated among zzso zzso representing zzso and zzso of the normal and challenged libraries, zzso Several types of each zzso zzso were zzso zzso alignments of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 1 to 5) implied possible alternative zzso of different zzso at both zzso and zzso Only one major type of zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso to 4) and a newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso were also isolated and zzso Using zzso analysis, expression of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts was detected in various zzso but the main expression site was in zzso zzso of these zzso peptides in zzso zzso subjected to zzso zzso challenge revealed a significant increase in expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso but a decrease in expression of zzso and zzso
