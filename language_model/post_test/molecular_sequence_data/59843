We have estimated the synthesis rates in zzso of precursor and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in newborn pigs fed with water or zzso for zzso post zzso At the end of the feeding period, zzso were zzso and infused zzso for zzso with zzso zzso Blood and zzso samples were collected at timed zzso The precursor and zzso forms of zzso were isolated from zzso zzso by zzso followed by zzso and their specific zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of precursor and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by using a linear zzso zzso zzso zzso protein consisted of five zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso complex zzso zzso precursor zzso intermediate complex zzso zzso precursor zzso and two forms of zzso zzso The fractional synthesis rate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were the same in the two groups but the absolute synthesis rate (in arbitrary units, zzso of zzso in the zzso animals was twice that of the zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso were significantly different zzso zzso zzso zzso but the absolute synthesis rates did not zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was not different between experimental treatment groups (on average zzso However, the proportion of newly zzso zzso processed to zzso zzso was zzso lower in zzso than in zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso stimulates the synthesis of zzso but, at least temporarily, zzso the processing of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
