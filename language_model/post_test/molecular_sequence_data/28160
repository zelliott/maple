The human zzso gene was isolated on the basis of its ability to complement the zzso of the zzso cell cycle zzso zzso which is blocked in zzso at the zzso zzso This gene has now been identified as the structural gene for zzso zzso zzso on the bases of sequence zzso and the ability of zzso zzso to bypass the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a size of about 2 zzso and is induced in zzso phase in human, zzso and zzso cell zzso We have studied the organization and regulation of expression of the zzso zzso The human zzso gene consists of 13 zzso (the first two zzso zzso in a region of about 21 zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso using the bacterial zzso zzso reporter gene identified two separate zzso one zzso zzso contained in a zzso region upstream of the first zzso and the other zzso zzso contained in the first zzso zzso zzso produced about zzso more zzso zzso activity than did zzso zzso and had features of the promoters of zzso zzso high G + C content, multiple zzso start sites, absence of a zzso box, and presence of putative zzso binding zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso sequence and other elements characteristic of a promoter, but so far we have no evidence of its zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso in zzso cells exposed to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the culture medium led to a drastic decrease in zzso levels and prevented zzso induction in zzso cells, which indicated that expression of the AS gene is regulated by a mechanism of end product zzso
