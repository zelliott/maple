The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is implicated in T cell maturation and zzso In zzso the zzso of the zzso gene is regulated by two independent zzso the zzso promoter, which is active in zzso and the zzso promoter, which dominates in mature T zzso In the human and mouse zzso gene zzso the two promoter elements are separated by at least 40 zzso and 10 zzso zzso In this study, we have cloned and zzso 60 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The promoter region of the zzso zzso spans only zzso zzso and contains a zzso and a zzso promoter in the zzso region adjacent to the coding zzso By generating transgenic mice, we have demonstrated that the compact promoter of the zzso zzso contains regulatory elements that direct expression to zzso zzso of zzso We were able to zzso the regulatory elements to a short region of 830 zzso without losing specificity to cultured human T cell zzso These results show that the basic mechanisms that mediate zzso expression are zzso between zzso and zzso The short promoter of the zzso zzso isolated by us offers a powerful tool for labeling T cells, targeting zzso and manipulating T cell activity in zzso as well as in zzso
