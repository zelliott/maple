zzso is a zzso hypothetical protein from zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso A sequence comparison with its zzso suggested that zzso is a distinct protein from zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Here we report the zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by the zzso anomalous zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure consists of seven zzso zzso and one short zzso The crystal structure and the zzso zzso revealed that zzso forms a zzso ring structure in zzso The zzso potential distribution on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso showed that positively charged regions exist on the side of the ring structure, suggesting that zzso interacts with some zzso charged zzso A structural zzso search revealed that the structure of three zzso zzso is remarkably zzso suggesting that it is the common structural motif for the zzso family zzso In addition, the nine zzso of the zzso tag bound to the zzso region between zzso and zzso in chains A and B of zzso zzso that this region is the putative zzso site for some small zzso
