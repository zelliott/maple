zzso binding protein C zzso is a zzso accessory protein of zzso muscle zzso Three zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso play a crucial role in maintaining and modulating zzso zzso The cardiac zzso has an additional zzso domain zzso that is zzso to provide a greater level of regulatory control in cardiac zzso We have used zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso shape restoration, and zzso modeling to determine the average shape and spatial arrangement of the four zzso zzso of cardiac zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that is analogous to the zzso of the skeletal zzso zzso We found that the zzso of both proteins are zzso arranged in a highly extended zzso that is sufficiently long to span the zzso zzso distances in zzso and, zzso be poised to zzso these zzso The average spatial organization of the zzso zzso and C2 zzso is not significantly zzso by the removal of the zzso zzso domain, suggesting that the zzso zzso while relatively small in area, have a degree of zzso Modeling the zzso and zzso scattering data reveals that the structures of the zzso and m zzso (also referred to as the zzso zzso are compact and have dimensions that are consistent with the zzso fold zzso of zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso and circular zzso experiments support the conclusion that the previously zzso structures of these zzso can be characterized as having an zzso zzso Atomic models using the known zzso structures for C1 and C2 as well as zzso models for the zzso and m zzso provide insights into the placement of zzso zzso zzso of the m domain that are zzso in zzso and cause a change in muscle fiber contraction by abolishing interactions with zzso
