The zzso of the zzso C virus directs the synthesis of a single zzso which is zzso zzso into at least nine functional zzso The zzso portion of the zzso forms the structural zzso while the zzso region constitutes a variety of viral zzso The zzso 3 zzso zzso consisting of zzso acids zzso of the zzso is believed to be a zzso protein with an zzso zzso zzso domain, which is involved in zzso processing, and a zzso zzso zzso domain, presumably involved in viral zzso We have assembled an expression zzso which directs the synthesis of zzso zzso of the zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso This portion of the zzso protein contains the putative zzso zzso The protein has been zzso to yield zzso zzso of zzso active protein per liter of zzso The zzso zzso protein has both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is the preferred zzso for the zzso zzso is also zzso however, zzso is a very poor zzso and zzso is not zzso The zzso zzso activity is dependent on zzso and zzso zzso Either zzso or zzso can serve as the zzso zzso
