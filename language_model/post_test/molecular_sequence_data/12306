zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variation at a high rate, and this variation can be monitored by changes in a zzso ability to bind zzso zzso zzso We report here the cloning and identification of a zzso zzso that can mediate this zzso The DNA sequence of zzso has been determined for zzso zzso zzso a strain that expresses a zzso zzso and a zzso of this strain, zzso that produces a truncated zzso In the parental strain, zzso contains a string of 12 zzso in the middle of its coding zzso In cells that had zzso varied to produce a truncated zzso the number of zzso in zzso was zzso zzso deletions were constructed to verify that expression of a zzso LOS is due to zzso in zzso
