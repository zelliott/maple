The gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso zzso A complex of the zzso protein with a zzso analog has been zzso and its structure solved by multiple anomalous zzso using phase information obtained from a single crystal of zzso zzso The zzso folds into a zzso zzso zzso flanked on one side by two zzso and on the other by three consecutive zzso giving a novel zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of a zzso complex has been refined at zzso A zzso The location of the zzso analog and a zzso zzso gives important insight into the molecular mechanism of the zzso
