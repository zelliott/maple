New methods for zzso both zzso and plasma forms of the zzso collagen zzso zzso VI zzso in experimental models or human clinical samples, and the development of the first therapeutic compounds based on zzso soluble zzso or zzso zzso zzso coincide with increased understanding of the potential zzso role of zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso not only mediates zzso zzso at the site of vascular injury where collagen is exposed, but is also implicated in the zzso of other diseases, such as zzso and zzso zzso arthritis and zzso zzso Here, we describe some of the critical mechanisms for generating soluble zzso from zzso and future avenues for exploiting this unique zzso zzso for diagnosis and/or disease zzso
