zzso zzso factor, zzso is a zinc finger zzso shown to be essential for embryonic zzso zzso knockout mouse zzso for zzso die in zzso at day 14 of zzso due to liver zzso In the present study, we report the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequence similarity with that of zzso human, fish and zzso The size of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and the coding region zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The putative zinc finger and zzso zzso comprised by zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso shows high identity of 97, 93, 93 and zzso in the DNA binding zinc finger domain and 51, 44, 48 and zzso overall identity with zzso human, mouse and zzso zzso zzso results show the maternal expression of zzso zzso The pattern of zzso gene expression during embryonic and early zzso development was studied by zzso in zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ubiquitous expression was observed during the embryonic stages zzso specific zzso especially in the neural parts, was observed throughout the stages studied after zzso
