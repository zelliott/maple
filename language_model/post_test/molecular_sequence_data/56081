Human zzso zzso and zzso cells differentiate into neural cells on treatment with zzso Here we report that in association with differentiation induced by zzso the zzso of zzso was activated in both zzso cell zzso An zzso zzso factor was also found to be produced in association with the neural cell differentiation of these zzso These results suggest that, during differentiation of neural cells, an zzso zzso factor was produced, and that when the neural cells are infected with zzso the production of zzso B results in zzso of zzso of zzso Thus this zzso zzso factor may be involved in the mechanism causing AIDS zzso
