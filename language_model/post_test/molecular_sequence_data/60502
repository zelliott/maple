zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein characterized by a zzso and zzso domain referred to as the zzso zzso Despite the pivotal role of this zzso only the zzso box region has been zzso through evolution, suggesting that zzso function depends solely on the zzso box and therefore acts as an architectural zzso zzso In mice zzso zzso zzso also includes a large zzso zzso repeat region zzso a zzso zzso domain that acts as a zzso zzso in zzso The absence of this or any other potential zzso domain in other zzso however, has raised doubts as to its biological zzso To test directly whether the zzso region is required for zzso function in zzso we created zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and tested their ability to induce zzso formation in zzso zzso using a transgenic mouse zzso zzso zzso that zzso proteins lacking the zzso region were unable to effect male sex determination, in contrast to their zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso repeat domain of the mouse zzso protein has an essential role in sex determination in zzso and that zzso may act via a fundamentally different zzso mechanism in mice compared with other zzso
