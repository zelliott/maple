We characterized two new zzso A resistance genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso which was selected from 79 zzso zzso zzso lacking known genes zzso zzso A zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso contained two open reading frames carrying resistance genes related to zzso A, zzso genes for an zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The first open reading frame comprised zzso zzso zzso 216 zzso acids with a predicted left-handed parallel zzso domain zzso this new gene was designated zzso zzso The second open reading frame consisted of zzso zzso zzso 525 zzso acids with two predicted zzso binding cassette zzso comprised of Walker A, Walker B, and zzso zzso this gene was designated zzso zzso is located 65 zzso upstream from zzso zzso was detected together with zzso zzso in 12 of 179 zzso zzso zzso zzso and was located on the same zzso Also, the zzso zzso zzso which was observed in zzso was detected in nine zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by Southern zzso zzso it was expected that these two genes were strongly correlated with each other and that they may be composed of a zzso zzso zzso is the first identified ABC zzso zzso resistance to zzso A in zzso zzso zzso gel zzso patterns and sequence types of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differed for zzso from humans and zzso
