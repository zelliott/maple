The biological process of differentiation - from a zzso egg to a human being - is a consecutive mechanism that leads to the establishment of zzso gene zzso but also to a coordinated zzso of all those genes that are not necessary for a given cell zzso This process is accompanied by zzso modifications of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also termed the zzso zzso All zzso processes are zzso by protein complexes that either mediate specific DNA zzso patterns, or modify zzso proteins in a zzso fashion zzso zzso zzso and zzso One important player involved in zzso is the zzso protein which represents a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene gained much attention because of its frequent genetic zzso thereby creating zzso zzso fusion genes that cause acute leukemia in pediatric and adult zzso This article is zzso certain functional aspects about zzso but is mainly emphasizing on an alternative zzso event within the zzso zzso This changes the biological properties of the zzso zzso thereby influencing its ability of being either a zzso zzso or zzso
