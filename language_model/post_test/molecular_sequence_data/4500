We have developed a zzso display technique for the mapping of zzso interaction sites and characterized the interaction between the zzso zzso product and its zzso zzso zzso DNA segments of the zzso gene were cloned into a modified zzso which allowed for expression in all possible reading zzso The zzso encompassing all functional zzso of the protein was zzso as zzso and screened with different bait zzso zzso of the sequences revealed that the zzso acids zzso of zzso interact with the zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso interaction of the zzso zzso DNA binding domain with the zzso zzso acids zzso could be zzso
