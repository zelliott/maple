zzso zzso zzso has been directly zzso with zzso using zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso fragments obtained from partial zzso or zzso zzso zzso indicate that two different zzso are zzso One site, on a Mr zzso 36,000 zzso zzso located near the zzso zzso has characteristics consistent with it being close to or part of the zzso site of the zzso This zzso contains a region of sequence that is highly zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been zzso to contain the zzso domain of the zzso The other site, on a Mr zzso 28,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso located near the middle of the zzso probably makes up part of the zzso site of the zzso zzso of the zzso is concentration dependent and zzso analysis of labeling yields a zzso plot with apparent half labeling zzso of about 1 and 30 zzso consistent with two types of sites being zzso Limited zzso of the zzso by zzso yields five prominent fragments that separate by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso at Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both the Mr zzso 60,000 and 57,000 apparently have blocked zzso zzso suggesting that the Mr zzso 57,000 zzso is a zzso of the Mr zzso 60,000 zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates that both the Mr zzso zzso and 17,000 fragments are zzso of the Mr zzso 36,000 zzso zzso of zzso then partially zzso zzso show labeled bands at Mr zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 5 zzso zzso prior to zzso eliminates zzso of the Mr zzso 36,000 zzso but not the Mr zzso 60,000 or 57,000 zzso The labeled site not blocked by zzso is also contained in a Mr zzso 28,000 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso that does not overlap with the Mr zzso 36,000 zzso zzso Limited zzso zzso also increases zzso activity and eliminates zzso stimulation of zzso zzso The zzso fragments can be separated by either zzso exchange high performance liquid zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso removes the Mr zzso 60,000 and 57,000 labeled fragments and any intact, zzso protein but does not remove the Mr zzso 36,000 zzso or the majority of zzso Ion exchange zzso separates the fragments into three zzso zzso II, and zzso zzso I and II contain activity of approximately 40 and 100 zzso zzso Peak II is the zzso or slightly zzso native zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
