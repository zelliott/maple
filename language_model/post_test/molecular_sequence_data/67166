Cystic zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso a member of the ABC zzso binding zzso zzso family, is a zzso channel whose activity is controlled by protein zzso zzso Opening and closing zzso of the zzso zzso is coupled to zzso binding and zzso at zzso two zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso Recent studies present evidence that the open channel zzso reflects a zzso zzso of zzso two zzso as seen in the zzso of other ABC zzso zzso et zzso zzso Whether these two zzso binding sites play an equivalent role in the dynamics of zzso zzso and thus in gating zzso channels, remains zzso Based on the crystal structures of zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso we have identified two critical aromatic zzso acids zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso that coordinate the zzso ring of the bound zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso has little effect on the sensitivity of the opening rate to zzso but the same zzso at the zzso zzso dramatically lowers the apparent affinity for zzso by zzso suggesting distinct roles of these two zzso binding sites in channel zzso The zzso zzso however, shortens the open time zzso zzso analysis of our data suggests that the free energy of zzso binding at zzso but not at zzso contributes significantly to the zzso of the open zzso This kinetic and energetic asymmetry of zzso two zzso suggests an zzso motion of the zzso during channel zzso Opening of the channel is initiated by zzso binding at the zzso site, whereas separation of the zzso zzso at the zzso site constitutes the zzso step in channel zzso
