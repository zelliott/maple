A new method for isolation and characterization of peptides presented in the context of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso class I zzso zzso was zzso A combination of different zzso steps coupled with zzso mass zzso allowed us to detect the presence of small amounts of a naturally processed human zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso cells of from zzso cell zzso The zzso sequence was confirmed by tandem mass zzso zzso This approach provides a versatile and sensitive method for direct identification of zzso class zzso peptides that might be derive from different pathogen or zzso zzso
