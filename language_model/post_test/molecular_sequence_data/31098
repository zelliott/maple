A partial zzso clone for mouse zzso was isolated by use of a rat zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso was then used to isolate zzso clones that corresponded to the two mouse genes detected in Southern zzso One gene zzso an open reading frame for the zzso of rat zzso and this gene was notable for the absence of zzso within the coding zzso A lack of zzso has previously been observed for the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rosen, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The other mouse gene was an zzso zzso for a zzso zzso The presence of only one functional gene that lacked zzso zzso established that molecular zzso in mouse zzso could not arise from multiple genes or alternative zzso of zzso The sequence of mouse zzso suggested an zzso segment with a high content of zzso zzso as is the case in the rat and zzso In addition the mouse zzso had one possible zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of 124 zzso acids was highly zzso between zzso and human zzso for the functional genes but not for the zzso This suggests an important functional role for the zzso zzso
