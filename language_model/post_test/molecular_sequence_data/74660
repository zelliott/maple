To date, studies conducted on cone snail zzso have attributed the origins of this complex mixture of zzso peptides entirely to gene expression by the zzso cells lining the zzso of the zzso zzso However, specialized zzso such as the zzso zzso also zzso their contents into the anterior gut and could potentially contribute some zzso components injected into target zzso evidence supporting this possibility is reported zzso zzso analysis of a zzso library created from a zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed the expression of two transcripts whose predicted gene products, after zzso processing, zzso resemble mature zzso belonging to the zzso zzso These two zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso mature peptides containing the zzso zzso zzso pattern zzso but the highly zzso zzso signal sequences were not zzso Analysis of zzso members expressed in the zzso duct of the same zzso zzso specimens revealed three putative zzso zzso the zzso zzso transcripts were not found in the zzso duct zzso library, suggesting that these zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso gene products by the zzso zzso could potentially add to the complexity of zzso zzso
