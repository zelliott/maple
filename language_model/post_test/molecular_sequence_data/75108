The Philadelphia zzso zzso is a zzso between zzso 9 and 22 that is found in chronic zzso leukemia zzso and a subset of acute zzso leukemia patients zzso In zzso this results in the expression of a zzso zzso zzso transcript that encodes the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in ALL expresses a distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso Since the expression of different zzso products may play a role in the distinctive presentation of zzso ALL versus zzso it is necessary to understand the molecular basis for the expression of zzso Both zzso and zzso are recognized by an zzso directed to zzso zzso in the zzso region of both zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to the zzso junction in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso sequence analysis of complementary DNA clones made from zzso from the zzso ALL zzso cell line, and zzso zzso protection analysis confirmed the presence of zzso zzso transcripts in zzso ALL zzso In zzso zzso zzso sequences were joined to zzso sequences approximately zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso represents the product of a zzso fusion gene in zzso ALL that is distinct from the zzso fusion gene of zzso
