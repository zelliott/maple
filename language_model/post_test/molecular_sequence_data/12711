By means of zzso sequencing, and zzso in zzso zzso we have determined that the zzso satellite DNA family is zzso in the 10 zzso species analyzed zzso Its zzso its zzso location at the zzso of each zzso and its structural features could make this satellite DNA family an important structural and/or functional element of the zzso of these zzso zzso units of this satellite DNA have a consensus length of zzso zzso Its sequence is characterized by a high AT content and the presence of short runs of consecutive AT base zzso These zzso zzso repeats also contain three to four copies, depending on the species, of a short sequence reflecting the repetitive zzso and subsequent divergence of an ancestral zzso sequence in this zzso This sequence motive is zzso in some parts of the zzso units of the different species studied at the same positions, and, precisely, surrounding the area in which the zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso sequence motive is similar to other zzso sequences of the zzso satellite zzso of other zzso including those of zzso and zzso
