The majority of antibiotics currently used to treat zzso zzso zzso zzso infections target bacterial cell wall synthesis or protein zzso Only zzso has a novel mode of zzso zzso on limited targets for zzso chemotherapy, has contributed to zzso zzso Two alternative approaches to the treatment of zzso infection, particularly those caused by zzso that have alternative mechanisms of action and that address the challenge of zzso resistance are zzso host zzso peptides and agents that target zzso zzso zzso host zzso peptides have multiple mechanisms of action and are less likely than conventional agents to select resistant zzso They are amenable to modifications that improve their stability, effectiveness and zzso Some zzso zzso peptides such as zzso zzso and zzso have potent in zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso agents also have potential to limit the zzso of zzso These are generally small molecules that inhibit zzso targets in zzso without killing the zzso and therefore have limited capacity to promote resistance zzso Potential zzso targets include the zzso zzso system, the accessory gene regulator zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these targets have been identified and these may have potential for further zzso
