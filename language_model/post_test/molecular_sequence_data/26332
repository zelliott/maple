The effects of zzso injections of zzso II, a novel zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso levels in the rat zzso were studied using in zzso zzso The ability of zzso II to inhibit zzso substance P or zzso A stimulation of zzso zzso levels was also zzso A unilateral injection (all substances were injected in a volume of zzso zzso of zzso II zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso rats produced a zzso decrease in zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels showed no change after zzso zzso A unilateral injection of substance P zzso zzso into the zzso produced an increase in zzso zzso zzso levels, which was prevented when substance P was zzso with zzso II zzso zzso A unilateral injection of zzso A zzso zzso into the zzso produced an increase in zzso zzso zzso levels, which was not modified when zzso A was zzso with zzso II zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso to zzso zzso and zzso K, as well as zzso violet zzso revealed that zzso injections of zzso II zzso zzso did not produce significant damage in the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso II is not zzso when injected zzso and that it is a selective zzso of substance P in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the reduction of zzso zzso levels after zzso zzso II injections suggests that the zzso zzso projection is zzso zzso by zzso substance zzso
