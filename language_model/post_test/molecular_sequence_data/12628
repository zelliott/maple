zzso zzso commonly have zzso losses of zzso zzso which suggests the presence of a tumor zzso gene on zzso The candidate tumor zzso gene on zzso is the zzso 2 zzso zzso Using single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis, we screened 24 pairs of zzso cancer and adjacent normal zzso as well as 10 colon cancer cell lines from zzso patients, for zzso in the coding sequence of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso one in zzso 14 and another one in zzso 16, were detected in two of the sporadic zzso zzso but not in adjacent normal zzso zzso zzso of these zzso in one tumor detected an zzso transition in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in the change of zzso to Val at zzso zzso of zzso the zzso protein zzso The other tumor showed a zzso zzso deletion in the zzso sequence of the alternatively spliced zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene is probably involved in some zzso tumors, but is not the critical zzso zzso tumor zzso gene involved in colon zzso
