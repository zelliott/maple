zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso 4 zzso identified in the zzso zzso have been characterized and their expression profiles zzso In contrast to both typical zzso and insect zzso peptides generally, the newly identified zzso were not zzso with zzso zzso following immune challenge in insects or cell zzso However, zzso abundance of zzso zzso and zzso increased significantly during the zzso zzso zzso analysis of all three genes failed to identify putative immune response elements previously identified in other zzso zzso zzso As previous studies failed to identify these zzso zzso it seems likely that further zzso zzso genes with zzso expression profiles will be identified as more zzso sequences become zzso
