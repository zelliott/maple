Recent studies have shown that zzso growth factors zzso play an important role in the diverse cellular mechanisms involved with zzso zzso One system which has received a great deal of attention is the developing limb in part because of the extensive zzso interactions that take place during this zzso Because it closely parallels the zzso process of the limb and is a model for wound repair, the phenomenon of zzso limb zzso has been used to investigate the role of zzso in these zzso We have recently reported on the cloning and functional characterization of an zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons indicate that the zzso zzso exhibits between 79 to zzso identity with zzso from zzso and avian zzso The full length zzso of the zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso expression zzso and zzso from zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso shares a high degree of primary zzso acid sequence similarity with other zzso zzso the zzso protein was not detected in a Western zzso analysis using a zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso Despite the zzso zzso the zzso zzso was capable of binding to zzso and Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso comparable to those reported for zzso zzso Newt zzso could also be zzso to receptors on the surface of zzso zzso In addition, it elicits a zzso response in zzso cells indistinguishable from human zzso zzso
