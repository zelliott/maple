zzso T zzso zzso constitute a major component of the zzso response following organ zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso killing remain to be determined but multiple candidate molecules involved in zzso zzso have been zzso zzso B, a zzso zzso zzso in zzso pathways of zzso and is necessary for induction of DNA fragmentation in target zzso In this study the expression of zzso B in liver zzso obtained from liver zzso recipients was determined by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso were classified into four zzso evidence of zzso preservation injury, acute zzso or resolving zzso to zzso zzso There was a significantly higher frequency of transcripts for zzso B in the acute rejection group zzso compared to the no rejection zzso resolving rejection zzso and preservation injury zzso zzso Analysis of zzso B gene expression in sequential samples from individual patients prior to, and after, treatment for rejection revealed an inverse correlation between zzso B zzso and response to zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso B may participate in zzso zzso during liver zzso zzso
