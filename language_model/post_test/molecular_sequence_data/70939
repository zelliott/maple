There are indications from zzso zzso and cell biological studies that protein zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso has a variety of functions at different stages in the cell zzso To further characterize zzso and its potential roles during cell cycle zzso one of the objectives of this study was to systematically examine the expression of all three zzso of zzso at different stages in the cell zzso To achieve this objective, we examined levels of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso as well as zzso activity in samples prepared zzso zzso zzso populations of zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells and zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso we observed a significant and zzso increase in the expression of zzso and zzso following serum stimulation of zzso human zzso By comparison, no major fluctuations in zzso activity were detected during any other stages during the cell zzso Furthermore, we did not observe any dramatic differences between the relative levels of zzso to zzso during different stages in the cell zzso However, we observed a significant increase in the amount of zzso relative to zzso in cells arrested with zzso We also examined the activity of zzso in extracts or in zzso prepared from zzso zzso Of particular interest is the observation that the activity of zzso is not changed in zzso zzso Since zzso is zzso zzso in these cells, this result suggests that the zzso of zzso by zzso does not affect the zzso activity of zzso However, the activity of zzso was increased by incubation with zzso in zzso Since this zzso was independent of zzso we speculate that zzso may have an associated factor that stimulates zzso zzso zzso the observations that relative levels of zzso increase in zzso cells, that zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso cells and that zzso affects zzso activity in zzso suggest that zzso does have regulatory functions associated with cell zzso
