The zzso factor zzso locus in zzso is now functionally subdivided in three distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso After knowledge of the complete zzso Y sequence in zzso 14 Y genes zzso zzso functional proteins and expressed in human zzso are found to be located in one of the three zzso zzso zzso a major question for each zzso clinic performing molecular screening for zzso deletions has now raised concerning the functional contribution of the zzso zzso proteins to human zzso Additionally, it has been shown that distinct zzso regions in zzso overlapping with the zzso zzso and zzso intervals are probably involved in the zzso X and Y zzso pairing zzso An old hypothesis on the germ line function of zzso becomes therefore zzso It proposed a specific zzso folding code in zzso which controls the zzso cycle of the Y zzso in the male germ zzso Thus, with the exception of zzso proteins functionally expressed during the zzso differentiation and proliferation of zzso the need for zzso proteins functionally expressed at zzso or during the zzso zzso maturation process is difficult to assess before the identification of specific zzso in the corresponding zzso gene causing male zzso
