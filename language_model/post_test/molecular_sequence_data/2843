The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso agent zzso has been determined through the DNA sequence characterization of 121 zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso induced was the zzso transition zzso zzso constituted zzso of all zzso with the greatest contribution being that of zzso events zzso Runs of zzso base pairs were the preferred sites of zzso zzso One zzso sequence zzso appeared to be highly susceptible to all classes of zzso and events within this sequence accounted for zzso of all zzso zzso Although the distribution of zzso zzso appeared zzso the zzso observed was quite different from that reported for zzso zzso zzso The results of this study highlight the differences between the consequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
