zzso zzso recognize extended zzso sequences in the major groove of zzso DNA by zzso zzso The resulting local triple zzso are relatively stable and can block DNA recognition by zzso DNA binding proteins such as restriction zzso Association and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate zzso zzso are now measured with a restriction zzso protection zzso When zzso are present in greater than zzso excess over the DNA target site, the binding reaction zzso are zzso first order in zzso zzso Under our standard conditions zzso degrees C, 25 zzso zzso pH zzso 70 zzso sodium zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine serum zzso the value of the observed zzso association rate constant, zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso rate constant yields an equilibrium zzso constant of approximately 10 zzso zzso sodium zzso concentration slightly decreased the association rate, substantially increased the zzso rate, and thereby reduced the equilibrium binding zzso This effect was zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso confirming the significant role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso formation under these zzso Finally, a small reduction in association rate, a large increase in zzso rate, and a resulting reduction in the equilibrium binding constant were observed upon increasing the pH between zzso and zzso
