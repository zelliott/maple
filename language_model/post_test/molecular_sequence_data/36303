The zzso binding pocket of many G zzso receptors is thought to be located within the core formed by their seven zzso zzso zzso Previous results suggested that zzso zzso bind to a pocket located toward the zzso region of the zzso primarily at zzso 2, 3, 6, and zzso zzso zzso is located in zzso only one zzso turn from the presumed membrane surface of zzso whereas a zzso zzso is found in the equivalent position of the closely related zzso In order to determine the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso binding and selectivity versus zzso we constructed the point zzso zzso F of zzso and measured binding affinities of various zzso with zzso zzso as the zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso into human embryonic kidney zzso zzso Whereas the affinities of zzso zzso and zzso were either unchanged zzso or enhanced by less than twofold zzso and zzso the affinity of the zzso zzso was reduced zzso by the zzso zzso These changes parallel affinity differences of zzso and zzso indicating that the zzso F zzso affects the binding pocket and that zzso contributes to the binding selectivity among closely related zzso zzso
