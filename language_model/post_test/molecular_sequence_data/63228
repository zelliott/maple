We describe a quantitative analysis of the genetic diversity of zzso potential in bacterial communities from zzso activated zzso zzso DNA extracted from activated sludge from two sequential batch zzso fed with synthetic sewage plus zzso was amplified using zzso zzso for the major zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and used to generate clone zzso Following zzso analysis, 59 sequences containing a zzso zzso clustered into six distinct zzso with a genetic distance of zzso most likely representing ecologically relevant zzso of the zzso Seven sets of zzso were designed to target the six clusters and used to obtain quantitative information on the dynamics of zzso gene diversity using real-time zzso zzso throughout 9 months of zzso zzso Total zzso gene copy number remained approximately steady in zzso and control zzso However, a significant increase in zzso activity in the zzso sludge was accompanied by a parallel increase in zzso gene diversity, suggesting that zzso degradation in the activated sludge depends on the combined activity of a number of redundant zzso
