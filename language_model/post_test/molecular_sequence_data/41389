The grazing activity of predators on zzso organisms is a major mechanism of mortality and population restructuring in natural zzso zzso is also one of the primary difficulties in growing zzso and other zzso in large, open ponds for the production of zzso as zzso destroy valuable biomass and prevent stable, continuous production of zzso zzso To address this problem, we have isolated a zzso zzso zzso that zzso upon zzso and zzso freshwater zzso zzso We have established a model zzso system using this zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso to a library of zzso of zzso zzso led to the identification of a zzso knockout zzso of the zzso ABC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in three other genes involved in zzso synthesis and transport also prevented the expression of zzso and zzso resistance to zzso zzso of these rough zzso returned zzso expression and zzso to zzso zzso zzso are easily identifiable by appearance, are capable of zzso and do not display growth defects under standard laboratory growth conditions, all of which are desired traits for a zzso production zzso Thus, preventing the production of zzso is a zzso for producing resistance to grazing by certain zzso
