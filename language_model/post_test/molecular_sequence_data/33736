Chinese zzso crab zzso zzso is one of the most important aquaculture zzso species in zzso A zzso library was constructed from zzso of zzso zzso challenged with the mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and randomly zzso to collect zzso information and identify genes involved in immune defense zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso clones yielded zzso high quality zzso zzso zzso zzso and these zzso were assembled into zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso of the total) or zzso zzso zzso of the total) were novel genes that had no significant matches to any protein sequences in the public zzso The rest zzso zzso zzso of the total) were closely matched to the known genes or sequences deposited in public databases, which could be zzso into 20 or 23 zzso according to zzso zzso or zzso zzso respectively based on the Gene zzso zzso And 221 zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso of matched zzso or zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso of matched zzso were identified to be immune zzso The relative higher proportion of zzso genes in the present zzso library than that in the normal library of zzso zzso and other crustaceans libraries, and the differences and changes in percentage and quantity of some key zzso genes especially the immune zzso genes between two zzso zzso zzso libraries may derive from the bacteria challenge to the Chinese zzso zzso The results provided a zzso zzso resource for the zzso community, gene discovery especially for the identification of zzso genes and pathways in zzso as well as other zzso
