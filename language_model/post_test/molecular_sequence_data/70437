The zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso chain has been shown to promote zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we defined the potential sequences originating from the zzso of zzso zzso chain which possess these functional zzso A series of peptides were zzso from the zzso termed LG peptides zzso to zzso and were tested for their various biological zzso In the direct zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso zzso and this zzso also directly promoted cell zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso also promoted the zzso outgrowth of zzso cells, mouse zzso cells, and chick zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the cell zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso plays a functional role as a zzso binding site in the zzso of the zzso zzso chain, and this sequence was thus concluded to play a crucial role in regulating cell zzso and spreading and zzso zzso which is related to zzso zzso
