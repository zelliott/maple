A series of zzso zzso zzso acids have been investigated for development of a novel factor zzso zzso possessing a potent zzso activity for factor zzso and a selectivity for factor zzso compared to zzso In order to study the zzso relationships and the zzso models of factors zzso complexes formed with the zzso were constructed on the basis of X-ray zzso data of a zzso zzso The models showed that the binding mode of the zzso to the zzso pocket of the zzso accounted for the zzso relationships and that the difference between zzso of factor zzso and zzso of zzso had a key role in the zzso
