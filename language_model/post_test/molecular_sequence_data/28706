zzso is a cell zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso involved in nervous system zzso Its avian zzso known as zzso or zzso promotes zzso zzso growth and controls the zzso of growth zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of zzso are still to be determined, since neither its zzso zzso nor its zzso have been zzso Nevertheless, a major class of zzso is present in the retinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso the potent native growth zzso for retinal zzso We demonstrate here that zzso is a zzso protein and that its zzso zzso zzso include the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen zzso These molecules interact with high affinity with zzso in zzso and this binding is totally dependent upon their zzso zzso zzso Using molecular zzso and zzso zzso a binding site for zzso and zzso zzso was identified in the first zzso domain of zzso zzso are therefore a novel class of zzso zzso for zzso suggesting that zzso signaling in zzso and growth cones is directly responsive to zzso zzso
