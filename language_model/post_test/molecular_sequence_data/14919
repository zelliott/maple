Four zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belonging to a novel zzso species were isolated from coal mine zzso of zzso in zzso zzso state, zzso Another strain zzso was isolated from agricultural field soil from zzso state, zzso The zzso cells of all these strains were round, zzso and produced zzso by zzso between independent cells or mother cell and zzso with rough zzso suggesting their possible relation to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso domain of the large zzso zzso zzso gene and Internal zzso zzso zzso regions revealed that, among the five zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have identical zzso The other two strains zzso and zzso differed from the other three strains in less than zzso zzso zzso in the combined zzso domain and ITS zzso indicating that all of them (five zzso may belong to the same zzso These five strains were closely related to zzso zzso but showed more than zzso sequence divergence from zzso zzso and all other species in the zzso zzso in the combined sequence analysis of zzso domain and ITS region of zzso zzso In addition, these strains also showed distinct zzso zzso pattern from related species and differed in several zzso responses suggesting that these strains belong to a novel species of zzso We propose to name these strains as zzso zzso zzso zzso and designate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type strain of this novel zzso The zzso number of the novel species is zzso zzso
