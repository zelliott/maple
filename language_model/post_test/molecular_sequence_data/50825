The two findings indicate that zzso is a hot zzso zzso in zzso These are zzso of DNA containing zzso at the site of this zzso and decomposition of zzso when the DNA and zzso were treated in 1 M zzso for 30 zzso at 90 degrees zzso However, no zzso was observed in DNA containing zzso or zzso zzso was found to be different from zzso sites that are also zzso zzso since the former was more resistant to zzso zzso This property of zzso can be used as a check for the incorporation of this base into DNA after the synthesis of DNA containing zzso at a specific position or possibly can be one of the markers for the identification of zzso formed in DNA exposed to zzso oxygen zzso
