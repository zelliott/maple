We have used zzso zzso to map the zzso pathways of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso at successive stages of differentiation in newborn mouse zzso The zzso zzso is first detected in large, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the stratum zzso and then distributed throughout the zzso of the zzso layers of stratum zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso precursor is first accumulated in zzso from which it is subsequently released and processed into zzso and becomes associated with the densely packed zzso of zzso filaments inside stratum zzso zzso Its diminished visibility in the outer layers zzso with the known degradation of zzso to free zzso zzso zzso is first detected in small round zzso zzso zzso and subsequently at the periphery of cells throughout the stratum zzso zzso of zzso zzso envelopes establishes that this zzso zzso is exposed only at their inner zzso zzso Thus zzso is initially accumulated in zzso to be released at a specifically programmed stage of zzso zzso and incorporated into the zzso zzso lining of the cell zzso Since zzso is rich in zzso zzso account for the zzso zzso zzso described zzso zzso are made to zzso why, subsequent to zzso zzso precursor and zzso should be zzso both from each other and from the rest of the zzso
