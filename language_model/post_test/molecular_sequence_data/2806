Three distinct zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso virus were zzso These zzso were defined by three zzso zzso one of which recognized all zzso virus field strains zzso whereas the other two were zzso A zzso virus zzso zzso zzso representing 502 of the 525 zzso acids was cloned into a bacterial expression zzso zzso zzso and expressed as a zzso zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso The expressed protein reacted with all three zzso zzso A series of zzso gene deletion was constructed in order to locate the zzso zzso The zzso site identified on all zzso virus strains zzso which was designated site I, was located between zzso acids 122 and zzso The two variable zzso were located at the C zzso of the protein zzso II at zzso to zzso site III at zzso to zzso The structural and biological implications of these observations are zzso
