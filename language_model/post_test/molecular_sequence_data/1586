The zzso zzso of a large cryptic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified and zzso The zzso zzso two proteins essential for zzso replication and zzso The putative replication protein zzso is zzso to that of the plasmids in zzso zzso family, while the putative zzso protein immediately downstream of zzso is significantly zzso to the zzso zzso required for partition of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso These two proteins and other zzso are clustered with the putative promoters and other regulatory zzso illustrating an efficient organization of the zzso for this novel zzso
