zzso of data from functional mapping carried out on scorpion and sea zzso toxins blocking currents through zzso zzso channels revealed that, despite their different zzso structures, the binding zzso of these toxins displayed some zzso Further molecular modeling studies suggested that these similarities reflect the use by these toxins of a common binding mode to exert their blocking zzso zzso scorpion and sea zzso toxins offer an example of zzso zzso zzso
