The solution structure of the DNA duplex zzso containing a tandem repeat of the human zzso zzso unit has been determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso distance geometry zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso This remarkably stable zzso zzso duplex contains a tandem repeated motif in which zzso zzso zzso from opposite strands zzso and zzso between sheared zzso zzso Twelve independent refined structures were determined from the zzso data and found to zzso to a single family of closely related structures with zzso zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso All sugar zzso are in the normal zzso zzso except for the zzso zzso which are in the unusual zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pairs have zzso zzso angles and zzso backbone zzso angles close to the trans zzso The structure exhibits many unusual zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso hydrogen bonding and zzso base zzso The zzso unit contains a stack of four zzso zzso zzso all of which have their zzso surface zzso exposed to zzso and available for interaction with other bases or zzso This unexpected property may explain the unique zzso and function of the human zzso in zzso
