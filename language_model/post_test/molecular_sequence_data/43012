A point zzso at zzso zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso gene has been demonstrated to play an important zzso role in some cases of familial Alzheimer's disease zzso Recently, a single case of chronic schizophrenia with a point zzso at zzso 713 of zzso gene which sits very close to the zzso in zzso was zzso We screened for these two kinds of zzso in 39 schizophrenic patients using zzso chain reaction zzso and restriction zzso zzso A zzso of zzso 713 creates a zzso restriction site and that of zzso zzso creates a zzso zzso zzso zzso with amplified zzso product revealed no restriction site in all zzso None of our subjects had either of these two kinds of zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that the case of a zzso at zzso 713 of zzso gene is a natural zzso zzso and, as well as a zzso at zzso zzso has no relation with the genetic predisposition to zzso
