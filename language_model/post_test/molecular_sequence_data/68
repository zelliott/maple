The variable zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso is a major zzso factor in zzso A large number of zzso genes zzso zzso and we hypothesized that a restricted zzso repertoire determines clinical disease zzso We conducted a zzso study in zzso New zzso and analyzed transcribed zzso genes in naturally infected zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was isolated from 78 children with zzso mild, or severe zzso We prepared complementary DNA from the upstream region into the zzso domain and zzso on average, 20 clones for zzso 

Twenty-five percent of centrally located zzso genes were shared between children, whereas only zzso of zzso genes were shared, indicating lower diversity in the former zzso zzso between group B or C zzso upstream sequences and zzso groups was not observed, which zzso prediction by zzso zzso A higher proportion of zzso group A sequences was detected in symptomatic malaria, and a zzso of frequently encountered zzso genes with complex head structure seems to be associated with severe zzso A subset of zzso group C genes was frequently expressed in older children with zzso high levels of zzso 

Despite this vast diversity, restricted zzso zzso genes were identified and might be used for innovative interventions based on zzso
