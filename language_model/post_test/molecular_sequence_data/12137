In order to investigate the mechanism of carbon zzso repression in the industrially important fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed to amplify a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which was used to clone the entire zzso It encodes a zzso acid protein with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso Its zzso shows zzso and zzso overall similarity to the corresponding genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso containing the zzso zinc finger and several zzso rich in zzso and basic zzso zzso which may be involved in the interaction with other zzso Another zzso rich in the zzso that has been considered analogous to a region of zzso zzso was instead identified as a domain occurring in several zzso zzso zzso The presence of the zzso translation product was demonstrated with zzso zzso against zzso which identified a protein of 43 zzso 2) zzso in zzso extracts from zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso from the two zinc fingers to the region similar to the zzso of zzso zzso factors, was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso revealed binding of the fusion protein to the sequence zzso which matches well with the zzso zzso consensus sequence for zzso binding zzso zzso extracts of zzso zzso formed different complexes with zzso carrying this binding sites, and the presence of zzso and additional proteins in these complexes was zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso is the functional zzso of zzso zzso and that it binds to its target sequence probably as a protein zzso
