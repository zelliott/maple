We characterized the mouse zzso gene 2 product zzso which is a zzso of the zzso gene 1 product zzso We revealed that the zzso gene spanned approximately 10 zzso and was separated into 18 zzso The zzso start site of zzso was located 377 zzso upstream from the putative initiation zzso The zzso location of the zzso protein was the nucleus, and nuclear zzso signals were identified in the region between zzso acids 456 and zzso To obtain data on the zzso potential of zzso various zzso containing different portions were fused to the zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso protein zzso the zzso of the reporter zzso whereas treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso led to recovery from the repression and to zzso zzso However, the N zzso of zzso activated zzso activity in the absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso has the potential to both repress and activate gene zzso and that its zzso repression activity might be related to zzso zzso
