To identify a new zzso located on the zzso artificial zzso zzso clone zzso that was mapped to human zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA from the clone was zzso directly as a probe to screen a human brain zzso library after the suppression of human repetitive zzso One zzso clone zzso specifically to the zzso zzso DNA was zzso The clone has an insert of zzso zzso and the longest open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso A search of zzso revealed that the clone has a high degree of zzso to zzso zzso zzso at the zzso acid level, and its zzso sequence represents the expressed sequence from the zzso segment of the human zzso zzso Thus a new gene was named zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso with total human and zzso zzso suggests that zzso might be a zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso procedure was applied, and the results showed that the gene mapped to the human zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, zzso zzso liver, and lungs but at different levels in different zzso
