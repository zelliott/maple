The specific zzso of a DNA triple zzso by zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso was observed on both strands of the zzso pair zzso duplex at the zzso zzso Strand zzso products and zzso zzso zzso were both zzso The strongest zzso zzso site was located at the zzso zzso which is also the preferred triplex binding site of zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso The preference of zzso for the zzso does not appear to derive from selective zzso binding at this zzso This is supported by the observation that zzso which contains a zzso zzso rather than a zzso zzso ring system, exhibited the same selectivity of triplex zzso as zzso zzso of the triple zzso by zzso was unaffected by zzso of zzso up to 5 zzso suggesting possible therapeutic applications of this novel DNA zzso zzso calculations of the triplex region suggested that dramatic variations in minor groove zzso and depth occur at the zzso zzso particularly at the zzso Moreover, the minor groove at these sites was calculated to be somewhat zzso and wider than the minor groove of zzso These results suggest that the preference of zzso for the zzso junctions derives from selective recognition of minor groove shape at these sites and thus reflects zzso rather than zzso DNA recognition by zzso
