Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso functionally interact with each other to regulate zzso synaptic transmission in the zzso zzso In exploring molecular mechanisms underlying their zzso we found that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso may play a central zzso The zzso zzso directly binds to the zzso region of zzso C terminal tails of zzso in zzso This binding is zzso inactive zzso binds to zzso at a high level whereas the active form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso loses its affinity for the zzso zzso also promotes zzso to bind to zzso at a region overlapping with the zzso site, resulting in a competitive zzso of zzso binding to zzso In rat zzso zzso inactive zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and simultaneously promotes zzso to bind to the adjacent zzso zzso zzso which enables zzso to zzso zzso at a zzso zzso Together, the long zzso zzso tail of zzso seems to serve as a scaffolding domain to recruit and store zzso within zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso interactions with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso which may contribute to zzso between the two zzso We show that zzso of zzso with a selective zzso triggers zzso zzso release in zzso zzso Released zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and meanwhile promotes active zzso to bind to the adjacent zzso zzso zzso which enables zzso to zzso zzso at a zzso zzso This zzso cascade seems to mediate zzso between zzso and zzso receptors in zzso
