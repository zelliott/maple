zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso contain three zzso zzso but the first site zzso cannot bind zzso Here we aimed to recreate the putative ancestral proteins zzso and zzso by replacing the zzso zzso loop in the AB site by a zzso zzso zzso To create an optical zzso probe we also expressed the zzso with a zzso zzso zzso in none of the proteins did the zzso reactivate the AB zzso The zzso zzso bind two zzso zzso with strong positive zzso zzso zzso 2) and moderate affinity zzso zzso 2 zzso compared with zzso zzso 37 zzso and zzso zzso 1 for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changed zzso from 2 to zzso but without modification of the zzso zzso CD revealed that the zzso and zzso forms of the remodeled zzso lost one-third of their alpha zzso content compared with the zzso form of zzso zzso However, the zzso of single zzso zzso in the zzso cores, monitored using intrinsic zzso and difference optical density, is the zzso The zzso remodeled zzso possess unfolded zzso The zzso zzso also bind two zzso with zzso zzso 43 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso does not affect zzso zzso Again the zzso forms display two-thirds of the zzso content in the zzso while their core is still strongly zzso as monitored by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso are partially unfolded and seem not to possess a zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso has the potential to regulate cell functions, whereas it is unlikely that zzso can play a regulatory role in zzso The predicted evolution of the AB site from a zzso to an zzso zzso may have been dictated by the need for stronger interaction with zzso and zzso and a high zzso stability of the zzso zzso
