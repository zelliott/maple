zzso is zzso in the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells by zzso leads to the rapid zzso of zzso leading to their degradation that results in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two direct zzso zzso Two recently identified novel zzso are zzso and zzso We have zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso human zzso and zzso and compared their zzso properties with those of zzso We show that zzso and zzso are zzso similar to each zzso We demonstrate by zzso mapping and zzso zzso that zzso and zzso are zzso on zzso zzso in the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso loop and that this zzso is necessary for zzso zzso Also, zzso and zzso have differential zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso loop of zzso being a more favorable zzso than the zzso zzso Finally, using zzso of zzso we demonstrate unique differences in the zzso sites of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, although these zzso are structurally similar, their zzso properties may provide insights into their unique zzso
