Floral scent has been extensively investigated in plants of the South American zzso zzso Flowers of zzso zzso emit mostly zzso while flowers of zzso zzso zzso zzso emit a mixture of volatile zzso and zzso compounds that include zzso and zzso Flowers of the artificial hybrid zzso zzso a cross between zzso zzso and zzso zzso emit a similar spectrum of zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the flowers of zzso zzso zzso zzso emit neither zzso nor zzso but contain high levels of zzso zzso in the zzso the main zzso and zzso zzso We recently showed that both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are zzso from zzso zzso in reactions zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, via a zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso has a functional zzso gene that is expressed in flowers, but its zzso gene contains a zzso zzso that renders it zzso Despite the presence of active zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso activity the zzso zzso zzso is converted by an as yet unknown zzso to zzso zzso By contrast, suppressing the expression of zzso in zzso zzso by zzso interference also leads to a decrease in zzso zzso but instead of the zzso of zzso zzso the flowers zzso higher levels of zzso
