zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated in DNA fragmentation during zzso We have demonstrated that particular zzso of this type are inhibited by zzso and suggested that subsequent zzso of zzso by zzso might release these zzso from zzso zzso zzso we zzso and partially zzso such a zzso isolated from bovine seminal plasma and identified human, rat and mouse zzso of this zzso The extent of sequence zzso among these zzso indicates that these four proteins are zzso members of the family of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of the human zzso previously specified as zzso can induce zzso and zzso DNA fragmentation in zzso and in zzso zzso analysis failed to detect zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso isolated from these cells did not exhibit zzso DNA fragmentation when incubated in the presence of zzso zzso However, zzso isolated from zzso cells that had been zzso zzso with zzso zzso underwent such DNA fragmentation in the presence of both zzso The zzso zzso also induced zzso DNA degradation in zzso but not in control zzso zzso zzso alternating field zzso revealed that in zzso from zzso zzso cells, but not in those from control cells, DNA was zzso into fragments of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso addition of zzso the presence of zzso in processing of the zzso zzso fragments into 50 zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is necessary for zzso and zzso zzso of DNA into both zzso and high molecular mass fragments in specific cell zzso
