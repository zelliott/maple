zzso zzso zzso was found to mediate sequence specific zzso of zzso in the absence of added metal zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso bond zzso 3' to the zzso zzso at all resolved zzso sites not involving modified zzso as demonstrated by high-resolution zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso The reaction proceeded with surprising facility, approaching efficiency that of zzso strand zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso By the use of a number of zzso zzso as well as a study of the time, temperature, and salt dependence of the zzso it was shown that in many respects the zzso reaction parallels the zzso degradation of zzso and DNA zzso by zzso Thus, in contrast to the zzso zzso degradation of DNA and zzso by zzso studied for two decades, the present report documents the ability of certain zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso
