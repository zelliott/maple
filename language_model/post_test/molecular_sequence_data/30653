zzso human zzso and zzso zzso (which encodes a protein with a zzso zzso were cloned into a zzso transfer zzso and expressed in zzso insect zzso The resulting proteins were zzso and their zzso zzso zzso activities, and responsiveness to zzso proteins zzso were characterized and compared with those of zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso with affinities similar to those observed for zzso zzso zzso The rate of exchange of zzso by zzso without zzso was much slower than that by zzso The zzso zzso activities by both zzso proteins were lower than that observed with the zzso zzso but the zzso activity of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins could be zzso to similar levels by zzso activity in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso was unresponsive to zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso protein zzso activity could be zzso by zzso zzso at a concentration zzso higher than that required to zzso 50% of zzso zzso under similar zzso These results suggest that the putative zzso zzso zzso acids 32 to 40) shared between zzso and Ras are functionally similar and interact with their respective zzso However, although zzso and Ras are identical in this region, secondary structure or additional regions must zzso the ability to respond to zzso
