Environmental and zzso stresses such as heat zzso zzso stress, heavy metals, and zzso conditions induce cellular stress zzso This response is often zzso by heat shock proteins that function as molecular zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso organizer zzso functions as an zzso protein that simultaneously binds with zzso and zzso to transfer client proteins from zzso to zzso However, the biological role of zzso in zzso is poorly understood in zzso Here, we report the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is approximately zzso identical with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso nervous system, and muscle from larvae to zzso Analysis of proteins zzso with zzso zzso by mass zzso revealed that zzso can bind with both zzso and zzso zzso like its zzso zzso zzso expression is elevated by heat stress, and an zzso zzso zzso shows decreased fertility under heat stress zzso These zzso also show zzso high zzso in extreme heat and may be functioning with zzso in zzso In addition, zzso zzso have a shortened life zzso Our results confirm that zzso is a zzso protein that may maintain zzso functions during episodes of stress and can regulate longevity in zzso
