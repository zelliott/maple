The role of zzso polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the large zzso loop, and zzso to zzso action at human zzso receptors was tested by generating zzso substitution zzso For the majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution had no effect on zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed changes in efficacy for the partial zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that these polar zzso may contribute to the gating of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso three- and zzso decreases in zzso zzso zzso For zzso and zzso the partial zzso zzso and zzso were no longer zzso but still bind to the zzso as shown by the ability to zzso the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso acquires complex zzso in the zzso These results aid in refining a model for zzso binding at the zzso zzso where the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are likely to play a role in zzso action at the zzso
