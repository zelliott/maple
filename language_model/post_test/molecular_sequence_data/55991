A novel class of targeted zzso agents based on zzso compounds linked to zzso zzso was tested in a long term zzso system in order to determine their effects on different types of rat zzso zzso The compounds investigated included two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso and zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso through zzso acid zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both containing two zzso of zzso The zzso were infused for 24 h at pharmacological zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells after a short zzso and a long zzso recovery period following the treatment were compared to those before the analog zzso All four zzso zzso zzso selectively decreased the zzso zzso response, while zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso release of zzso and zzso were not influenced in spite of the high doses applied and the long duration of zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly greater than those of their parent zzso zzso zzso of zzso compounds alone zzso or zzso however, caused functional damage to all types of cells zzso To evaluate the mechanisms of the observed zzso actions, we compared the amount of zzso released in response to 1) a specific stimulus to receptors (3 zzso zzso 2) membrane zzso with 100 zzso zzso not involving the zzso and 3) the extraction of cells with zzso N zzso at the end of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their carriers caused depletion of zzso pools, while zzso zzso zzso or their parent peptides decreased the available binding sites for zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in our system could be due to an action on cell zzso Our work indicates that in the zzso cell zzso system, targeted zzso zzso based on zzso zzso selectively affect zzso cells, in contrast to zzso zzso compounds, which also damage zzso and zzso zzso
