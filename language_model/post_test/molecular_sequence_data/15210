zzso of zzso sites in the promoter region can affect gene zzso DNA derived from peripheral blood zzso zzso from the zzso clinical zzso might be useful to study the influence of environmental factors on DNA zzso However, these studies could be zzso by the zzso nature of zzso The aims of this study were to determine the impact of zzso distribution on zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso promoter, and determine the associations between zzso zzso zzso status of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso differential count analyses were performed at the time of blood sampling for DNA preparation in 170 elderly zzso The DNA was zzso treated, and the zzso status of five zzso units in the zzso promoter was analyzed using a zzso technique based on zzso mass zzso The degree of zzso of all the five investigated zzso units was strongly positively associated with the percent of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso status of a specific zzso unit in the zzso promoter was significantly associated with body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso and other measures reflecting fat mass in elderly zzso In conclusion, adjustment for zzso distribution needs to be done to be able to use DNA from whole blood for zzso analysis of the zzso promoter and most likely also when investigating other zzso
