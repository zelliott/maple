zzso zzso zzso the main cause of adult blindness, is a genetically zzso disorder characterized by progressive loss of zzso through zzso Up to now, 39 genes and zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso yet the genetic bases of zzso of the cases, particularly of the zzso forms, remain zzso Previous linkage analysis in a Spanish zzso family allowed us to define a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within an zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso In the present study, we further refine the zzso locus down to zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After unsuccessful zzso analysis of the nine genes initially reported in this region, a detailed gene search based on zzso data was zzso We finally identified a novel gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso which zzso 13 zzso All of the patients from the zzso family bear a zzso zzso in zzso 5, which generates a premature termination zzso The same zzso was also characterized in another, zzso Spanish pedigree with zzso Human zzso is expressed in the zzso among other adult and fetal zzso A more detailed analysis by in zzso zzso on adult zzso zzso sections shows expression of zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso convert the zzso zzso zzso into zzso both key zzso of cellular zzso and zzso zzso metabolism plays an essential role in the viability of zzso cells, the zzso of which are particularly rich in zzso zzso zzso zzso could shift the relative levels of the signaling zzso zzso and increase sensitivity of zzso and other retinal cells to zzso zzso This is the first genetic report suggesting a direct link between retinal zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
