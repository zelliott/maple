The zzso coli zzso zzso factor 1 zzso and the zzso zzso toxin zzso activate zzso zzso by zzso of zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, both toxins possess in zzso zzso activity in the presence of primary zzso Here we characterized the region of zzso essential for zzso recognition by the toxins using zzso zzso as protein zzso The zzso protein zzso was zzso or zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso developed formation of zzso structures after treatment with the zzso zzso indicating zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso effects in intact zzso The zzso zzso protein contained the minimal zzso sequence allowing zzso or zzso by zzso A zzso covering mainly the switch II region and consisting of zzso acid zzso zzso through zzso of zzso was zzso for zzso Changes of zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso of zzso into the corresponding zzso of Ras zzso and zzso inhibited zzso and zzso of the zzso by zzso In contrast to zzso zzso did not modify zzso zzso or the switch II zzso zzso through zzso zzso of zzso at zzso blocked zzso by zzso but not by zzso The data indicate that zzso recognizes zzso zzso exclusively in the switch II region, whereas the zzso recognition by zzso is characterized by additional structural zzso
