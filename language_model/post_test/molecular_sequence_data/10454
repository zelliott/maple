The zzso zzso of zzso zzso rotate only zzso and control directional changes of swimming cells by modulating zzso rotary zzso Using zzso zzso we have identified and zzso a zzso zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso zzso The zzso gene (and an zzso zzso has been assigned by similarity to the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso are new and without known zzso in other zzso zzso deletions introduced in zzso zzso or zzso each result in zzso zzso function was fully restored by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, deletions in zzso or zzso required the native combination of zzso and zzso in trans for restoring normal zzso zzso whereas zzso with zzso or zzso alone led to zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a zzso gene fusion and a zzso zzso intervening between zzso and zzso resulted in zzso swimming as a consequence of large fluctuations in zzso rotary zzso We conclude that zzso zzso requires coordinate expression of zzso and zzso and balanced amounts of the two gene zzso The zzso zzso contains an zzso signal sequence for export, and Western blots have confirmed its location in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A working model suggests that interactions between zzso and zzso at the zzso surface of the motor control the energy flux or the energy zzso that drives zzso zzso
