We demonstrate that in humans, two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso of zzso an zzso zzso required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso have an identical modular structure, are distinct in possessing 15 zzso and a unique zzso domain, and have a similar gene structure, suggesting that they comprise a new zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is very sparingly zzso although it is zzso in zzso cells of the breast and zzso However, zzso is highly expressed in embryonic and adult zzso and therefore we characterized the zzso protein zzso Although the zzso zzso has many zzso zzso processing sites, zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso acid sequencing demonstrated that maturation to the active form occurs by selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Although lacking a zzso zzso zzso is retained near the cell surface as well as in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso and zzso core proteins at the zzso bond of zzso zzso and the zzso bond of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso domain alone was neither localized to the cell surface nor able to zzso these zzso activities on cells, demonstrating that the ancillary zzso of zzso including the zzso are required both for specific zzso zzso and for its zzso and zzso zzso
