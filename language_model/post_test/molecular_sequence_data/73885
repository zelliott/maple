The zzso zzso is a technique that was developed to detect and map zzso This zzso takes advantage of the zzso coli mismatch binding protein zzso which binds and protects mismatched, zzso DNA from subsequent zzso zzso The zzso of using the zzso zzso as part of a zzso selection scheme was zzso zzso were formed between mouse zzso gene zzso products or restriction fragments that contained zzso sequence and sequence with a single base change at zzso 61 zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were incubated with zzso and then treated with the zzso activity of zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA sequences were amplified by zzso When this method was linked to single zzso primer extension zzso for zzso base zzso original zzso zzso of 1 in zzso and above were zzso Using comparable DNA template zzso the sensitivity of zzso alone was 1 in 5 or 1 in 50, depending on the direction of zzso zzso and the particular base being zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso was able to enrich the zzso sequence approximately zzso and, therefore, has considerable potential as a tool for zzso zzso
