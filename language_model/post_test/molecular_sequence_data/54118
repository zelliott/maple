A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from wall material of an indoor zzso The isolate formed a zzso zzso zzso that fragmented into zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strain zzso was shown to belong to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid in the cell wall and zzso and zzso as the main zzso zzso acids were zzso The polar zzso profile consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and seven unknown zzso The fatty acid profile contained major amounts zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed the differentiation of strain zzso from the type strains of the three known zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso species, for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso with type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
