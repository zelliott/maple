zzso suggested that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso involves the formation of transient zzso zzso followed by conversion to zzso zzso However, atomic details of zzso zzso and the transition mechanism are mostly zzso We investigated the structural properties of the zzso and zzso in zzso detail by replica exchange molecular dynamics zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were both observed in the zzso zzso Our calculated zzso chemical shifts based on the zzso zzso run are in agreement with the zzso zzso experimental zzso Multiple 300 zzso MD simulations at 310 K show that zzso transition follows two zzso the first involved direct transition of the random zzso part of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso and in the second, the zzso zzso unfolded and converted into zzso zzso In both mechanisms, the zzso transition occurred via random zzso and the transition was accompanied by an increase of zzso zzso In addition, our zzso simulations revealed different temperature zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with experimental data suggests that the propensity for zzso to form zzso and zzso structures is zzso and zzso
