The harvesting and storing of alfalfa is a routine practice in the agricultural industry zzso To investigate gene expression in harvested zzso zzso from zzso and harvested plants in the field was subjected to zzso zzso to zzso in particular, those genes that are induced by the harvesting zzso One zzso zzso named zzso was isolated and zzso The full length zzso of the zzso gene was cloned by zzso zzso The zzso zzso which has high zzso to a putative protein of unknown function in zzso was induced in alfalfa following zzso a zzso heat shock and a wounding zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that the expression patterns of zzso in alfalfa in response to zzso heat zzso and zzso In addition, zzso walking was performed to isolate the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso The promoter of the zzso gene was fused to the zzso reporter gene and transferred to zzso zzso and zzso In all transgenic plants of zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression was observed in harvested zzso especially in the transgenic tobacco plants, but not in the zzso control zzso
