A novel combination of theoretical approaches was exploited to predict which zzso acid zzso of various zzso zzso zzso participate in forming zzso zzso Estimates of sequence zzso moments were used initially to identify zzso within zzso regions in the zzso half of the heavy zzso A neural network zzso was then used to make additional secondary structural predictions for these zzso Together, these approaches predicted a complimentary pattern of four, adjacent zzso possibly zzso regions that may be separated by zzso zzso Both the zzso moment and the neural net analyses predicted that at least one of these zzso segments may be in an extended zzso These theoretical results are discussed in view of our current knowledge of other zzso zzso
