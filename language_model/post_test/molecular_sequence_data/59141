The structures of the zzso zzso from five strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Two series of structures were identified, all but one containing the same zzso zzso Series 1 zzso are zzso at the third zzso zzso to zzso zzso 3) by zzso or zzso acid, as are some zzso anchors of zzso zzso The core can be further zzso by terminal zzso zzso zzso In contrast, Series 2 zzso do not have additional zzso groups attached to Man 3, the latter being zzso instead by a single side chain unit of zzso Series 1 zzso are present in all strains (G, zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas Series 2 structures are present mainly in zzso and Y zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso from the G, zzso and zzso strains is predominantly zzso as reported for the Y strain, whilst that from the zzso strain is a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso and probably also the zzso structures may play an important zzso role in infection by zzso zzso
