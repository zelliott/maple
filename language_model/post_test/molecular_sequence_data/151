The zzso box small zzso zzso zzso represent an essential class of small zzso zzso that guide zzso zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified, most of them zzso by zzso gene zzso but little is known on the factors controlling their zzso Here, we focus on the identification of factors controlling the processing of zzso zzso precursors zzso zzso by zzso zzso III and producing zzso and zzso zzso We produced zzso zzso zzso corresponding to different zzso zzso to test their impact on processing in zzso by a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso that processes the zzso of zzso and by nuclear extracts from cauliflower zzso zzso zzso that accurately process the zzso This was coupled to an in zzso analysis of the processing of zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso Our results strongly zzso zzso Z in zzso zzso of the zzso In addition, they reveal an alternate zzso that could depend on a zzso zzso surveillance zzso Finally, we provide arguments showing that processing of zzso both in zzso and by nuclear zzso is coupled to the assembly of zzso with core proteins forming the functional zzso (for small zzso zzso zzso
