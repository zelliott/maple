The zzso zzso of steroid hormone receptors is a highly zzso region located at the extreme zzso end of the zzso zzso A protein zzso zzso zzso 2 has been shown to function as an independent zzso zzso zzso however, because this region is essential for hormone zzso it has been difficult to determine whether the zzso zzso also contributes to the zzso function of intact steroid zzso In this study a series of zzso acid zzso were engineered at zzso positions in the zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso to map specific zzso acid zzso that contribute to the zzso function, zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso or zzso for some zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced or eliminated hormone zzso but the zzso function of the intact zzso and/or the minimum zzso zzso was unaffected for each of these zzso zzso of zzso for zzso acid zzso reduced zzso activity in the intact zzso and the minimum zzso zzso but had no effect on hormone zzso The single zzso zzso and the double zzso acid substitution zzso affected both hormone binding and zzso The fact that the zzso and zzso zzso each caused a loss of zzso activity in the minimum zzso zzso and the full-length zzso indicated that the zzso zzso does contribute to the overall zzso function of the full-length zzso Overall, the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was primarily involved in hormone zzso whereas the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was primarily involved in zzso
