zzso zzso play fundamental roles in marine zzso as zzso zzso This recognized importance contrasts with our ignorance of the zzso composition of this functional group, which remains mostly unidentified by zzso and zzso zzso Recent molecular marine surveys based on zzso zzso genes have retrieved many sequences unrelated to cultured organisms and marine zzso were among the first reported zzso zzso However, little is known about the organisms corresponding to these zzso Here we determine the abundance of several marine zzso lineages in surface marine waters using molecular zzso and fluorescent in zzso zzso We show that these zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso They were widely distributed, occurring in the five world zzso and accounted for a significant fraction (up to zzso of zzso zzso in diverse geographic zzso A single group, zzso represented zzso of cells within this functional zzso with the intriguing exception of polar waters where it was zzso zzso cells likely contribute substantially to zzso grazing and zzso zzso in vast areas of the oceans and represent a key zzso group in marine food zzso
