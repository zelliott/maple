The Q gene is largely responsible for the widespread zzso of wheat because it zzso the zzso zzso It also zzso influences many other zzso traits such as zzso shape and zzso zzso zzso spike zzso plant zzso and spike emergence zzso We isolated the Q gene and verified its identity by analysis of knockout zzso and zzso The Q gene has a high degree of similarity to members of the zzso family of zzso zzso The Q zzso is more abundantly transcribed than zzso and the two zzso differ for a single zzso zzso An zzso at position zzso in the Q protein leads to an abundance of zzso formation in zzso cells, whereas a zzso in the zzso protein appears to limit zzso zzso zzso expression analysis allowed us to observe both zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso shape, and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in transgenic plants exhibiting zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso Q zzso Variation in spike zzso and plant height were associated with the level of zzso zzso due to the dosage effects of zzso The zzso zzso is the more zzso and the zzso that gave rise to Q occurred only once leading to the world's cultivated zzso
