zzso zzso zzso are part of a complex zzso with zzso zzso which the zzso cultivate for food, zzso zzso pathogens zzso which zzso zzso and zzso which produce zzso compounds that suppress pathogen zzso Earlier studies that have characterized the association between zzso zzso and their bacterial zzso have employed broad zzso approaches, with conclusions ranging from a diffuse zzso zzso to no specificity being zzso However, the geographic mosaic theory of zzso proposes that zzso interactions likely occur at a level above local populations but within zzso Moreover, the scale of population subdivision is likely to impact zzso zzso Here, we describe the population structure of bacteria associated with the zzso zzso zzso across Central America using zzso sequence typing zzso of six zzso zzso The majority zzso of bacteria that were isolated grouped into a single zzso within the zzso zzso In contrast to studies that have suggested that zzso zzso is high and therefore zzso by zzso associations, we found highly structured zzso see zzso and zzso zzso significant isolation by distance; zzso see zzso zzso see zzso populations over even a relatively small scale zzso within the Panama Canal zzso Estimates of zzso versus zzso were zzso low compared with estimates for zzso zzso zzso zzso see zzso in La zzso Costa zzso which suggests that zzso is constrained by association with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso population structure was correlated with that of zzso species zzso see zzso zzso see zzso supporting the zzso role in disease zzso Overall, the population dynamics of symbiotic zzso are more consistent with a specialized zzso association than with recently proposed models of low specificity and frequent horizontal zzso
