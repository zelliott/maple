The zzso zzso zzso zzso recently developed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994) was applied to clone zzso genes of zzso zzso After sequence analysis, one of the clones obtained by this selection procedure was shown to contain an open reading frame with significant sequence similarities to zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame was preceded by a zzso consensus binding site, which according to primer extension analysis zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis also revealed the presence of zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso On the zzso level, zzso expression is strictly iron regulated in both organisms and also in the zzso host zzso coli harboring a zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso was detected only after zzso of the bacteria in zzso zzso A zzso zzso fur zzso zzso expressed zzso thereby confirming the functional similarity of the iron regulatory systems in the two zzso Apart from iron regulation, zzso expression was affected by changes in DNA zzso induced by zzso A but not by the global zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso did not show significant changes in their growth zzso In contrast, zzso of the previously described zzso zzso zzso resulted in clones strongly impaired in zzso No direct involvement of zzso in bacterial zzso could be revealed because deletion of the zzso gene affected survival of zzso species neither in cultured zzso nor in a mouse respiratory infection zzso
