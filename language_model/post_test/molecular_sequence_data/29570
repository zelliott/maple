We have developed a novel expression zzso zzso for transformation in zzso zzso The zzso was constructed by cloning zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso To examine transformation with the zzso zzso we chose the green fluorescent protein zzso as a selection zzso When a zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso open reading frame was injected into the zzso the zzso transcript was expressed in many clones whereas protein expression was detected only after extensive zzso of original zzso zzso zzso zzso was distributed throughout the zzso and zzso except for zzso and food zzso Upon continuous cell division, notable zzso of zzso zzso among descendants from the same zzso has zzso This expression zzso can be applied to the analysis of protein trafficking and zzso in addition to zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
