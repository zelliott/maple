zzso zzso are systems created from components of at least two distinct classes of zzso for example, synthetic zzso and proteins or zzso zzso The synergistic combination of two types of structures may produce new materials that possess unprecedented levels of structural organization and novel zzso This Review focuses on zzso zzso of hybrid zzso into functional zzso zzso First, basic rules that govern the secondary structure of peptides are discussed, and then approaches to the specific design of hybrid systems with zzso properties are zzso followed by a discussion on the similarity of design principles of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the future of the field is briefly zzso
