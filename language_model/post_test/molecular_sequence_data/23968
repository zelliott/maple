It is well known that a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of short zzso filaments at the tip region are necessary for zzso tube zzso However, little is known about the connections between the two zzso Here, a novel zzso zzso protein with molecular mass of 41 zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso with zzso I zzso Our zzso procedure yielded about zzso zzso of zzso with zzso purity from 10 g of zzso zzso At least two zzso with zzso points of zzso and zzso were detected on two-dimensional zzso The results of zzso sequencing and zzso analysis of zzso showed that both zzso shared substantial similarity with trumpet zzso zzso zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso electron microscope images showed that zzso severed in zzso zzso zzso zzso into short zzso filaments in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the protein was required for zzso tube zzso The results of zzso of the protein showed that it existed in the zzso of the zzso tube, especially focused in the tip zzso Our results suggest that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and may play an important role in controlling zzso organization in the zzso tube tip by responding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
