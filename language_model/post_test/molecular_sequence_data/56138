The present work was undertaken to investigate the regulatory role of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso acid, in the surface expression of alpha v beta 3 zzso receptors in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cells, or zzso Several zzso and zzso zzso localized alpha v beta 3 in focal zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha v beta 3 zzso were further characterized by zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso or other zzso zzso fatty zzso induced a zzso increase in alpha v beta 3 surface expression in zzso which was antagonized by zzso or its analog zzso as well as by zzso a zzso product of zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso to zzso an effect inhibited by zzso against alpha v beta zzso zzso also promoted zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso which was inhibited by various zzso against alpha zzso beta 3 but not by an zzso against alpha zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso demonstrated a significant increase, which was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso 3, or zzso v beta 3 zzso and by zzso Western zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction indicated that zzso zzso cells expressed alpha zzso beta 3 zzso but not alpha v beta zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a significant role in modulating zzso interactions with zzso by enhancing zzso cell zzso zzso alpha v beta 3) zzso
