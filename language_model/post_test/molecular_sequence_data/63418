The four classes of zzso zzso alpha zzso act as molecular routers inside cells, gating signals based on a bound zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso that specifically target individual zzso provide new tools for monitoring and modulating these networks, but are challenging to design due to the high sequence zzso and structural plasticity of the zzso zzso Here we have created an zzso display library of peptides based on the short zzso zzso zzso and selected zzso that target a zzso zzso surface of zzso zzso After zzso the most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to design a second-generation library, resulting in several new zzso and zzso peptides zzso as zzso The zzso evolutionary walk from zzso to zzso resulted in an zzso inversion in binding zzso altered seven out of nine zzso in the starting zzso core, and incorporated both positive and negative design zzso The resulting zzso zzso shows remarkable selectivity and zzso exhibiting little or no binding to nine zzso zzso zzso or human zzso and even discriminates the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides make specific contacts with the zzso region of zzso which may explain an interesting zzso activity observed in zzso Overall, our work demonstrates a design of simple, zzso highly specific peptides that target a zzso surface of zzso and argues that zzso zzso zzso is a powerful route for targeting protein families with high class specificity and state zzso
