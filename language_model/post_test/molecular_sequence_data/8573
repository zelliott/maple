The zzso to 3' direction of DNA strands within zzso of zzso zzso can be determined by using simultaneous zzso of a single strand of the zzso probe and a single strand of a repetitive sequence to slides zzso for zzso zzso The zzso probe identifies the direction of the DNA zzso strand remaining in each zzso of the zzso zzso The direction of the repetitive sequence is then determined from the direction of the strand to which it zzso This method was used to determine the zzso to 3' direction of three repetitive DNA zzso each for a different human repeat zzso
