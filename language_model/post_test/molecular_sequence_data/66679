DNA zzso is an essential zzso for all organisms and zzso a zzso reaction in the final step of the DNA zzso repair, and zzso zzso zzso we show the physical and functional interaction between DNA zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso activity of zzso zzso DNA zzso was observed not at low zzso strength, but at a high salt zzso at which a DNA zzso alone cannot bind to a zzso DNA zzso On the basis of zzso zzso we identified the zzso acid zzso that are critical for zzso binding in a loop structure located in the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso DNA zzso We propose that the zzso motif zzso is involved in the zzso zzso in which zzso and the first zzso are especially important for stable binding with zzso
