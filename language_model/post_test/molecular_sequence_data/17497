In order to assess the significance of the zzso zzso of the B beta chain in expression of zzso sites of the E domain, we have prepared zzso zzso against a synthetic zzso corresponding to beta zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prepared from these zzso reacted strongly and specifically with the synthetic zzso and intact zzso zzso This specificity was determined both by zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso and its zzso fragments and described in our previous paper zzso et zzso 1986, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anti beta zzso zzso and their zzso fragments were strong zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso acid sequence beta zzso recognized by these zzso may be in a close vicinity to the contact sites of the E zzso
