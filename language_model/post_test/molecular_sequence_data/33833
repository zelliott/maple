zzso of many zzso secondary zzso is initiated by incorporating starter units other than zzso Thus, understanding their zzso mechanism is of importance for zzso zzso Insight into the loading process of zzso into the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso has been provided by the sequencing of a partial zzso gene cluster in the zzso zzso zzso The cluster encodes a predicted zzso zzso zzso that was hypothesized to activate and transfer zzso to the zzso carrier protein zzso However, gene zzso and in zzso experiments described here contradicted this zzso Aided by the zzso sequence of zzso zzso we identified an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a different gene zzso which is additionally required for zzso zzso We report the characterization of both zzso and the zzso of a novel zzso zzso strategy in zzso zzso zzso
