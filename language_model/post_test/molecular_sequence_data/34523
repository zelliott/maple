zzso restrictions imposed by hydrogen bond formation during protein folding are investigated by zzso Carlo simulations of a zzso zzso zzso model in which the formation of favorable contacts is coupled to an effective reduction in lattice zzso This scheme is intended to mimic the requirement that polar backbone groups of real proteins must form hydrogen bonds zzso to their burial inside the zzso protein zzso In addition to the square zzso with zzso zzso per zzso we use extensions in which diagonal step zzso are allowed, resulting in zzso and zzso zzso are governed by the zzso energy function, according to which zzso zzso tend to make contacts zzso while the reverse is true for zzso zzso with the additional restriction that only contacts between zzso adopting one of zzso local zzso contribute to the energy, where zzso is the number of local zzso assumed to be compatible with hydrogen bond zzso The folding transition zzso and zzso zzso ratio are found to increase dramatically by this simple and physically motivated zzso The observed increase in folding zzso is correlated to an increase in the zzso of the underlying zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso zzso simulations in three dimensions, even though using a smaller relative reduction in lattice effective coordination zzso display a slight increase in zzso for a zzso model of 40 zzso and a more pronounced increase in zzso for a zzso zzso with the same native zzso suggesting that this purely zzso effect is not an artifact of zzso and is likely to be of fundamental importance in the theoretical understanding of folding zzso
