zzso zzso are a group of small, zzso zzso DNA viruses that have been detected in a variety of zzso and avian species including humans, zzso and zzso zzso cause zzso in the skin and zzso zzso of the host and after persistent infection, a subset of zzso can cause tumors such as cervical zzso and head and neck zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso from several species have been isolated and their zzso have been zzso thereby increasing our understanding of the mechanism of viral zzso and allowing for the development of molecular zzso for the detection of zzso zzso In humans, molecular testing for zzso DNA is used to identify patients with persistent infections at risk for developing cervical zzso In zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso from oral zzso zzso of several wild species including zzso Asian lions and snow zzso Since a number of wild zzso are zzso zzso associated disease is a concern and there is a need for molecular tools that can be used to further study zzso in these zzso 

We used the sequence of the snow zzso zzso zzso to develop a zzso strategy to amplify viral DNA from samples obtained from captive zzso We designed primer pairs that flank the E6 and zzso viral zzso and amplify two DNA fragments encompassing these zzso We detected viral DNA for E6 and zzso in zzso DNA isolated from zzso but not in paired blood samples from snow zzso We verified the identity of these zzso products by restriction digest and DNA zzso The sequences of the zzso products were zzso identical to the published zzso zzso zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso to detect zzso in snow zzso and amplified viral DNA encompassing the E6 and zzso zzso specifically in the saliva of zzso This zzso could be zzso for the molecular investigation of zzso in snow zzso using zzso thereby allowing the detection of the virus in the anatomical site where oral zzso zzso develop during later stages of infection and disease zzso
