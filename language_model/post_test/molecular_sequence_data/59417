Proper development of the zzso zzso requires sufficient zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso during a brief zzso period produces severe neurological defects in humans and experimental zzso zzso hormone exerts its effects through nuclear zzso which zzso the zzso of downstream genes in response to hormone zzso Surprisingly, few genes that are regulated by zzso hormone receptors in the zzso have been zzso Here, I report the isolation and characterization of genes that are expressed in response to zzso hormone in developing rat zzso One such gene zzso encodes a novel protein related to zzso a protein involved in regulating neurotransmitter zzso another zzso encodes a putative zinc finger protein related to the product of a recently identified mouse zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are induced rapidly zzso zzso suggesting that they are regulated directly by zzso zzso The zzso and spatial expression of both zzso and zzso is characteristic of genes important to nervous system zzso zzso and zzso are likely part of a cascade of gene zzso induced by zzso hormone that is critical for zzso organization and zzso
