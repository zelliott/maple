Treatment of zzso zzso with the zzso DNA zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso has previously been shown to induce zzso zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso strains defective in both the checkpoint control pathways and in DNA repair processes are sensitive to zzso Here we describe the isolation of zzso as a zzso zzso of the zzso sensitivity of zzso checkpoint and DNA zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative 25 zzso protein with limited zzso to a zzso zzso open reading frame of unknown zzso The zzso gene is not essential and the zzso zzso shows no zzso in either DNA repair or checkpoint zzso We also report the sequence of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso which lies immediately adjacent to zzso but which plays only a moderate role in suppression of zzso zzso
