The zzso stability of a series of recently obtained zzso of zzso from zzso T4 (a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso each containing zzso zzso acid zzso progressively truncated from the zzso zzso was studied during incubation at zzso degrees C in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso G, B, C, and zzso contained zzso zzso zzso and 120 zzso acid zzso zzso One more truncated zzso zzso S1, 108 zzso acid zzso was zzso The zzso zzso showed that the migration zzso of all these proteins corresponded to apparent molecular masses substantially greater than those of the preliminarily heated samples (3 zzso at 100 degrees zzso The heating of the intact zzso and the zzso G at zzso degrees C for 10 zzso resulted in the formation of a form with an apparent molecular mass higher than 200 zzso This form probably represented a zzso protein with a partly zzso zzso zzso zzso B and C were more stable and were only partly zzso into zzso even at zzso degrees zzso The short zzso E and zzso zzso into zzso at temperatures from 45 to 50 degrees zzso The zzso of zzso B, C, zzso and zzso proceeded in one stage without formation of any intermediate zzso The stability of the zzso molecules of native zzso under PAGE zzso conditions and the behavior of the intact protein during heating in the temperature range of zzso degrees C might be used for the identification of zzso intermediate forms upon folding in zzso The zzso capability was found for zzso and its zzso zzso by heating at low temperatures in the presence of zzso zzso
