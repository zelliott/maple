Because we found in previous work that a high fraction of zzso exhibiting various zzso bound to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso we studied the zzso of clones producing zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso mice bearing zzso zzso The zzso of such clones was studied after mice were zzso with zzso in zzso zzso (an zzso zzso carrying the internal image of zzso in the D zzso and a synthetic zzso corresponding to the D segment of zzso Our results indicate that zzso mice produced both zzso and zzso zzso Study of the zzso properties of zzso showed that they exhibit zzso properties and bind with zzso zzso to zzso or zzso such as DNA, Smith zzso zzso and zzso An important fraction of zzso obtained from zzso mice zzso with zzso expressed zzso zzso and some of these zzso share zzso expressed on zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso The zzso producing zzso zzso use zzso zzso and zzso region zzso genes from various V gene families, suggesting that they do not derive from the pool of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes of two zzso show that they can use closely related zzso zzso zzso or different zzso genes than those used by zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that clones producing zzso binding to zzso and zzso with zzso zzso can be activated by foreign or zzso zzso carrying the internal image of the zzso or even by a synthetic zzso corresponding to the D segment of zzso zzso
