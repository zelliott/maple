The zzso zzso protein is a negative regulator of zzso zzso It specifically zzso the zzso activity of type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and promotes their degradation by a zzso zzso To further understand the function of the zzso family in the plant kingdom, we cloned a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso LIKE 1), an zzso zzso from zzso zzso encodes a putative protein with domain architecture zzso in the zzso zzso proteins and in the predicted rice zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and the full ripe stage of fruit, suggesting diverse regulatory roles in the development of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed specific interactions between zzso and type 2 zzso zzso When the zzso 14 zzso acids zzso target of zzso of zzso specific to type 2 zzso zzso were fused to a type 1 zzso zzso at the corresponding position, it allowed zzso to strongly interact with zzso A zzso fusion protein expressed in rice zzso and in the roots of zzso zzso showed reduced stability compared to native zzso However, the zzso of zzso was comparable to that of the native zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment significantly enhanced the zzso of zzso in the roots of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso protein degradation zzso is zzso in both zzso and zzso and that zzso acts as a protein zzso signal recognized by the zzso protein zzso
