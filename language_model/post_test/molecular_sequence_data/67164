The role of zzso in cell metabolism and survival is controlled by calcium signals that are commonly transmitted at the close associations between zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the physical linkage of the zzso interface and its relevance for cell function remains zzso We show by electron zzso that zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso that are approximately 10 zzso at the smooth zzso and approximately 25 zzso at the rough zzso Limited zzso separates zzso from zzso whereas expression of a short zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to tightening of the zzso Although normal connections are necessary and sufficient for proper propagation of zzso calcium signals to the zzso tightened connections, synthetic or naturally observed under zzso conditions, make zzso prone to zzso overloading and ensuing zzso zzso These results reveal an unexpected dependence of cell function and survival on the maintenance of proper spacing between the zzso and zzso
