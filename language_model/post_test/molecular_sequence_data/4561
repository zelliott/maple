The zzso zzso factor is expressed in zzso cells and during subsequent stages of heart development in diverse zzso zzso To gain insights into the molecular events that govern this zzso zzso we isolated the chicken zzso gene and used several approaches to screen for associated control zzso Our analysis of two chicken zzso zzso in transgenic mouse zzso was particularly zzso One zzso zzso which has zzso zzso pairs of upstream sequences along with the promoter and first zzso was expressed exclusively in the zzso canal region of the zzso This expression pattern is novel and appears to mark specialized zzso cells that induce underlying zzso cells to initiate valve zzso The other zzso zzso which has an additional zzso zzso pairs of upstream zzso was expressed in the zzso and zzso tract in addition to the zzso zzso The failure of these zzso control regions to function as enhancers in zzso cardiac zzso cultures underscores the importance of using transgenic approaches to zzso zzso controls that function in the developing zzso Although the zzso zzso gene is expressed throughout the heart, our results indicate that this is zzso in a heart zzso zzso
