A zzso zzso a novel zzso coupled zzso zzso was isolated from a human cerebral zzso zzso library by low stringency zzso zzso This putative zzso domain zzso of 469 zzso acids was designated zzso zzso and zzso Like zzso zzso zzso shares the highest amount of zzso acid similarity with the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso receptors zzso with zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in human brain regions, particularly the zzso zzso and zzso although the zzso can also be detected in the peripheral zzso albeit at low zzso zzso mapping by radiation hybrid analysis localized the human zzso gene to the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells did not produce any binding sites for zzso or zzso II, indicating the necessity for further study to discover its zzso and zzso zzso
