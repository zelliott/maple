We report the isolation and characterization of a zzso of zzso coli unable to grow zzso on zzso zzso except for very slow growth on zzso The zzso contains zzso zzso o and zzso and grows zzso with alternative electron zzso zzso consumption rates of zzso extracts were low relative to activities in an zzso control strain, but were restored in zzso by adding zzso to zzso zzso Transformation with a cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA restored the ability of this zzso zzso to grow on zzso and also restored cellular zzso levels in this zzso The zzso also zzso a previously isolated zzso zzso zzso for zzso growth on zzso The zzso sequence revealed a zzso zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso deletions from this zzso and zzso analysis identified an open reading frame zzso a protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso This gene zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso which zzso the terminal step in the zzso of zzso The open reading frame is preceded by a putative zzso sequence and followed by three zzso unit zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso with the sequence of other zzso zzso zzso reveals a highly zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso zzso also contains a sequence zzso the zzso of a protein with zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso
