The structural genes for the zzso terminal zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso The locus comprised two open reading zzso zzso and zzso coding for gene products of zzso and 335 zzso acid zzso with predicted molecular masses of zzso and zzso Da zzso These genes were zzso by a zzso zzso transcript and probably comprise an zzso zzso of a major zzso start site is a zzso promoter region and, approximately at zzso zzso and zzso there are sequences zzso to the binding site of the zzso regulator zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso signals were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso signal was seen under zzso growth conditions but only in strains in which the zzso genes were present on a zzso zzso The appearance of these zzso zzso signals was not paralleled by a zzso increase in zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso zzso does not contain zzso zzso This raises the possibility that there is a family of bacterial zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso of zzso coli that can differ in their zzso composition from the zzso coli zzso
