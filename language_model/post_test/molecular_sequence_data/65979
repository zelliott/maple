zzso formation is crucial for organ development in zzso zzso In higher plants, boundaries that separate the organ zzso from their surroundings have relatively low rates of cell zzso This cellular feature is regulated by the actions of certain zzso zzso whose zzso expression in zzso can cause zzso of organ zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso genes function in the zzso and zzso zzso to repress zzso genes for normal development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso produced extremely tiny zzso and zzso Analysis of a zzso marker zzso revealed that cell division in zzso zzso of the double zzso was zzso Moreover, these abnormal zzso and petals exhibited zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso LOSS zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso and zzso Loss of zzso or zzso and zzso functions in the zzso zzso background could partially rescue the tiny zzso and zzso zzso supporting the model that the tiny zzso zzso are caused, at least in part, by zzso expression of zzso zzso Together, our data reveal a previously zzso fundamental regulation by which zzso zzso and zzso act to define zzso and zzso from their zzso
