Following zzso by zzso most G zzso receptors undergo rapid zzso This is accompanied by a drastic decrease in the efficacy of continued or repeated zzso due to zzso zzso from G protein and zzso zzso Such processing steps have been shown to be absolutely dependent on zzso zzso in the case of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report results that indicate that the mechanisms responsible for zzso and zzso are zzso Using zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we have characterized regions that zzso regulate these two zzso Whereas substitution of all 11 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso prevents both zzso and zzso substitution of four zzso zzso between zzso blocks zzso but has no effect on zzso Similarly, substitution of four zzso zzso between positions 334 and 339 results in a deficit in zzso but again no decrease in zzso suggesting that zzso at either site evokes zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso requires zzso at both zzso These results also indicate that zzso zzso is not involved in the process of zzso Further analysis of the zzso between zzso revealed that restoration either of zzso and zzso or of zzso and zzso was sufficient to restore zzso suggesting that zzso within either of these two sites, in addition to sites between zzso 334 and 339, is sufficient to produce zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanisms involved in zzso processing zzso from G proteins and zzso are regulated zzso by zzso at distinct sites within the zzso zzso of the zzso The relevance of this paradigm to other G zzso receptors is zzso
