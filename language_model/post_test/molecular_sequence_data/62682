zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso intermediate at its target site zzso downward zzso in duplex zzso The contributions of backbone zzso and individual zzso zzso to the zzso reaction were zzso by introducing 22 single zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 11 positions zzso the zzso zzso zzso groups at eight positions (four on the zzso strand and four on the zzso zzso inhibited the rate of zzso zzso by factors of zzso zzso interference was observed at several zzso thereby distinguishing simple zzso contributions from putative specific polar contacts to either the zzso or zzso zzso The functionally relevant zzso zzso are located on the minor groove face of the zzso on which the zzso zzso zzso Our findings, combined with available crystal structures of zzso and human zzso zzso show how specific zzso contacts remote from where chemistry occurs are critical for assembly of the active zzso
