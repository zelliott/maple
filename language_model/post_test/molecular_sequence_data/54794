The birth and death of genes is central to zzso evolution, yet the underlying zzso dynamics remain zzso The availability of closely related complete zzso sequences helps to follow changes in gene contents and clarify their relationship to overall zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria in our stomach, are known for their extreme zzso plasticity through zzso and zzso and will make a good target for such an zzso In comparing their complete zzso zzso we found that gain and loss of genes zzso for outer membrane zzso which mediate host interaction, occurred at zzso of zzso zzso zzso comparison there revealed a unique mechanism of DNA zzso DNA zzso associated with zzso In this process, a DNA segment at one zzso locus is copied and zzso in an zzso orientation, into a distant locus on the same zzso while the entire region between these two zzso is also zzso zzso of this and three more inversion zzso which occur through zzso zzso between long or short sequence similarity or adjacent to a mobile element, allowed reconstruction of zzso evolution through inversion events in this zzso These results will guide the interpretation of extensive DNA sequencing results for understanding long- and short-term zzso evolution in various organisms and in cancer zzso
