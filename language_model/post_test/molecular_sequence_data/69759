zzso zzso II zzso has a zzso structure of alpha 2 beta 2 where alpha is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso expressed in insect cells is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso by binding to zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso of zzso zzso zzso 170 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of 71 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 42 zzso and bovine zzso with a zzso of 123 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso when measured in the absence of zzso The zzso values of bovine zzso and zzso zzso zzso measured in the presence of 150 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 82 zzso and 204 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 51 zzso zzso Since the zzso for the zzso zzso is zzso zzso greater than the zzso zzso measured in the absence of added salt these results indicate that the zzso acts primarily as an zzso zzso
