zzso zzso are water channel proteins that are expressed in almost all living zzso In zzso 13 members of zzso zzso have been identified so zzso zzso is known to be expressed mostly in the zzso cells, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso A naturally occurring point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was earlier found in the rat zzso gene zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso the rate of initial saliva zzso under zzso and zzso conditions is less than that for the zzso zzso zzso 

Here the zzso zzso was characterized in zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we demonstrated the zzso zzso to have water zzso almost the same as that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso and expressed in polarized zzso zzso canine kidney zzso cells, first appeared in the zzso zzso in the zzso and were zzso to the upper plasma membrane or zzso membrane during zzso with the zzso zzso being zzso less zzso zzso and zzso both induced zzso in zzso of either zzso whereas zzso inhibited this zzso the fraction of cells showing zzso zzso of zzso zzso was less than that showing that of the zzso zzso under any of the experimental conditions zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso membrane of zzso cells was extremely zzso zzso structures positive for zzso and present in the zzso of the zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso membrane protein 2) or zzso D in the zzso zzso whereas such zzso were very rare in the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso molecules largely entered zzso for zzso 

Replacement of highly zzso zzso zzso with strongly zzso zzso in rat zzso though it did not affect water zzso may possibly have resulted in less efficient membrane trafficking and increased zzso degradation, leading to its lower expression in the zzso membrane of the zzso cells in the zzso
