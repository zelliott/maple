zzso receptors are believed to be zzso by an extremely large zzso of G zzso zzso A human gene zzso zzso a member of this family was cloned from a zzso library by zzso with a gene zzso obtained by the zzso chain zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso was determined, and the protein sequence was deduced from the single open reading zzso The gene was assigned by in zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso region of the human zzso in proximity to the zzso gene zzso zzso When used as a probe on Southern blots under moderately stringent conditions, it zzso to at least three closely related zzso A restriction zzso length zzso was detected after zzso zzso zzso segregation of the gene was assessed in three zzso families, and linkage analysis confirmed the zzso of the zzso
