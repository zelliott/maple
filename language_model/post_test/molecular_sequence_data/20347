To study the zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso acid conversion to aroma compound in zzso zzso 

Analysis of the zzso gene zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso revealed that the coding region is zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acids sequence exhibits the putative zzso active site and some zzso zzso characteristic of family I of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene of zzso zzso clustered with the zzso of other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the structural organization of the zzso locus the zzso acid similarity of zzso was higher than zzso but the locus organization was not zzso A dominant transcript of approximately zzso zzso was revealed by Northern zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso zzso extension showed that zzso start point of zzso was localized 43 zzso upstream of the potential start zzso zzso 

The zzso represents a zzso zzso highly zzso in zzso zzso 

A deeper knowledge of zzso zzso mechanisms could lead to develop zzso zzso industrial starter cultures with zzso aromatic zzso
