zzso zzso 1 zzso a key neuroendocrine zzso of the stress response, has two known zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso 1 zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso degrades zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso at critical zzso zzso which is essential for zzso zzso At near zzso zzso concentration (30 zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso Interestingly, at high zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso dependent, whereas zzso zzso becomes independent of zzso zzso At high zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted zzso but not zzso zzso recycling and zzso but did not prolong the association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggests that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is dependent on activity of zzso but not of zzso zzso behaves like a class A G zzso zzso with respect to transient zzso zzso We propose that differential degradation by zzso is a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso is protected from zzso by zzso relevant high zzso of higher affinity zzso to mediate distinct zzso and downstream zzso
