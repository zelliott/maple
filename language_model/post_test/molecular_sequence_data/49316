zzso is an zzso and zzso protein that zzso to focal zzso Recently, we have shown that both zzso and a new family member, zzso promote cell migration zzso Duncan, zzso and Lo (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso Since zzso of proteins to particular zzso compartments often regulates their functions, and zzso zzso domain 2 may mediate signals related to cell migration, we zzso that zzso cell migration is regulated by the focal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain 2 of zzso To test this hypothesis, we have zzso the effects of a series of zzso zzso on cell zzso Our results have shown that zzso zzso contains two focal zzso sites, zzso the zzso zzso significantly promotes cell migration, zzso zzso with one focal zzso site do not promote cell migration, zzso the zzso zzso localized zzso suppresses cell migration and zzso the zzso that is not able to bind to zzso proteins has no effect on cell zzso These results have indicated that focal zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso activity are two critical factors in regulating zzso cell zzso
