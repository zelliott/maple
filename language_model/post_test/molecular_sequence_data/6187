To investigate a complex formation of zzso G protein beta and gamma zzso we constructed a deletion zzso which lacked the zzso zzso repeating unit of beta 1 and zzso into zzso cells with gamma 2 which was zzso with zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso beta 1 failed to associate with zzso gamma zzso Furthermore, from the analysis of additional deletion zzso the last 10 zzso acids of zzso region of beta 1 were found to be necessary to associate with gamma zzso These results suggest that the zzso region, in addition to the zzso zzso structure, of beta zzso may be involved in the beta gamma complex zzso
