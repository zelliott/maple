The difference of zzso zzso in the native and unfolded states of the protein is used as a measure of the zzso contribution to the free energy of zzso We present a new approximation of zzso acids zzso zzso in the unfolded state based on the zzso molecular dynamics simulation of zzso zzso at a temperature of 368 zzso The standard accessibility values averaged from the molecular dynamics study are significantly lower from those previously obtained by considering only selected zzso of zzso zzso
