To better understand the process of zzso zzso in zzso cells, we have attempted to isolate novel candidate genes involved in zzso progression of mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso and the less differentiated zzso cell line zzso were established from peripheral nerve sheath tumors arising in transgenic mice of the zzso large T strain zzso By using the chemical zzso zzso technique, we have cloned a novel zzso zzso that detects pronounced expression in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso The longest open reading frame of the zzso predicts a zzso showing zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to the recorded sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso one of a family of proteins that are thought to interface with a wide range of zzso signal zzso zzso The predicted open reading frame of the corresponding zzso named zzso encodes a 38 zzso protein that harbors an zzso protein zzso domain that is zzso identical to that of zzso a zzso zzso repeat and a consensus zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was detected in both zzso and zzso cells, pronounced expression of the zzso zzso appeared in various classes of zzso associated with the zzso formation, as shown by in zzso zzso analysis of adult mouse zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso is zzso a novel potential marker for zzso zzso zzso may form zzso and/or interact with other zzso and zzso may have a role in zzso associated with memory zzso
