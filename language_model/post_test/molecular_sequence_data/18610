The interactions between viral zzso and coat proteins zzso are critical for the efficient completion of infection cycles of zzso zzso However, the specificity of the interactions between zzso and zzso or zzso zzso remains poorly zzso In this study, zzso mosaic virus zzso was used to zzso such zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso two regions in zzso each containing a basic zzso acid zzso and zzso respectively), were identified to bind directly to the zzso untranslated region of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that the secondary structures of zzso were not affected significantly, whereas the zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was severely decreased at 24 h zzso in the zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso were decreased to zzso and zzso of that of the zzso zzso respectively, in zzso leaves at 5 days zzso zzso In contrast, in the presence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso remained about zzso of that of zzso whereas the zzso zzso accumulated to at least zzso suggesting that zzso might increase the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso also restricted viral movement and zzso formation in zzso zzso leaves at 5 zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso of zzso play crucial roles in the zzso movement and zzso formation of zzso zzso and indicate that zzso and zzso zzso interact differently with zzso zzso
