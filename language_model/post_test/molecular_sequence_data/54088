The zzso of zzso mosaic virus New Delhi strain zzso from India, obtained from tomato, was completely zzso and compared with full zzso sequences of 14 known zzso strains from zzso I and II, for their genetic zzso zzso analysis suggests zzso shares maximum sequence identity at the zzso level with a zzso strain from zzso Among all 15 strains of zzso the zzso protein zzso is least zzso whereas the coat protein zzso is most zzso zzso identity values and zzso results indicate that zzso belongs to zzso zzso Based on the zzso detection program result, it appears that zzso is prone to zzso and different zzso components of zzso have evolved zzso zzso analysis of all 15 zzso strains detected maximum zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed the least zzso zzso
