Based on computer analysis of zzso and prediction of secondary structures for the full-length putative proteins zzso by open reading zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso E virus zzso we selected zzso regions with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso 7 peptides of possible zzso regions of the zzso zzso by all 3 zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso method of zzso zzso The synthetic peptides were screened and identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of the peptides zzso from zzso zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso showed zzso activity and possible application for the development of zzso test kits (the zzso zzso The laboratory experiments and clinical trials showed that the zzso using a set of 3 synthetic zzso peptides as coating zzso were of high specificity and exhibited good zzso The small-scale zzso survey indicated high zzso zzso of zzso in Tibetan zzso Additionally, the results also demonstrated good agreement with clinical findings, suggesting that the test kits will be of major use for zzso and zzso surveys of zzso zzso
