The crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso provides a good template for modeling the three zzso structure of zzso zzso which is the target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were built on the basis of the crystal coordinates of zzso in complex with zzso and zzso The reliability of the two models was assessed by zzso zzso zzso analysis, and by analyzing the consistency of the two models with the experimental data on the zzso The overall structures of the resulting zzso model and zzso model are similar to those of the template zzso The two models remain the core structure characteristic for zzso zzso and most of the insertions and deletions expose the molecular zzso The structurally and functionally important zzso such as the zzso binding zzso the zzso lining the zzso access channel, and zzso in active site were identified from the zzso To explore the binding mode of the zzso with the two models, zzso was zzso into the active site of the two models and zzso interaction and zzso were found to play an important role in zzso recognition and zzso These results provided a basis for experiments to probe zzso relationships in the zzso Although zzso and zzso shared similar core structural character, the active site of the two models were quite different, thus allowing the rational design of specific zzso to the target zzso and the discovery of novel zzso agents with broad zzso
