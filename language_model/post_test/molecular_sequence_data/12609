Type I and II receptors for the transforming growth factor beta zzso are zzso zzso zzso that are essential for zzso zzso However, little is known about their in zzso zzso or signal zzso zzso To determine the zzso specificity of these zzso we developed zzso zzso libraries zzso on a zzso zzso that is easily accessible to proteins in zzso zzso When we subjected these libraries to zzso by the zzso protein zzso we obtained the optimal zzso sequence zzso zzso in perfect agreement with the zzso sequence deduced from zzso and crystal structure zzso By using the same libraries, we showed that the optimal zzso zzso for both the type I and II zzso receptors was zzso Since the two zzso are thought to play different roles in zzso signal zzso it was a surprise to find that they have almost identical zzso zzso Our method is zzso sensitive, and simple and provides information about the zzso specificity for all the zzso acid zzso at each zzso
