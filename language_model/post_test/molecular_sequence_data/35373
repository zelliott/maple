Human zzso expressed gene 3 protein zzso is a large zzso entity with diverse biological functions, including acting as a zzso zzso zzso contains twelve zzso type zinc finger zzso extended regions of predicted disorder and at the zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been identified as partner of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an association we sought to zzso An efficient bacterial zzso expression system of the human zzso domain was prepared and zzso appeared spontaneously when the protein was being concentrated after zzso The structure was determined at zzso zzso resolution and reveals a zzso fold of five zzso in an extended zzso An extensive zzso zzso using almost a quarter of the zzso accessible surface, and key salt bridge interactions explain the stability of the zzso zzso with other zzso zzso reveals a high degree of conservation involving zzso that contribute to the zzso zzso The zzso domain appears to constitute an assembly block, enabling zzso zzso or zzso to control gene expression in a zzso zzso
