Many new zzso locus zzso have recently been identified by DNA sequencing, and a molecular based method for their detection using zzso with sequence specific zzso has been zzso However, other methods may be more appropriate for the identification of C locus zzso in larger zzso Here we describe one such system, based on zzso sequence specific zzso zzso zzso for C locus zzso zzso of zzso typing compared to zzso are that it is easier to detect new zzso more cost effective and less time zzso We have developed a DNA typing method to identify the broad C locus zzso (including those not yet defined zzso using a minimum of zzso with one zzso We use a C locus specific sense primer in zzso 2 and a consensus zzso primer in zzso 3, in a zzso zzso giving a product of zzso zzso zzso were designed with similar melting temperatures zzso degrees zzso that would identify as many zzso as zzso The method was established using DNA from B zzso cell lines of known C locus type, mostly 10th workshop zzso cell lines, plus as many other zzso cell lines as zzso The system was able to correctly identify their C locus types using only 26 zzso DNA was tested from a panel of zzso typed individuals which included many different zzso zzso We found a high zzso of results, with all discrepancies being additional zzso identified by molecular zzso filling in zzso zzso We can identify all common zzso combinations using this zzso
