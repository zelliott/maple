Sonic zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in numerous zzso processes including zzso of zzso nervous system, and zzso Using a zzso alignment zzso for zzso zzso we analyzed approximately 28 zzso of zzso DNA in the zzso locus of human and zzso This showed that the length of zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso shared by these species was approximately 3 times larger than the zzso coding sequence zzso zzso Most segments were located in zzso zzso or within zzso regions upstream zzso or downstream zzso of the first and last zzso zzso Even though regions more than 2 zzso upstream or downstream of the first and last zzso zzso represented 57% (16 zzso of the sequence zzso they accounted for only zzso zzso zzso of the total length of zzso zzso zzso One region of 650 zzso downstream of zzso was identified as a putative zzso attachment region zzso zzso analysis was zzso by sequencing in apes, zzso zzso and zzso thus further confirming the evolutionary conservation of some zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso segments are targeted by nuclear proteins and showed differences between two cell types that expressed different levels of zzso namely human zzso cells and breast cancer zzso The relevance of these findings with respect to regulation of zzso expression during normal and zzso development is zzso
