zzso are DNA viruses that zzso a number of zzso hosts and are associated with both sporadic and epidemic disease in zzso We previously identified a novel zzso zzso monkey zzso zzso as the cause of a zzso pneumonia outbreak in a colony of zzso monkeys zzso zzso at a national zzso center in zzso zzso evidence of infection by zzso was also found in a human researcher at the facility and household family member, raising concerns for potential zzso transmission of the zzso Here we present experimental evidence of zzso zzso infection in common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a cell zzso zzso strain into three zzso produced an zzso mild respiratory illness characterized by zzso fever, reduced activity, zzso and zzso An increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanied the development of clinical zzso Although serially collected zzso zzso were positive for zzso for at least 8 days, all 3 infected zzso spontaneously recovered by day 12 zzso and persistence of the virus in zzso could not be zzso Thus, the zzso of experimental zzso of zzso in common zzso resembled the mild, zzso respiratory infection typically seen in zzso human hosts rather than the rapidly progressive, fatal pneumonia observed in 19 of 23 zzso monkeys during the prior 2009 zzso These findings further establish the potential for zzso zzso transmission and provide the basis for development of a monkey model useful for assessing the zzso potential of zzso
