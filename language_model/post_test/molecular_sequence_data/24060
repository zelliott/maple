zzso zzso toxin zzso is one of the zzso produced by zzso zzso an agent of localized aggressive zzso We constructed zzso deletion zzso of zzso using an zzso coli expression system and found that zzso with a deletion from zzso to zzso showed comparable zzso activity but no apparent zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso by introducing a zzso tag into the zzso end of zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed strong zzso activity and a zzso structure composed of zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso zzso B), and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in nearly a zzso zzso zzso zzso A was identified as zzso with three zzso zzso in zzso but homogeneous in zzso zzso zzso also showed high stability that was absolutely dependent on the presence of zzso in the zzso In conclusion, the region from the zzso to zzso of zzso contributes to the zzso production of zzso but is zzso for the toxin zzso Furthermore, this study describes an effective protocol for the zzso of a native rather than zzso zzso and zzso the zzso composition of the active zzso zzso
