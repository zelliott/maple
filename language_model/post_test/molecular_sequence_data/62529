Bone zzso occurs as a series of events that requires zzso and spatial orchestration of numerous cell types guided by the zzso activity of thousands of zzso as recently demonstrated by our zzso Using the rat zzso fracture model, zzso zzso expression zzso fusion zzso and zzso we report on the identification and characterization of one such zzso expressed zzso termed Mustang zzso temporally activated novel zzso Mustang encodes for an 82 zzso acid nuclear protein with no zzso to any known protein zzso However, other species zzso zzso human, zzso were identified within zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso Nuclear zzso was confirmed using a zzso fusion zzso Using in zzso zzso Mustang expression was localized to zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso of the fracture zzso Unlike adult zzso developing zzso abundantly express Mustang, especially in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells of the zzso zzso Although the precise function of Mustang is unknown, its unique pattern of expression during bone development and zzso absence in adult zzso (except skeletal muscle and zzso and nuclear zzso suggest that Mustang is involved in the development and zzso of the zzso musculoskeletal zzso
