Among the three main species of zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the sole species present both in North America and in Europe, where zzso zzso and zzso zzso also zzso The greater genetic diversity together with the greater clinical zzso observed in the Old World suggests that this is the birthplace of the complex zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the genetic proximity of some North American and European zzso zzso strains in quite zzso A previous study of the whole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997) compared the diversity of North American and European zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the geographical origin and the migration of zzso zzso we have focused on the study of the single variable and highly zzso gene zzso Both approaches demonstrated the greater diversity of North American strains and the close zzso between European strains and between some zzso from the two zzso We discuss the significance of these features and suggest that they might be evidence of the zzso of North American zzso zzso zzso
