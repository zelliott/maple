In the small zzso zzso is processed into the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two smaller peptides showing about 50% zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was assumed that the sites of zzso zzso in the small zzso of the zzso precursor were determined by pairs of basic zzso acid zzso zzso the two zzso Earlier studies have shown that synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso according to the proposed structure zzso zzso or because zzso 108 is zzso zzso zzso had no zzso effects, whereas a truncated from of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso insulin zzso and depressed zzso zzso To determine the zzso acid sequence of the naturally occurring zzso we isolated zzso from human small zzso by zzso gel zzso and zzso high performance liquid zzso By analysis of composition and sequence it was determined that the zzso corresponded to PG zzso By mass zzso the molecular mass was determined to be zzso corresponding to PG zzso zzso Furthermore, mass zzso of the zzso zzso showed an increase in mass compatible with the presence of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso hormone zzso is shown to be PG zzso zzso
