The nuclear envelope zzso acts as a selective barrier to zzso trafficking between the nucleus and the zzso and zzso a complex reorganization during zzso Different zzso zzso show zzso in zzso function and zzso In contrast with zzso the protein composition of the zzso and the function of zzso proteins are barely understood in zzso zzso attachment factor 1 zzso is a zzso zzso protein first identified in tomato zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with the zzso specifically in zzso cells of the root zzso zzso into cell cycle after callus induction from differentiated root segments zzso their zzso zzso Based on green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso labeling data, the proteins are associated with the outer zzso and the nuclear pores in zzso cells and with the immature cell plate during zzso zzso zzso suppression of the zzso WPP family causes shorter primary roots, a reduced number of lateral roots, and reduced zzso activity of the root zzso Together, these data demonstrate the existence of regulated zzso targeting in plants and identify a class of zzso zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso
