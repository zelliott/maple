The zzso zzso zzso gene is involved in zzso processes in early zzso and in the structural organization of indirect flight zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso zzso binding domain and an zzso zzso repeat zzso interaction zzso The zzso human zzso gene encodes a zzso protein with zzso zzso acid sequence identity and is deleted in zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso gene and determined its zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso has 29 zzso compared with 13 in zzso zzso and 3 in zzso zzso The positions of several zzso are zzso in zzso genes and in the zzso and zzso of the zzso regions giving indications of zzso gene family zzso In keeping with its function in indirect flight muscle in zzso the human zzso gene was most highly expressed in zzso The zzso gene lies adjacent to zzso the human zzso of the zzso zzso tumor zzso gene zzso giant zzso The 3' end of the zzso transcript zzso the 3' end of the zzso transcript, and the corresponding mouse genes zzso and zzso also zzso The overlap region contains zzso signals for both genes and is strongly zzso between human and zzso
