The zzso nuclear zzso zzso K zzso zzso domain is an zzso zzso module that binds short zzso zzso zzso zzso most often are present in multiple copies per zzso In zzso studies of zzso K and other zzso domain bearing proteins have yielded conflicting results regarding the relative contribution of each zzso domain to the binding of target zzso To assess this zzso we used full-length zzso K, its fragments and the zzso zzso as zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that in this zzso in zzso system, the three zzso zzso bind zzso zzso and that a single zzso domain, in comparison, binds zzso zzso
