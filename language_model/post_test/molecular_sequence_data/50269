zzso of zzso populations was achieved using an arbitrarily selected primer at low stringency for first and second strand zzso zzso zzso amplification was then used to amplify the zzso The method required only a few zzso of total zzso and was unaffected by low levels of zzso double stranded DNA zzso A zzso pattern of ten to zzso clearly visible zzso products was obtained from any one zzso zzso in zzso fingerprints were detected for zzso from the same tissue isolated from different mouse strains and for zzso from different zzso from the same zzso The zzso differences revealed are probably due to sequence zzso and should be useful for genetic mapping of zzso The zzso differences revealed may be useful for studying differential gene zzso Examples of zzso differences were zzso zzso expression was confirmed for these products by Northern analysis and DNA sequencing uncovered two new zzso zzso The method should be zzso to the detection of differences between zzso populations in a wide variety of zzso
