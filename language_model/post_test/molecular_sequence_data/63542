Root zzso vitally contribute to plant nutrition and fitness zzso zzso root zzso confined to four plant orders, encompasses two distinct types of associations, the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso bacteria and zzso zzso where the bacterial zzso are zzso of the zzso zzso Although several genetic components of the zzso interaction have been identified in zzso the genetic basis of zzso formation is zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso gene zzso which is required for zzso in zzso is also necessary for zzso formation in the tree zzso zzso This indicates that both types of zzso zzso share genetic zzso Like several other zzso genes involved in the interaction with zzso zzso is also required for the interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is involved in AM formation in zzso zzso as well and can restore both zzso and AM zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso functions as a vital component of the genetic basis for both zzso and zzso zzso and is zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
