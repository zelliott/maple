A novel zzso organic compound, zzso has been characterized as a potent zzso of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso We designed this experimental study to evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso injury of the rat zzso 

Following general zzso the left zzso pulmonary artery and vein were clamped for 1 zzso zzso was administered continuously beginning 30 minutes before the onset of zzso and extending for 2 hours after zzso zzso zzso rats were divided into 4 groups according to the dose of zzso at the rate of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in each zzso After the optimal dose was obtained from the result of zzso survival rate, the group with the optimal dose was compared with a control group by using such parameters as zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso oxygen tension zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Survival rate of the group received zzso at the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso was best among the 4 zzso zzso levels and zzso levels after zzso of zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso higher in the zzso group than in the control zzso After zzso zzso zzso beta was lower in the zzso group than in the control group, and the expression of zzso zzso zzso was reduced in the zzso group compared with the control zzso In zzso study after zzso of zzso zzso damage with zzso and zzso zzso localized along the zzso duct were observed in the control group, whereas these findings were remarkably less evident in the zzso zzso 

We concluded that zzso ameliorates zzso injury of the lung and may inhibit the production of zzso zzso by means of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
