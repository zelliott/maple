The zzso as a catalyst for protein zzso is universal and essential for all zzso Here we describe the structure of the genes zzso human zzso proteins zzso and compare this class of genes among several zzso Using zzso and full-length zzso zzso we characterized 73 zzso genes and found that zzso zzso starts at a C zzso within a characteristic zzso zzso zzso the promoter region is zzso rich, but often has a zzso box or similar sequence zzso zzso the genes are small zzso zzso but have as many as zzso zzso on zzso zzso the zzso zzso is in the first or second zzso and is within plus minus 5 zzso of the first zzso boundaries in about half of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are significantly smaller zzso zzso and 56 zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes from humans, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed the coding sequences to be highly zzso zzso zzso on average), although gene size and the number of zzso zzso The positions of the zzso are also zzso among these species as zzso zzso of human zzso are present at the same position in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting zzso genes are highly suitable for studying the evolution of zzso
