zzso is a zzso protein that functions in complexes with other zzso proteins to regulate gene expression during zzso and zzso zzso proteins bind DNA zzso as zzso or higher order complexes with Meis family members and zzso proteins and are believed to specify cell identity during zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso in partnership with zzso can regulate zzso neural markers and neural crest marker genes during zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein was isolated and shown to be expressed throughout zzso zzso expression zzso with zzso in several areas, including the lateral neural zzso zzso zzso arch, zzso and zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso can zzso with zzso to promote zzso neural and neural crest gene expression in zzso zzso Further, a physical interaction between these two zzso proteins is necessary for induction of these genes in embryonic zzso In addition, zzso of zzso and zzso leads to a prominent shift in the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear transport or retention of zzso may depend upon zzso Finally, expression of a zzso construct in which zzso protein is fused to the zzso domain from zzso zzso zzso zzso neural and neural crest gene zzso These data indicate that zzso and its partner, zzso function in a zzso zzso complex during zzso and neural crest zzso
