A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a human bone cell zzso library and used to examine zzso protein structure, zzso structure and expression in human zzso The deduced protein sequence shows complete identity with a recently isolated zzso form and extensive zzso to mouse and bovine zzso The protein is rich in zzso zzso which are zzso between species except for zzso zzso which is only present in the zzso In the human, zzso zzso is of two sizes, zzso and zzso zzso the former being dominant in all zzso zzso Human zzso was detected in the Ewing zzso and in zzso cell and tissue zzso The potential folded structure of zzso zzso was estimated, based on computer predictions, and indicates the presence of a zzso at the zzso end of the message which includes the start of zzso Southern analysis of human zzso DNA using zzso zzso zzso as probe demonstrates a simple zzso pattern confirming earlier studies that the zzso gene is present in one copy per zzso human zzso
