Taste perception is an important component of an zzso zzso The identification of zzso taste zzso genes in the last decade has enabled molecular genetic studies of the evolution of taste perception in the context of the ecology and dietary preferences of zzso Although such analyses have been conducted in a number of species for bitter taste zzso a similar analysis of sweet taste receptors is zzso Here, we survey the sole sweet zzso zzso gene zzso in 42 bat species that represent all major lineages of the order zzso one of the most diverse groups of zzso in terms of zzso We found that zzso is under strong zzso selection in the majority of the bats zzso with no significant difference in the strength of the selection between insect eaters and fruit zzso However, zzso is a zzso in all three vampire bat species and the functional relaxation likely started in their common zzso probably due to the exclusive feeding of vampire bats on blood and their reliance on infrared sensors rather than taste perception to locate blood zzso Our survey of available zzso zzso together with previous reports, revealed additional losses of zzso in zzso cat, chicken, zebra zzso and western clawed frog, indicating that sweet perception is not as zzso as previously zzso Nonetheless, we found no common dietary pattern among the zzso zzso suggesting different causes for the losses of zzso in different zzso The complexity of the ecological factors that impact the evolution of zzso calls for a better understanding of the zzso roles of sweet perception in different zzso
