The zzso of free energy differences from computer simulation of zzso systems is important for rational strategies for drug design and for protein zzso As an example of one zzso we have studied the free energy change resulting from the conversion of a polar group zzso to an zzso group zzso in zzso zzso We have estimated the effect of various local environments on the magnitude of the free energy difference and find that significant environmental effects are zzso We have also studied the reliability of the results in zzso
