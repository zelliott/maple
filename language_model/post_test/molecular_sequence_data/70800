The heat stable inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso contains both a nuclear export signal zzso and a high affinity zzso region that is essential for zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso These functions are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso zzso zzso to examine its structure free in zzso zzso out of 75 zzso were identified, and examination of the zzso chemical shifts revealed two regions of zzso chemical shifts characteristic of zzso When zzso was fragmented into two functionally distinct peptides for study at higher zzso no significant zzso in chemical shifts or secondary structure were zzso The first ordered region, identified in zzso zzso contains an zzso from zzso zzso This zzso extends by one turn the zzso observed in the crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso The second region of zzso secondary structure, zzso zzso zzso with the nuclear export signal in the zzso zzso zzso This secondary structure consists of a zzso with a zzso face comprised of zzso zzso and zzso followed by a flexible turn containing zzso These four zzso are critical for nuclear export zzso The remainder of the protein in solution appears relatively zzso and this lack of structure surrounding a few essential and zzso signaling elements may be characteristic of a growing family of small regulatory proteins that interact with protein zzso
