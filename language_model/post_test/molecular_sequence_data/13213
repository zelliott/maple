zzso mice carrying zzso genes directed by a zzso segment of the regulatory sequence from the human zzso zzso gene demonstrated high expression in zzso Mice carrying the zzso zzso gene expressed zzso in zzso and zzso cells of the nucleus zzso the zzso corpus zzso zzso and zzso In brains from two independent zzso transgenic founder lines, copy number of zzso zzso exceeded the number of zzso transcripts zzso either mouse zzso zzso or mouse zzso zzso precursor zzso In two transgenic founder lines, the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso of the total soluble proteins of the zzso High expression observed in brain indicates that the zzso promoter is a promising director of brain expression of zzso zzso zzso the promoter has been used to express the three common human zzso E zzso zzso in transgenic mouse zzso The zzso zzso have been implicated in the expression of zzso disease, and the human zzso zzso are reported to interact with different affinities to the brain zzso and zzso protein in zzso zzso of this study demonstrate high expression and production of human zzso proteins in transgenic mouse zzso The model may be used to characterize the interaction of human zzso zzso with other brain proteins and provide information helpful in designing therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso
