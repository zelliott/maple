A zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso spanning the complete external zzso and its borders, has been isolated and characterized by zzso The zzso is zzso zzso long and includes zzso zzso of the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the first 76 zzso of the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso can be divided into three zzso two unique zzso zzso a zzso region of repeated zzso Seven repeats ranging from 80 to 103 zzso can be zzso They are separated by short zzso of zzso zzso zzso Each repeat slightly differs from the others by zzso changes or short zzso zzso of zzso changes common to two units suggests that a zzso arose during the evolution of this zzso The repeated region was zzso and used as a probe to demonstrate that it is highly zzso in stringent conditions it does not zzso with the zzso of zzso genes from closely related species such as zzso zzso products, starting or finishing within the zzso zzso were mapped by northern zzso primer extension and zzso zzso Two major precursors were identified starting respectively at positions zzso and zzso The region surrounding the start at zzso presents extensive zzso with an analogous region in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, longer transcripts can be zzso Several 3' ends downstream of the zzso zzso were also zzso Taken together these results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso processing in plants are more complex than anticipated from previous zzso
