zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso represent a specific target for zzso drug zzso We zzso a series of zzso zzso with different zzso groups and modifications at individual positions and tested them with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The kinetic parameters indicated that all three zzso prefer binding of zzso containing bulky zzso zzso between positions zzso and zzso The most divergent specificity was found for zzso The sequence alignment of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso modeling of zzso with the crystal structure of zzso and the complex of zzso with a zzso inhibitor showed that the overall folds of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso formed by zzso bonds between zzso zzso and zzso are significantly shorter in zzso and a unique zzso following zzso 129 in zzso results in the formation of a loop that can interact with inhibitor zzso These zzso structural differences might lead to its altered zzso to zzso
