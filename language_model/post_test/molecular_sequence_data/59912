The bacterial protein zzso zzso toxin zzso of zzso zzso and zzso toxin zzso of zzso coli, induce zzso by enhancing the zzso activity of the small zzso of man and rabbit zzso zzso This zzso effect is zzso by toxin binding to a zzso zzso the zzso zzso Gal beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso However, zzso but not CT, was recently shown by us to bind also to zzso Gal beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso identified in the target zzso By molecular modeling of this zzso in the known binding site of zzso the zzso interaction was shown to be limited to the terminal zzso zzso This sequence is expressed in many zzso and we have therefore zzso zzso and zzso prepared from the target zzso In addition to zzso zzso activity for zzso was detected in zzso of human origin and in zzso of zzso However, CT bound only to zzso Two zzso of zzso with slightly different zzso human zzso and zzso zzso were identical in their binding to target zzso and zzso but different regarding zzso which was positive for zzso but negative for zzso This difference is discussed on basis of zzso taking in view the difference at position 13, with zzso in zzso and His in zzso Although zzso is differently recognized in form of zzso by the two toxin zzso we speculate that this sequence in human zzso and rabbit zzso is the basis for the common zzso Much work remains, however, to clear up up this unexpected sophistication in target zzso
