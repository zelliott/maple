The genes zzso zzso and zzso have both recently been mapped to zzso region zzso that is a region alleged to involve one or several zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso This study presents an update zzso of the zzso Region of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and suggests that zzso is localized in the zzso The zzso organization of the human zzso zzso deduced by zzso comparisons of DNA zzso is described for the first time in this zzso In the present study 44 primary zzso were screened for zzso by analysis of the zzso sequences of the zzso In two out of the 44 zzso this detected in the zzso gene one rare zzso zzso that caused a zzso to a polar zzso acid exchange in a preserved zzso patch of zzso One case was zzso due to deletion of the more common zzso of this zzso Out of zzso normal control zzso only one was found to carry this zzso zzso so in respect of it, no healthy control individual out of 97 was zzso Moreover, our zzso expression studies showed that zzso is preferably expressed in zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser degree in zzso zzso We conclude that although coding zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso zzso our discovery of a rare zzso in two zzso cases should be taken to warrant further studies of the role of zzso in zzso zzso
