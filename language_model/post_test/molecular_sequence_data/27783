zzso elaborated membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso contain both linear and circular zzso Because little is known about the interactions between DNA and zzso studies were initiated to identify specific proteins that bind DNA in elaborated membrane zzso Western zzso of zzso and zzso proteins from zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso DNA, zzso or synthetic DNA zzso containing intact or altered zzso transformation zzso zzso The specificity and sensitivity of a zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso and the zzso was used to zzso zzso complexes on the zzso The complexes were then characterized by molecular mass, zzso zzso and expression in zzso zzso The zzso effectively detected zzso zzso zzso At least 17 zzso zzso proteins were zzso unique zzso occurred in zzso and zzso Certain zzso proteins had varied affinities for zzso and zzso DNA, and the intact transformation zzso sequence competitively displaced the altered sequence from a zzso protein at 11 zzso zzso A dud zzso strain zzso lacked zzso activity at the zzso protein in zzso The segregation of zzso proteins within zzso and zzso zzso with their distinct protein profiles and suggests that these zzso may play different zzso Although the zzso proteins expressed in zzso may influence the zzso export of plasmids within zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein may bind transforming zzso
