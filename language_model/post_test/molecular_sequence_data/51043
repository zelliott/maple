The zzso associated with a zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso was shown to generate a fusion between the 3' part of the CAN gene on zzso 9 and the zzso part of the zzso gene on zzso zzso The same part of the CAN gene appeared to be involved in a case of acute zzso leukemia zzso as well, where it was fused to the zzso zzso zzso sequences around the zzso zzso were determined in two zzso samples and in the case of the zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso markers and terminal zzso zzso was shown to be one of the characteristics of zzso zzso no addition of random zzso at the zzso zzso could be zzso In addition, the zzso regions did not reveal zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or zzso zzso The sequence in which the zzso zzso occurred was enriched in zzso zzso the specific zzso in which zzso of zzso occurs in zzso and CAN both contain a zzso zzso As zzso elements occur with a moderate frequency in the human zzso the presence of such an element in both zzso regions may be more than coincidental and may play a role in the zzso zzso
