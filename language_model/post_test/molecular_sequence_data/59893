Following a recent zzso analysis of all 39 species of the zzso zzso and related organisms, the name zzso zzso has been proposed for bacteria previously considered either as zzso zzso or as zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the zzso integrity of this newly proposed species, we determined the zzso zzso gene sequences of 10 zzso isolated from various environmental zzso All 10 zzso clustered within a zzso group containing all other members of the zzso zzso Eight of the 10 zzso formed a zzso zzso within the zzso which also included the two previously characterized zzso zzso zzso Four of these 10 zzso shared a specific and very close relationship with the zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso sequence zzso However, although clearly zzso the remaining two zzso strains bore no specific evolutionary relationship to either zzso zzso or any other zzso species zzso zzso sequence zzso Both zzso lay on their own relatively zzso branches within the radiation of the zzso zzso zzso do not, therefore, represent a unique species or even a single line of descent within the zzso and investigation of more zzso may reveal them to be as zzso diverse as the other presently recognized zzso zzso
