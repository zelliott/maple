zzso of genes using small interfering zzso zzso is a recently developed strategy to regulate the synthesis of target zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 6 zzso is a nuclear zzso factor that mediates zzso zzso 

To zzso the therapeutic potential of using zzso to inhibit zzso in allergic zzso we determined the zzso sequences of zzso specific for zzso 

The selected sequences of zzso zzso specifically inhibited the generation of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso and zzso zzso production in response to zzso in zzso Local administration of zzso zzso in zzso alleviated contact hypersensitivity responses to chemical zzso This was accompanied by reduced local production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, consecutive zzso zzso of zzso zzso markedly inhibited inflammatory cellular zzso of zzso zzso in allergic zzso responses in association with reduced zzso and zzso production from regional zzso zzso zzso Immediate responses, such as zzso and zzso rubbing behaviors, were also improved by zzso zzso 

Local administration of zzso zzso is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for both zzso zzso diseases and allergic zzso
