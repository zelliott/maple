Human zzso precursor from normal or stressed zzso cells were studied by zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso and by zzso zzso mapping of zzso from cells that had been labeled in zzso with zzso zzso cells to 43 degrees C decreased the amount of newly zzso zzso to less than zzso of the control level and led to greater than zzso zzso of zzso termination at a region zzso to 362 zzso downstream of the 3' end of zzso zzso with zzso continuing into the next zzso zzso zzso of cells to 42 degrees C led to zzso zzso of termination at this zzso 50% of transcripts that extended into the zzso zzso ended in a region 200 to 210 zzso upstream of the zzso I zzso I) initiation zzso This is presumed to be the human upstream zzso termination site because of the absence of zzso with a zzso end corresponding to this region, the location relative to the Pol I initiation site (which is similar to the location of upstream zzso in other zzso and the fact that it is 15 to 25 zzso upstream of the sequence zzso which has an zzso base identity with the sequence 3' of the downstream termination zzso Surprisingly, treatment of cells with sodium zzso which also leads to the induction of a stress response, did not inhibit zzso Pol I initiation was decreased to the same extent as zzso which lends support to the hypothesis that termination and initiation are zzso Although termination was almost completely inhibited at 43 degrees C, the majority of the recently zzso zzso were processed to have the correct 3' end of zzso This finding suggests that zzso formation can involve an zzso cut and is not solely dependent on zzso trimming of correctly terminated zzso
