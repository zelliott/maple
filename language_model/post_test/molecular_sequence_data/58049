zzso I zzso zzso zzso the transformation of zzso and zzso to zzso We have isolated human zzso clones zzso zzso I from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso encodes a protein of 184 zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso The zzso acid composition calculated from the deduced zzso acid sequence agreed with that reported for zzso I zzso from human zzso The zzso coli cells carrying the expression zzso of this zzso acquired zzso resistance and the cell zzso showed the high activity of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of human zzso I exhibited 57% identity with zzso zzso zzso I at the zzso two-thirds, suggesting that the two zzso may have originated from a common zzso
