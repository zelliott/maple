zzso cells zzso bind to the zzso zzso domain of zzso depending on the zzso state of zzso alpha 4 beta zzso In this study, we have identified a synthetic zzso derived from the zzso zzso domain of zzso that promotes zzso of zzso zzso cells (a zzso cell line) in a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was active to inhibit zzso of zzso zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso A zzso with scrambled version of zzso lost the zzso activity on the zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso promoted the zzso of zzso zzso cells to an extent comparable to that of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells on zzso zzso was inhibited both by zzso 4 beta 1 zzso and by zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso The other zzso zzso was also a weak zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso acid sequence defined by zzso zzso contributes to the main zzso activity of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The regulation of interactions of alpha 4 beta 1 zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso may have important implications for the migration and function of zzso zzso
