The human zzso protein zzso can impart zzso zzso activity to the zzso serum response element zzso by interacting with serum response factor zzso This activity is shared with other zzso class zzso but not with more zzso related zzso To understand the mechanism of action of zzso at the zzso and the basis for the selective activity of zzso class zzso in this context, we performed a detailed zzso of the zzso zzso We found that zzso acid zzso that contact the major groove of the DNA are required for zzso zzso in zzso suggesting an in zzso requirement for zzso DNA contact by the zzso In contrast, substitution of a zzso zzso in the zzso arm of the zzso zzso appeared to abolish DNA binding without affecting activity in zzso Certain zzso on the exposed surfaces of zzso 1 and 2, not required for DNA zzso abolished activity in zzso suggesting that these surfaces contact an accessory zzso required for this zzso We also found that transfer of a single zzso acid zzso from the surface of zzso zzso 1 to the corresponding position in the zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the ability to activate the zzso in zzso We propose that zzso interacts with one or more factors at the zzso in addition to zzso and that the specificity of this interaction is determined by zzso on the surfaces of zzso 1 and zzso
