The aim of the work was to explore the utility of the zzso zzso focusing zzso zzso zzso That method was proved to be the alternative separation method of zzso of protein zzso zzso in zzso Analysis of the identification of peptides was performed with the use of zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso For that research, previously designed the zzso zzso zzso zzso device (75 zzso volume for each zzso based on zzso gel zzso with zzso technology was zzso To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of zzso zzso combined with zzso peptides zzso bovine serum zzso zzso digest and mixture of five proteins digest were zzso First, zzso of bovine serum zzso digest sample was performed using zzso zzso Studies performed for that simple mixture of peptides proved the ability of the zzso device to focus peptides mostly in one zzso zzso performed the correlation analysis between zzso and zzso values for identified peptides proved the possibility to obtain zzso useful high zzso That information was found to have a potential value for construction of additional constraint during false zzso evaluation process among identified zzso Next, studies on the zzso zzso were combined with the evaluation of practical use of zzso zzso tips to zzso peptides in the case of simple mixture of zzso For this, five proteins digest samples were zzso The analysis without prior any zzso enabled to identify very limited number of zzso The significant improvement was obtained when one used zzso alone or with combination with zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso The proposed approach based on zzso zzso focusing proved to be an efficient and accurate alternative zzso method of protein zzso and can be considered as the first useful dimension in two-dimensional zzso zzso Moreover, zzso information from that zzso zzso method can be considered as the additional source of database matching zzso It can also be a valuable tool for zzso and zzso studies of peptides zzso in zzso
