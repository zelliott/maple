zzso balance in zzso cells is maintained in part by zzso repression of gene zzso for the low density zzso zzso and zzso in the cholesterol zzso zzso A promoter sequence termed the zzso regulatory element zzso is essential for this zzso With the use of an zzso containing the zzso to screen a human zzso complementary DNA expression library, a clone for a DNA binding protein was isolated that binds to the zzso zzso zzso in both a zzso and a zzso zzso This protein contains seven highly zzso zinc finger repeats that exhibit striking sequence similarity to zzso zzso acid binding proteins zzso We have designated the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a wide variety of zzso is up regulated by zzso and exhibits binding specificity that zzso with in zzso zzso These properties are consistent with a role in zzso control of zzso
