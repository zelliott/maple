We identified a novel family of proteins that have a VHS domain and an zzso zzso gamma ear zzso domain that is zzso to the ear domain of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso When zzso the zzso called zzso zzso and zzso localized to the zzso network zzso and often caused fragmentation and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso of the zzso proteins as well as those of zzso are able to interact with zzso which was previously shown to localized in the zzso region and interact with zzso Furthermore, zzso and either of the zzso proteins zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso proteins regulate the function of the zzso or membrane trafficking from this compartment and that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso like the ear domain of zzso are involved in interaction with molecules that zzso their zzso
