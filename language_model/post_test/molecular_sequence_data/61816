In this study, we investigated the role of the zzso form of heat shock protein 70 zzso in the presentation of the major putative zzso in multiple zzso zzso basic protein zzso in the context of appropriate zzso class zzso By zzso we found that zzso is associated with zzso in zzso in an zzso zzso Additionally, using zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso of zzso where it zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were shown to bind selectively and specifically to zzso by surface zzso zzso The functional significance of zzso interaction with zzso was demonstrated by the detection of enhanced responses of an zzso T cell zzso to zzso and zzso zzso with increasing levels of zzso and reduced responses when zzso expression was diminished within zzso zzso zzso zzso However, when zzso zzso was used as the zzso T cell zzso responses were not enhanced by zzso zzso within zzso suggesting that zzso contributes to zzso processing rather than zzso zzso The importance of a direct association between zzso and zzso in the presentation pathways was demonstrated by enhanced efficacy of zzso presentation by zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso a fusion zzso zzso This is the first report on the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso class zzso zzso processing by zzso It implicates that zzso self zzso expression may lead to the zzso of zzso zzso
