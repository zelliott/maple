Human infection with zzso zzso leads to zzso disease, which presents as several different clinical conditions ranging from an zzso form to a severe zzso zzso Several studies have demonstrated that T cells play a critical role in the development of cardiac pathology, as well as in zzso during chronic zzso However, the mechanisms that drive protective or zzso T cell response are not zzso We have shown that zzso T cells from zzso patients zzso express T cell zzso zzso zzso variable region zzso zzso The aim of this work was to determine whether T cells expressing this particular zzso region displayed variable or restricted zzso zzso as an indicator of the nature of the stimulus leading to the zzso of these T cells in zzso Additionally, we aimed to evaluate zzso characteristics of these cells that might be associated with zzso zzso zzso region sequencing of zzso expressing zzso T cells revealed the occurrence of a highly zzso zzso region with zzso zzso zzso region usage among patients with zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Moreover, correlation analysis indicated that the frequency of zzso cells is associated with zzso A zzso suggesting that these cells might display zzso zzso Together these results provide new insight into T cell recognition of zzso involved in zzso disease and suggest that these cells may be implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso
