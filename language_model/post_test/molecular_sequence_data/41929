A zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso grown in skim milk, was zzso to zzso by zzso zzso exchange zzso in the presence of zzso Its molecular weight was estimated to be 45,000 by zzso and also by the recovery of zzso activity only from this fraction of zzso gel slices of crude zzso It had maximum activity at pH zzso and 42 degrees zzso Since the activity was completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso it was suggested to be a zzso zzso It zzso zzso zzso and zzso but did not zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The 10 main peptides liberated from zzso and the 15 peptides liberated from zzso were isolated by reversed phase zzso These peptides were zzso by zzso and their zzso acid compositions were analyzed and zzso Many of peptides were located in the zzso parts of zzso and zzso zzso bonds zzso by the zzso had no clear specificity but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences frequently zzso
