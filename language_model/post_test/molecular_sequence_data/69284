We have isolated and characterized a new zzso cell line designated as zzso which was obtained by zzso of zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso derived from the zzso gene was proved to be expressed on exposure of the zzso cells to zzso the highest value being attained at 8 zzso zzso cells rapidly extended zzso processes within 24 h in response to zzso as well as nerve growth factor zzso The time of onset of zzso outgrowth induced by zzso corresponded to the time when the highest zzso zzso level was zzso The zzso content of zzso cells was found to be twice that of zzso zzso A time course study on the effects of zzso or zzso on cells showed that the former caused an increase in zzso a major zzso to twofold the control level at 48 h after the treatment, while the latter caused a decrease in the zzso zzso These effects on catecholamines were almost the same in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso cells was enhanced by both zzso and zzso whereas that of zzso cells was enhanced by zzso but not by zzso The changes in zzso activity were correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were not different from zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited extremely decreased zzso as compared with zzso zzso The zzso and zzso properties of zzso cells remained constant, even after repeated zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
