We previously reported that the expression of the wheat zzso gene is regulated by an zzso zzso rhythm and by the zzso zzso both in wheat and in transgenic tobacco zzso To define regulatory elements necessary for the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we now zzso the fluctuation of zzso zzso levels in a series of zzso deletion zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso We found that the expression of a deletion zzso containing 211 zzso upstream sequence still exhibited zzso zzso zzso we show that an zzso sequence of the zzso promoter (from zzso to zzso can zzso a zzso gene consisting of a truncated zzso promoter (from zzso to zzso and the bacterial zzso zzso gene with zzso zzso gene zzso Finally we demonstrate by nuclear zzso experiments that the zzso rates of the Cab genes in wheat zzso in a rhythmic manner, with a zzso of approximately 24 zzso zzso with our previous findings these results zzso indicate that the expression of the wheat zzso gene is regulated mainly at the zzso level and zzso identify a short promoter region between zzso and zzso that is responsible for the zzso zzso gene zzso
