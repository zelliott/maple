Iron zzso binding proteins are isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso milk and zzso On the basis of several criteria it is shown that the milk proteins are not zzso but are zzso similar to the corresponding zzso from the zzso The zzso of the zzso particularly the zzso milk zzso is, at least in part, due to different levels of zzso zzso Their zzso sequences (30 zzso are determined and compared with those of other zzso and zzso The role of the proteins is zzso
