zzso of zzso zzso strains have rearranged frequently during their evolution, partly due to multiple integrated sequences of zzso zzso To understand better the role of viral sequences in zzso evolution, we examined available zzso sequences of zzso elements in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of integrated and zzso sequences of zzso virus zzso DNA suggested that it is an zzso form of the circular zzso intermediate belonging to an zzso sequence zzso family zzso One zzso viral DNA zzso was identified as interrupting the remains of a DNA zzso modification zzso zzso A viral DNA zzso of zzso B DNA had hallmarks of having suffered an internal deletion by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso likely was responsible for several deletions within viral zzso A zzso zzso event was zzso between part of a viral DNA zzso and a similar zzso zzso zzso sequences from zzso C4 open reading frames zzso were identified as involved in a complex zzso zzso Thus, zzso sequences likely have altered zzso zzso by inserting within active zzso destroying their function, by providing targets for zzso zzso by zzso deletions of sequences adjacent to their integration sites, and by providing targets for zzso zzso leading to zzso
