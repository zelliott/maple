The zzso of zzso light chains by zzso light chain zzso zzso is a key event in zzso zzso cell gap formation and vascular zzso We now report the cloning and expression of a zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso of a human zzso cell zzso library identified a zzso zzso zzso with substantial zzso zzso zzso to the coding region of the rabbit and bovine smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso acid zzso as well as with the reported avian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also identified, however, a zzso stretch of novel sequence zzso acids zzso which is not contained in the open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso and is only zzso zzso to the avian zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed a 214 zzso high molecular weight zzso in bovine and human zzso which exhibits zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed zzso zzso consensus sequences for a variety of protein zzso including highly zzso potential zzso sites for zzso protein zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels markedly enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest potentially novel mechanisms of zzso cell contraction and barrier zzso
