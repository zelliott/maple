To promote host zzso many plant pathogens zzso zzso proteins that either suppress or counteract host zzso However, when these zzso are recognized by the zzso innate immune system, they trigger resistance rather than promoting zzso zzso are therefore key molecules in determining disease zzso or zzso We show here that zzso zzso by the vascular zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows both activities: it is required for full zzso in a susceptible host and also triggers resistance in tomato plants carrying the resistance gene zzso Point zzso in zzso causing single zzso acid changes, are associated with zzso zzso These point zzso prevent recognition by zzso both in tomato and when both genes are zzso in leaves of zzso zzso zzso strains carrying the zzso zzso are equally zzso showing that zzso and zzso functions can be zzso Although zzso is zzso into the zzso sap when zzso zzso tomato, the zzso protein can be recognized zzso by zzso zzso zzso by host zzso
