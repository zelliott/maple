Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from an inland salt lake of zzso Both have zzso zzso cells that lyse in distilled water, stain zzso and form zzso zzso They are zzso require at least zzso zzso for growth under the optimum growth temperature of zzso The major polar lipids of the two strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two major zzso zzso and zzso zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Trace amounts of two unidentified lipids zzso and zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of the two strains are zzso zzso show zzso similarity to the closest relative members of zzso of the family zzso The zzso gene similarity between strains zzso and zzso is zzso and show zzso similarity to the closest relative members of zzso The DNA zzso content of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso value between strain zzso and strain zzso was zzso and the two strains showed low zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the most related member of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso properties suggest that strains zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
