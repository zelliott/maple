The zzso head consists of a zzso motor or zzso domain that contains both the zzso and zzso binding sites, and a neck region which consists of a zzso zzso zzso that emerges from the zzso part of the heavy chain and is stabilized by the binding of the essential and regulatory light zzso High levels of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II, were produced in zzso zzso and zzso using a rapid extraction protocol and metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso functional protein was obtained per gram of zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that the zzso protein still has all the typical properties of a zzso zzso However, the removal of the light chain domain does have a pronounced effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso slower for zzso than for a zzso head zzso that includes the neck zzso In contrast, the rate of zzso binding and zzso the zzso zzso domain is zzso zzso zzso the results indicate that the zzso of the heavy chain affects the zzso binding site and the communication between the zzso and zzso binding zzso Furthermore, it seems that the zzso site of zzso is not fully formed but binding to zzso or zzso zzso the structure in general and the zzso binding site in zzso
