zzso zzso factor one alpha zzso zzso genes are part of the large zzso binding protein zzso The zzso family is important for protein synthesis and zzso filament and bundle zzso In this study, the expression of four zzso genes in zzso zzso is zzso zzso analyses of the gene family showed high expression levels in zzso seeds, zzso and shoot and root zzso zzso real time zzso was used to determine individual zzso gene zzso Unlike animals, in zzso zzso all four zzso genes were expressed in all zzso zzso However, the abundance of each transcript varied zzso zzso out expression of one zzso gene produced zzso with stunted roots and a subsequent change in expression of the other three zzso zzso The varying abundance of each gene in different zzso may indicate different concentration requirements for each message zzso These results will be very useful for zzso the role of each gene in growth, development, and stress responses of the zzso
