The unique species specificity of the bacterial zzso zzso is explained by its requirement for the human complement regulator zzso as the primary zzso zzso studies using individual zzso of zzso mapped the zzso site to domain 4 and swap zzso between human and rabbit zzso zzso implicated a short sequence zzso zzso in human zzso in binding zzso We set out to map more closely the zzso binding site in zzso We first looked for regions of zzso between domain 4 in zzso and the terminal complement components that bind zzso zzso and zzso A nine zzso acid sequence immediately adjacent the zzso segment in zzso domain 4 matched (5 of 9 zzso 3 of 9 zzso a sequence in zzso A zzso containing this sequence caused zzso zzso of zzso zzso of human zzso and rendered zzso more susceptible to complement zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis of zzso binding to immobilized zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso binding and a calculated affinity of zzso zzso zzso of three zzso from the putative binding site caused a zzso reduction in zzso potency of zzso and reduced affinity for immobilized zzso by zzso The demonstration that a zzso modeled on the zzso site zzso zzso zzso leads us to suggest that such peptides might be useful in treating infections caused by zzso zzso
