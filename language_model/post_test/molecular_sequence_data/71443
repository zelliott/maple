Biological data support the hypothesis that there are multiple species in the zzso zzso but a recent analysis of the available genetic data suggested that there is insufficient evidence for species zzso In order to resolve the controversy in the zzso of this zzso zzso we characterized the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and performed a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Our study revealed that the zzso zzso contains the zzso distinct species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is consistent with the biological characteristics and host specificity zzso The zzso species formed two zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonging to one zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonging to the other zzso Within zzso zzso human zzso zzso and guinea pig zzso zzso as zzso zzso each differed from bovine zzso zzso by the zzso sequence in four zzso A zzso zzso isolate from cattle was also different from zzso isolated from a rock zzso and a zzso zzso Minor differences were also detected between zzso zzso zzso from snakes and zzso Based on the genetic information, a zzso and zzso zzso zzso length zzso diagnostic tool was zzso
