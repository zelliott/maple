Four patients zzso acquired zzso zzso in the serum within 2 to 4 weeks after the zzso zzso zzso was detected in at least one of the blood units received by three patients, all of whose units were available for testing, with a sequence in the zzso 3 region identical to that from the corresponding zzso Three patients developed elevated zzso zzso levels which persisted for two weeks or longer in two of zzso
