We have studied the structural components and architecture of the zzso zzso of a strongly zzso channel zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by systematically examining zzso modification by zzso zzso of zzso zzso engineered into two zzso zzso In a stretch of 33 zzso acids in the zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso and 22 zzso acids in the zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso 15 and 11 zzso respectively, were found to be accessible to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and presumably project into the zzso zzso zzso The pattern of accessibility suggests that both stretches may adopt an extended loop zzso To explore the physical dimension of the zzso zzso we zzso linked a constrained number (one to four) of positively charged zzso of different sizes to the zzso position and found that this zzso region is sufficiently wide to accommodate four zzso groups with dimensions of 12 A zzso 10 A zzso 6 zzso These results suggest that regions in both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso channel form a long and wide zzso zzso that zzso beyond the membrane into the zzso
