We have previously shown that zzso gamma 1 zzso zzso zzso levels increase in response to treatment of rat zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso Richardson, zzso zzso Gordon, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 268 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso gamma zzso gene expression is likely to be zzso zzso As the zzso gamma zzso gene promoter had not previously been cloned in the zzso we cloned the zzso region of this gene from a rat zzso zzso Like the human and zzso zzso gamma zzso gene zzso the rat zzso gamma zzso gene zzso spanning from zzso zzso to zzso relative to the start zzso is zzso rich and lacks zzso or zzso zzso This rat zzso gamma zzso gene promoter region appears to contain at least two zzso initiation sites, zzso position zzso and zzso In transient zzso in zzso the zzso and zzso fragments cloned upstream of a zzso reporter gene had very little zzso activity and were not zzso beta zzso In sharp contrast, a zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity and was zzso beta zzso The zzso zzso contains motifs that recognize zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities in zzso nuclear zzso zzso the results of this study suggest that multiple zzso zzso factors may regulate zzso gamma zzso gene promoter activity in zzso
