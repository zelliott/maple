The last few years have seen extensive efforts to zzso human genetic variation and correlate it with zzso zzso Most common zzso have now been assessed in zzso studies for statistical associations with many complex traits, including many important common zzso Although these studies have provided new biological zzso only a limited amount of the zzso component of any complex trait has been identified and it remains a challenge to zzso the functional link between associated zzso and zzso zzso zzso advances, such as the ability to detect rare and structural zzso and a clear understanding of the challenges in linking different types of variation with zzso will be essential for future zzso
