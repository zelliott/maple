We identified a single zzso acid zzso that abolished the zzso of human zzso zzso The zzso was identified by screening a zzso zzso gamma expression library for molecules with altered biological zzso The zzso protein was expressed at high levels in zzso coli, and remained soluble upon zzso However, the protein was completely inactive in all zzso gamma zzso investigated, exhibiting less than zzso of the specific activity of native zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso this zzso protein showed that the zzso at position 111 of native human zzso gamma is changed to zzso acid zzso zzso Other zzso at this site showed that only zzso zzso acids at position 111 maintain zzso though low, biological zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso protein by zzso as well as CD zzso demonstrated that the protein has limited zzso differences from native zzso zzso Models of the X-ray crystal structure of human zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso Cook, zzso zzso zzso Carson, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) Science, zzso zzso suggest that this zzso zzso is located at a severe 55 degrees bend in the zzso F zzso We conclude that zzso lies within or affects the zzso binding domain of human zzso zzso
