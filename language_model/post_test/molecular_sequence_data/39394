Human DNA zzso N zzso or pol zzso is the most recently discovered nuclear DNA zzso in the human zzso It is an zzso DNA zzso related to zzso coli pol I, human zzso and zzso zzso We report the first zzso of the zzso zzso and examination of its zzso properties, as a step toward understanding the functions of zzso zzso for an zzso DNA zzso zzso is a low zzso zzso incorporating T opposite template G with a frequency of zzso and G opposite template T with a frequency of zzso The frequency of zzso of T opposite template G is higher than any other known DNA zzso zzso has a zzso of DNA synthesis zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli pol I, is inhibited by zzso and resistant to zzso The strand displacement activity of zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso can perform zzso synthesis past zzso zzso a common zzso and zzso product of zzso oxygen species damage to zzso zzso zzso blocks DNA synthesis by most DNA zzso but zzso was particularly adept at efficient and accurate zzso synthesis past a zzso zzso
