zzso is the largest member of a recently discovered family of proteins zzso zzso that appear to function as negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins have been identified by cloning or by comparison to expressed sequence zzso and several of these proteins have been shown recently to function as zzso proteins for zzso alpha zzso Despite the intense interest in zzso proteins as zzso regulators of zzso zzso there is little understanding of the structure and regulation of zzso zzso zzso Using long-distance zzso we amplified and characterized the entire coding and zzso region of the human zzso zzso The coding region of the human zzso gene spans zzso zzso and contains six zzso and the zzso region spans zzso zzso and contains two zzso zzso of the zzso revealed that the zzso domain, zzso among all zzso zzso was zzso by three zzso while the unique zzso domain of zzso was zzso by a single zzso zzso of the location of the zzso boundaries of the human zzso gene to that of the human zzso zzso the only zzso zzso gene described zzso revealed a remarkable zzso providing the first conceptual support for a common ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to map the zzso start site 517 zzso upstream of the translation start site, and anchored zzso was performed to amplify zzso zzso of zzso DNA upstream of the zzso start zzso Analysis of the zzso region revealed the presence of many potential regulatory zzso the presence of an zzso zzso element overlapping the zzso start site, and the absence of a zzso or a zzso box at the usual zzso By radiation hybrid zzso the zzso gene was assigned to human zzso zzso This study is the first to zzso the structure, zzso location, and regulatory sequences of the zzso zzso and it establishes the genetic basis for zzso gene research in zzso
