Several techniques are available to study gene function, but many are less than ideal for zzso zzso zzso a relatively new approach, can be zzso to identify novel zzso in candidate zzso this technique has not produced an zzso zzso with a confirmed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso fatty acid zzso genes were screened for novel zzso in zzso soybean zzso 

Four zzso in independent lines were identified in the zzso zzso gene zzso two zzso resulted in zzso acid zzso and one resulted in an altered seed zzso zzso The resulting zzso was an increase in seed zzso levels as well as a decrease in both zzso and zzso seed zzso zzso Three zzso in independent lines were identified in the zzso fatty acid zzso gene zzso all three zzso resulted in zzso zzso acid zzso and one resulted in an altered seed fatty acid profile that led to an increase in zzso acid and a decrease in zzso acid in the seed zzso 

The zzso zzso controlled by the novel zzso zzso is similar to previously observed seed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to the zzso characteristics of zzso and zzso this represents a positive change in seed zzso The fatty acid zzso controlled by the novel zzso zzso controls an increase in zzso acid in the seed oil, a zzso also observed in a line previously characterized to have a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso marker zzso were developed to reliably detect the inheritance of the zzso zzso and can be used in efficient breeding for these desired seed zzso Our results serve as the first demonstration of the identification of soybean zzso controlling seed zzso discovered through the reverse zzso technique zzso
