Host factors that are important for infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso with zzso A zzso zzso that was resistant to zzso infection was recovered, showing that the gene zzso by the zzso is required for infection by the zzso but not for zzso replication or zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso containing the bacterial DNA zzso one end of the zzso was cloned and shown to be required for zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso reveals the presence of an zzso that encodes a protein of 146 zzso zzso This protein shows zzso identity to the type 4 zzso zzso by the zzso genes of other zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso is thus essential for infection by the zzso zzso
