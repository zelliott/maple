zzso of the LDL zzso gene is markedly enhanced in the zzso T cell line by stimulation with the combination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso The DNA sequences necessary for this response were identified by analysis of zzso T cells permanently zzso with reporter gene expression zzso containing fragments of the LDL zzso promoter extending from 68 zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the major zzso start zzso The magnitude of the response of this array of promoter fragments to stimulation with zzso and zzso was similar to that previously observed with a approximately zzso zzso promoter zzso However, the various promoter fragments differed with regard to the role of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso Thus, whereas a 142 zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso independently of zzso a shorter 115 zzso promoter was absolutely dependent on zzso Furthermore, internal deletion of promoter sequences from zzso zzso to zzso zzso from longer promoter zzso in which the zzso was zzso prevented the induction of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso binding by zzso nuclear proteins to the novel response element mapped between zzso and zzso Even though the minimal 115 zzso or 68 zzso promoter zzso required an intact zzso to respond to zzso and zzso zzso induction persisted when nuclear levels of zzso regulatory element binding proteins zzso were made zzso by culture in zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso stimuli such as the combination of zzso and zzso induce LDL zzso gene zzso through at least two distinct promoter zzso neither of which requires the presence of zzso However, the element zzso to the zzso start site is dependent on the zzso
