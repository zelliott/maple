To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in zzso resistance of rainbow trout, zzso zzso zzso from zzso selected strain in various zzso stages were treated at 22 degrees C for 30 zzso and subsequently developed at 12 degrees C using the zzso strain as a zzso The zzso were evaluated for their zzso rate along with the ratio of zzso having an abnormal appearance and subjected to zzso arbitrarily primed reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso One of the genes zzso expressed in the zzso selected strain zzso zzso coded for zzso c zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the accumulated levels of zzso II transcripts were more abundant in zzso and zzso eggs from the zzso selected strain than those from the zzso zzso Furthermore, the differential expression patterns of the zzso zzso gene were similar to those of the zzso II zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso gene showed no significant differences between the two zzso
