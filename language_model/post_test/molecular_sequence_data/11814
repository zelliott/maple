zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso by the reverse zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso has been successfully applied to the detection for zzso in blood and its zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso for detecting zzso and zzso zzso in the core region for zzso zzso were used in this zzso When 20 cycles of amplification with outer zzso and another 20 cycles with inner zzso were zzso good results were obtained in both specificity and sensitivity of zzso zzso especially by a single tube zzso Of zzso subjects suspected of being infected with zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso subjects who were positive for zzso zzso and in 70 zzso of 147 subjects who were zzso the total detection ratio was zzso The zzso of zzso zzso designated as I, II, III, IV and mixed type zzso zzso and zzso were 0, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, sensitivity in zzso zzso was more improved by a single tube zzso Using two primer sets zzso and B: zzso prepared within the zzso region, it was shown that the zzso of zzso was zzso Of 315 subjects, 232 zzso were positive for zzso with both of A and B primer sets, and 20 or 22 were positive with either A or B primer set, thus indicating that a combination of these two primer sets increased the detection ratio of zzso approximately to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
