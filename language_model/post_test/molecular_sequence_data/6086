The inheritance of a genetic zzso to the development of zzso generally follows an zzso mode of inheritance with high zzso zzso families, however, show evidence of incomplete zzso where individuals can transmit the zzso gene without being affected zzso In these families formal proof of this dogma requires the identification of the zzso zzso In this study we have identified the zzso in cousins with bilateral zzso zzso Using zzso and DNA sequencing, different constitutional zzso were detected in the affected cousins in this zzso One cousin carries a zzso zzso in zzso 8 generating a stop zzso directly which was also present in his affected mother whereas the other cousin carries an 8 base pair deletion in zzso zzso Neither half of the family carried the same zzso as the zzso The mother of the patient with the 8 zzso deletion carried neither of the zzso Thus, we have demonstrated that the zzso in this family have developed as a result of independent, sporadic genetic events which occurred coincidentally in the same extended family rather than being due to a common zzso which zzso as incompletely zzso These observations have important implications for genetic zzso in this type of zzso
