zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso grains were characterized by molecular zzso zzso zzso were identified by amplification of zzso zzso gene and analysis by zzso zzso DNA zzso Analysis zzso using the restriction zzso zzso III, zzso I, and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso for each zzso used, a same zzso pattern between the zzso zzso and the reference strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Other reference zzso and one zzso isolate showed differences in at least one of these zzso The zzso zzso zzso region was also used to discriminate the bacterial zzso at the species zzso The data obtained from the analysis of zzso region confirmed that sequencing of this zzso region is a good tool for a reliable identification of members of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was performed by Random zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained allowed the differentiation of zzso in three zzso The three clusters showed by zzso analysis could be correlated with at least three different strains of zzso zzso species in the group of zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso
