zzso zzso zzso is a checkpoint zzso required for the cellular response to DNA zzso Like human zzso and zzso zzso zzso it contains zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain interacts with zzso zzso and is required for recruitment to DNA zzso zzso The zzso domain is required for zzso but its precise role in DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling is zzso The crystal structure of the zzso domain, alone and in complex with a zzso zzso zzso reveals the structural basis for zzso and direct interaction with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso confirms the functional role of key zzso and allows the generation of zzso in which zzso and zzso binding are separately zzso zzso analysis of these in zzso reveals distinct roles in the DNA damage zzso zzso zzso are zzso sensitive and defective in checkpoint zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formation, while zzso zzso are only slightly sensitive to zzso have extended checkpoint delays, zzso zzso and form zzso zzso However, zzso zzso binding slows formation of zzso protein zzso zzso and reduces levels of zzso zzso zzso indicating a DNA repair zzso
