An zzso fungus was screened out of 26 zzso zzso isolated from soil by zzso zzso analysis based on the alignment of zzso zzso zzso combined with the zzso zzso indicated that the strain zzso was a member of the zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso to apparent zzso by ammonium zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso The molecular size of the zzso zzso is approximately zzso estimated by zzso The zzso has an optimum pH of zzso and an optimum temperature of 45 degrees zzso The zzso is stable between zzso and zzso below 40 degrees zzso The zzso activity is slightly inhibited by zzso , which is dissimilar to other zzso zzso studies of the zzso showed that the zzso and the zzso for zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso The zzso is able to degrade natural zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso was identified by zzso and its inner peptides were zzso by zzso The results show that the zzso is a novel zzso
