Garden asparagus zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso Like zzso plants such as zzso and zzso the zzso of asparagus have two whorls of almost identical zzso zzso called zzso Floral structures of these zzso flowers could be explained by a modified ABC model, in which the expression of the class B genes has expanded to zzso 1, so that the zzso of whorls 1 and 2 have the same zzso zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized two zzso genes zzso and zzso one of class B zzso from zzso Southern zzso showed that zzso and zzso genes are single copy zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that these genes were specifically expressed in male and female zzso In zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso and zzso genes is confined to whorls 2 and 3 zzso zzso and zzso and not detected in zzso 1 zzso zzso The other asparagus class B zzso zzso was also not expressed in outer zzso zzso et zzso zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the class B genes are not involved in the outer zzso development in asparagus, not supporting the modified ABC model in zzso
