Human zzso I plays a critical role in zzso stability by relaxing the DNA zzso tension that arises from a variety of nuclear zzso including zzso transcription, and zzso zzso Human zzso I is a approximately 91 zzso zzso composed of four major zzso a 24 zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso core domain, zzso zzso zzso domain, and zzso zzso zzso domain containing the zzso zzso zzso A zzso crystal structure of a 70 zzso zzso truncated form of human zzso I in zzso complex with a 22 zzso DNA duplex exhibited remarkable zzso zzso shifts in cell zzso of up to 9 A in the b zzso length and up to zzso degrees in the zzso were zzso Eight crystal structures of human zzso I - DNA complexes from this crystal form were determined to between zzso and zzso A zzso These structures revealed both dramatic shifts in crystal packing and functionally suggestive regions of zzso flexibility in the structure of the zzso Crystal packing shifts of up to zzso A combined with zzso of up to zzso degrees were observed, helping to explain the zzso in cell zzso When the core zzso III regions of the eight structures are zzso the zzso zzso zzso I and zzso of the zzso is observed to rotate by up to zzso degrees and to shift by up to zzso zzso The zzso domain shows the greatest degree of zzso flexibility, rotating and shifting by up to zzso degrees and zzso A, respectively, in five of eight structures, and becoming zzso altogether in the remaining zzso These observed regions of zzso flexibility in the cap and the zzso domain are consistent with the structural flexibility invoked in the zzso zzso mechanism proposed for the relaxation of DNA zzso tension by human zzso zzso
