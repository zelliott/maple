In this review, we will emphasize the role of zzso membrane zzso in protein export and zzso protein trafficking in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also termed zzso zzso belong to a zzso of ubiquitous zzso membrane zzso that share extensive sequence similarity and highly zzso domain zzso They are implicated in a remarkable variety of zzso transport zzso including the transport of zzso heavy metals, zzso zzso drugs, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso include the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso but also include protein zzso systems, such as the exporter for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso members of this zzso include the human zzso (which is associated with the phenomenon of multiple drug resistance in tumor zzso the product of the zzso zzso gene zzso the gene zzso implicated in zzso resistance of the zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso at the locus for the class II major zzso complex zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which mediates export of a zzso hormone that lacks a classical zzso signal zzso The well-established function of zzso zzso in the zzso of proteins without typical signal zzso and the example set by the zzso zzso have led to the reasonable hypothesis that certain zzso in animal cells may be operating by a similar mechanism to mediate the export of a new class of zzso zzso those lacking a classical zzso signal zzso
