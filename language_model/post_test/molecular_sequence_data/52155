We have identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in separate strains of multiply resistant zzso zzso These zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso via a zzso zzso are capable of both zzso and zzso integration in a zzso environment, and transfer between strains in the absence of zzso zzso DNA at zzso ranging from zzso 1 zzso zzso to 2 zzso zzso per donor zzso depending on the donor strain and the growth zzso zzso studies indicate that these zzso are closely related to zzso We have identified bands of zzso 19 zzso on zzso gel zzso of alkaline zzso preparations from zzso zzso strains containing zzso copies of zzso which we have confirmed to be a zzso form of this zzso This phenomenon has previously been observed only when zzso has been cloned in zzso zzso Overnight growth of donor strains in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso results in an approximately zzso increase in transfer frequency of zzso into zzso recipients and an increase in the amount of the circular form of zzso as zzso by zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso for which the appearance of a circular form and the zzso frequency are regulated by a zzso affected by the presence of zzso in the growth zzso
