zzso zzso can be labeled specifically on the alpha zzso with zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides have been zzso and their primary structure has been zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso The environment of this zzso zzso has been determined by sequencing peptides isolated from a zzso zzso zzso digest and two further zzso zzso fragments of the zzso zzso alpha zzso The partial sequences obtained have then been localized in the primary structure of the alpha zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 85, zzso Both the incorporation of the fluorescent label and zzso zzso are inhibited by zzso only at pH zzso zzso and zzso do not zzso zzso analysis reveals a competition between zzso and zzso a Ki for zzso of zzso zzso 100 zzso has been zzso
