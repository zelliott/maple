To gain insight into the zzso of zzso a molecular definition of the zzso zzso cell zzso which is involved in the early stages of the infection, is zzso The zzso material of the pathogen was isolated by mechanical means and chemically zzso It was shown by scanning electron zzso that the method used for zzso the zzso material preserves the integrity of the zzso Surprisingly, in view of the current opinion, only small amounts of lipids zzso were zzso zzso and proteins were the main components of the zzso The zzso were neutral and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso from zzso columns in positions corresponding to molecular masses of zzso 13 and 4 zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and conventional chemical zzso the major structural motifs of the zzso zzso were established as being identical to those of the zzso we previously isolated from the culture zzso of the zzso zzso zzso studies showed that these compounds were not only zzso but were also present in the inner zzso zzso The major protein constituents exhibited the same zzso on zzso as those of the culture zzso on the zzso zzso and readily reacted with the zzso zzso directed against these zzso These proteins included the 19 and 38 zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso proteins and the 40 zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the culture zzso material represents part of the capsule which, in an in zzso context, could contribute to the electron transparent zone surrounding the zzso zzso The 24 zzso zzso protein was found to be a zzso zzso as it was detected almost exclusively in the culture zzso Taken together, the data give a new insight into the zzso compounds of the zzso zzso and may explain part of the nature and limitation of the host immunity towards the zzso
