zzso growth factors zzso and zzso receptors zzso play major roles in zzso zzso including control of skeletal muscle growth and zzso zzso their roles requires zzso the specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study analyzes the zzso transcripts found in a model mouse skeletal zzso cell line zzso during growth and terminal zzso zzso cells express transcripts for zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The predominate zzso transcript contains three zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso domain transcripts possess a zzso deletion between the first and second zzso zzso which after translation would result in deletion of an zzso zzso Cloning of mouse zzso DNA surrounding the region of the zzso zzso deletion indicates that the deletion is derived by alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso account for less than zzso of total zzso zzso in zzso zzso A survey of zzso from mouse zzso indicated that two zzso domain zzso transcripts are rare in all zzso except in zzso in which the two zzso domain form accounts for roughly zzso of the lung zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning studies disclosed 162 zzso of additional zzso zzso zzso which was highly zzso zzso transcripts decline 8- to zzso during low serum, zzso differentiation of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso decline is similar to the previously described zzso decrease in cell surface zzso zzso
