zzso of zzso innate and acquired immune responses must be tightly regulated by elaborate mechanisms to control their onset and zzso zzso have been implicated as negative regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of zzso zzso zzso profiling of 200 zzso in human zzso revealed that several of them zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso gene expression unveiled a pattern of induction in response to a variety of microbial components and zzso zzso By means of promoter analysis, zzso was found to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso were predicted to zzso with sequences in the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso factor 6 and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and we found that these zzso inhibit expression of a linked reporter zzso These genes zzso two key adapter molecules downstream of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, we propose a role for zzso in control of zzso zzso and zzso signaling through a negative feedback regulation loop involving zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso factor 6 protein zzso
