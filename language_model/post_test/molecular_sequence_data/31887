Higher order zzso filament structures are necessary for zzso zzso zzso movement, and other zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which the higher order zzso is formed in plants remains zzso In this study, we identified a novel zzso protein family (named zzso that is well zzso only in the plant zzso There are six zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso specifically expressed in zzso In zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso is a novel zzso protein with binding and stabilizing zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso loss of function zzso zzso zzso and zzso tube growth hypersensitive to zzso zzso All of these results demonstrate that zzso may play an important role in stabilizing and zzso zzso filaments by binding to and zzso zzso zzso
