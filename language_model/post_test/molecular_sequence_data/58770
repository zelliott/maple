The gene of zzso disease virus zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso to zzso D zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso was identified and characterized by its zzso and predicted zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene contains an open reading frame capable of specifying a zzso of 385 zzso zzso which include zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with signal and anchor regions, respectively, and two potential zzso zzso sites, one of which was located in a highly zzso region when compared to zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso By northern zzso analysis using a zzso zzso DNA probe, two highly abundant zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts were detected in zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso zzso are transcribed to form 3' zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By using rapid amplification zzso end zzso method, several zzso start sites, to be thought those of the zzso zzso zzso were detected in the upstream of zzso zzso zzso
