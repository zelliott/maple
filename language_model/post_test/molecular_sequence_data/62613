DNA zzso zzso have been discovered that could potentially be used for the diagnosis of cancer by detection of zzso zzso DNA in bodily zzso Any zzso detection zzso that would be applied to these samples must be capable of detecting small amounts of tumor DNA in the presence of background normal zzso We have developed a real-time zzso zzso called zzso that is well suited for this zzso zzso uses zzso zzso zzso and a zzso probe to achieve zzso amplification and zzso We tested the zzso on zzso and artificially zzso DNA in order to determine the limit of zzso After careful zzso our zzso zzso and zzso zzso can amplify as little as 30 and 60 zzso of zzso DNA, respectively, and neither zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a highly significant zzso difference between normal colon and colon zzso and zzso was also detected in serum DNA from colon cancer zzso These zzso show that zzso technology can be successfully employed for the analysis of very low zzso of zzso DNA, zzso in serum of patients with zzso
