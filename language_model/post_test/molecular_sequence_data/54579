True zzso zzso zzso are arguably the most zzso of the estimated zzso million zzso that inhabit our zzso Field guides treat these zzso zzso as belonging to a few species with cosmopolitan zzso but this hypothesis has not been zzso zzso by the results of a growing number of molecular studies, which have shown many microbes exhibit strong zzso structure and cryptic zzso we constructed a zzso zzso for 177 members of the zzso to zzso their origin, evolutionary diversification and historical zzso zzso time estimates place the origin of the zzso in the middle zzso zzso zzso highest zzso density zzso zzso zzso million years ago zzso and the divergence of zzso from its closest relatives in the early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both within western North zzso zzso analyses identified three lineages within zzso a zzso zzso lineage represented by zzso zzso and two sister zzso zzso the black zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso and yellow zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso possesses a zzso distribution with zzso species restricted to the zzso All 33 zzso species represented by multiple collections exhibited zzso zzso Moreover, zzso North American and zzso zzso species appeared to exhibit zzso Although zzso fruit bodies produce thousands of explosively discharged spores that are well suited to aerial zzso our results suggest that they are poorly adapted at invading novel zzso zzso also appear to have retained the ancestral fruit body plan, which has remained remarkably zzso since the zzso
