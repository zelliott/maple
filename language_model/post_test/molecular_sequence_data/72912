zzso zzso proteins zzso form a zzso of zzso that recruit zzso to sites of inflammation and that may contribute to zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso state against zzso zzso With the use of zzso zzso that were based on zzso zzso consensus zzso the known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and the previously unidentified zzso and zzso genes were isolated from a zzso zzso from human zzso zzso The amplified zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate an zzso zzso from which the gene sequence was zzso The zzso gene shares with the zzso and zzso genes a zzso zzso structure and a coding zzso sequence zzso of zzso By Northern zzso analysis the zzso zzso zzso was predominantly zzso in the small zzso peripheral blood, heart, zzso zzso skeletal muscle, zzso zzso spinal cord, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were found in the zzso the small zzso and the zzso The isolation of the zzso gene from the zzso zzso localized it on zzso clones of zzso zzso which also contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The combination of using zzso primer zzso and zzso illustrates that novel genes can efficiently be isolated from gene cluster zzso with less zzso and effort than the isolation of novel zzso
