Three classes of human zzso zzso gamma receptors zzso gamma zzso have been identified so far: zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that genetically determined differences between individuals exist both with respect to the binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso gamma zzso and with respect to the binding of zzso zzso zzso The zzso in binding of zzso could be ascribed to zzso gamma zzso an zzso of zzso gamma zzso The authors have now investigated whether one of the zzso of zzso gamma zzso is also responsible for the zzso in binding of zzso In these studies the authors used zzso human B cells that demonstrated either binding or no binding of zzso in zzso zzso zzso obtained from these cells was amplified by reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso experiments with the zzso products revealed that the zzso gamma zzso but not the zzso gamma zzso zzso was present in these zzso DNA sequencing further demonstrated that the zzso sequence of both the zzso part and the zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso was identical for all individuals tested, regardless of their ability to bind zzso These findings indicate that the zzso binding of zzso cannot be ascribed to one of the zzso of zzso gamma zzso Since zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso are not present on the cell surface of these cells, the authors conclude that an zzso zzso different from the known zzso gamma receptors must be responsible for the zzso binding of zzso These data further expand the complexity of zzso gamma zzso
