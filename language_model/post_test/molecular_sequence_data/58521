zzso zzso of zzso family zzso through the zzso of viral sequences is the zzso mechanism by which zzso zzso virus zzso zzso liver tumors in chronically infected zzso The main target is zzso a functional zzso of the zzso zzso but zzso and zzso are also marginally zzso Here we identify a major, zzso regulatory element in the zzso zzso zzso which efficiently activates the zzso promoter in cultured zzso zzso In the context of the zzso viral zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso and thus plays a central role in the control of viral zzso zzso activity is primarily controlled by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors, although zzso and Oct proteins were also shown to bind in a central zzso The expression of zzso and zzso appears to be maintained in zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a prime candidate for controlling zzso gene zzso zzso during zzso zzso
