Cellular adaptation to zzso stress at the zzso zzso zzso depends on zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent elimination of zzso zzso products by the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins by transferring zzso zzso zzso chains from the zzso zzso zzso to zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso linkage specific zzso chains by forming an unprecedented zzso The zzso of zzso zzso primarily by zzso interactions between two zzso is also facilitated by the charged zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso zzso is required for zzso degradation zzso In addition to zzso zzso we show that a highly zzso zzso zzso in the donor zzso senses the presence of an zzso in the zzso zzso to position only zzso of zzso in proximity to the donor zzso active zzso These results reveal an unanticipated mode of zzso zzso that allows the zzso to effectively engage two zzso to specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso
