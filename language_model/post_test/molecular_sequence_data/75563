We recently reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the seeds of the zzso plant zzso zzso is a potent zzso for the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso and Cummings, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We and others have shown that this zzso is a weak zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1974) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report that zzso by zzso is inhibited by low zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso but it is not inhibited by either zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso or free zzso To further study the zzso specificity of this zzso we investigated the interactions of immobilized zzso with zzso prepared from the mouse zzso cell line zzso and from zzso zzso We found that immobilized zzso interacts with high affinity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing outer zzso acid zzso linked alpha zzso to penultimate zzso zzso zzso containing zzso acid linked only alpha zzso to penultimate zzso did not interact zzso with the immobilized zzso Our analyses indicate that the interactions of zzso zzso chains with the zzso are dependent on zzso acid linkages and are not dependent on either the branching pattern of the zzso zzso or the presence of zzso zzso
