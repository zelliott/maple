We report the cloning of a human zzso zzso a protein of calculated zzso zzso molecular mass, named zzso The deduced protein sequence shows a large zzso zzso part and a zzso part with nine putative zzso regions characteristic of integral zzso zzso Computer searches with sequence databases revealed zzso with three complete zzso proteins and with at least 19 human, 10 plant and one zzso short unidentified protein sequences translated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso protein retains between 27 and zzso overall sequence identity with the zzso zzso We propose that zzso and related genes have evolved from a common ancestral gene and form a new zzso membrane protein family which we call the zzso protein zzso Gene expression of zzso appears to be zzso as the zzso is zzso in all human zzso zzso so far, as shown by Northern zzso zzso Furthermore, a protein of about 70 zzso is zzso in different zzso cell lines, as shown by zzso zzso From its widespread expression and conservation from zzso plants to zzso it is likely that zzso has a fundamental biological function in the zzso
