A novel species of the zzso zzso was isolated from sediments collected on the zzso floor in the zzso Pacific zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso Ridge, had almost identical zzso sequences for their internal transcribed zzso and their zzso zzso Their zzso characteristics were also almost zzso The strains were assumed to be related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on sequence similarities in the zzso region of the zzso zzso The low zzso zzso and sequence similarity between strain zzso and related species revealed that strains zzso and zzso represent a zzso unknown zzso As zzso and sexual reproduction were not observed in strains zzso and zzso these strains are described as zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso
