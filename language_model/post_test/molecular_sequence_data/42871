zzso zzso protein with a molecular mass of 70 zzso zzso with zzso zzso and promotes zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso protein is, however, distinct from those of animal zzso but shows significant sequence zzso with zzso zzso a component of zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the structural relationships between zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso by using both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein reacted with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex zzso indicating that it shares common zzso zzso with rat zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, sequencing studies of peptides obtained by zzso zzso indicated that internal sequences of zzso zzso protein show significant zzso with zzso zzso but do not show any zzso with the primary structures of authentic zzso zzso revealed that the protein is widely localized in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso but is not present in the central area of zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso protein is a zzso structurally and zzso related to zzso zzso but functionally similar to animal zzso although its zzso is zzso
