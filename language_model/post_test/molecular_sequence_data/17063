zzso transfer of resistance zzso amongst bacteria can be achieved by zzso zzso DNA zzso We have determined the complete zzso zzso sequence of the zzso group H zzso zzso zzso originally isolated from the Gram negative opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso This zzso zzso genetic element contains 295 predicted zzso of which 144 are highly similar to coding sequences of zzso plasmids zzso and zzso The regions of similarity among these three zzso plasmids principally zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stability, and zzso zzso and we conducted a comparative analysis to define the minimal zzso zzso backbone zzso No resistance zzso are included in the backbone and most of the sequences unique to zzso were contained in a large zzso region between the two transfer zzso These findings indicate that zzso evolution occurs through gene zzso predominantly in regions outside of the core zzso Furthermore, a modular evolution for zzso was zzso by the presence of gene neighbors or zzso that were highly related to sequences from a wide range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso transfer regions are most similar to sequences zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The dual zzso zzso zzso on zzso resemble numerous zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also codes for resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mercury zzso to zzso silver zzso to zzso copper zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso separate regions similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other zzso sequences are related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso where the latter is surrounded by zzso and could potentially be involved in zzso zzso The similarity to a diverse set of bacterial sequences highlights the ability of zzso zzso DNA elements to acquire and zzso genetic traits through the bacterial gene zzso
