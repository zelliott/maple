The zzso zzso soluble zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso proteins are involved in the fusion of zzso with their target zzso While most zzso are permanently anchored to zzso by their zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso has been found both in soluble and in zzso zzso The zzso zzso is thought to mediate interactions between various zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso attachment of zzso is achieved by its zzso zzso and zzso motif succeeding the zzso zzso In this study, we have analyzed full-length zzso zzso from zzso and humans by zzso and structural zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso box of zzso full-length zzso resulted in stabilization of the native protein and a more zzso folded structure, as shown by size exclusion zzso and limited zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a specific increase in the zzso content of the zzso zzso compared to the zzso form or the zzso domain, which correlated with a marked increase in stability as observed by heat zzso zzso Although highly zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso membrane binding independent of the membrane charge, as shown by surface zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso A zzso As similarly found in a previous zzso structure, the zzso zzso domain contains a zzso patch at its surface that may accommodate the zzso zzso In the crystal structure, this zzso surface is buried in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these observations support a previously suggested closed zzso of zzso zzso where the zzso zzso zzso folds onto a zzso groove in the zzso zzso zzso
