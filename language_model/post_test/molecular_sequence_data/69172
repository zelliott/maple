Group II and nuclear zzso zzso share a common zzso zzso involving a zzso zzso as well as some primary sequence similarities at the zzso zzso In this work, we analyze the role of the zzso zzso at the first and penultimate positions zzso and zzso of a group II zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso is essential for the efficiency of both the first and the second zzso steps, while zzso at the penultimate zzso affect mostly the efficiency of the second zzso A zzso suppression of the second zzso step zzso can be observed in some double zzso This result is best explained by a zzso interaction between the first and the penultimate zzso of the zzso which occurs after zzso zzso The finding that an interaction between zzso boundaries is required for the second zzso step in both group II and nuclear zzso zzso strengthens the idea that both systems employ similar mechanisms, albeit with differences in the details of the zzso zzso
