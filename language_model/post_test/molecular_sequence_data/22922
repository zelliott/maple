zzso zzso is a zzso fungus and a member of the normal zzso zzso of zzso However, it is also a zzso zzso associated with a wide range of skin zzso One unusual feature of zzso zzso is an absolute dependency on zzso provided lipids which the fungus zzso by zzso activity to release fatty acids necessary for both growth and zzso In this study, the cloning and characterization of the first gene zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso possibly associated with this activity are zzso The zzso zzso shows high sequence similarity to other known zzso zzso but is not a member of a zzso gene family in zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso a protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso a zzso zzso motif and an zzso signal zzso of 26 zzso By using a zzso library, two other genes were identified zzso zzso one of them zzso a putative zzso zzso the other a putative zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and the zzso properties of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso is most active at 40 degrees C and the pH optimum was found to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso such as zzso frequently used as the source of fatty acids in zzso zzso media, and had minor zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso is inhibited by different zzso metal zzso This is the first molecular description of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso
