The DNA binding domain of the zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso has been produced and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein bound to a synthetic binding site yields a zzso zzso of 14 K in molecular zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso showed that its sequence is the same as that of the intact zzso A zzso zzso of approximately 14 K, zzso which zzso to the zzso 113 zzso acids of the intact zzso zzso has been expressed in a functional form in zzso zzso The first zzso was processed during the expression and the zzso zzso thus contains 112 zzso zzso zzso I zzso and gel zzso zzso showed that zzso binds to a synthetic DNA having the consensus binding site and to the upstream regulatory sequence of the zzso gene as intact zzso zzso These results showed that this zzso fragment, zzso may be a good material for investigation of the DNA binding domain of zzso and of the zzso zzso
