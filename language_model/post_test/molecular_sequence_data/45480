The molecular cloning of zzso zzso zzso receptors for zzso factor zzso was undertaken as the first step in our investigation of the action of zzso at the zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso zzso of a total zzso isolated from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso With the partial zzso as zzso two types of full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso 1: zzso zzso type zzso 1600 zzso were obtained from a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso types 1 zzso and zzso zzso type 2 zzso showed zzso and zzso identity with zzso and zzso of other zzso zzso The distribution of zzso of the two zzso receptors was studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected almost exclusively in brain and zzso and to a very minor degree in zzso whereas zzso was found in the peripheral zzso as well as in the brain and zzso
