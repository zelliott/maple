The two zzso of the zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso are zzso by separate zzso zzso We have established the zzso structure of both zzso A sequence comparison of zzso with zzso from chicken skeletal muscle and two partially known sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso capping proteins belong to a highly zzso group of zzso zzso This conclusion is supported by the zzso of zzso zzso against zzso and zzso with proteins from lower and higher zzso In addition, a system is presented that allows the expression of truncated zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso
