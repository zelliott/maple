We have determined the complete zzso sequence of the gene for the cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The gene contains a very zzso promoter region followed by the coding sequence of a protein of 1962 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso and the expected primary translation product of the zzso gene indicates that the zzso is probably zzso as a zzso This is confirmed by expression studies of the zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso shows significant zzso to a number of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Compared with the related zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso acids zzso and a total of zzso acid zzso some of which may account for the different zzso specificity of both zzso Furthermore, a region was identified in the zzso zzso which shows zzso to the zzso zzso of a number of proteins from other zzso zzso
