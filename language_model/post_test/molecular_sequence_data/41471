When cells swell in zzso solutions, zzso zzso channels zzso activate to reduce zzso zzso and prevent catastrophic cell zzso Despite intensive efforts to assign a molecular identity to the zzso zzso channel, it remains zzso In an unbiased zzso zzso interference zzso screen of zzso cells zzso expressing an zzso fluorescent zzso we identify zzso 1 zzso as the zzso zzso zzso Of the 23 screen hits with zzso zzso and predicted zzso zzso only zzso specifically targeting zzso eliminated the zzso current zzso We further demonstrate the essential contribution of zzso to zzso zzso with the introduction of a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso construct in zzso cells significantly reduced the zzso zzso We confirm that zzso expression of zzso alone in human embryonic kidney zzso cells creates a clearly identifiable zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of mouse zzso 2 zzso the closest zzso zzso of zzso is zzso The first 64 zzso of zzso zzso swell zzso to zzso The zzso however, maintains zzso pore properties, strongly indicating that the zzso protein forms the zzso channel itself rather than functioning as an essential auxiliary zzso zzso is an zzso channel clearly responsive to zzso this zzso depends upon its zzso
