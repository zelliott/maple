The success of zzso zzso to zzso cells far exceeds that of most other viruses on account of their specialized tail and associated zzso zzso The zzso protein gene product zzso 10 of zzso zzso whose structure was determined to zzso A resolution, was fitted into the zzso zzso structures of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso functions as a molecular lever that zzso and extends the hinged short tail fibers to facilitate cell zzso The central folding motif of the zzso zzso is similar to that of the zzso protein zzso and to the zzso domain of the short tail zzso zzso The three proteins comprise the periphery of the zzso and interact with each zzso The structural and functional similarities of zzso zzso and zzso and their sequential order in the T4 zzso suggest that they evolved zzso subsequent to gene zzso from a common zzso Such events are usual in the evolution of complex zzso from a common primordial zzso
