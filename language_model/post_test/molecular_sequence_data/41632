A zzso chain anchored to the zzso has been the hallmark of zzso zzso However, the degradation signal appears to be more complex and to contain also a zzso zzso zzso Recent reports have shown that the zzso can degrade also zzso zzso which adds an additional layer of complexity to the zzso Here, we demonstrate that the size of the zzso is an important zzso in its extent of zzso a single zzso zzso fused to a tail of up to zzso zzso derived from either short artificial repeats or from naturally occurring zzso is sufficient to target them for zzso zzso zzso chemically zzso zzso where zzso is attached to the zzso via a naturally occurring zzso bond, display similar zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the zzso zzso signal is zzso and is not always made of a long zzso zzso
