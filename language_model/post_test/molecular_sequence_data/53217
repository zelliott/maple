Recent research in various areas has appreciably expanded our knowledge of zzso a zzso zzso produced by all human group A zzso group C zzso and group G zzso zzso Several molecular genetic approaches are described here to study the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of the above zzso zzso zzso zzso the use of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso reporter zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso led to the zzso of the core promoter region of zzso and the identification of a zzso upstream region required for full promoter zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter upstream region identified an intrinsic DNA zzso locus as the pivotal DNA element stimulating the activity of the core zzso The detection of zzso zzso expression zzso which proved not to be due to different zzso zzso zzso prompted zzso swap experiments, showing that promoter activity is dictated by the host genetic background, rather than the sequence of the regulatory zzso These findings suggest the involvement in zzso expression of an as yet unidentified zzso zzso that contacts the bent DNA zzso zzso termination of zzso is directed by a zzso zzso whose structural requirements for termination efficiency were determined with base substitution zzso fused to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso plasmids are described for zzso and zzso replacement zzso of the zzso zzso
