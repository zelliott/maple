zzso zzso factor, a zzso present in the zzso of a wide variety of zzso is composed of zzso proteins and a zzso zzso termed zzso which is known to activate zzso Using differential zzso display technology to study the zzso gene expression of zzso zzso cells zzso we partially cloned a zzso zzso the rat zzso of zzso which displayed zzso and zzso zzso to mouse and human zzso zzso zzso In the rat zzso specific transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso in size were detected in major amounts in normal liver, but were absent or near the detection limit in other zzso Among the different liver cell populations studied during primary culture, zzso transcripts of zzso zzso were prominent in zzso and present in zzso and zzso cells, whereas zzso cells and zzso zzso cells were zzso In addition to zzso zzso freshly isolated zzso also contained transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso which were zzso during primary zzso In zzso zzso of normal liver tissue confirmed the in zzso data in that zzso was expressed by zzso and zzso liver cells, which probably represent zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were zzso by zzso and/or zzso During the acute phase reaction induced by zzso injection, zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in rat zzso The data demonstrate that: zzso the liver is the primary site for zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to represent the cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are zzso by the acute phase zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and during the acute phase reaction in zzso suggesting that zzso represents a novel, positive zzso gene in the zzso
