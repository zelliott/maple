A full-length zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso from the Southern cattle zzso zzso zzso was isolated using a strategy based on sequence zzso among G zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed highest identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells, and Western zzso analysis showed the expected zzso zzso zzso In these cells, application of zzso (10 zzso inhibited zzso zzso synthesis by zzso The results indicate that the tick zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that couples to zzso zzso
