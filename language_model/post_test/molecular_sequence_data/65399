Although the liver is the primary site of zzso expression of zzso serum zzso A zzso zzso zzso production has also been zzso Besides its role in zzso and zzso zzso during the zzso zzso has recently been assumed to contribute to bone and cartilage zzso However, expression of zzso in human zzso tissue has not been zzso zzso we first show that zzso zzso for the major zzso zzso but not zzso transcripts are expressed in human zzso and cortical bone zzso and bone zzso Next, we show expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the human zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor involved in zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts in zzso and, to a higher extent, in zzso differentiated human zzso stem zzso Third, we provide evidence that human zzso cells of tumor origin zzso and zzso express zzso under zzso zzso zzso transcripts are expressed under zzso conditions zzso and zzso conditions zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis, and zzso technique confirmed zzso expression of zzso on zzso and protein level in zzso cell lines while zzso a protein of unknown function, is zzso expressed in all zzso zzso zzso
