In the zzso era, the transformation of genetic information into zzso meaning is zzso We have analyzed the zzso of the zzso outer envelope membrane by an in zzso and a zzso zzso Based on its evolutionary relation to the outer membrane of zzso bacteria, the outer envelope membrane should contain a large number of zzso zzso We therefore calculated the probability for the existence of zzso zzso and hairpin structures among all proteins of the zzso zzso zzso According to the existence of these structures, a number of candidates were zzso This protein pool was analyzed by zzso to discard sequences with signals that would direct the protein to other zzso different from zzso In addition, the pool was manually controlled for the presence of proteins known to function outside of the zzso zzso The approach developed here can be used to predict the zzso of zzso zzso For the zzso approach, proteins of highly zzso outer envelope zzso of zzso from zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso mass zzso In addition to the known zzso four new proteins of the outer envelope zzso were identified in this zzso
