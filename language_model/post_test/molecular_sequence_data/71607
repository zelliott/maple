In this study we present an zzso zzso library of zzso zzso constructed within a novel zzso carrying zzso as a zzso zzso zzso The average insert size per zzso comprises 41 zzso We screened the library and detected copies of known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of new zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed either by Southern zzso zzso or more efficiently by zzso zzso zzso We successfully applied zzso with specific and with zzso zzso multiplex zzso and colony zzso in library zzso Our results suggest a new, more efficient pooling strategy for future high zzso screenings to be used in zzso with pooled zzso zzso or in a less zzso approach using pooled zzso coli colonies for zzso
