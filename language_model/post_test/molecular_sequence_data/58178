The induction of the viral zzso cycle in zzso zzso virus zzso B cells is initiated by zzso of the zzso zzso whose expression is sufficient to disrupt zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts as the switch to change from a zzso to a zzso zzso zzso In the present studies, a series of deletion plasmids encompassing positions zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter were constructed and tested for their response to zzso zzso an zzso of the viral zzso cycle, upon zzso into zzso and -positive zzso zzso The promoter consisted of three functionally distinct zzso Region I zzso zzso to zzso had a negative influence on promoter zzso its deletion made the promoter highly responsive to zzso Region II zzso zzso to zzso was important for zzso responsiveness to zzso The response to zzso did not require the presence of the zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso This sequence also enhanced expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene from the zzso virus 40 promoter in response to zzso even when inserted downstream of the cat zzso Region III zzso to zzso was a positive element that was zzso by the zzso gene zzso
