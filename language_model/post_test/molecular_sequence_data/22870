zzso target two bacterial type II zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso occurs zzso with the first zzso occurring in the more sensitive target zzso To limit the emergence of resistance, zzso should zzso possess dual activities against the two zzso For reasons that are as yet zzso zzso zzso zzso is less sensitive to zzso than zzso IV, counter to its greater sensitivity in zzso coli, thereby limiting the use of zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of zzso are important in determining zzso zzso We replaced an extended region encompassing the zzso domain in the zzso coli zzso protein with its zzso in zzso zzso and tested for its ability to complement a zzso zzso and its zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was more resistant to zzso than zzso zzso at both zzso of zzso activity and stimulation of zzso complexes, and this difference was more apparent in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso zzso was able to complement zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso Without supplemental zzso the zzso of zzso for zzso zzso coli zzso with zzso DNA zzso were equal to those for zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso but were twofold higher in the presence of zzso Our findings suggest that the extended zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso is responsible, at least in part, for the increased resistance of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and that this effect is modulated by zzso
