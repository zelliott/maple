zzso proteins with a molecular mass of about 14 to 16 zzso were isolated from a rice zzso fraction based on the zzso with zzso zzso from patients allergic to zzso zzso clones zzso these zzso proteins were isolated from a zzso library of maturing rice seeds, and the deduced zzso acid sequences showed considerable similarity to wheat and barley zzso zzso which have recently been identified as major zzso associated with zzso zzso An zzso zzso strategy was applied to repress the zzso gene expression in maturing rice zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the seeds using a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso showed that zzso content of seeds from several transgenic rice plants was markedly lower than that of the seeds from parental wild type zzso
