zzso zzso strain zzso harbors two cryptic zzso named zzso and zzso in addition to the symbiotic zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso has been recently cloned and zzso By DNA zzso zzso to former zzso region was found on zzso zzso as well as on other plasmids zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In these former bacteria, a zzso product of 362 zzso was generated using zzso derived zzso zzso and zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that the amplified zzso fragments were closely related being classified into two zzso designated zzso and zzso Similarly, a zzso product of zzso zzso was obtained when zzso zzso and zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso DNA region zzso were zzso DNA sequence analysis of the corresponding amplified products showed that, as occurs, with zzso the zzso were also zzso In addition, we designed a set of zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso consensus sequence encompassing the zzso and zzso zzso that are able to recognize zzso zzso A zzso regions in zzso By using these zzso we determined that the former zzso region is widespread in zzso zzso indigenous populations and that its frequency within the zzso zzso depends on the host zzso Furthermore, it is shown that the zzso region type A is linked to cryptic plasmids in zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas it is located in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
