zzso gene transfer is the method of choice for many plant biotechnology zzso however, large-scale use of this zzso in conifer transformation has been limited by difficult propagation of zzso material, selection efficiencies and low transformation zzso We have analyzed zzso conditions and different disarmed strains of zzso to improve zzso Additional copies of zzso genes were added to three common disarmed zzso These extra zzso genes included either a zzso active zzso or extra copies of zzso and zzso both from zzso In experiments with Norway zzso we increased transformation efficiencies zzso from initial experiments where little or no transient expression was zzso Over 100 transformed lines expressing the marker gene zzso zzso were generated from rapidly dividing zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso activity was used to monitor transient expression and to further test lines selected on zzso zzso In zzso zzso transient expression increased zzso utilizing modified zzso zzso zzso gene transfer is a useful technique for large-scale generation of transgenic Norway spruce and may prove useful for other conifer zzso
