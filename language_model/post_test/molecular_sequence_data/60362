Two families of zzso zzso and zzso are key regulators of zzso zzso While zzso proteins are implicated in zzso budding from the donor zzso zzso proteins are involved in the targeting of zzso to the zzso zzso Recently, we have shown a role for zzso in exit from the zzso zzso suggesting a possible function for zzso proteins in zzso budding as zzso Here we report the identification of a new member of the zzso family, zzso as a zzso zzso of a zzso zzso Several proteins that belong to the zzso family, including the zzso zzso have recently been shown to stimulate zzso exchange by zzso zzso zzso exchange by zzso zzso the switch from the zzso to the zzso form, is thought to be crucial for their zzso zzso itself has an important role in the zzso zzso zzso However, its mechanism of action is not yet zzso We show that all members of the zzso family exhibit distinct genetic interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that, although the zzso between the members of the zzso family is relatively low zzso and limited to a small domain, they all can act as zzso zzso exchange factors zzso for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is sufficient for this zzso Interestingly, the zzso domain activity is inhibited by zzso A zzso a zzso zzso that zzso some of the zzso indicating that this domain is a target for zzso These results demonstrate that the ability to act as zzso is a general property of all zzso proteins in zzso The genetic interactions observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest the existence of a zzso zzso cascade in the zzso zzso
