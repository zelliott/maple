zzso coli group I zzso K zzso are found in two forms on the cell zzso The zzso form is linked to zzso zzso A core, whereas the zzso zzso form is assembled independently of zzso A zzso zzso zzso K zzso are generally zzso with either the zzso or zzso zzso and, under the appropriate conditions, with the zzso zzso zzso To examine the relationships between the genetic zzso and the synthetic pathways for these various zzso zzso the gene cluster responsible for expression of a zzso group zzso K zzso zzso zzso was cloned and the zzso zzso regions zzso Analysis of the six zzso within the cluster indicates features typical of zzso zzso O zzso zzso of group zzso K zzso is initiated by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and the chain length of zzso is determined by the zzso gene zzso The zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso is almost exclusively devoted to the expression of three different surface zzso The zzso cluster is located adjacent to the zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the gene order: zzso Thus, zzso is in the location occupied by other zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso represents an additional zzso
