A 29 zzso region of the circular zzso of zzso zzso containing genes required for bacterial attachment to host cells and zzso has been zzso zzso zzso in many of the genes have been zzso The zzso can be divided into two groups: those which can be zzso by zzso medium and those whose zzso is unaffected by zzso zzso The first group includes zzso in genes with zzso to ABC zzso one possible zzso regulator, and some closely linked genes immediately zzso The second group includes zzso in two possible zzso regulators, one zzso and a number of zzso genes including a zzso required for the formation of an zzso zzso zzso There are also several genes with no zzso to genes of identified zzso The presence of such a large number of genes required for attachment to host cells suggests that the ability of zzso zzso to bind to plant cells may play an important role in the life of these zzso
