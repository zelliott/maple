The structure of integrated viral DNA in a zzso zzso of a duck from zzso county in China was zzso Three different clones of integrated viral DNA, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6-2, and zzso zzso 6-2, were obtained from the zzso portion of the liver by molecular zzso One of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso repetition of integrated viral DNA with zzso zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso 6-2, showed a head-to-head zzso of the core and surface gene regions of duck zzso B virus zzso zzso The zzso junctions were often located near direct repeat 1 or 2 of zzso DNA in three independent zzso zzso sequences at the zzso junctions in two zzso zzso zzso zzso and 6-2, indicated the possible zzso of zzso DNA and zzso of viral zzso zzso DNA appears to be integrated into the zzso of zzso in a manner similar to that of human and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the duck system may serve as a useful animal model for the study of human zzso
