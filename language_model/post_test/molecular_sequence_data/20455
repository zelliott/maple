zzso zzso acids zzso are widely used to zzso zzso zzso A series of zzso containing zzso zzso at alternating positions and their zzso acid counterpart zzso zzso zzso were zzso to fully investigate the impact of zzso on zzso backbone structure in zzso zzso CD, zzso and zzso spectral analysis suggest that zzso containing peptides adopt more ordered structures relative to their zzso containing zzso The central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the charged zzso of zzso and zzso play important roles in the degree of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the central position of the zzso produce greater folding as judged by CD and zzso Variation of the chemical shift with temperature zzso zzso of zzso suggests a series of i zzso i + 3 hydrogen bonds between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso NH, and the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The solution zzso of zzso calculated from zzso constraints shows a zzso structure zzso repetitive zzso zzso at zzso zzso which is supported by zzso zzso CD, and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso models of these peptides suggest that there is a strong zzso interaction of the zzso zzso side chain of zzso and the zzso zzso that may be a strong stabilizing force of the zzso folding in zzso
