The large zzso of the zzso zzso gene contains a zzso zzso element, which is important in the zzso expression of the zzso We have confirmed the binding activity of a zzso factor present in zzso extracts derived from cell lines zzso or induced to zzso the zzso zzso We have extended these studies to show the binding activity is present in normal activated zzso B cells as well as zzso producing cells, and have demonstrated by zzso footprint analysis full protection of a sequence containing the 11 zzso zzso to the zzso core zzso We have compared these in zzso binding studies with an analysis of zzso interactions in intact zzso cell lines using zzso sequencing zzso We demonstrate significant zzso in zzso zzso of DNA in the zzso zzso cell line after it is induced to zzso zzso These zzso occur at zzso zzso which are part of the the 11 zzso core zzso and are identical to those observed in cells zzso expressing zzso This provides direct evidence for the induced binding of the tissue specific factor to intact zzso In intact zzso we also observed significant zzso in the zzso of a zzso 3' of the core zzso which is part of a potential secondary DNA structure, and protection of four zzso that are part of a region zzso to the heavy chain zzso
