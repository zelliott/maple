Cell cycle progression in zzso is driven by the master zzso regulators zzso and zzso The cellular levels of zzso and zzso are temporally and zzso zzso during the cell cycle, with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso a protein required for the initiation of DNA zzso also functions as a zzso zzso of zzso which in turn activates multiple zzso notably those involved in zzso replication and zzso The cellular concentration of zzso is cell zzso zzso at the time of replication initiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso contributes to the cell cycle variations in zzso zzso We propose that zzso couples DNA replication initiation with the expression of the two zzso regulators zzso and zzso and that the zzso regulatory cascade drives the forward progression of the zzso cell zzso
