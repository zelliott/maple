The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is expressed on tissue zzso where it functions both to mediate the zzso of zzso zzso and as a zzso zzso for bacteria, zzso and other zzso zzso In this report we describe the cloning of the full-length zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso and we investigate the level at which zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter is a marker of the functional state of the cell as high levels are expressed on resident and inflammatory zzso whereas cells activated by treatment with zzso have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame that predicts a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the protein in zzso cells shows that this zzso encodes a functional zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this protein has an overall zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso and as such, the zzso contains an zzso that is zzso followed by a zzso type II domain and eight zzso recognition zzso zzso The zzso is linked to a zzso zzso region and a zzso acid zzso zzso All of the eight zzso are particularly well zzso especially zzso which shows zzso zzso with the equivalent region of the human zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso were measured in the zzso cell line zzso which is known to express the protein at the cell zzso These levels were decreased by a zzso to zzso incubation with zzso but were almost abolished by overnight treatment with this zzso Nuclear zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso the regulation of zzso zzso expression by zzso provides a novel system in which to study the mechanisms by which this zzso zzso gene zzso
