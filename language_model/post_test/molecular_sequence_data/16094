zzso of a zzso library from zzso stage zzso zzso for zzso sequences led to the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso B), which encodes a zzso type I zzso In zzso and Northern zzso zzso indicate that expression of zzso zzso B zzso is concentrated in the zzso whereas expression in the zzso is zzso times zzso zzso zzso B zzso is present in the zzso and increases from late zzso zzso zzso by late zzso and is greatly reduced by the zzso zzso in the adult, a low level of zzso zzso B zzso is present in the zzso zzso zzso B shows sequence zzso to mouse zzso zzso zzso Southern blots show that zzso zzso B is the most similar sequence to mouse zzso B in the zzso zzso and vice versa, indicating that zzso zzso B and mouse zzso B are zzso The use of zzso B as a marker and the germ layer derivation of the zzso are discussed in light of these zzso
