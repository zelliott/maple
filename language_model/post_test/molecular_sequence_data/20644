zzso by zzso strains of zzso hinges on the zzso ability to adhere to host cells via zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Previously, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins were recognized as zzso binding to zzso domain zzso and gelatin binding domain zzso of zzso In this study, we identified another zzso motif on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing sequence zzso with a zzso and nascent zzso zzso This motif binds to 15th type III zzso zzso zzso zzso and association zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rate zzso represents a slow binding zzso in this zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso cells with zzso blocked the binding of zzso by zzso demonstrating a significant role of zzso in cellular zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein bind zzso of zzso at a novel binding site, and this interaction contributes to zzso to host zzso
