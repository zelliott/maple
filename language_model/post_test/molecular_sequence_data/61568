The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from the soluble fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso U zzso were obtained with zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, at pH zzso Under the same conditions, zzso values of 17, 15, and 3 zzso were respectively calculated for zzso zzso and zzso The zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso falls in the range observed for typical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso activity, with a specific activity of zzso U zzso with zzso zzso as zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities were fully inhibited by zzso zzso of the gold compound zzso supporting the existence of an essential zzso zzso Relative molecular mass of native zzso was zzso zzso zzso while the corresponding value per zzso obtained under zzso conditions, was zzso zzso zzso These results suggest zzso exists as a zzso zzso zzso point of the zzso was at pH zzso zzso or high zzso of zzso but neither zzso nor zzso resulted in a markedly zzso zzso characterized by a lag time before the steady state zzso was zzso The magnitude of the lag time was dependent on zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso of zzso or zzso abolished the zzso suggesting that a zzso exchange mechanism is zzso
