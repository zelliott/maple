zzso protein zzso zzso are involved in environmental signal zzso They are thus expected to play key roles in the biology of zzso zzso which display complex life cycles and use zzso cues to zzso cell zzso Despite their zzso structural data of zzso zzso is zzso We have now determined the crystal structure of zzso major zzso a zzso activated zzso both alone and in complex with zzso zzso was observed to be more similar to zzso to other human zzso However, significant differences could be identified in the zzso pocket, as well as in potentially regulatory sites in the zzso zzso The modified pocket architecture in zzso zzso zzso regulatory flipping as observed in zzso zzso zzso association was also zzso revealing a potential zzso zzso zzso Overall, these data should speed the discovery of molecules interfering with zzso functions, with relevance for zzso drug development zzso
