zzso is a family of proteins that catalyze long-term expansion of cell walls and has been considered a principal protein that affects cell expansion in zzso We have identified the first zzso zzso gene in soybean zzso zzso zzso which may be responsible for root zzso zzso levels of zzso were very high in the roots of zzso to zzso zzso in which rapid root zzso takes zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was most abundant in the root tip region, where cell zzso occurs, but scarce in the region of zzso where cell zzso zzso zzso that its expression is closely related to root development zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso transcripts were zzso present in the zzso cells and underlying cell layers in the root tip of the primary and secondary zzso zzso expression of zzso accelerated the root growth of transgenic tobacco zzso zzso zzso and the roots showed zzso to zzso zzso These results imply that the zzso gene plays an important role in root development in zzso especially in the zzso and/or initiation of the primary and secondary zzso
