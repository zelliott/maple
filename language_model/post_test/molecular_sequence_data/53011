zzso and the zzso zzso coli zzso tumor zzso protein are components of the zzso growth factor signaling zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso levels of the zzso zzso through the formation of a large complex containing these three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several other zzso Both zzso and zzso are known to be critical for zzso regulation, and zzso in zzso that eliminate the zzso site result in human zzso A zzso domain of zzso that contains the zzso site is a member of the regulators of zzso signaling zzso zzso The crystal structures of this domain alone and in complex with an zzso sequence from zzso reveal that the zzso interaction occurs at a zzso groove on a face of the protein that is distinct from the zzso interface of classical zzso zzso The molecular interactions observed in the zzso complex provide a rationale for the evolutionary conservation seen in both zzso
