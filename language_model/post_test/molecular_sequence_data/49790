The human zzso virus type I zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates viral entry through fusion of the target cellular and viral zzso A segment of zzso containing the sequence zzso has previously been identified as the zzso of the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is highly zzso among zzso envelope zzso zzso directed at the zzso zzso have zzso effects on a broad range of zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso Recently, a crystal structure of the zzso bound to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has shown that the zzso zzso adopts a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Klein, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso World Intellectual Property Organization Patent zzso We have designed zzso peptides to adopt zzso zzso by the incorporation of a zzso to zzso zzso bridge between the i and i + 4 zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso of extended, zzso peptides encompassing the zzso zzso revealed that the 13 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this sequence were explored to zzso zzso binding zzso The solution zzso of the constrained peptides have been characterized by zzso zzso and molecular modeling zzso The results presented here demonstrate that both inclusion of the zzso constraint and extension of the zzso segment are necessary to elicit optimal zzso binding zzso The ability of these zzso zzso to stimulate a high zzso zzso immune response incapable of viral zzso is discussed in regard to developing an zzso vaccine designed to elicit a zzso immune zzso
