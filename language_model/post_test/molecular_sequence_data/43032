We are interested in the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the development of the vascular zzso In order to respond to zzso and zzso signals, zzso cells must express appropriate zzso To characterize zzso zzso zzso we have concentrated on zzso zzso zzso because several lines of evidence suggested the importance of controlled zzso levels in zzso zzso A strategy based on zzso amplification using zzso zzso and mouse brain zzso as zzso source, led to the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso which we designated zzso In zzso zzso using a zzso probe revealed an interesting spatial and zzso expression zzso The gene was expressed specifically in the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were present in zzso cell precursors zzso and also in zzso cells of zzso blood vessels throughout development and in all zzso and zzso so far zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso Because of the unusual combination of zzso zzso and zzso type III zzso in the zzso portion of zzso which is shared by zzso and zzso these molecules may be considered members of a new family of zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso via this new class of zzso zzso could lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of blood vessel zzso
