zzso is an important zzso controlling the branching pattern of zzso zzso This zzso recognizes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso and adds a zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the central zzso zzso Eight zzso of 5 were chemically zzso where zzso of the zzso zzso in 5 was zzso and structurally diverse modifications were introduced at zzso of the same zzso The key intermediate prepared for this purpose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where the original zzso group was readily zzso on the unprotected zzso The eight zzso zzso were evaluated as zzso for zzso both isolated (from zzso zzso and cloned (from rat zzso All of the compounds were found to be competitive zzso with Ki in the range of zzso zzso The conclusion of this work is that recognition of zzso 5 does not involve contact of the zzso end of the zzso zzso with the protein in the zzso (or zzso zzso
