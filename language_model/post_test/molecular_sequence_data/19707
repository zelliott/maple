Compared to the zzso 70 S zzso the zzso 80 S zzso contains additional zzso proteins and extra segments of zzso referred to as zzso expansion segments zzso These zzso zzso zzso are mainly on the periphery of the 80 S zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso studies, but their precise function is not zzso To address the question of whether the zzso zzso are structurally zzso among 80 S zzso of different zzso we performed zzso zzso on 80 S zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso and compared it to the zzso zzso 80 S zzso Our analysis reveals general structural conservation of the zzso expansion segments but also changes in zzso and zzso as well as the absence of a zzso interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The differences provide a hint on the role of zzso zzso in regulating zzso Furthermore, we show that the stalk region and interactions with zzso factor 2 zzso are different in zzso zzso exhibiting a more extensive contact with domain I of zzso
