To test the ability of an zzso processing zzso to cleave zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts containing zzso III zzso sites were zzso zzso in zzso to contain specific zzso zzso zzso zzso One transcript zzso zzso was generated using zzso zzso zzso zzso and a cloned segment of zzso zzso DNA containing the zzso zzso III processing zzso The second transcript was the zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso which was zzso using zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcripts contained zzso zzso groups at positions including the zzso zzso The modified zzso were stable to incubation in zzso zzso and were specifically zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the modified zzso zzso processing site was the same as the zzso site and contained a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso III zzso the zzso zzso bond with zzso zzso zzso III zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso early zzso precursor produced the same gel zzso pattern as that obtained with the control zzso Thus, zzso III zzso specificity is not altered by zzso zzso zzso
