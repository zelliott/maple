In zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins would be a valuable tool in converting those proteins expressed in zzso zzso to their natural zzso For this purpose zzso zzso zzso the zzso responsible for zzso zzso of zzso was characterized from a bovine liver zzso zzso zzso was active in a zzso environment with a pH optimum of zzso and displayed a stimulation by the zzso with the optimum activity in the presence of zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso expressed in zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso indicating its specificity for the naturally zzso zzso zzso zzso of the reaction zzso on synthetic peptides showed that the bovine liver zzso has a higher affinity and reaction rates for those peptides with a zzso zzso on the zzso side of the zzso when compared with a zzso zzso
