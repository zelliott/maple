In zzso the synthesis of zzso peptides in response to microbial infections is under the control of the Toll and immune zzso zzso signaling zzso The Toll signaling zzso responds mainly to the zzso zzso of zzso bacteria and zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso responds to the zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso bacteria and certain zzso zzso Recently we determined the zzso mechanism of a Toll signaling zzso zzso using a large zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso recognition mechanism and its signaling zzso are still unclear in the fly and zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso but not its zzso form, formed a complex with zzso zzso recognition zzso and this complex activated the three-step zzso cascade to produce processed zzso a Toll zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso larvae similarly to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced expression of zzso zzso recognition zzso which is zzso zzso zzso zzso that functions as a zzso zzso scavenger, appearing to function as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that molecular recognition mechanism for zzso zzso zzso is different between zzso larvae and zzso adults, providing zzso zzso of biological diversity of innate immune responses in zzso
