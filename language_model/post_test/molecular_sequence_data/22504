zzso is the major zzso neurotransmitter in the central nervous system but has also important functions in the zzso It is involved in zzso barrier function and in zzso processes after zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been suggested to be implicated in the development of zzso The present study examined the expression and functionality of zzso and zzso zzso receptors on normal human zzso We found that cultured zzso expressed the zzso zzso receptors zzso and 4 zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors 2A and zzso and possibly the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also found to express specific zzso zzso and zzso but appeared neither to produce nor to release zzso zzso with 10 or 100 zzso zzso or zzso elevated zzso calcium zzso in zzso and thus demonstrated the functionality of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not induce zzso toxicity and had no stimulating effect on zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso receptors with zzso zzso or zzso caused a rapid and zzso change in zzso zzso which was associated with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso After 24 h of treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso there was a sharp reduction in the expression of the crucial zzso differentiation and proliferation factor zzso The results of this study demonstrate a role for zzso in zzso regulation that may have implications in zzso associated zzso
