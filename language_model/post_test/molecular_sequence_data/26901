A zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso which had stable zzso in the zzso zzso accumulated less zzso and zzso zzso than the wild type, strain zzso zzso pump zzso both increased the zzso of zzso zzso by cells of the zzso and enhanced their sensitivity to this toxic zzso Cloning a zzso which codes for a putative ABC zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso strain zzso into the zzso strain zzso not only reduced the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso strain but also reduced its sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso pump zzso decreased the rate at which zzso zzso was removed from the cells of the zzso zzso It appears that the putative ABC zzso protein zzso may contribute to zzso of drugs from zzso zzso
