Although it is known that zzso and zzso are essential to the zzso spread of tumor cells, little is known about the molecules that regulate these zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso by a variety of tumor zzso Studies described here examined whether zzso zzso zzso new binding properties on tumor cell zzso zzso zzso analysis with soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins was performed on human pancreatic zzso and zzso and colon zzso tumor zzso zzso cells bound zzso and zzso and zzso cells bound zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells did not bind to zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso on the surface of zzso cells blocked the interactions of zzso to zzso zzso but did not affect accessibility of zzso zzso to other cell surface zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso revealed that zzso expressed by zzso cells was able to bind to zzso zzso zzso expressed on B zzso zzso of zzso containing a targeted zzso (the tandem repeat domain entirely or partially zzso did not block the binding of zzso to its zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that the heavily zzso tandem repeat domain of zzso can simultaneously mediate and block binding to zzso molecules with some molecular specificity and further support the hypothesis that zzso plays a dual role in the zzso spread of tumor zzso
