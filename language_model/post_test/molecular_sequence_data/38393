zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso and zzso resistance, as well as S and zzso phase checkpoint zzso We isolated a human zzso zzso to zzso called zzso The major focus of this report is on a detailed analysis of the physical interactions of the zzso protein and two other checkpoint control zzso zzso and zzso implicated in the cellular response to DNA zzso We found that zzso interacts with itself and the zzso region of zzso In contrast, the zzso portion of the checkpoint protein zzso is essential for interacting with zzso and the zzso region of zzso Since the zzso portion of zzso was previously demonstrated to participate in zzso this protein likely has at least two functional zzso one that regulates programmed cell death and another that regulates cell cycle checkpoint zzso zzso versions of zzso are unable to bind zzso zzso or another zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions can be demonstrated by zzso but not by zzso analysis, suggesting that the proteins associate as part of a complex but do not interact zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that zzso is expressed in different zzso but the zzso is most zzso in zzso where high levels of zzso and zzso message have been zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso and zzso form a complex in human cells and may function in a zzso checkpoint in addition to the cell cycle delays induced by incomplete DNA replication or DNA zzso
