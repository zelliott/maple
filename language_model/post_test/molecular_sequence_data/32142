The structural genes for strain zzso zzso zzso zzso a representative type C zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso First, by determining the zzso zzso acid sequences of sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso bands of zzso zzso zzso it became clear that four zzso 14, 25, 32 and 42 zzso are the products of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso zzso The Western zzso analyses reacting these zzso bands with an zzso serum prepared previously indicated that the products of zzso and zzso are the main proteins of the zzso zzso Then, six candidates for the zzso structural zzso including zzso and zzso gene products, were prepared as zzso zzso Also, the protein corresponding to the zzso gene product was excised from zzso zzso The zzso against these seven proteins were prepared in zzso and finally, the reaction of these zzso to the zzso zzso particles was analyzed by electron zzso It was concluded that a sheath protein and a head protein of the zzso zzso are the products of genes zzso and zzso respectively, and that these two proteins are zzso in the other three converting zzso but not in the zzso zzso
