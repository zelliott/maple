The zzso zzso by amplification of the zzso gene is frequently observed in human zzso and occasionally in other zzso with zzso zzso As a consequence of amplification, elevated levels of the zzso protein are zzso zzso contains a zzso basic region zzso that can bind to DNA, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, which is responsible for the physical interaction with another zzso zzso zzso This principle structure is zzso among all members of the zzso gene zzso The resulting zzso can bind to the DNA sequence zzso The zzso zzso but not zzso zzso near the zzso a region zzso the ability to activate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso probably activate and zzso zzso repress zzso of, as yet, unidentified target zzso In zzso cells, where zzso is zzso the balanced interaction of zzso proteins is probably zzso and, therefore, genes controlled by zzso might be zzso expressed and thereby alter normal cell growth with the consequence of zzso
