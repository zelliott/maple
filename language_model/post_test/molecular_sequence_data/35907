The predicted zzso acid sequence of the protein zzso by a zzso clone isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has approximately zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso There are similar levels of zzso acid identity with other members of the zzso zzso zzso The identities include many zzso highly zzso in the zzso However, the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein zzso clearly lies outside the cluster of the previously characterized members of the zzso A putative protein zzso by a previously zzso partially characterized open reading frame at the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso strain zzso also exhibits similarity to zzso and the zzso zzso
