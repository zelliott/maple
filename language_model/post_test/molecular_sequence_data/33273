zzso reduce zzso compounds and other zzso in living organisms, having interesting implications in environmental and human zzso A putative zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was recently zzso in the completed DNA sequence of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this research, this zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso and the corresponding protein zzso was zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso is a 216 zzso acid zzso zzso which exhibits zzso identity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with those from zzso such as zzso zzso zzso This zzso also showed zzso identity zzso zzso to predicted zzso proteins from other zzso acid zzso It zzso a wide range of electron zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso and it was inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso data showed that it specifically zzso the reduction of the zzso group to the corresponding zzso in the presence of zzso zzso parameters zzso and zzso showed a higher efficiency for the reduction of zzso than for the reduction of zzso It was zzso for the reduction of zzso being unable to reduce other zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso zzso might be more specific than other microbial zzso that reduce a wider range of zzso zzso The zzso and functional role of zzso remain zzso however, their presence in zzso acid bacteria widely occurring in foods and the human zzso tract should be of further zzso
