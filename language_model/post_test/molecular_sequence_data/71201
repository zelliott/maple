A homogeneous zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed for human zzso viral zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso labeled on either side of the zzso bond, to bring two detection zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into proximity allowing zzso resonance energy transfer zzso to zzso zzso of the doubly labeled zzso by zzso zzso zzso complex formation, thereby decreasing zzso and allowing zzso activity to be zzso Potential zzso were evaluated by zzso with the best results being obtained using zzso and zzso where the zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso detection zzso Using these zzso detection conditions, zzso zzso zzso the zzso in 50 zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, pH zzso with apparent zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso rate constant versus zzso concentration suggested a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also zzso to measure the zzso of the zzso by two known zzso
