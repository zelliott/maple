Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso can regulate zzso of selected genes at the level of zzso However, little information concerning the existence of zzso and coordinate gene regulation in this zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso To address these issues, we have focused on the zzso gene linkage group zzso reading frame 23 zzso which includes the zzso analog zzso of the major zzso synthesis zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of an zzso coding for a protein of unknown function the structural genes for DNA zzso zzso and the major zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso protection zzso zzso were used to determine if these genes are organized into an zzso controlled by multiple promoters and the quantities of transcripts produced by these genes relative to each zzso zzso with a probe spanning the zzso zzso intervening region identified a putative zzso promoter within the intervening zzso Multiple zzso zzso spanning the next zzso bases of the linkage group demonstrated the presence of a continuous transcript and thus the existence of an zzso A probe spanning the zzso region revealed that two additional zzso fragments were also protected, which enabled us to identify additional putative promoters for zzso within zzso zzso extension determined that the zzso ends of the three transcripts consist separately of zzso zzso 227 bases upstream of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 336 and 250 bases upstream of zzso zzso zzso of transcripts produced by the three zzso determined the relative amounts of transcripts zzso to zzso to zzso to be zzso
