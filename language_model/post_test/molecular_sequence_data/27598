A barley zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated with a zzso zzso probe of the gene specifying the zzso from zzso The zzso named zzso was found in a zzso zzso zzso library prepared from dark grown barley leaves even though the zzso zzso zzso is absent from such zzso In agreement zzso the clone zzso in Northern zzso analyses with a zzso zzso zzso species present the in zzso zzso zzso fraction of both dark grown and zzso primary leaves of zzso The zzso sequence of the barley clone reveals zzso identity to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso while only zzso identity is observed in comparisons with the clones specifying the zzso zzso At the zzso acid level zzso identity is found between the deduced barley zzso zzso sequence and that of the corresponding zzso zzso from bean and zzso The zzso zzso zzso contain zzso in the putative zzso and and zzso binding zzso In the zzso forms these positions are occupied by zzso zzso
