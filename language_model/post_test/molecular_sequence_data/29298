The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso at zzso zzso lower than do the native zzso zzso The low zzso activity of zzso could be due to differences in cellular environments between these zzso species or to naturally occurring zzso in zzso By screening of a zzso zzso library, two single zzso zzso and zzso were each found to increase zzso approximately zzso When combined, zzso increased zzso zzso that the two zzso act zzso Neither zzso affected zzso protein zzso processing, zzso zzso or target site zzso However, zzso levels in both single zzso and the double zzso were significantly higher than in the wild zzso The zzso zzso resides in the zinc finger of zzso and increases the potential for hydrogen bonding with zzso zzso We generated other zzso that increase the hydrogen bonding potential zzso zzso and zzso and found that they similarly increased zzso This suggests that hydrogen bonding within the zinc finger motif is important for zzso production and builds upon previous studies implicating basic zzso acids zzso the zinc finger as important for zinc finger zzso Although zzso zinc fingers differ from the zinc finger motifs of cellular zzso the requirement for efficient hydrogen bonding is likely zzso
