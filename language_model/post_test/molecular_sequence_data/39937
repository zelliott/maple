zzso are zzso discovered in plants, that control a wide variety of zzso zzso They have also been found in bacteria and zzso but for many species their biological role remains zzso This work concentrates on the zzso system of zzso zzso a zzso soil zzso with two zzso To identify proteins that might share common functions with zzso a zzso analysis was performed on the basis of protein sequences from 138 zzso 

A database of protein sequences from 138 bacteria was zzso Each sequence was zzso against the entire zzso The zzso distribution of each query protein was then compared with the zzso distribution of every other protein (target zzso of the same species, and the target proteins were sorted according to their probability of zzso under random zzso As query zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were chosen along with several zzso proteins from zzso zzso The zzso photosynthesis protein D1 was selected as a zzso In the D1 zzso the ratio between zzso proteins and those not related to photosynthesis among the top 150 in the zzso tables was zzso zzso showing that the method is appropriate for finding partner proteins with common zzso The zzso of zzso with other zzso zzso was remarkably high, although most zzso zzso zzso were not direct zzso zzso of the query zzso This finding implies that zzso and other zzso zzso share common functions as parts of zzso zzso All zzso tested, with one exception, also revealed a remarkably high zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso This result implies a general role of bacterial zzso in ammonium zzso and zzso acid zzso 

It was possible to identify several proteins that might share common functions with bacterial zzso by the zzso zzso This zzso approach might also be helpful in other zzso
