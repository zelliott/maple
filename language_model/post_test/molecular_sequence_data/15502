zzso zzso of a zzso slowly growing, zzso species of the zzso zzso were cultured from respiratory specimens obtained over the last eight years from 17 patients in the zzso These zzso were grouped because they revealed a unique zzso zzso gene sequence and were related to zzso zzso None of the 17 patients met the American zzso Society diagnostic criteria for zzso zzso disease, which zzso the novel zzso from the related species, zzso zzso A zzso zzso approach, including identification by zzso and zzso analysis, zzso gene sequencing and zzso restriction zzso pattern analysis, and sequence analyses of the zzso gene and zzso internal transcribed zzso supported the separate species status of the novel zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the novel zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso A more distinctive zzso of zzso is a prerequisite for the assessment of their clinical zzso
