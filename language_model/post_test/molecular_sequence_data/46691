The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation of an zzso zzso zzso which is structurally divergent but functionally similar to the zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso mediates repression by interacting with zzso a zzso known to form a complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso we identify an zzso zzso zzso that fails to bind zzso and is characterized by zzso defects and zzso Together, these results reveal a novel nuclear zzso zzso that exhibits evolutionary conservation in the mechanism to achieve repression and demonstrate the essential role of repression in hormone zzso
