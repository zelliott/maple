The zzso zzso zzso was recently introduced as a new model zzso for zzso studies, since it contains a full set of zzso genes but only zzso as much DNA as a zzso zzso genes tend to be smaller and densely spaced due to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We isolated the zzso gene for the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso a zzso of heavy metal regulation and zzso stress response previously characterized in zzso In addition, most of the zzso sequence was also zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso protein of zzso is very similar to that of mouse and human, with zzso zzso acid identity in the DNA binding zinc finger domain and 57% overall zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells shows that zzso zzso has the same DNA binding specificity as its zzso counterpart and also zzso zzso in response to zinc and zzso The zzso part of the zzso zzso gene spans zzso zzso and consists of 11 zzso zzso region and first zzso constitute a zzso zzso The distance between stop zzso and zzso motifs is zzso zzso suggesting a very long 3' untranslated zzso region, followed by another zzso island which may represent the promoter of the next gene zzso Part of the zzso zzso structure was also determined in the zzso and some striking similarities were zzso for example, the upstream adjacent gene in both species is zzso zzso a zzso The mouse zzso promoter is also embedded in a zzso island, which however shares no sequence similarity to the one of zzso The zzso zzso island is shorter than the one of the mouse and has no elevated zzso zzso these and other data indicate that zzso islands of fish may represent a primordial stage of zzso island zzso
