zzso growth factor alpha zzso zzso is a 6 zzso zzso zzso that interacts with the zzso growth factor zzso and activates its intrinsic zzso zzso The mature 50 zzso acid zzso alpha is released from a 159 or 160 zzso acid integral membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso at both zzso by an unknown zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso that is transcribed from a gene containing 6 zzso and spanning 85 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso alpha is most prevalent and abundant in transformed cells and tumors, but also zzso at modest levels in a limited number of normal cells and zzso In many zzso cells, zzso processing of zzso alpha is incomplete and/or inefficient, resulting in the preponderance of soluble and/or zzso forms larger than the mature zzso zzso To characterize the biological activities of the zzso zzso alpha precursor in the absence of processing, zzso acid zzso were introduced at the zzso sites by zzso zzso of the rat zzso alpha zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso alpha zzso did not zzso zzso zzso but did accumulate zzso alpha at the cell zzso zzso of these cells with zzso cells resulted in binding and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso calcium in zzso cells, demonstrating that the zzso zzso alpha can activate zzso receptors on adjacent cells, leading to signal zzso In addition, rat zzso zzso expressing the zzso or zzso zzso alpha became zzso transformed in culture, and induced tumors in nude zzso Thus, the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso triggers zzso that can culminate in zzso zzso To characterize the zzso and pathological effects of zzso alpha in zzso particularly with respect to zzso cells, transgenic mice were developed which zzso the growth factor in multiple or specific zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha driven by the zzso promoter induced zzso zzso in several zzso including liver and zzso without zzso normal tissue zzso In contrast, the zzso displayed increased proliferation of both zzso cells and zzso and focal zzso of zzso cell zzso This pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso were reproduced when zzso alpha expression was placed under control of the zzso promoter, and thus locally restricted to zzso cells, suggesting zzso and/or zzso mode of zzso Finally, zzso of zzso alpha promoted zzso transformation of certain zzso In zzso zzso there was dramatic zzso and zzso with focal evidence of zzso in zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
