zzso occurs as a zzso group of proteins which form part of the regulatory system of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These proteins are present in zzso muscle as zzso Mr zzso that are specific for the muscle type and under individual genetic zzso zzso occupies a central position in the chain of events starting with the binding of calcium to zzso C and ending with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso filament in zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit the zzso of zzso in a manner that is zzso by zzso is fundamental to its role but the molecular mechanism involved is not yet completely zzso For the zzso to be regulated the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso must undergo changes as the calcium concentration in the muscle cell rises, which result in the loss of its zzso zzso A variety of techniques have enabled the sites of interaction to be defined in terms of regions of the zzso chain that must be intact to preserve the biological properties of zzso There is also evidence for zzso changes that occur when the complex with zzso binds zzso zzso a detailed high resolution structure of the zzso complex and its relation to zzso is not yet zzso zzso zzso changes in those proteins with which it zzso that are essential for their zzso In the special case of cardiac zzso its effect on the calcium binding properties of zzso is modulated by zzso It has yet to be determined whether zzso acts directly as an inhibitor or indirectly by interacting with associated proteins to facilitate their role in the regulatory zzso
