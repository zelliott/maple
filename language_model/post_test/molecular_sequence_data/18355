zzso zzso fluid contains a protein capable of inducing zzso formation from animal cap cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso at the late zzso zzso The procedure for zzso of this protein is described and includes the following steps: zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso size exclusion zzso and a second zzso zzso A partially zzso preparation of a zzso factor with high zzso activity was thus zzso zzso zzso gel zzso with subsequent transfer of proteins onto zzso membrane was used to obtain the protein in pure zzso The membrane was cut, the proteins zzso and each fraction tested for zzso zzso The zzso activity corresponded to a protein of molecular mass 25 zzso (in zzso zzso consisting of two identical zzso connected by zzso zzso The zzso factor, at zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced development of zzso and muscle cells and, at lower zzso zzso and blood zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the protein were zzso and found to be identical to those of the zzso of the beta zzso of zzso and zzso known regulators of zzso zzso by zzso zzso The beta zzso is zzso with the transforming growth zzso family of zzso On the basis of the estimated molecular mass of the zzso factor and its zzso sequence it is suggested that the protein is zzso or a related zzso
