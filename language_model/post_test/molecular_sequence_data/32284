The avian eggshell is a highly ordered zzso composed mainly of calcium zzso associated with an organic zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso This structure provides the developing zzso with protection from physical damage and microbial zzso zzso zzso is a 32 zzso zzso zzso protein which has been cloned and demonstrates zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to further study its function, zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso zzso The protein was extracted from inclusion bodies and zzso by sequential zzso zzso and zzso metal zzso affinity zzso as a 58 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso significantly inhibited bovine zzso and also inhibited the growth of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso may show similar activity to the fusion protein and reinforce the zzso properties of the eggshell by providing protection to the developing avian zzso zzso is the first example of an eggshell specific protein to be successfully cloned and expressed in a zzso zzso The association of an zzso zzso inhibitor with the outer eggshell and zzso of the table egg may enhance the food safety of this zzso
