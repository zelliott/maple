zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which, upon zzso zzso is activated within zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the highly ubiquitous zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso Associated with zzso receptors it is activated by zzso zzso after the triggering of zzso surface zzso We have cloned and zzso the human zzso zzso zzso extension analysis reveals the existence of a major zzso start zzso The zzso promoter contains zzso stretches with a cluster of zzso zzso consensus sites, an zzso and an zzso site between zzso zzso to zzso A construct containing the region from zzso to zzso zzso full promoter activity, as shown by fusion to a zzso reporter gene zzso The zzso part of the promoter between zzso zzso to zzso containing an zzso zzso and zzso box contributed zzso to promoter activity in the zzso line zzso but not in three adherent cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso is expressed at low levels with a half life greater than 4 zzso After treatment with serum, zzso zzso acid, or with zzso increased levels of zzso zzso were induced in zzso
