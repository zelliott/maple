zzso zzso that had been zzso with DNA were examined for their potential use as donor zzso in nuclear zzso zzso zzso were obtained from zzso collected by zzso zzso zzso matured and zzso in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein C zzso DNA zzso and cultured in zzso on liver cells of buffalo rat zzso zzso zzso from these zzso were transferred into zzso bovine zzso received from an zzso by zzso at 40 h zzso Following 7 d of culture, the zzso stage was recorded, and resulting zzso were prepared for analysis by zzso chain zzso zzso that were derived from zzso donor zzso did not differ from control donor zzso (11 zzso zzso in development to the zzso and zzso zzso Of the zzso from 20 zzso donor zzso 19 were positive for the injected zzso Of 37 zzso developing zzso only 12 zzso were positive for the injected zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso can be successfully used in a nuclear transfer program to produce additional viable zzso and that these zzso may be reliably screened for the zzso for transfer to zzso
