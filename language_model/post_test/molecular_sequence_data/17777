Two general methods which exploit the zzso of zzso groups toward zzso are described for the synthesis of zzso zzso for use as zzso zzso zzso In the first approach, zzso acid zzso zzso was used to couple zzso zzso to calf zzso alkaline zzso to provide a zzso zzso in zzso zzso The second strategy employed zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso with a zzso zzso in zzso and zzso yields, zzso The zzso zzso zzso was able to detect 6 zzso of target DNA in 4 zzso while the zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso lower in its sensitivity of detection by using dye zzso zzso
