zzso are a zzso of zzso zzso zzso which function to regulate a number of key biological processes including zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso are the only viruses known to zzso functional zzso While some zzso zzso regulate inflammation zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso or zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso the function of other zzso zzso remains zzso The zzso virus zzso zzso protein is zzso identical to zzso and shares all of the zzso structural zzso However, no zzso activity has been demonstrated for zzso to zzso Earlier we showed that zzso with the zzso gene deleted, unlike zzso virus, fails to grow on zzso or zzso cells zzso Ali, zzso zzso Turner, zzso zzso Brooks, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that in the absence of a functional zzso zzso infected zzso cells which exhibit the zzso features of zzso fail to activate terminal zzso or cleave the death zzso zzso or zzso zzso We show that zzso forms a stable complex in zzso with zzso G, a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso loop zzso zzso of the critical zzso and zzso zzso abolish this zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso also fail to grow on zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that the full virus host range depends on the zzso activity of zzso and that in restrictive cells zzso zzso a zzso with zzso activity and may function to inhibit a zzso zzso of zzso
