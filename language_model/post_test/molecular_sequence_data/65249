zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso is partially influenced by the zzso of the infecting zzso zzso using zzso zzso or peptides results in diminished zzso among individuals infected with zzso zzso We examined the magnitude of this effect on detection of core zzso by using zzso core zzso zzso to test 254 zzso zzso individuals infected with zzso zzso or zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso reacted with zzso zzso and zzso of all samples, zzso zzso zzso detected zzso of individuals infected with zzso or 2 but only zzso of those infected with zzso 3, 4, or zzso zzso zzso was also observed for peptides zzso and zzso The use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso within the zzso region detected zzso in zzso of zzso thereby eliminating the zzso zzso detection observed with shorter zzso zzso differences between peptides and core of the infecting isolate did not entirely account for the zzso zzso since some individuals displayed zzso to peptides containing up to seven zzso acid differences relative to the sequence of the infecting zzso while others with identical core sequences had little or no zzso Thus, zzso core sequence divergence accounts for only a portion of the differential core zzso zzso observed when zzso peptides are zzso zzso in immune response between individuals infected with identical zzso also plays a significant role in core zzso detection using short zzso
