The zzso and zzso proteins in zzso are known to exist in the zzso zzso space and to form a zzso complex involved in the import of the zzso inner membrane protein zzso the central component of the zzso zzso Here, we have isolated zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and have shown that zzso lacking the zzso complex were deficient in the import of the outer membrane zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso precursor contacts the zzso zzso The complex is involved at an early point in the zzso assembly zzso because zzso can only be detected during the initial stages of zzso zzso In zzso lacking the zzso complex, the zzso precursor appears in a previously characterized early intermediate of zzso assembly more slowly than in wild type zzso Thus, our data suggest a model in which one of the first steps in zzso assembly may be interaction with the zzso zzso As in zzso the zzso zzso zzso precursor was imported zzso into zzso lacking the zzso complex when the membrane potential was zzso zzso import zzso could also be zzso to the complex, suggesting a dual role for the zzso zzso space complex in the import of proteins found in both the outer and inner zzso zzso
