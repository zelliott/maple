zzso sites of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso from an extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by two independent zzso reactions and zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso as zzso None of the zzso zzso which have the zzso sequence but are not long enough to form the zzso structure could be zzso by zzso The zzso fragments having the intact zzso structure served as zzso for zzso with a similar zzso but zzso times larger zzso as compared with the intact zzso The results of zzso analyses were consistent with the zzso zzso zzso protected only the zzso region of zzso from zzso zzso attack, but other parts of zzso extending from the zzso acid stem to the T arm became more sensitive to zzso zzso suggesting a considerable change of zzso zzso structure due to complex formation with zzso These results indicate that a zzso structure is a prerequisite for recognition by zzso
