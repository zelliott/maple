zzso coli zzso is a component of the zzso drug zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso with human zzso zzso cells, zzso coli zzso is capable of suppressing adherence of zzso zzso coli zzso In this study, we demonstrate that a completely novel class II zzso produced by zzso zzso coli zzso is responsible for this zzso We named this zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso S is coded on a zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso which we have completely zzso and zzso The zzso S zzso is about zzso zzso in size and is comprised of four zzso zzso of the genes and gene fragments followed by gene expression experiments enabled us to functionally characterize all members of this zzso and to clearly identify the zzso sequences zzso the zzso itself zzso its transport apparatus and the gene zzso zzso self immunity against zzso zzso zzso of cloned zzso zzso zzso activity, thus protecting indicator strain zzso coli zzso in the in zzso adherence zzso Moreover, growth of zzso coli transformed with a zzso containing zzso under control of an zzso zzso zzso is inhibited upon zzso zzso Our data provide further zzso insight into the zzso behavior of zzso coli zzso
