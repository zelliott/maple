zzso the dynamic fate and interactions of zzso zzso within living cells and organisms is a prerequisite for their use as in zzso sensors or zzso While recent research has provided indications on the effect of size, shape, and surface properties of zzso on their zzso by living cells, the zzso fate of the zzso after zzso has been essentially zzso Here we show that, upon zzso in a wide range of zzso cells, biological molecules attached to the zzso are zzso within the zzso compartments through zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso tools, we show that zzso L is able to cleave more than a third of the human zzso indicating that this degradation process is likely to happen to most zzso zzso with peptides and proteins and cannot be ignored in the design of zzso for zzso zzso Preservation of the zzso can be achieved by a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
