A zzso library derived from zzso cells of an zzso rabbit expressing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso chains zzso zzso was screened with V zzso or C zzso zzso of a zzso light chain bearing zzso zzso The zzso sequences of three zzso clones were found to be identical within the V zzso J zzso and C zzso zzso The V zzso region was zzso similar to that of the functional zzso gene V zzso 2, and the C zzso region was identical to that of gene C zzso 6, recently zzso Gene C zzso 6 exhibited four zzso differences when compared with gene C zzso 5, the latter zzso zzso zzso The data presented here and in the accompanying report zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1990, zzso support the view that gene C zzso 6 encodes the C region of zzso zzso chains and that zzso and zzso markers designate two distinct zzso forms of zzso zzso On the basis of comparative Southern zzso analyses and restriction maps of cloned zzso regions containing V zzso and C zzso zzso a scheme is proposed to account for the zzso and zzso zzso
