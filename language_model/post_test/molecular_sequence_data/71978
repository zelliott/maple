In sub-Saharan Africa, where the effects of human zzso virus type 1 zzso have been most zzso there are multiple zzso of this zzso The distribution of different zzso within African populations is generally not linked to particular risk zzso Thus, Africa is an ideal setting in which to examine the diversity and mixing of viruses from different zzso on a population zzso In this setting, it is also possible to address whether infection with a particular zzso is associated with differences in disease zzso To address these questions, we analyzed the zzso zzso plasma viral zzso and zzso zzso levels in 320 women from zzso zzso zzso was determined by a combination of zzso mobility zzso and sequence analyses of envelope zzso using geographically diverse zzso reference sequences as well as envelope sequences of known zzso from zzso The distribution of zzso in this population was as zzso zzso A, 225 zzso zzso D, 65 zzso zzso C, 22 zzso and zzso G, 1 zzso zzso zzso envelope genes were detected in zzso of the sequences zzso Given that the sequences analyzed represented only a small fraction of the zzso zzso this suggests that zzso zzso viral zzso may be very common in Kenya and in other parts of Africa where there are multiple zzso The plasma viral zzso levels were highest in women infected with zzso C virus, and women infected with zzso C virus had significantly lower zzso zzso levels than women infected with the other zzso Together, these data suggest that women in Kenya who are infected with zzso C viruses are at more advanced stages of zzso than women infected with zzso A or zzso There are at least two models to explain the data from this zzso study; one is that infection with zzso C is associated with a more rapid disease zzso and the second is that zzso C represents an older epidemic in zzso zzso between these possibilities in a zzso study will be important for increasing our understanding of the role of specific zzso in the transmission and zzso of zzso
