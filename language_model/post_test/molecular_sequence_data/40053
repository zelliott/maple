zzso landmark zzso scanning zzso is a zzso of zzso DNA, which zzso thousands of zzso In a conventional zzso method for zzso analysis, we have used a zzso sensitive restriction zzso zzso as a zzso However, it was unable to discriminate zzso zzso from sequence zzso Here, we report an improved zzso method to detect zzso sites zzso We employed zzso zzso and zzso that recognize the same sequence zzso but have different zzso zzso We carried out the zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso Columbia, and obtained a pair of spot patterns with zzso and zzso We detected 22 spots in both zzso In comparison of them, zzso of the spots were zzso which indicated the zzso of zzso zzso Further analyses revealed an additional zzso site of zzso Moreover, 52 and 54 restriction zzso sites were also analyzed in two other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 52 common sites showed zzso zzso among the three zzso The restriction sites analyzed in this study were located in or near zzso and contribute new data about the correlation between zzso status and gene zzso zzso this result strongly indicates that the improved zzso method is readily zzso to practical analyses of zzso zzso and provides clues to the relationship between zzso and gene zzso
