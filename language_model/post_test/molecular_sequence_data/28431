Human zzso clones that span the entire zzso zzso zzso gene have been isolated and used to determine its zzso The gene is approximately 30 zzso zzso pairs in length in which the zzso specifying sequence is divided into 10 zzso zzso zzso are of average size zzso zzso whereas zzso 10, which specifies the entire 3' zzso zzso is 1948 zzso in zzso zzso 1 codes for the signal zzso zzso 2 includes the protein domain that was shown to bind to the zzso zzso and zzso 6 and 9 code for sequences that are relatively rich in basic zzso acids and therefore likely to be involved in zzso of the zzso to the zzso zzso by interaction with the zzso domain of zzso zzso Four closely spaced zzso zzso zzso were observed, indicating multiple zzso initiation sites, one of which seems to be zzso Two potential zzso sequence motifs in the zzso upstream region were zzso One may specify expression in response to zzso zzso zzso and the other may be responsible for expression in zzso
