A model is proposed for the zzso structure of zzso a potent zzso and zzso zzso from vascular zzso The model is derived through protein structure prediction and circular zzso studies, and is based on the atomic coordinates for the zzso zzso zzso The model derived shows the same zzso motif as observed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of this model we suggest possible strategies for zzso zzso design, and note that this motif may be common in a number of peptides acting on channel zzso
