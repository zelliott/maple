Two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso Each gene is composed of five zzso and zzso positions are zzso however, zzso sizes and sequences are not the zzso The predicted protein sequences are zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso are only zzso zzso Both deduced protein sequences contain the expected zzso zzso transit zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis shows that both genes are expressed under normal growth conditions and that their zzso transcripts are zzso to the zzso leader zzso The latter result together with Northern zzso analysis indicate that both genes have zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso X, and the location of zzso was confirmed to be zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to amplify the zzso regions zzso the predicted mature zzso zzso zzso proteins and each was cloned and expressed to high levels in zzso coli cells deficient in zzso zzso zzso Both proteins were shown to be active in zzso coli, providing similar protection against zzso zzso zzso zzso The expressed zzso which were not inhibited by hydrogen zzso or zzso are zzso show quite different zzso zzso and zzso points, but exhibit comparable specific zzso
