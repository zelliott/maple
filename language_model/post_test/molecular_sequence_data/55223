zzso encephalitis zzso is prevalent over a wide area of the zzso zzso zzso viruses cause severe encephalitis in humans, with serious zzso and have a significant impact on public health in these endemic zzso To gain insight into genetic evolution of zzso encephalitis virus zzso in China, the complete zzso sequences of two zzso strains zzso and zzso which were isolated in 1953 and 2001 respectively, were zzso The complete zzso sequences of two strains were all consist zzso zzso and there are 364 zzso deletion in the 3' zzso zzso Compared with other zzso zzso zzso range from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso on the level of zzso zzso trees based on the complete zzso open reading frame and E gene zzso sequences all showed that the strains zzso and zzso belong to zzso zzso and cluster with other Chinese zzso zzso All these implied that zzso prevalent in China were highly conservative, other measurement should be taken to improve protective efficacy of present zzso
