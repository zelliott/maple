zzso initiation in zzso requires zzso the cap binding zzso which mediates its function through an interaction with the scaffolding protein zzso as part of the zzso zzso In zzso four zzso zzso have been described but the specific function of each is not well zzso Here, we report a study of these proteins in zzso zzso zzso through zzso At the sequence level, they can be assigned to two groups: zzso and 2, similar in size to zzso zzso and zzso and 4, with long zzso zzso All are zzso zzso but whilst zzso and 2 zzso to both the nucleus and zzso zzso and 4 are strictly zzso and are also more zzso After zzso through zzso zzso was the only zzso confirmed to be essential for viability of the insect zzso zzso In contrast, zzso 3 and 4 were all essential for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and 2 caused zzso of growth and death in zzso but with a delayed impact on translation, whilst zzso of zzso alone or a combined zzso and 4 zzso led to substantial translation zzso which preceded cellular death by several days, at zzso Only zzso and 4 were found to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound both zzso and 4 whilst zzso bound only to zzso These results are consistent with zzso and 4 having distinct but relevant roles in initiation of protein zzso
