To help uncover the mechanisms underlying the staggered expression of zzso genes in the growth plate, we dissected the zzso mechanisms driving expression of the zzso gene zzso We show that a unique assembly of zzso zzso zzso elements in the zzso zzso promoter restricts expression to the zzso and zzso zones of the growth zzso These elements functionally interact with zzso elements and likewise are capable of restricting the domain of activity of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso elements include a zzso element binding the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso element binding zzso zzso and an zzso zzso element binding the Sox trio and other zzso zzso binding to zzso is indispensable for functional interaction with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in a protein zzso manner, possibly to enhance zzso activity in early stages of zzso and repress it at later zzso zzso our data suggest a novel model zzso Sox and zzso proteins bind to zzso zzso zzso elements and functionally interact with each other to finely tune gene expression in specific zones of the cartilage growth zzso
