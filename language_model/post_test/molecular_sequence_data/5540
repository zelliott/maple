In order to investigate the effect of primary zzso peptides on zzso zzso zzso we have zzso five molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a 16 to zzso zzso sequence and the nuclear zzso sequence zzso zzso of zzso virus 40 zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso cluster was in zzso the signal sequence of the heavy chain of zzso zzso zzso G and in zzso the fusion zzso of human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained by slight zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that, in zzso zzso peptides were mainly under the form of zzso whereas zzso peptides displayed a high proportion of zzso These peptides proved to be zzso for some zzso notably zzso zzso but were much less potent than zzso Furthermore, their zzso activity was independent of the average thickness of the plasma membrane zzso core whilst that of zzso was zzso related to the zzso zzso and the synthetic peptides abolished zzso cell zzso and zzso but only zzso and zzso peptides split the cells into zzso forms displaying an average diameter of zzso 1 zzso In contrast to zzso the synthetic peptides zzso zzso suggesting that their zzso zzso was exposed on the cell zzso zzso peptides zzso though less efficiently than zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso membrane potential zzso zzso and zzso pH zzso zzso zzso at zzso much lower than their minimal zzso zzso whilst zzso peptides had no effect on delta zzso and delta pH in the same zzso Actually, the zzso activity of these peptides towards zzso was zzso to their ability to collapse the zzso zzso zzso
