zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso which is an essential precursor for the zzso pathways of zzso and other components in zzso The crystal structure of a truncated form of zzso has been solved at zzso A resolution using the zzso anomalous zzso technique and its function tested with zzso zzso The zzso is composed of two distinct zzso connected by a long zzso zzso zzso an zzso domain which resembles the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso domain which adopts a left-handed parallel zzso structure zzso as found in zzso bacterial zzso Three zzso molecules assemble into a zzso arrangement with tightly packed parallel zzso zzso the long zzso zzso being seated on top of the arrangement and the zzso zzso projected away from the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso A resolution structure of the zzso complex reveals the structural bases required for the zzso zzso These structures exemplify a three-dimensional template for the development of new zzso agents and for studying other members of the large family of zzso bacterial zzso
