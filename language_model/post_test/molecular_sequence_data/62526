zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and formation of the active center were constructed, and their characteristics and crystal structures were zzso As expected from the structure of the zzso binding pocket, the zzso zzso showed significantly lower zzso and zzso values for aromatic zzso and zzso respectively, than zzso zzso In the crystal structure of a complex with an inhibitor zzso zzso the zzso group of zzso formed hydrogen bonds with both zzso acid and zzso which is located in the active zzso The zzso zzso showed an elevated zzso value and a significantly decreased zzso zzso The zzso which contains no zzso zzso zzso was prepared from zzso coli cells grown in medium without zzso zzso It showed no zzso zzso A zzso bond between zzso and zzso was formed in the zzso zzso In the highly zzso sequence motif in the zzso cluster region, two positions are exclusively zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were constructed, each zzso being replaced with an zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed similar characteristics to the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso showed a very low zzso content and zzso activity compared with the zzso zzso and zzso modifications of zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso The zzso zzso may be involved in the interaction with the zzso zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso
