zzso are basic zzso zzso factors that function in cell type zzso The gene zzso encodes two zzso zzso and zzso which are required in zzso zzso proteins can interact directly with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to induce target gene zzso Prior investigations have shown that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso or zzso in zzso or in zzso However, zzso lacks the important zzso zzso domain zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso in zzso have not been zzso and the functional consequences of zzso are largely zzso Here, we use zzso to show that a zzso zzso at position 34 within zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso lies adjacent to a zzso zzso zzso motif that interacts directly with the zzso domain of zzso We show that zzso at zzso increases the affinity of zzso for the zzso domain and enhances zzso zzso zzso Our results illustrate for the first time that zzso can both zzso and be zzso by, zzso and that zzso recruitment may promote zzso induction in part through zzso of zzso zzso
