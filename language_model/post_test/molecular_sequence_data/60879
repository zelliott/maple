The zzso disease zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso with no known function and no zzso sequence similarity to other proteins in current zzso To gain insight into the normal biological role of zzso we isolated and zzso a zzso zzso a protein that is a likely zzso of the HD gene product in zzso zzso We also determined the complete sequence of 43 125 zzso base pairs of zzso DNA that zzso the zzso HD zzso allowing the zzso structure and zzso and zzso regions to be zzso The predicted zzso zzso protein has zzso zzso zzso which is several hundred zzso acids larger than any other previously characterized member of the HD zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso sequences indicates that zzso HD has 29 zzso compared with the 67 zzso present in zzso HD zzso and that zzso zzso lacks the zzso and zzso stretches present in its zzso zzso The zzso HD zzso is expressed in a broad range of zzso stages and in the adult, a zzso pattern of expression similar to that observed for zzso HD zzso We can discern five regions of high similarity from multiple sequence alignments between zzso and zzso zzso These regions may define functionally important zzso within the zzso
