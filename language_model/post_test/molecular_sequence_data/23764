We have shown previously that zzso zzso such as zzso can mediate potent zzso effects against zzso solid zzso zzso is a newly described zzso zzso that zzso various aspects of T and/or zzso cell zzso We hypothesized that zzso might also mediate potent zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso cells engineered to zzso zzso demonstrated markedly delayed growth compared with control mice, and complete durable tumor zzso was observed in zzso of mice bearing either zzso or zzso zzso tumors, and zzso of mice bearing induced zzso zzso The majority of mice cured of their original zzso tumors were resistant to tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso tumors were heavily infiltrated by zzso T cells, and draining zzso zzso zzso from mice bearing zzso zzso tumors are primed to zzso more readily when cultured ex zzso with zzso compared with zzso from mice bearing control tumors, and to zzso higher levels of zzso In addition, marked enhancement of local zzso gene expression and potent zzso of cell surface zzso class I expression are noted within zzso tumors compared with control zzso zzso these zzso occur in conjunction with the generation of zzso zzso zzso in mice bearing zzso tumors, and the induction of tumor zzso via mechanisms that are critically dependent on zzso but not zzso T cells or zzso zzso zzso these studies suggest that zzso could be used zzso to zzso the host zzso immune response in patients with zzso
