To identify and characterize a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of the Yellow zzso 

We used zzso zzso gene sequences based zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso DNA G + C content zzso determination of cellular fatty zzso testing of carbon sources and respiratory zzso and experiment of zzso zzso Its capability of degrading zzso zzso in zzso media supplemented with nine zzso zzso as sole source of carbon and energy was further zzso 

The zzso isolate zzso was a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso as its zzso respiratory zzso The similarity between its zzso zzso gene and that of its most closely related type strain in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and their level of DNA zzso was zzso The appropriate temperature for its growth ranged from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C with the optimum of 30 degrees C, the appropriate initial acidity from pH zzso to zzso with the optimum of pH zzso and the appropriate zzso zzso from zzso to zzso with the optimum of zzso It zzso many carbohydrates and organic acids and was sensitive to diverse antibiotics including zzso and zzso The G + C content of its zzso DNA was zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The isolate zzso was identified as a petroleum zzso novel species of zzso zzso holding the potential of being applied in the zzso of oil zzso
