Two different amplification products, termed zzso and zzso showing a high similarity to zzso zzso sequences from plants, were obtained from zzso zzso using two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso The genes corresponding to these zzso clones were designated zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso library resulted in the isolation of zzso clones for zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid zzso sequence from the full-length zzso suggests that the gene product contains all regions associated with zzso function of zzso zzso zzso zzso A first zzso analysis including only zzso from plants suggested that the two zzso genes of zzso zzso arose by an ancient zzso event, zzso the divergence of zzso and zzso zzso usage analysis showed a bias towards zzso ending zzso This tendency is likely due to the biased zzso composition of the asparagus zzso rather than to the zzso selection for specific zzso Using principal coordinate analysis, the evolutionary zzso of plant zzso with zzso sequences from a large spectrum of organisms was zzso The results showed a closer affinity of plant zzso to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso species, when compared to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis at specific zzso acid signatures, known to affect the zzso stability of zzso and zzso of zzso activity at zzso temperatures, showed a greater adaptation to zzso conditions for the asparagus and tobacco zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso
