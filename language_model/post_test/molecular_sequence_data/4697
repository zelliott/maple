Loss of zzso at zzso zzso is common in human prostate cancer, suggesting the presence of one or more tumor zzso genes at this zzso A zzso gene that is expressed specifically in adult human zzso zzso the expression of which is regulated by zzso maps to zzso zzso Fine structure in zzso mapping showed that zzso is zzso to zzso zzso scavenger zzso type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and very close to zzso zzso zzso light zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of 48 radical zzso cancer specimens and 3 zzso for the entire coding region of zzso showed no zzso sequence zzso in 50 specimens and total absence of the gene in 1 zzso known to have a zzso deletion of zzso zzso was found to have a zzso at zzso 154 in zzso 52 that resulted in a zzso sequence change and an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso This zzso was present in zzso of DNA zzso If zzso is a target of the zzso zzso it is not via disruption of the coding region of the zzso
