The zzso zzso has a tandem dual zzso zzso where each zzso is a separate zzso domain, but the zzso function together to bind zzso zzso We sought to understand the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso by comparing sites of zzso contacts in a series of cooperative and zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso radical zzso zzso zzso and native zzso zzso The results illustrate the importance of a direct or indirect interaction between the zzso hairpin of zzso 2 and the zzso zzso of zzso 1 in cooperative zzso zzso Furthermore, our data support a model in which zzso binding is zzso where the binding of zzso to the second zzso allows zzso interactions to be made that facilitate binding of a second zzso zzso to the first zzso These results provide insight into cooperative zzso binding in zzso zzso
