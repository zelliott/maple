zzso of zzso zzso is known to be triggered by nutrients such as zzso and zzso and facilitated by zzso however the role of CO2 has not been fully zzso During the studies of the zzso zzso zzso we found that CO2 could be replaced by zzso or zzso zzso pH zzso zzso We also found that the spores obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso without zzso Moreover, the spores could zzso in the absence of zzso when the spores were incubated with zzso or under zzso zzso zzso zzso which might consist of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is one of the key zzso involved in the spore zzso and converts the zzso form of the spore zzso zzso zzso to the mature zzso zzso of zzso in the spores obtained from the mother strain of zzso zzso zzso requires nutrients plus zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, mature zzso was found in the spores obtained from the cells zzso zzso when the spores were treated by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso and zzso zzso pH can trigger the zzso of the spores obtained from zzso zzso cells zzso zzso
