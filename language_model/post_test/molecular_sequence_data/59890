In zzso zzso a zzso zzso system zzso has been characterized and it was shown to be involved in zzso and zzso zzso but no zzso zzso activity could be zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso amplified by zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis showed four zzso which could zzso proteins similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso in a zzso of zzso sake impaired in zzso activity restored this zzso Furthermore, this DNA zzso zzso the regulatory function of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the protein zzso by zzso could also play a regulatory role in zzso zzso
