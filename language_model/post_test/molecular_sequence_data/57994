The zzso promoter regions of the zzso gene from man, beef, dog and rat were compared by transient expression in primary cultured dog zzso All four promoter regions were able to control properly the expression of a reporter gene in response to zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, despite extensive sequence zzso the zzso activities of these four zzso zzso promoters were differently affected by equivalent zzso zzso sequence elements from these promoter regions also exhibited distinct binding characteristics in zzso experiments conducted in the presence of nuclear proteins from bovine zzso Our observations show that the highly zzso zzso promoters may exhibit unexpected functional differences in a specific zzso and indicate that some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of zzso gene expression have evolved differently within zzso
