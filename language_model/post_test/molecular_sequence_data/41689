zzso protein assembly is a fundamental process in all zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein is an essential component of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes, and it is exported across the zzso zzso of bacteria and plants in a folded zzso by the twin zzso protein transport zzso zzso transport zzso Although the zzso protein in most organisms is a zzso membrane zzso in zzso it is a zzso protein with three zzso zzso In this work, we show that the zzso protein of zzso zzso requires both the zzso and the zzso pathways for its zzso zzso and zzso approaches revealed that the initial two zzso zzso were integrated into the membrane in a zzso manner, whereas integration of the third zzso domain, and thus the correct orientation of the zzso domain, required the activity of the zzso zzso This work reveals an unprecedented zzso between the mechanistically distinct zzso and zzso systems in the assembly of a single integral membrane zzso
