The mouse Clara Cell 10 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was used to isolate a zzso zzso containing the zzso gene sequence in a 14 zzso zzso insert from a mouse zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso of this clone was zzso The zzso region zzso zzso zzso of zzso region, zzso zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso of DNA zzso the 3' end of the zzso Computer assisted sequence analysis identified potential zzso acting response elements for the zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso The presence of B1 zzso repetitive sequence also has been identified in a similar position reported in rat zzso zzso zzso As with the rat zzso the zzso zzso region also contains deletions of a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso sequence present in the rabbit zzso zzso these regions are reported to contain a cluster of zzso zzso binding sites and zzso zzso binding sites, zzso
