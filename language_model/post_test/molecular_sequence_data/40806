An open reading frame zzso was found in the zzso zzso of the zzso strain of zzso zzso that showed high similarity to the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso gene in other zzso So far all other typical zzso genes identified in this zzso require zzso editing to generate zzso capable of directing protein zzso The zzso zzso sequence was compared to the putative zzso gene in the related zzso zzso zzso which would require zzso Based on this comparison, editing sites could be predicted for the zzso zzso gene that would result in the synthesis of a highly zzso zzso protein between the two zzso To determine the editing status of the zzso gene in other zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to amplify this region from eight other independent zzso of the A1 Central American zzso zzso In each case a zzso base pair zzso was detected by zzso amplification and zzso Three patterns of sequence variation were zzso however all base zzso were in the third zzso position and silent with respect to the zzso acids zzso The distribution of the sequence zzso was mapped zzso The requirement for zzso editing in all other typical zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the presence of zzso editing in the zzso gene of zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso zzso gene might have been edited at one zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso gene may have lost the requirement for zzso editing by reverse zzso of an edited transcript that subsequently was inserted into the zzso
