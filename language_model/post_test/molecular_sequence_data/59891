zzso zzso acquires iron from the zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso This involves two zzso zzso proteins zzso termed zzso and zzso which show considerable preference for the human form of zzso Since the zzso are attracting considerable attention as potential vaccine zzso we used zzso affinity zzso to examine their conservation amongst 28 zzso zzso type b strains belonging to different zzso zzso as well as six zzso zzso Whole cells of all type b and zzso strains examined bound human zzso whilst most strains possessed a zzso of approximately 105 zzso the molecular mass of zzso varied from 79 to 94 zzso zzso raised against zzso native zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso on Western blots with the respective zzso of all the zzso strains zzso When used to probe zzso zzso zzso zzso from each of four mice zzso with the zzso zzso complex recognized the 68 zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso but not the 78 zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso from one mouse also reacted zzso with zzso of strain zzso Apart from a weak reaction with the zzso of a zzso 5 strain, this mouse zzso failed to recognize the zzso of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso recognized the zzso of all zzso and zzso strains zzso Since zzso zzso forms part of the natural zzso of the upper respiratory zzso human zzso were screened for the presence of zzso to the zzso zzso from healthy adults contained zzso which recognized both zzso and zzso from zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso meningitis patients contained zzso which, on Western zzso recognized the zzso of both zzso These data demonstrate the existence of shared zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso despite their zzso species zzso
