Recent evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso related to zzso zzso zzso are key components of zzso programmed cell death or zzso We have shown recently that the zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso cleave the zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of a new zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso designated zzso that encodes a protein with the highest degree of zzso to zzso compared to other family zzso An alternatively spliced zzso named zzso zzso was also zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso has intrinsic zzso zzso The specific activity of zzso alpha toward the zzso zzso zzso and zzso resembles that of zzso Like zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso the active zzso alpha is made of two zzso derived from a precursor zzso zzso It was of interest that zzso zzso zzso can form an active zzso zzso complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso and vice versa, as determined by the ability of the zzso complexes to induce zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso alpha and zzso can interact to form an active zzso zzso zzso zzso We also provide evidence that zzso can efficiently cleave zzso zzso but not the opposite, suggesting that zzso alpha zzso in zzso may depend in part on zzso zzso The high degree of conservation in structure and specific activity and the coexistence of zzso alpha and zzso in the same cell suggests that the zzso zzso activity observed during zzso cannot solely be attributed to zzso but could also be an activity of zzso zzso
