alpha zzso zzso is a zzso of alpha zzso which has lost its ability to inhibit zzso zzso and which is associated with a zzso disorder zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso The abnormal protein was zzso from the plasma of a zzso patient and subjected to one-dimensional zzso mapping using zzso for zzso A slightly zzso zzso zzso (Mr zzso was found which represented the zzso part of the zzso (the zzso of the zzso corresponded to zzso in normal alpha zzso and which contained the zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with alpha zzso zzso was studied by adding zzso to plasma of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that no complex persisted, but that the abnormal alpha zzso was zzso into two fragments of Mr zzso and 14,000 zzso The latter zzso zzso with the zzso zzso which is zzso from normal alpha zzso during zzso with zzso In a zzso system, zzso amounts of zzso rapidly zzso alpha zzso zzso into the aforementioned zzso In kinetic studies alpha zzso zzso zzso and temporarily inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a competitive inhibitor zzso 35 zzso It was concluded that alpha zzso zzso apparently forms a normal complex with zzso The complex is, however, not stable, but disintegrates rapidly to a zzso form of alpha zzso zzso and active zzso The abnormal protein thus behaves like a zzso instead of an zzso of zzso
