We have identified a form of the zzso zzso protein zzso that results from deletion of the zzso zzso domain by alternative zzso zzso This natural zzso of zzso (called delta zzso has revealed several aspects of the function of the zzso zzso The delta zzso protein was characterized using a delta zzso zzso Further, selection zzso of random zzso pools identified binding site preferences for both wild type and delta zzso zzso zzso copper zzso and missing contact analyses were used to compare the binding characteristics of the two forms of zzso on a selected zzso DNA binding affinity zzso on several DNA elements revealed that the zzso domain contains a modular DNA binding activity affecting the DNA binding affinity of the entire zzso domain on some, but not on other, DNA zzso zzso analysis on such DNA elements has revealed that the zzso domain is an essential, but zzso component of the zzso zzso domain dependent on its natural context within the zzso zzso
