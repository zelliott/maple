zzso muscular zzso zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by progressive weakness of the zzso shoulder and upper arm zzso The disease is associated with DNA zzso which are zzso using probe zzso zzso in DNA zzso with zzso or other restriction zzso We have cloned and characterized the rearranged zzso zzso of four unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and DNA sequence analysis showed that the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso fragment, which flank a region of zzso repeated zzso zzso units, are identical in normal and rearranged zzso zzso These results strongly support the hypothesis that the zzso associated zzso are due to deletions of integral copies of the zzso zzso repeated zzso Since these repeated units are likely to form part of the zzso zzso unit, the variation in repeat unit number might affect the function of the gene zzso zzso our data zzso the zzso gene region and thus provide a starting point for cloning the zzso zzso
