The aim of this study was to define the helper T cell zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso in zzso zzso and TO zzso zzso A panel of 55 synthetic peptides zzso overlapping by five zzso zzso representing zzso of the H protein were zzso and tested for zzso and ability to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso The results obtained show that mouse zzso respond to defined regions of the H protein which differ according to mouse zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice responded in zzso to peptides 7, 38, 39 and 44 whereas zzso from zzso TO mice responded only to zzso zzso When mice of both strains were zzso with the zzso a number of peptides induced zzso responses, showing that the T cell repertoire for zzso on the H protein is broader than that following zzso with zzso In zzso mice, zzso primed to peptides 37, 39, 40, 42 and 43 responded in zzso to zzso and in TO mice, zzso primed to peptides 14, 32, 39, 40 and 49 responded to the zzso Thus in both strains of mice zzso 39 behaved as a dominant T cell zzso following zzso with virus or zzso When the results obtained zzso were compared with sequences predicted to be T cell zzso by a number of zzso the zzso was zzso
