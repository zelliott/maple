zzso zzso pathways and genes are well zzso but relatively little is known in plants, especially in lower zzso To study the zzso apparatus of a lower land plant, a zzso gene well characterized particularly in zzso zzso and man, the zzso zzso was isolated from the moss zzso zzso and zzso Two highly zzso zzso genes were found to be zzso zzso zzso genes have been found thus far exclusively in zzso with duplicated zzso Therefore the presence of two highly zzso genes suggests a recent zzso zzso event in the ancestry of zzso zzso of the protein sequences to zzso proteins from other organisms showed that both zzso genes originated within the group of plant zzso zzso However, the two proteins form a separate zzso in a zzso tree of plant zzso zzso In contrast to zzso genes from other zzso zzso the zzso genes are not interrupted by zzso Because zzso are a common feature of zzso zzso the lack of zzso in the zzso genes is unusual and may indicate the presence of an unusual zzso apparatus in this zzso The presence of duplicated zzso zzso genes is unique among zzso Studies of further members of this lineage are needed to determine whether this feature may be typical of lower zzso
