zzso zzso rhythm is maintained by the zzso nucleus zzso via an intricate set of zzso and other signaling zzso In this work, zzso analyses from two times of day were examined to characterize variation in zzso peptides using three different zzso zzso zzso spectral count, zzso index and zzso Of the zzso identified zzso zzso peptides were analyzed by two zzso methods, spectral count and spectral zzso There were 24 peptides with significant zzso zzso zzso zzso differential zzso zzso between daytime and zzso including multiple peptides derived from zzso II, cocaine and zzso regulated transcript, and zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso Interestingly, more peptides were zzso and had significantly different zzso between the two time points using the spectral count and spectral index methods than with a prior analysis using the zzso method with the same zzso The results of this study reveal the importance of using the appropriate data analysis approaches for zzso relative zzso of zzso The detection of significant changes in so rich a set of zzso reflects the dynamic nature of the zzso and the number of influences such as feeding behavior on zzso zzso Using spectral count and spectral index, zzso level changes are correlated to time of day, suggesting their key role in zzso zzso
