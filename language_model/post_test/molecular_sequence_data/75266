The zzso zzso zzso zzso is found zzso in both zzso and zzso It is essential for de zzso synthesis of zzso and of zzso zzso for DNA zzso Among zzso however, only the zzso and zzso zzso have been found to zzso their own zzso In this study a gene for zzso was found in a specific zzso of the gamma or zzso class of zzso DNA sequences for zzso were found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso virus, zzso disease virus, zzso zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso zzso or human zzso The predicted sequence of zzso zzso zzso is 186 zzso acids in zzso the same length as human, zzso and bovine zzso The human and zzso zzso zzso share 83 percent zzso identity in zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is devoid of zzso zzso suggesting that it was acquired by some process involving reverse zzso This is to our knowledge the first example of a zzso virus with a gene for zzso
