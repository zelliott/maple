One of the most intriguing groups of zzso the zzso zzso zzso is ubiquitous in both simple and complex zzso zzso have gained importance in zzso medicine and food industries due to their capability of acting on a large range of zzso for zzso zzso bonds and zzso zzso value molecules through zzso and zzso zzso During the past two decades extensive studies have been carried out on the production and partial characterization of zzso from zzso while much less is known about zzso of bacterial or plant zzso zzso zzso studies on zzso were restricted on sequence similarity and zzso specificity on just four model zzso and considered only a handful of zzso belonging to the zzso zzso This study centers on the zzso zzso and structural analysis of zzso verified and putative zzso zzso the framework presented here is zzso to every poorly characterized zzso zzso 365 zzso sequences of zzso bacterial and zzso origin were collected and they were clustered using zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso into distinct groups based on zzso acid composition and zzso composition zzso derived from the respective zzso acid zzso A Support zzso zzso model was subsequently constructed for the zzso of new zzso into the zzso zzso The model successfully recognized zzso of the training sequences and all the sequences of the blind zzso The underlying functionality of the 12 proposed zzso families was validated against a combination of prediction tools and published experimental zzso Another important aspect of the present work involves the development of zzso models for the new zzso families, for which sufficient information on known zzso zzso Knowing the zzso features of a small zzso that are essential for binding to the members of a certain family opens a window of opportunities for tailored applications of zzso
