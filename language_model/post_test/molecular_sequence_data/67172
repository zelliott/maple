zzso zzso potential zzso type 1 zzso can be activated by multiple chemical and physical stimuli such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interacts with the binding pocket constituted by zzso regions 3 and 4, whereas zzso act through zzso in the zzso loop of zzso Here, we report on characterization of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso loop of zzso A rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acted as a full zzso of zzso zzso zzso values for pH 5 and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and as a partial zzso of zzso heat, and pH 6 zzso chemical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonism of zzso is not affected by the zzso of the zzso pocket because it is equally potent at zzso zzso rat zzso and its zzso zzso zzso With the goal of generating zzso zzso zzso to the zzso region of human zzso we used a recently developed rabbit zzso zzso Although rabbit zzso zzso blocked human zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso on the basis of selective binding to Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing human zzso did not block zzso by either zzso or zzso Thus, rabbit zzso zzso against rat and human zzso zzso region seem to partially lock or stabilize the channel in the closed state, whereas rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso bind to the zzso region but do not lock or stabilize the channel zzso
