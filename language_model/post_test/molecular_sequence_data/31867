A zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso exhibits broad binding specificity for zzso zzso We determined the crystal structures of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso From these structures and a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso we revealed that a zzso change of a unique zzso sequence containing zzso provides two binding modes for zzso and thereby zzso broad binding zzso We propose that the unique sequence provides these two distinct zzso modes by an zzso zzso
