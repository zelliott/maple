To isolate the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

By the zzso method a clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso gene coded 348 zzso acids and it belongs to the zzso zzso family zzso The molecular mass of zzso protein induced from zzso coli zzso appeared to be 35 zzso The optimum pH and optimum temperature was zzso and about 30 degrees C for its zzso activity zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso gene having an open reading frame of zzso zzso coded for the activity of zzso of zzso zzso 

The production of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed, which would play specific roles in zzso Future study should focus on its role in the infection and zzso zzso
