Giant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found only in zzso is an approximately zzso zzso structure involved in oxygen zzso The zzso are comprised of zzso and zzso zzso the latter being required for the assembly of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso varying in size from 225 to 283 zzso zzso have a zzso zzso domain within their zzso zzso that is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family found in many zzso We have investigated the gene structure of zzso from zzso marina, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found, contrary to the results obtained earlier with zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso that in all of the zzso cases, the zzso zzso module is flanked by two phase 1 zzso as in the human zzso zzso with two more zzso in the 3' side whose positions varied with the zzso In addition, we obtained 13 zzso zzso that have been determined zzso or found in the zzso database zzso A molecular zzso analysis of the zzso primary sequences demonstrated that they cluster into two distinct families of zzso zzso We propose that the common gene zzso to zzso zzso genes exhibited a zzso and zzso structure and gave rise to the two families subsequent to a zzso zzso
