One of the major families of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso stress stimuli into cellular zzso Among them, zzso alpha is the best characterized zzso and many biological phenomena, especially in the inflammatory responses, were attributed to the specific zzso zzso namely zzso alpha and zzso zzso However, the roles played by each member are still zzso Here, we report the identification of a new zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso (for zzso zzso by zzso using zzso derived from a zzso tumor cell line, zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso protein and the absence of zzso 10, 11, and zzso results in the shift of the reading frame at the zzso 9-12 junction to produce a unique zzso zzso The expression of zzso was barely observed in cultured cells tested, but substantial amounts of zzso were detected in mouse zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso lost a common zzso domain well zzso in major zzso families for their specific interactions with upstream zzso or downstream zzso Even though zzso is not zzso at zzso zzso motif by zzso treatments, such as an zzso shock or zzso with a zzso active form of zzso in zzso cells, zzso can induce an earlier onset of zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has unique properties as a member of zzso alpha and may play zzso in the signal zzso zzso different from those of zzso zzso
