The zzso precursor to the terminal protein zzso expressed in a zzso virus expression system or in native zzso was zzso for its ability to interact with the nuclear zzso zzso function was measured by determining the relative amount of zzso protein or of zzso DNA that remained associated with the nuclear zzso after extensive zzso zzso was retained on the zzso whereas zzso was not, as zzso by quantitative zzso zzso Nuclear zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells retained bound zzso DNA even when washed with 1 M zzso zzso this interaction could be inhibited by added zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso isolated from zzso cells infected with a zzso zzso virus that expressed zzso showed a similar retention of zzso zzso this association could also be inhibited by added zzso zzso zzso of zzso to nuclear zzso isolated from zzso cells was zzso with an apparent zzso of 250 zzso and an estimated zzso zzso zzso sites for zzso binding per cell zzso The association of zzso with zzso is zzso to help direct zzso replication complexes to the appropriate locale within the zzso
