zzso are dynamic zzso that undergo fusion, zzso and zzso The dynamic property is essential for establishing zzso biological processes including cellular zzso Early zzso studies have shown that zzso of zzso zzso cells dramatically change their number, size, distribution, and internal zzso However, its regulatory mechanism is largely zzso In course of searching for molecules involved in the zzso zzso in zzso we identified mouse zzso protein 1 zzso a zzso zzso protein of unknown function, as a zzso zzso When zzso was expressed in zzso cells, it was localized in the zzso space and induced an extensive fragmentation of zzso in the manner dependent on the activity of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso region is required for its zzso targeting and that the zzso region including the zzso domain is responsible for the zzso fragmentation zzso zzso of mouse zzso revealed that zzso is highly expressed in the late zzso zzso and early round zzso However, a zzso zzso study showed that it is localized to not only zzso but also other zzso compartments in zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in zzso by zzso zzso dynamics and zzso
