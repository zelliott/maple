The zzso retinal zzso C zzso gene encodes an unusual protein zzso zzso in that it contains at least two zzso motifs at its zzso zzso By a combination of large-scale sequencing of human zzso zzso clones and searches of expressed sequence tag and zzso DNA databases, we have identified two sequences in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and 2 zzso and zzso and one in zzso zzso zzso that closely resemble zzso In the adult, zzso is expressed specifically in retinal rod zzso and the zzso In the zzso several zzso of zzso are predicted to arise from differential zzso The zzso that most closely resembles zzso is localized to rod inner zzso Together with the recently described zzso of zzso transcripts to primary zzso zzso and inner ear cells in the developing zzso these data suggest that the zzso family of protein zzso zzso plays a specific and zzso role in diverse sensory zzso
