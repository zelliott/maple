zzso elements zzso have the potential to produce broad changes in the zzso of their zzso acting as a type of evolutionary zzso and generating a collection of new regulatory and coding zzso Several TE classes have been studied in zzso zzso however, the information gained from these studies is restricted to the physical zzso zzso whereas the genetic diversity of the zzso remains zzso zzso the zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in five zzso zzso species was evaluated using physical zzso mapping and DNA sequencing to provide information about the role of zzso in the evolution of zzso zzso 

Physical mapping revealed abundant TE clusters dispersed throughout the zzso Furthermore, several species showed conspicuous clusters zzso in the zzso and terminal portions of the zzso These TE zzso sites are associated with both zzso and zzso zzso A higher number of zzso clusters were observed among the derived zzso The zzso and zzso zzso sequences were more zzso in the zzso species than in the derived zzso however, this pattern was not observed in zzso In addition, it was possible to observe zzso blocks corresponding to the reverse zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso clones and to the zzso of zzso 

Our data showed no zzso between the zzso trees generated for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso species and zzso hypothesis described for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were more zzso in the zzso species whereas zzso exhibited high substitution rates in both zzso and derived zzso The distribution of Rex elements in zzso zzso suggests that such elements are under the action of evolutionary mechanisms that lead to their zzso in particular zzso regions, mostly in zzso
