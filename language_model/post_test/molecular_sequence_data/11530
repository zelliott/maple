The regulatory zzso of the zzso form of protein zzso 1 zzso plays a crucial part in muscle tissue zzso synthesis and zzso As impaired insulin zzso zzso synthesis in peripheral zzso is considered to be a zzso factor in zzso of zzso diabetes zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso should be viewed as a candidate gene for inherited insulin zzso When applying zzso formation analysis and zzso sequencing of zzso zzso from 30 insulin resistant white zzso patients two cases were identified as zzso carriers of an zzso zzso zzso zzso The carrier prevalence of the zzso zzso was zzso in 150 healthy subjects and zzso in 313 zzso subjects zzso 2 zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso healthy subjects volunteered for a 4 h zzso zzso clamp in combination with indirect zzso in order to zzso the potential impact of the zzso substitution on the whole body zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was associated with altered zzso of zzso a decreased insulin zzso zzso zzso metabolism of peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increased zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso when compared with wild type zzso A zzso sample of 380 unrelated young healthy Caucasians was examined during a combined intravenous zzso and zzso test to address whether the zzso zzso was associated with zzso in insulin zzso which might be secondary to the insulin resistance of skeletal zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
