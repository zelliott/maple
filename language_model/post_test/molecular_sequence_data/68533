The zzso of the human zzso virus, type 1 zzso by the DNA zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C was observed in human B zzso zzso zzso with plasmids in which the zzso long terminal repeat zzso directed the expression of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso sites of zzso abolished the zzso zzso induced by the three zzso while deletion of the three zzso sites slightly reduced zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed an increased binding to the zzso B sites of zzso zzso in the nuclear extracts of human B zzso upon zzso treatment, while binding to zzso sites was zzso The zzso region was also involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a small deletion in the zzso sequence zzso zzso to zzso greatly decreased the induction of zzso zzso Moreover, an enhanced binding activity to the zzso DNA sequence zzso zzso to zzso was observed in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso Thus, both the zzso and the zzso region of zzso functionally cooperate in the zzso induction of zzso zzso
