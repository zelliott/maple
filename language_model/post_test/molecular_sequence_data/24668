The complexity and specificity of many forms of signal zzso are widely believed to require spatial zzso of protein zzso and zzso activities, yet existing methods for measuring zzso activities in cells lack zzso or spatial or zzso zzso We present three genetically zzso fluorescent reporters for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso The reporters consist of zzso of zzso fluorescent protein zzso a zzso binding domain, a consensus zzso for the relevant zzso and yellow fluorescent protein zzso zzso of zzso activities in living cells with addition of growth factors causes zzso changes in the ratios of yellow to zzso emissions because of zzso changes in zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso activity most strongly in zzso membrane ruffles, supporting the importance of this zzso zzso in the regulation of cell zzso These results establish a general strategy for zzso imaging dynamic protein zzso zzso activities with high spatial and zzso resolution in single living zzso
