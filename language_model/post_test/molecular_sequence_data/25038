The Mail zzso possessing zzso repeats induced by zzso protein is a member of the zzso zzso It has six zzso repeats that are zzso in other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Mail zzso expression is induced rapidly following zzso zzso injection, most notably in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of mice, where immune cells, such as zzso and zzso are zzso In this study, we cloned and characterized the Mail zzso The isolated zzso clones span approximately 30 zzso and zzso the entire zzso Comparisons with Mail zzso revealed that the Mail gene consists of 14 zzso Several zzso junctions zzso zzso repeats are zzso among Mail and other zzso family zzso Southern zzso showed that Mail is a zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso analysis, mouse and rat Mail genes were mapped to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso extension determined the zzso start site of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter region revealed the presence of a zzso box and putative zzso zzso sites, such as those for zzso and zzso This region is sufficient to drive high-level reporter gene expression in zzso zzso zzso
