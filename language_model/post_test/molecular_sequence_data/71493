zzso zzso is the result of specific interactions between zzso zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso the main component of zzso is a very zzso protein resulting from the expression of several zzso and from the existence of various zzso zzso In order to characterize zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are important for zzso movement, we prepared zzso zzso against zzso proteins from whole zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained were screened for their potency to inhibit zzso zzso models and for their zzso zzso on zzso Among the different zzso we zzso zzso reacted specifically with a subset of zzso zzso Limited zzso zzso zzso sequencing, mass zzso and zzso experiments indicated that zzso recognized an zzso localized in the primary sequence zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and that this sequence belongs to class zzso The use of synthetic peptides and zzso analysis further narrowed the zzso acids important for zzso recognition to zzso Because the primary effect of this zzso on zzso zzso is to decrease the zzso beat frequency, we suggest that this sequence is involved in the zzso head zzso
