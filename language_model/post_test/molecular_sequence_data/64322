The zzso positions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined using zzso tests, zzso zzso gene sequencing and zzso zzso The two species displayed very similar zzso patterns and produced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is the closest zzso of zzso zzso sharing about zzso % similarity in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso experiments further reinforced these results, demonstrating a zzso % zzso level between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, strain zzso an isolate from zzso rice zzso exhibited zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity and a DNA zzso level of more than 97 % with both type zzso zzso it is proposed that the species zzso zzso should be reclassified as zzso zzso
