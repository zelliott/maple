In order to improve the storage capability under zzso of the widely sold biological zzso based on zzso zzso zzso we need to understand how these organisms respond to zzso zzso As part of our studies to achieve this, we studied survival and protein expression in zzso juveniles of the zzso zzso zzso zzso when exposed to zzso zzso to zzso relative humidity zzso for 3 days, followed by a zzso exposure to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso More than 400 protein spots that were detected by zzso analysis showed zzso abundance within zzso Of these, 10 spots and 7 spots showed zzso changes in abundance under zzso and zzso stress, respectively, compared to fully hydrated zzso Three spots exhibited a differential response pattern between zzso and zzso zzso (one was down regulated and two were novel in zzso zzso zzso mass mapping with zzso mass zzso zzso identified 10 zzso zzso among which several are known to be stress responsive including heat shock protein 60, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that were found in both zzso Other identified proteins are known to be involved in the cell cycle regulation, regulation of gene transcription, organization of zzso structure and some currently have no known zzso Our results suggest that it is unlikely that improvement of zzso tolerance in zzso can be achieved through genetic transformation and addition of single genes and that selective breeding could be the best approach to generate zzso resistant zzso
