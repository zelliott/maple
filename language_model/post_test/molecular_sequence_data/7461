The 3' end region of zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the initiation of zzso zzso We analyzed the extreme 3' end of the zzso C virus zzso zzso by primer extension of the zzso end region of the zzso strand zzso found in infected zzso We discovered a novel sequence present downstream of the zzso stretch that was previously considered to be the 3' end structure of the zzso zzso The novel sequence was 98 zzso long and had no significant zzso with any known zzso viral or zzso The discovery of this novel tail on the zzso zzso should contribute to the study of zzso zzso
