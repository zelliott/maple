We examined the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso acid zzso encodes the small zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso it is subject to unique negative regulation by zzso and is positively regulated in response to limitation for many different zzso acids through a mechanism known as zzso zzso zzso specifies a zzso zzso important for zzso zzso zzso of these genes was compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels, zzso zzso results, and the distribution of zzso in zzso indicated that zzso negative regulation of zzso affected the levels of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso and positive zzso effects on zzso were apparent soon after cells were provided with zzso zzso In cells limited for zzso increased expression of zzso and zzso and decreased expression of zzso also had zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts contain upstream open reading frames zzso as do their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We examined the regulation of zzso reporter genes containing or lacking the zzso start zzso the capacity for zzso zzso translation appeared critical for controlling gene zzso
