The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso that is selective to zzso We demonstrate zzso monitoring of an zzso zzso change of zzso in living zzso The monitoring method is based on zzso resonance energy transfer from a zzso fluorescent protein zzso to a zzso zzso zzso attached to the zzso and the third zzso loop zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso increases in the zzso zzso ratio, indicating that the zzso approached the zzso upon zzso Since the zzso ratio changes were on a time scale of seconds, the zzso change of zzso in living cells was more rapid than that of zzso zzso measured in zzso Interestingly, the direction of the zzso ratio change of zzso was opposite to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reported zzso It was suggested that this zzso zzso directly to the zzso biological functions, zzso the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso
