The left-handed DNA structure, zzso is believed to play important roles in gene expression and zzso zzso forms zzso with a preference for sequences rich in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is generated in the presence of negative zzso or upon binding proteins that absorb the high energetic cost of the zzso transition, including the creation of distorted junctions between zzso and zzso To date, the sequence preferences for the zzso transition have primarily been studied in the context of sequence repeats lacking zzso zzso Here, we develop a method for characterizing zzso preferences for zzso formation and zzso junction zzso within zzso DNA duplexes that is based on combining zzso zzso zzso with a new quantitative application of circular zzso zzso for determining the fraction of zzso versus zzso Using this approach, we show that at least three consecutive zzso zzso steps, traditionally thought to zzso zzso can be incorporated within zzso zzso containing zzso junctions upon binding to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the incorporation of zzso steps into zzso is driven by favorable zzso zzso and zzso stacking interactions as well as by zzso zzso that zzso the distorted zzso junction at flexible zzso Together, our results expose zzso complexities in the zzso code within zzso sequences and suggest that zzso can in principle zzso into a wider range of zzso sequence elements than previously zzso
