zzso major zzso is caused by any of approximately 150 zzso within the zzso zzso To establish the degree of zzso after bone zzso transplantation zzso we have performed molecular analysis of zzso zzso in 14 patients with TM over a period of 10 zzso All patients underwent T zzso zzso zzso from zzso related donors, using either in zzso zzso depletion with zzso zzso and complement or in zzso depletion using zzso zzso in the bone zzso collection zzso To date, at different time periods after zzso seven patients have some degree of zzso six of these patients, all blood zzso have donor cells in the range of zzso to zzso with stable mixed zzso zzso The seventh patient has less than zzso donor cells with, surprisingly, only minimal zzso zzso The detection of zzso gene point zzso as used here, is a highly specific and sensitive marker for zzso and zzso in patients with zzso In light of its zzso the method is zzso in all cases of zzso as it is independent of sex and other zzso DNA zzso The high zzso of zzso found in our patients may be a consequence of the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso was associated with zzso independence, complete zzso of residual host cells for effective treatment of TM and possibly other genetic diseases may prove not to be zzso
