zzso gene analysis, quantitative trait locus mapping in zzso and experimental zzso and a zzso association study in zzso have reported that a few zzso regions contribute to great zzso in the degree of zzso spotting in zzso In particular, an important region affecting this trait was localized on bovine zzso 22 in the region containing the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso We zzso a total of zzso zzso of the zzso gene in 40 cattle of different breeds, including 20 animals from spotted breeds (10 Italian zzso and 10 Italian zzso and 20 animals from solid zzso breeds (10 Italian Brown and 10 zzso and identified 17 single zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of one zzso zzso were clearly different between spotted (A zzso zzso T zzso zzso and zzso breeds (A zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This result was confirmed by zzso additional animals of these four breeds zzso zzso zzso A total of 21 different zzso were zzso from the zzso zzso Considering similarities among zzso spotted and zzso groups of cattle showed significant differences in their zzso distribution zzso zzso zzso which was further supported by the analysis of molecular zzso zzso of two zzso zzso in an enlarged sample of zzso zzso in the zzso gene clearly explained the differences between spotted and zzso zzso but, at the same time, it is evident that this gene is not the only genetic factor determining zzso in Italian zzso and Italian zzso cattle zzso
