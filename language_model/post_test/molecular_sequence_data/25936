A full-length zzso zzso zzso complementary to rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was obtained by extending the zzso sequence of a rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso to include an zzso initiation zzso and the zzso zzso using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso sites for zzso and zzso were incorporated at the zzso and zzso of the zzso respectively, by the zzso zzso The resulting full-length zzso was inserted into an expression zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso restriction zzso zzso coli strain zzso was transformed with the constructed expression zzso and zzso was expressed under the control of the zzso zzso The expressed zzso exhibited high activity of zzso reduction and was inhibited by zzso at a concentration of zzso After zzso by zzso Blue affinity zzso the expressed zzso migrated as a single band on zzso sodium zzso zzso gel with a molecular weight equivalent to that of the zzso rat liver zzso zzso The zzso expressed protein was recognized by zzso zzso against rat liver zzso on zzso zzso It zzso either zzso or zzso as electron donor at equal efficiency and displayed high activities in reduction of zzso zzso and zzso which are typical zzso for zzso The expressed zzso exhibited a typical zzso spectrum with zzso zzso at 380 and zzso zzso zzso content determination showed that it contained 2 zzso of zzso per mole of the zzso zzso protein sequencing of the first 20 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso of the expressed protein indicated that the expressed zzso is not blocked at the zzso zzso and has an zzso as the first zzso zzso The remaining 19 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso were identical with those of the zzso zzso from rat liver zzso
