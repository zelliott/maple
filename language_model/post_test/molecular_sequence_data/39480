The zzso zzso and structural stability of zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 95 degrees zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso influences kinetic stability in an unusual manner since zzso is more pronounced at 55 degrees C than at higher zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso unfolds in a two-state zzso transition, and circular zzso analysis shows that zzso almost completely zzso after a zzso heat treatment at 85 degrees zzso These properties are in agreement with zzso being part of the zzso tail which is ejected in an unfolded state during zzso zzso
