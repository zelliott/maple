In previous work, the zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a gene expressed zzso during the sexual cycle and shown to be essential for normal sexual zzso The zzso gene has been zzso and further zzso It contains two zzso the first of which is zzso and zzso or zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein has extensive zzso with zzso B of zzso zzso which zzso the backbone within the zzso zzso regions of zzso In zzso zzso zzso sexual development is initiated and large numbers of zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso does not occur, however, and no sexual progeny are zzso As most zzso zzso contain eight zzso the two zzso divisions and subsequent zzso division typical of normal crosses seem to occur, but the zzso zzso are not zzso into zzso In zzso zzso the zzso protein is present in large amounts in zzso and young zzso but it is only faintly zzso in more mature zzso containing developing zzso Models to explain the possible role of a zzso in sexual development are zzso
