In zzso zzso zzso formation in the middle position of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the presence of the zzso in the zzso gene zzso and zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes contain zzso of three size zzso 20 or 21 base pairs zzso (six zzso 48 zzso (one zzso and 113 zzso (one zzso As in zzso removal of the zzso led to loss of zzso 35 in the zzso when zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso sizes supported zzso 35 zzso The same results were obtained with the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes containing zzso of 12 or 13 zzso or with a deleted zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while they all supported zzso 35 zzso did not share any consensus zzso As discussed, these results, taken together, suggest that for appropriate function the zzso 35 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso needs the presence of an unqualified zzso in the zzso gene and a zzso structure in the zzso zzso zzso
