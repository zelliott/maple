The genes zzso the DNA zzso A zzso and B zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso were cloned and zzso zzso and zzso coded for proteins of zzso and 799 zzso acids with calculated molecular weights of zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso temperature sensitive zzso zzso To analyze the role of type II zzso in the intrinsic zzso resistance of zzso bacteria, the sequences of the zzso zzso regions zzso in the A zzso of DNA zzso and the C zzso zzso of zzso IV zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso of the zzso in the four zzso bacteria were identical to that of zzso coli zzso The sequences of the zzso in zzso were also identical to those in zzso coli zzso except for the zzso acids at positions 83, 87, or zzso The zzso to zzso substitution in zzso zzso strain zzso and the zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso in the three other zzso agreed well with the minimal zzso zzso of zzso in the four bacteria, suggesting that these zzso play a role in the intrinsic zzso of zzso bacteria to zzso
