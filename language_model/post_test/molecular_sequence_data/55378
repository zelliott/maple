zzso capable of degrading the zzso zzso were isolated from agricultural soil using an enrichment zzso In this way, five distinct zzso strains of zzso zzso were isolated, and were characterized using zzso and zzso analysis, as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited the greatest zzso degradation rate and was consequently selected for further zzso zzso of zzso by strain zzso was rapid at 20 and zzso but was greatly reduced zzso by the presence of carbon zzso zzso zzso was able to effectively degrade zzso in zzso soil using low zzso zzso The maximum degradation rate of zzso zzso ( max zzso was calculated as zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso constant (K ( s zzso was determined as zzso zzso zzso zzso such as strain zzso that use zzso as a carbon source, could be employed for the zzso of sites contaminated with zzso
