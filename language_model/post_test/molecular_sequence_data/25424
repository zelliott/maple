The lack of zzso or molecular zzso specific for the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso has hindered characterization of the molecular zzso by which zzso influences the zzso survival, and differentiation of cells of the zzso nervous zzso We have developed methods for the detection and separation of cells expressing zzso receptors by using a variety of binding zzso based on a genetically engineered zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso at its zzso These zzso have allowed us to identify several zzso cell lines, as well as embryonic and adult zzso in primary cultures, that bind zzso and functionally respond to zzso by rapidly zzso the zzso of immediate early primary response zzso
