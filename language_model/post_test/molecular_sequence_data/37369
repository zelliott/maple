zzso is a benign smooth muscle tumor of the zzso that affects many women in active zzso zzso It is composed by zzso of smooth muscle cells surrounded by zzso zzso We have recently shown that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is modified in zzso increased amounts of zzso with structural modifications are zzso The data here presented show that zzso is present in both normal zzso and zzso but zzso zzso is zzso with longer zzso side zzso Furthermore, these chains contain a higher ratio zzso as compared to normal zzso To determine if these changes in zzso zzso zzso with modifications in the zzso zzso organization, we compared the general structural architecture of zzso to normal zzso By zzso and zzso methods, we found a reorganization of muscle fibers and zzso zzso with changes in the distribution of zzso zzso and zzso Thin zzso zzso possibly composed by types I and III zzso were replaced by thick zzso possibly richer in type I zzso Type I collagen zzso with zzso both in zzso and normal zzso in contrast to type IV collagen that did zzso The relative amount of zzso was increased and the distribution of zzso and collagen was totally modified in the zzso as compared to the normal zzso These findings reveal that not only zzso structure is modified in zzso but also the tissue architecture changed, especially concerning zzso zzso
