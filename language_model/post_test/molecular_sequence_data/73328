We zzso and used zzso zzso designed for the zzso and zzso target sequences located in the terminal loop C of animal and plant zzso zzso to verify its involvement in a higher order structure formation of zzso zzso The activity of both zzso and zzso specific zzso were proven to be active against synthetic zzso of the stem III and loop C in the two types of zzso zzso In contrast we did not observe any zzso zzso within the loop C of the native zzso zzso We considered two possible explanations of the zzso an involvement of the loop C in long range interactions and lack of a structural flexibility to form proper zzso structure of the complex with the zzso From our data it seems that the single stranded zzso within the loop C can not form correct zzso duplex structure required for zzso zzso It is clear that zzso zzso can be used for zzso of different steps of expression of genetic information only if the target sequence occurs in appropriate context, that allows to form correct secondary and zzso structure of the zzso zzso
