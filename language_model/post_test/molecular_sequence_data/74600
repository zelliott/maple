zzso resistance is currently assessed through direct sequencing, which cannot detect resistant strains below zzso We compared the zzso resistance profile of zzso and zzso using zzso analysis and single zzso sequencing of the zzso region of the pol gene in samples collected from five individuals in whom zzso zzso resulted in treatment zzso Single zzso sequencing showed that not all strains present the same resistance zzso which can be dispersed across different zzso zzso The resistance profile found in plasma was very similar to that found in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso confirming the utility of assessing zzso DNA as for a means of determining zzso zzso
