zzso clones spanning the human type I and type II zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso 75 zzso of zzso DNA is required to zzso the type I zzso and approximately 38 zzso to zzso the type II zzso In each case, the zzso coding region is contained in only about 20 zzso of DNA, with most of the rest of each locus representing the distance between the two zzso II zzso or three zzso I zzso zzso promoters which drive zzso The virtually identical location of zzso within the zzso portion of the coding regions reinforces the presumption that the two receptors derive from a common zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso have been isolated which contain the two zzso zzso One of the zzso also contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative map position of these three genes has been zzso
