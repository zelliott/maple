The zzso protein zzso binds seven or eight zzso a zzso a) molecules and is an important model antenna system for understanding zzso interactions and zzso aspects of zzso light zzso zzso proteins of green sulfur bacteria zzso have been extensively studied using a wide range of zzso and theoretical approaches because of their stability, the spectral resolution of their zzso their zzso nature, and the availability of high-resolution structural zzso We obtained new structural and zzso insights by studying the zzso protein from the recently discovered, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Native zzso zzso zzso is a zzso according to both zzso gel zzso and zzso mass zzso Furthermore, the mass of intact zzso zzso is consistent with the presence of zzso zzso a in zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso zzso was performed by using the structure of the zzso protein from zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso zzso zzso in two distinct zzso the zzso zzso region and a region that is proposed to bind the reaction center zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso at room temperature but only one at zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the two zzso zzso zzso result from two zzso zzso a populations that have identical zzso zzso Modeling of the data suggests that the two populations contain 1-2 zzso and 5-6 zzso a molecules and that zzso equilibrium effects zzso the relative population of the two emitting zzso
