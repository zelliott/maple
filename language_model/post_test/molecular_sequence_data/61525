zzso zzso zzso occurs at high levels in fetal zzso Previous studies showed that zzso promotes fetal lung zzso To test the hypothesis that such effects are zzso by known zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso and the orphan zzso zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in mouse zzso We examined the regulation of these three genes by zzso and zzso which zzso lung zzso Using incorporation of zzso and zzso we then assessed whether zzso zzso and zzso zzso lung growth and maturation in fetal lung zzso zzso gene expression was detected predominantly in zzso whereas zzso and zzso genes were expressed from embryonic days zzso and on multiple zzso zzso All three zzso are present in airway zzso and zzso cells but occur in different relative zzso These genes were regulated zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neither agent affected zzso zzso increased incorporation of zzso and zzso in zzso whereas zzso induced cell proliferation and zzso yielded variable zzso zzso data suggest the involvement of multiple zzso zzso including novel zzso and argue against simple functional zzso within this gene family during lung zzso
