The factors that organize the internal zzso of cells are still poorly zzso We have been addressing this question using zzso muscle cells, which have regular zzso of zzso that associate with the zzso apparatus in zzso zzso Here we examine links between zzso structures and the zzso zzso zzso established by small zzso 1 zzso a approximately zzso integral protein of network zzso We used zzso zzso to identify zzso a giant zzso zzso as the major zzso zzso for zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso sequence of zzso is zzso by a sequence of zzso that is zzso to its last zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in two in zzso zzso In one, zzso bound to zzso specifically zzso native zzso from muscle zzso In the second, zzso bound zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies using surface zzso resonance yielded a zzso zzso 130 zzso On zzso zzso zzso was concentrated in the zzso zzso consistent with its identification as zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso like zzso concentrated around zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso binds zzso and are the first to document a specific and direct interaction between proteins of the zzso and the zzso
