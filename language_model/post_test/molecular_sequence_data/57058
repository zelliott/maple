We have investigated the therapeutic effect of zzso fusion zzso containing both zzso domain zzso and zzso domain zzso of zzso in combination with zzso drugs such as zzso zzso or zzso C zzso on tumor zzso of different types of zzso zzso fusion zzso alone significantly inhibited both liver and lung zzso when it was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso melanoma cells, and spontaneous lung zzso of zzso melanoma cells when administered zzso seven times before or after surgical zzso of the primary zzso Combined treatments with zzso and either zzso or zzso significantly inhibited liver and lung zzso of zzso or melanoma cells respectively, as compared with either treatment alone or the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in combination substantially prolonged the survival time of mice injected zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso was effective for zzso the invasion of zzso cells into zzso in a zzso zzso Our previous study has shown that zzso zzso of tumor invasion may be due in part to the zzso adhesive property without affecting the cell growth, whereas the zzso effect of zzso was established to have resulted from the growth zzso of tumor zzso Moreover, the combination of zzso with zzso provided a more effective zzso of tumor invasion into zzso than did either zzso Thus, we have demonstrated that the combination of zzso adhesive zzso and zzso drugs such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso therapy and chemotherapy, is a new approach that offers enhanced zzso zzso effects on tumor zzso and zzso
