zzso C inhibitor zzso is a plasma zzso zzso inhibitor of activated protein C, which is the main zzso of the zzso protein C zzso Human zzso is zzso in the liver, zzso and several zzso zzso zzso seminal zzso and zzso In the present study, we characterized zzso of the human zzso gene required for expression in the zzso cell line, zzso cells, and also evaluated rat zzso zzso zzso particularly on the effect of zzso in rat zzso zzso On the zzso gene expression in zzso cells, transient expression zzso using several deletion zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso gene and gel mobility shift zzso using several synthetic zzso showed that the zzso site zzso zzso to zzso and the upstream zzso site zzso zzso to zzso play roles as the promoter and the zzso zzso Both the zzso site zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso response element zzso zzso to zzso serve as the zzso In the study on zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso we first cloned rat zzso zzso and then evaluated the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The isolated rat zzso zzso contained a zzso coding region of a zzso acid precursor zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rat zzso showed an zzso and zzso zzso with that of mouse and human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that rat zzso zzso was strongly expressed in the seminal zzso moderately in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso expression in seminal zzso and zzso increased during the process of zzso The zzso zzso expression in seminal zzso was significantly decreased after zzso or after zzso zzso Treatment with testosterone in the zzso rats significantly enhanced its zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso gene expression in rat seminal zzso is under zzso zzso
