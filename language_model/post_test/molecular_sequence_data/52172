In the previous report, we demonstrated that zzso zzso regulated zzso muscle zzso zzso levels through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso We here report that the decline in the zzso muscle zzso zzso levels was well correlated with disorganization of zzso but not necessarily with the rise in zzso zzso levels in rat cultured vascular smooth muscle zzso The decrease in the zzso muscle zzso zzso induced by zzso agents also resulted from enhancement of the turnover rate of the zzso These results raise the possibility that the zzso control of the zzso muscle zzso expression is linked to the organization of zzso filaments in smooth muscle zzso
