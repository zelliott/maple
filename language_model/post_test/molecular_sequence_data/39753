The recent X-ray crystal structure of a zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso containing the zzso peripheral domain has a zzso core that is very different from the zzso core present in the structure of the zzso zzso which lacks a peripheral domain zzso and Scott, zzso The new structure zzso many of the disagreements between the minimal zzso structure and the zzso data on the zzso properties of chemically modified zzso The new structure also emphasizes the dynamic nature of small zzso zzso and provides a cautionary tale for everyone who tries to use structure to understand zzso
