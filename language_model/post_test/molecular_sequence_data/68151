zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso transfer from zzso to zzso forming zzso zzso and zzso We have identified, by using zzso zzso and zzso five zzso zzso located at or near the zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso also modified the same set of zzso zzso Based on the amounts of labels incorporated into each zzso zzso we have provided a hypothetical model for possible locations of the five zzso zzso around the zzso bound to the zzso This model was consistent with the results of the zzso zzso zzso is essential for the zzso whereas zzso may participate in the binding of zzso and/or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso On the other hand, the results of affinity zzso with zzso zzso suggest the role of zzso in the direct interaction with zzso in the zzso zzso
