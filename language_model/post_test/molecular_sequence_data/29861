The zzso zzso which codes for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli, has been zzso The coding region contains a single open reading frame for a protein of zzso zzso zzso within the zzso acid sequence are two consensus sequences for zzso zzso The sequence of zzso does not resemble that of other previously described zzso or zzso the other zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli, except in the zzso site consensus zzso The zzso gene is expressed as a zzso zzso zzso extension experiments define a major start point of zzso at zzso relative to the start of zzso A zzso zzso is located 23 bases beyond the end of the coding zzso The zzso protein is zzso in zzso in a zzso fashion zzso approximately 60 zzso A fusion protein containing the first 40 zzso acids of zzso fused in frame to zzso is zzso very rapidly in a zzso host zzso approximately 3 zzso but not in a zzso zzso This fusion protein is the first zzso zzso zzso
