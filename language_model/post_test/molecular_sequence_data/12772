Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of the insulin zzso in the cell zzso Recently, it was shown that the insulin zzso also exhibits nuclear zzso zzso zzso In the present investigation, I have searched for structural zzso to a nuclear zzso of the insulin zzso as well as to other potential nuclear actions of this zzso Interestingly, this analysis yielded that the insulin zzso zzso contains a zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso with the preceding experimental zzso several zinc zzso motifs and an zzso zzso These findings have intriguing implications with regard to a zzso role of the insulin zzso zzso as a gene regulatory zzso
