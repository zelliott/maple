To function as a repair and zzso zzso zzso has to be assembled as an active filament on zzso DNA in the presence of zzso or its zzso We have identified zzso acids in the primary DNA binding site of zzso that interact with zzso DNA by zzso A zzso complex consisting of zzso protein bound to a zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso zzso was zzso with long wavelength ultraviolet radiation to effect zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso sequencing, revealed the zzso of two independent zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso from loop zzso and zzso from loop zzso were determined to be the exact points of zzso Thus, our data confirm and extend predictions about the DNA binding domain of zzso protein based on the molecular structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso Weber, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) Nature zzso zzso
