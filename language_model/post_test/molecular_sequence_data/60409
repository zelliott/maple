The Japanese pear zzso of zzso zzso causes black spot of Japanese pear by producing a zzso toxin known as zzso zzso zzso integration zzso zzso was used to tag genes required for toxin zzso zzso of a zzso strain were treated with a zzso zzso along with the restriction zzso used to zzso the zzso Of zzso zzso zzso recovered, three produced no zzso zzso and lost zzso on pear zzso zzso DNA zzso the integrated zzso was recovered from one of the zzso With the recovered DNA used as a probe, a zzso clone of the zzso strain was zzso zzso and functional analyses of an zzso region corresponding to the zzso site indicated the presence of two zzso One, designated zzso encodes a member of the class of zzso zzso The other, zzso encodes a protein of unknown zzso The essential roles of these two genes in both zzso production and zzso were confirmed by zzso gene disruption zzso DNA gel zzso analysis detected zzso and zzso zzso not only in the Japanese pear zzso strains but also in strains from the tangerine and zzso zzso The zzso toxins of these two zzso are similar in structure to zzso zzso were not detected in other zzso or in zzso strains of zzso zzso suggesting acquisition of zzso and zzso by horizontal zzso
