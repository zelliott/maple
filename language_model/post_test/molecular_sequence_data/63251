A novel zzso zzso inhibitor named zzso zzso was isolated from the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso The strain produced 1 only when zzso zzso was used as the sole carbon source in the production zzso The structure of 1 was determined by spectral and zzso sugar analyses of the corresponding zzso derivatives to be an zzso mixture of zzso and its zzso zzso of the reducing end zzso zzso zzso showed potent and selective zzso of insect and zzso zzso with no zzso of zzso and plant zzso In contrast, the known zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited all zzso It should be emphasized that zzso zzso which is the component sugar of 1, showed no zzso of the insect zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso unit positioned at the reducing end of 1 is essential for its zzso zzso zzso The unique zzso spectrum of 1 will be useful to study zzso systems and to develop selective zzso or zzso
