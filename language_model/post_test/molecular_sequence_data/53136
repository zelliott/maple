The synthesis of a linear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a form amenable to zzso formation, is zzso The zzso contains the zzso challenging zzso zzso element, as well as a terminal zzso zzso zzso An zzso protection strategy is zzso which permits the protection and manipulation of three zzso groups present in the zzso zzso and the zzso used to prepare zzso The zzso zzso was generated in excellent yield by the introduction of the zzso unit as a zzso zzso followed by an zzso sequence to generate the zzso zzso in high zzso zzso The required zzso donor was zzso in a series of high-yielding steps from zzso utilizing the zzso zzso
