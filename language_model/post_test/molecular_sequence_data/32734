G zzso receptors transmit zzso signals into the cells by zzso zzso G zzso a process that is often followed by zzso zzso Monitoring such a process in real time and in living cells will help better understand how G protein zzso zzso Energy zzso approaches zzso resonance energy transfer zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso were recently shown to be powerful methods to monitor the G zzso receptors zzso protein association in living zzso Here, we used a zzso technique to monitor the zzso between the zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso A specific zzso zzso signal can be measured between zzso zzso and the zzso protein expressed at a zzso zzso This signal is insensitive to zzso toxin zzso and probably reflects the zzso of these two zzso The zzso signal rapidly increases upon zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso signal then returns to the zzso level after few zzso The zzso of the zzso signal is zzso with zzso recruitment to the zzso consistent with the known rapid zzso of zzso The zzso zzso increase was dependent on the zzso site of zzso in zzso Taken together, our results show that zzso between zzso and zzso proteins can be used to monitor the zzso zzso in real time and in living zzso Our data also revealed that zzso can be part of a zzso complex with zzso zzso resulting either from a direct interaction between these partners or from their zzso in specific zzso and that zzso zzso probably results in zzso within such zzso
