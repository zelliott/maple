A recently cloned rat brain zzso derives from a novel zzso termed zzso zzso expressed exclusively in zzso structures, particularly in zzso zzso bulb, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In these structures, the zzso zzso is present in zzso cell bodies and their zzso whereas near exclusive zzso zzso is observed for the zzso zzso In the zzso DEN zzso is highly expressed in the cell zzso and zzso layers of the zzso zzso and zzso field, but expression is markedly reduced in the zzso and zzso zzso The predicted primary structure of the zzso highly basic zzso zzso does not suggest a zzso The restricted expression and zzso location are compatible with a role for DEN in synaptic plasticity of central zzso zzso zzso
