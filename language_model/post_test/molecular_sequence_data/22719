It has been reported that some zzso zzso zzso binding proteins interact with small zzso zzso zzso III zzso However, their biological significance is poorly zzso Here we examine the relationship between the zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso and the zzso binding protein zzso In the zzso zzso the processing steps of zzso zzso were partially zzso increased zzso of zzso and reduced zzso of short zzso and mature zzso as well as misplaced zzso in the stem structure of zzso were zzso These misplaced zzso were similar to those previously observed in the zzso zzso in which the second zzso zzso binding domain of the protein was zzso An zzso zzso using zzso transient expression in zzso zzso showed that zzso was able to form a complex with zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso We also examined zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Increased zzso of zzso and reduced zzso of zzso and mature zzso were zzso zzso zzso on zzso was observed only in zzso but not in zzso whereas not on zzso in either zzso These results indicate that zzso has a function in assisting efficient and precise zzso of zzso through interaction with zzso
