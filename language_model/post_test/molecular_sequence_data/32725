Three members of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso gene family zzso potential zzso regulatory proteins of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso with two zzso and have a zzso full-length zzso with a 260 zzso acid open reading zzso They share zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identities to each other, and are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso An zzso type of zzso was found to contain zzso zzso 2 and zzso a premature zzso They all have an alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso also have an alternative zzso initiation zzso zzso with zzso their zzso untranslated regions zzso are astonishingly zzso and two zzso regions were also found in their 3' zzso zzso deletion leads to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso zzso proteins containing predicted zzso sites, zzso interaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso indicated that there might be three zzso members in zzso zzso lower than zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso revealed that the expression of zzso is mostly like zzso with intensive expression in young seeds, but it is also expressed in root in which zzso has no zzso zzso shows lower tissue specificity and zzso levels, whereas zzso is the zzso Comparative cloning and zzso indicated that seed color zzso lines zzso and zzso have equivalent zzso zzso and the yellow seed color in zzso might be caused by zzso other than zzso Our results lay the basis for further investigating the regulatory mechanism of zzso genes in zzso zzso and for transgenic creation of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso
