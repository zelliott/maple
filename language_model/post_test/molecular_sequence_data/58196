trans zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 long terminal repeat requires that the viral trans zzso zzso interact with the zzso responsive region zzso zzso Although the zzso 47 zzso acids represent an independent zzso domain that functions via zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso that are required for interactions between zzso and zzso in cells have not been zzso Although in zzso binding studies suggested that the nine basic zzso acids from positions 48 to 57 in zzso bind efficiently to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by creating several zzso of zzso and new hybrid proteins between zzso and the coat protein of zzso zzso we determined that this zzso domain is not sufficient for interactions between zzso and zzso in zzso Rather, the zzso domain is also required and must be juxtaposed to the basic zzso Thus, in zzso zzso zzso binding does not translate to function in zzso which suggests that other proteins are important for specific and productive interactions between zzso and zzso
