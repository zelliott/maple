Using the zzso zzso system we have identified a human zzso zzso zzso Alpha zzso zzso that specifically interacts with the zzso zzso protein G alpha zzso zzso was verified by specific binding of in zzso G alpha zzso with a zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso is a small protein zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso that contains two potential zzso sites for protein zzso C and seven for zzso zzso zzso zzso shows high zzso to two previously identified human zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso gene product in zzso zzso of unknown zzso zzso zzso was also found to the zzso gene product in zzso zzso that is known to interact with a zzso G alpha zzso zzso A highly zzso core domain of 125 zzso acids characterizes this family of zzso Analysis of deletion zzso demonstrated that the core domain is the site of zzso interaction with G alpha zzso zzso is likely to be an early zzso zzso as its zzso contains the zzso sequence characteristic of early response genes in its zzso zzso By Northern analysis zzso zzso zzso is most abundant in zzso heart, zzso and liver and is very low in brain, skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso zzso appears to interact exclusively with G alpha zzso as it did not interact with G alpha zzso and G alpha zzso The fact that zzso and zzso interact with G alpha zzso and share a common domain suggests that other members of the zzso family also interact with G alpha zzso through the zzso core zzso
