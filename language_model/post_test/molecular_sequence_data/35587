zzso was expressed primarily in bamboo leaves, which was zzso under high zzso The protein zzso by zzso had zzso activity of catalyzing zzso zzso to zzso zzso through zzso zzso as zzso shown in zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso cycle, zzso conversion from zzso zzso to zzso zzso through zzso zzso to protect photosynthesis zzso A zzso zzso zzso a zzso was isolated from bamboo zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso and contains an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a transit zzso of 103 zzso zzso The mature protein is deduced to have 348 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso and a zzso zzso point of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the highest expression level of zzso was in zzso which agreed with the zzso pattern of zzso zzso Real time zzso results showed that zzso was zzso and reached the highest level after the treatment zzso for zzso then decreased and kept at the level similar to that of zzso after treatment for zzso To investigate the function of zzso mature protein was zzso expressed in zzso coli and the zzso activity zzso was carried out using V as zzso The zzso that formed in the reaction mixture were extracted and analyzed by zzso zzso Besides zzso A and Z were detected in the reaction mixture, which indicated that the zzso protein exhibited zzso activity of catalyzing V into Z through zzso This study indicates that zzso functions through regulating the components of zzso cycle, which might be one of the critical factors that contribute to the growth of bamboo under naturally varying light zzso
