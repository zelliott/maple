zzso cell fate decisions are primarily controlled at the zzso level with zzso zzso zzso playing a crucial role in zzso zzso In this study, we report the identification of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a species complex of the zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso an enigmatic process that involves the exclusion of an individual zzso and zzso zzso Both genes were expressed during the early stages of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their natural hybrid zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso was also expressed in zzso zzso although only at low zzso The two genes were expressed in different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso divisions as demonstrated by zzso with an zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso and zzso may represent useful markers for zzso the molecular aspects of zzso exclusion and zzso of the zzso zzso
