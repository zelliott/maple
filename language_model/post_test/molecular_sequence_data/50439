zzso and zzso receptors are zzso expressed in the immature rat zzso zzso but virtually zzso in the zzso of zzso Although zzso binding sites have been zzso during the zzso period in the external zzso cell layer, the type of cell that expresses zzso receptors has never been zzso thus, the potential function of zzso in the developing zzso remains zzso In the present study, we have taken advantage of the possibility of obtaining a culture preparation that is greatly enriched in immature zzso zzso cells to investigate the presence of zzso receptors and the effect of zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso labeling revealed the occurrence of a high density of binding sites for zzso zzso on zzso cultured immature zzso zzso zzso and competition studies showed the existence of a single class of zzso binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 217 sites per zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso formation zzso zzso 10 zzso and this effect was prevented by zzso of cultured immature zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso also caused a marked reduction of zzso calcium zzso These results show the presence of functionally active zzso receptors on immature zzso zzso Our data suggest the possible involvement of zzso in the regulation of proliferation and/or migration of zzso during the development of the zzso zzso
