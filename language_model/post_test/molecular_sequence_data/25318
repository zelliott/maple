In zzso zzso the majority of zzso zzso zzso occur at the 3' region of the zzso gene and are juxtaposed to the J region of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso involvement of the putative zzso zzso in the zzso has been proposed, since the hot spot region of the zzso on zzso 18 possesses the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso gene is another hot spot of the zzso which are zzso associated with chronic zzso zzso The zzso in chronic zzso leukemia results in the juxtaposition of the zzso gene to various regions on the zzso light chain zzso No association of a zzso signal sequence and the zzso of the zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso occurring at the zzso region of the zzso gene might be zzso by a different mechanism from that of the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso at the zzso zzso region of zzso gene are surrounded by multiple alternating zzso elements zzso zzso The zzso specific to zzso showed that the regions containing the alternating zzso elements were confined to the zzso hot spot zzso The data suggest that zzso formation may be involved in zzso zzso at the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso
