zzso in zzso species cultured in the Philippines results in massive zzso and consequently in severe economic losses in the shrimp zzso Rapid and accurate detection of the zzso agent of the disease is zzso In this study, zzso gene sequence analysis of ten zzso zzso (from several provinces of the zzso implicated in disease affecting the zzso shrimp zzso zzso was performed in order to develop a zzso zzso detection of similar strains of shrimp zzso Analysis of the partial zzso gene revealed zzso sequence similarity among the ten zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence variation of the zzso zzso however, was observed between the zzso zzso zzso and the type zzso with the zzso zzso exhibiting only zzso and zzso sequence similarity with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of a zzso primer set that was designed based on zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso amplified the expected zzso zzso zzso using templates from all ten zzso zzso zzso No amplified product was observed in zzso using templates from type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso bacteria, suggesting that the zzso were specific for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso reported in this study could be useful in the detection of zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso in the shrimp industry, which could not be detected in zzso using zzso designed for type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
