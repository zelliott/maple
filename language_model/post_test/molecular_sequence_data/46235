zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene was detected by zzso and DNA sequencing methods in 665 individuals from five Chinese cattle zzso The results showed that at the zzso zzso three observed zzso zzso AB and zzso two linked zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso within a putative signal zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso A and B in the five breeds were zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was shown to be significantly associated with growth traits in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso had greater zzso zzso body weight and average daily gain than those with zzso AA at 6 months old zzso as well as better body zzso body length and heart zzso when 6 months zzso This study revealed for the first time that the zzso gene is a promising candidate gene that affects growth traits in zzso
