zzso binding zzso factor zzso is a highly basic 136 zzso acid protein containing 10 zzso zzso We have determined the zzso status and the zzso arrangement of the zzso zzso in zzso from bovine brain and zzso human zzso protein produced in zzso zzso Our data indicate that all 10 zzso are involved in zzso bond zzso The zzso linkages of human zzso and bovine brain zzso as determined after zzso zzso of the zzso proteins by zzso mapping and sequence analysis are: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso has the same zzso arrangement as the native zzso zzso
