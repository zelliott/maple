The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a protein that has 37 and zzso identity with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are hypothesized to act in concert at the zzso site to resolve zzso zzso formed by zzso during zzso zzso of zzso zzso contained a zzso of zzso cells held together in long zzso The chains included zzso cells and cells with zzso dense or diffuse zzso indicating a zzso zzso zzso This result is consistent with zzso having a role in the resolution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso contain a single uninitiated zzso and analysis of zzso zzso spores showed that the placement of zzso rings and zzso is affected in zzso strains by the first division after the initiation of zzso The introduction of a zzso zzso into zzso strains resulted in only slight modifications of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso can form in a zzso manner in zzso zzso In addition to zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso shows extensive similarity to zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso proteins were shown to bind in zzso to DNA containing the zzso coli zzso zzso Together they functioned efficiently in zzso to catalyze zzso zzso of an artificial Holliday junction containing a zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone did not cause a discernible change in zzso and it is speculated that zzso can substitute for zzso in zzso
