The zzso zzso of the zzso gecko zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso protein at a level of 20 to zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of peptides from this protein are most zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso which normally occurs at zzso levels in the eye zzso and which is involved in the development of diabetic zzso The sequences show zzso identity with zzso from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that different genes from the same zzso of zzso zzso have been recruited to become highly expressed as lens proteins in at least two different evolutionary zzso To reflect the relationship with zzso zzso the gecko lens protein is designated as zzso zzso As for zzso zzso no zzso activity could be established for zzso zzso in the gecko zzso Up to now, zzso zzso has not been detected in zzso of other zzso or zzso
