zzso is a highly zzso therapeutic zzso protein that contains multiple zzso and zzso zzso An in-depth characterization of the zzso of zzso was carried out using liquid zzso zzso zzso methods in a systematic approach in which we analyzed the zzso and zzso zzso and located the occupied zzso zzso zzso was first treated with zzso zzso F to release the zzso The zzso pool was labeled with a zzso zzso zzso tag and separated using zzso liquid zzso interaction liquid zzso zzso zzso structures were assigned using zzso These assignments, which included zzso sequence and linkage information, were confirmed by zzso array zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso The removal of the zzso from zzso facilitated the selective characterization of zzso and enabled the zzso to be zzso These were predominantly of the core 1 zzso zzso zzso attached to zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to remove the zzso acid zzso on the zzso allowing the use of an automated zzso protocol to identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso was then used to pinpoint the 12 occupied zzso zzso The determination of zzso and zzso and zzso sites in zzso provides a basis for future studies addressing the biological importance of specific protein zzso in the production of safe and zzso zzso
