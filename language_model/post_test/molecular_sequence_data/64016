zzso zzso virus zzso is a zzso that causes zzso zzso disease in domestic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carry a chronic zzso strain of zzso zzso which so far has not been convincingly connected with immune pathology or zzso zzso harboring the three distinct strains A, B, and C defined by pol gene sequence zzso is endemic in the large zzso population of lions in the zzso zzso in zzso Here we describe the pattern of variation in the three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso among lions within 13 prides to assess the occurrence of zzso infection and zzso Genome diversity within and among zzso strains is shown to be large, with strain divergence for each gene approaching genetic distances observed for zzso between different species of zzso Multiple in zzso with two or three strains were found in zzso of the zzso individuals based on zzso sequence analysis, which may suggest that zzso immunity or interference evoked by one strain is not consistently protective against infection by a zzso This comprehensive study of zzso in a zzso population of lions reveals a dynamic transmission of virus in a social species that has historically adapted to render the virus zzso
