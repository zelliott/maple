The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is zzso regulated both by oxygen and zzso We have shown recently that an upstream zzso site located in the zzso region of this gene controls its expression zzso zzso and Smith, zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we present the complete zzso sequence of the zzso locus of zzso zzso The zzso locus encodes a protein of 157 zzso with an Mr of 17, zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product shows zzso extensive sequence and structural zzso zzso identical zzso and an additional zzso conservative zzso to the zzso human and rabbit zzso translation zzso factor zzso Factor zzso is the only known zzso protein that zzso a unique zzso modification of zzso to the zzso acid zzso and interestingly the same zzso is also present in the zzso gene zzso zzso presented provide strong evidence that the zzso locus that encodes a transcript, zzso and a second locus zzso a transcript, zzso together zzso two forms of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso regulates both the zzso in an opposite manner; as a result it can dictate the zzso available under conditions of high and low oxygen zzso The zzso locus of zzso zzso is known to regulate zzso zzso and zzso genes at the zzso zzso the zzso locus thus regulates all known zzso expressed genes that are involved in different cellular functions such as zzso and protein zzso
