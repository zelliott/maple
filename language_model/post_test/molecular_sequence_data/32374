zzso zzso comprise a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly expressed at zzso zzso Previously we identified a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso that, when zzso is a mixture of zzso zzso and exhibits potent zzso activity against zzso coli and zzso zzso Here we report that zzso displays zzso activity against an extended panel of zzso zzso pathogens for which zzso treatment is limited or zzso zzso zzso were collected by zzso liquid zzso and analyzed by gel zzso and mass zzso zzso activity was initially investigated with the type strain zzso zzso zzso All zzso tested displayed zzso potent zzso activity levels comparable with that of the zzso zzso However, use of an zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso or of reduced zzso gave diminished zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso structure of zzso is crucial to zzso zzso this hypothesis was confirmed by investigation of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso This gave an activity profile similar to that of synthetic zzso but only in an zzso zzso zzso Thus, we have shown that zzso zzso molecules based on the zzso zzso sequence demonstrate zzso activity even in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso
