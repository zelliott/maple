In aquatic systems, bacterial community succession is a function of zzso and bottom-up factors, but little information exists on zzso controls, such as bacterial zzso by zzso organisms zzso which likely impacts zzso cycling within the microbial loop and eventual export to higher zzso zzso Here we report transient response of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso dissolved organic matter supply in a zzso zzso zzso Bay, zzso Both dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen zzso oscillated over the course of the tidal cycle with relatively higher zzso observed at low zzso zzso with the shift in dissolved organic matter zzso supply at low tide, a zzso increase in numbers of bacteria and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso length zzso of small zzso zzso zzso and sequence analyses revealed distinct shifts such that, at low tide, significantly higher zzso zzso were observed from zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity of zzso zzso and zzso group increased at high zzso To identify metabolically active zzso zzso tidal zzso were spiked with six zzso bacteria as potential prey and studied using an adaptation of stable isotope zzso At low tide, representative of higher zzso and increased prey but lower zzso zzso community also shifted such that zzso clusters I and VI were more zzso with an increased zzso at high tide, zzso clusters III, zzso and X were zzso Eventually, zzso label was identified from higher zzso indicating that zzso interactions within the zzso microbial food web are potentially far more complex than previously zzso
