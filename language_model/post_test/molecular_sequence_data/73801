zzso analyses of transcripts zzso various zzso of the human zzso zzso inward zzso channel zzso (also referred to as zzso revealed the existence of at least five distinct transcripts zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These five zzso transcripts appear to be the result of alternative zzso of five zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso DNA including and spanning these zzso (the zzso zzso was obtained directly from zzso and zzso clones (a total of 40 zzso The organization of the zzso gene was determined by combining this sequence information with data obtained from primer extension and zzso zzso It appears that the zzso gene zzso multiple zzso with zzso elements found zzso of zzso 1, 4, or zzso The promoter zzso of zzso 5 was zzso thus, it appears that the zzso gene is capable of producing six distinct zzso transcripts via the use of three promoters and alternative zzso of five zzso Comparisons of the rat and human zzso zzso sequences find human zzso zzso for two of the three distinct zzso zzso A search of the complete human zzso sequence with the zzso sequence that defines the other zzso transcript located a region of shared zzso a putative sixth zzso in the zzso zzso This finding suggests that the zzso gene may contain an zzso that is no longer or infrequently used in transcripts derived from the zzso zzso
