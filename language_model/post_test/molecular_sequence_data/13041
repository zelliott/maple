zzso protein zzso IV zzso zzso a member of the zzso family involved in zzso regulation, is zzso by zzso but also requires zzso by a zzso zzso for full zzso In this study we investigated the zzso role of a zzso cascade in zzso T human zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso Total and zzso zzso IV activities were increased zzso by zzso zzso This zzso zzso involved zzso since the zzso zzso IV from zzso zzso cells could be subsequently zzso in zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso IV zzso from zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso cells could be activated in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso from rat brain or zzso whereas zzso IV from zzso zzso zzso cells was only activated to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso IV zzso was triggered by zzso acting through zzso since zzso could also be zzso by zzso treatment, and zzso zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso These data are consistent with a zzso cascade in which zzso IV is activated by a zzso zzso cascade triggered by elevated zzso calcium in zzso zzso
