A series of zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso tumors were developed in zzso and analyzed for drug zzso Three of 20 tumors studied expressed an altered zzso zzso zzso and each was zzso having a C to T base transition at zzso 46 in the zzso gene as demonstrated by zzso and direct zzso This transition results in a zzso to zzso substitution at zzso acid 15 of the zzso zzso altered zzso displays significantly lower binding affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with respective Ki values zzso zzso zzso and zzso higher than values obtained for zzso isolated from parental tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding is also diminished for the zzso zzso although to a lesser extent zzso and zzso higher zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso for all zzso species of zzso but has no known zzso either directly or zzso with bound zzso zzso or zzso zzso molecular modeling reveals that the affected zzso is 9-12 A away from the zzso active site and located in a region analogous to the mobile zzso loop domain characterized for zzso coli zzso
