zzso zzso is a zzso zzso by activated T cells and shares most but not all biological activities with zzso zzso Both zzso play an important role as a switch factor directing synthesis of zzso they act on zzso and zzso cells, but unlike zzso zzso does not act on T zzso These zzso have both common and distinct components in their respective zzso Based on sequence similarity shared by zzso zzso family members, we have identified a zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso This zzso was used to examine the pattern of zzso zzso expression by Northern zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso from different human zzso and cell zzso Among several myeloma cell lines zzso the zzso cell line was the only one found to express zzso zzso This cell line is also the only one described as producing zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso by in zzso zzso Interestingly, this locus is near that of the zzso zzso zzso the product of which is also involved, like zzso in proliferation and zzso zzso switching of human B zzso The human zzso gene maps between two zzso zzso genes located on the zzso arm zzso zzso the zzso zzso gamma chain gene zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso The lack of zzso sequence similarity suggests unrelated evolutionary pathways between these zzso zzso
