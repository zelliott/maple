The smooth muscle zzso zzso beta and gamma were isolated in pure form and labeled with zzso zzso on the zzso zzso at either the zzso or the zzso region zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on local zzso changes in different regions of the zzso zzso was determined on the basis of changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso formed in zzso of zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso at zzso of zzso zzso decreased in a simple manner on the addition of zzso whereas the zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso exhibited a zzso change, suggesting that additional weak binding sites exist near zzso In the presence of zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso of zzso were observed only with zzso and this change was associated with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso A competition study with zzso zzso zzso indicated that the different zzso changes exhibited by zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso were due to zzso changes in different regions of the zzso zzso and not to differences in their affinities for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso derived using the zzso expression system showed that the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso requires the regions between zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso although the latter region was sufficient for direct interaction with zzso
