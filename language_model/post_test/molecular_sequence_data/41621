zzso zzso has emerged as an important zzso modification involved in a variety of biological zzso especially regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in three distinct states zzso zzso and zzso which are recognized by specific protein zzso The zzso brain tumor zzso domain is one such module found in several zzso regulatory complexes including zzso repressive complex zzso Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of the human zzso family with emphasis on zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to screen for the zzso zzso peptides that bind to zzso zzso found in nine human zzso zzso interactions were zzso using zzso polarization zzso We show that all zzso proteins recognize only zzso and/or zzso marks and provide evidence that some zzso zzso recognize a defined consensus sequence while others bind in a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso we identify a zzso of zzso in the zzso binding pocket that zzso discrimination between zzso and zzso This study represents a comprehensive analysis of zzso zzso zzso establishing a foundation for the rational design of selective zzso domain zzso that may enable zzso of their role in human biology and zzso
