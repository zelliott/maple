We compared the distribution of the zzso zzso of zzso sodium channels zzso and zzso and a related channel, zzso in zzso identified zzso zzso of the rat zzso root zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso was restricted to zzso zzso and they were zzso expressed by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso possess these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were more abundant in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso was evenly expressed in both zzso Although zzso and zzso were zzso expressed by zzso zzso other zzso were expressed independently of zzso zzso Actually, all zzso zzso expressed both zzso and zzso and relatively limited zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed zzso and/or zzso These findings provide useful information in interpreting the zzso characteristics of some zzso zzso of zzso zzso After zzso spinal nerve zzso zzso zzso was zzso mainly in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Although previous studies demonstrated that nerve growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso reversed this zzso the zzso induction was independent of either zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that the induction of zzso may be one of the common responses of zzso zzso zzso without a direct relationship to zzso zzso
