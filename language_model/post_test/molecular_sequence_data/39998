The zzso zzso of an engineered gold binding zzso on gold surface was studied by using both zzso crystal zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso The gold binding zzso was originally selected as a zzso acid sequence by cell surface display and then engineered to have a zzso form zzso with improved binding zzso Both sets of zzso data for zzso were fit to zzso models to extract zzso and thermodynamics zzso In zzso the zzso onto the surface shows a zzso behavior and this is explained as the effect of zzso surface zzso of the zzso gold zzso on zzso zzso Depending on the concentration of the zzso a preferential zzso on the surface takes place with different energy zzso The kinetic parameters zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso and the binding energy zzso zzso zzso are comparable to zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate the potential zzso of genetically engineered zzso zzso peptides as molecular zzso due to their binding zzso stability, and functionality in an zzso zzso
