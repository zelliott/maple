zzso protein zzso zzso is the zzso that zzso the zzso transfer of zzso acid from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of a protein zzso zzso zzso of bovine brain indicates that zzso activity was located in both the zzso and the particulate fraction of the zzso zzso of the particulate fraction resulted in a zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso of the particulate fraction and zzso fraction resulted in zzso of the elevated zzso zzso zzso These results indicated the existence of putative zzso activity of zzso located in the particulate fraction of bovine zzso The inhibitor was stable to heat and was identified as a zzso on the basis of its zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation first required the zzso of the particulate zzso The inhibitor was zzso to zzso by heat treatment, zzso extraction and zzso zzso zzso column zzso The inhibitor was zzso zzso from the particulate fraction with a zzso zzso The protein inhibitor had an apparent molecular mass of 92 zzso by gel zzso and 71 zzso by zzso indicating the protein is zzso The inhibitor did not interact directly with zzso and possessed no zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso inhibitor protein inhibited the formation of zzso zzso of zzso per zzso of zzso
