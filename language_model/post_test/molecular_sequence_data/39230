The complete zzso sequence of a zzso isolated from zzso zzso in Thailand was zzso The L zzso comprises of zzso zzso and codes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso are located on the M zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the viral zzso precursors zzso zzso zzso separated by an zzso region of 433 zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 275 zzso respectively, were identified on the S zzso zzso zzso separated by an zzso region of zzso zzso The N protein of the Thailand isolate was most closely related to that of zzso zzso virus zzso sharing an zzso acid sequence identity of zzso Additionally, multiple sequence analyses revealed significant similarities to zzso of the species Watermelon silver zzso virus and to several putative zzso entries in zzso Based on these alignments it is proposed to refer to all these different viruses as zzso of zzso
