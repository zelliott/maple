zzso zzso factors interaction with zzso DNA has been investigated in zzso on the human zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso of this promoter shows a preferential zzso positioning on the zzso promoter zzso including the zzso centered at zzso relative to the start site of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso are unable to interact with their recognition site incorporated in a zzso However, competition between zzso factor binding and zzso assembly allows zzso binding and zzso important modifications in the zzso structure suggesting the displacement of zzso These findings imply that binding of zzso factors to the zzso prior to zzso induction might be required to prevent the incorporation of this element in a zzso
