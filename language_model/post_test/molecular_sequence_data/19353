A bacterial isolate obtained from soil from a municipal landfill site in India was characterized using a zzso zzso zzso The colonies of the isolate were found to be yellow and highly zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that this isolate constitutes a distinct zzso line within the zzso zzso displaying zzso % sequence divergence with respect to recognized zzso zzso The generic assignment was confirmed by zzso data, which revealed the presence of a fatty acid profile characteristic of members of the zzso zzso and consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids as well as zzso : zzso zzso as zzso fatty acid, and the presence of an zzso with eight zzso units zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso The zzso and zzso data show that strain zzso zzso merits zzso as representing a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
