zzso is essential for the normal zzso control of diverse zzso zzso events in zzso zzso zzso acts by zzso regulating the level of zzso zzso creating a zzso decrease in zzso protein starting in the first zzso stage zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso locus by zzso walking and transformation zzso We used the zzso zzso clone to isolate the gene from three other zzso zzso all four zzso clones functionally rescue the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence from these four species and zzso zzso of potential open reading frames indicated that zzso does not zzso a zzso Two small zzso transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 zzso were identified in zzso zzso and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso regulates zzso translation via an zzso zzso zzso
