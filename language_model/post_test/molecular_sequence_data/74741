zzso and zzso studies were performed on 15 zzso of an unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from human zzso The novel organisms were zzso zzso and produced zzso and zzso as end products of zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing demonstrated that the 15 zzso were highly related to each other and formed a zzso unknown zzso within the zzso zzso cluster zzso The novel zzso formed a robust zzso group with a number of organisms which included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a number of other zzso zzso On the basis of these studies, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are transferred to this zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the new zzso the zzso unknown zzso bacterial strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed as representing the type strain of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso
