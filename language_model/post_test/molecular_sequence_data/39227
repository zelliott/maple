zzso coronavirus zzso causes enteric and respiratory zzso orders in calves and zzso in zzso In this study, 51 stool samples of calves from 10 Brazilian dairy farms were zzso by an zzso that zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso region of the spike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso using sequences from 15 field strains studied here and 10 sequences from zzso and zzso as an zzso virus showed the existence of two major clusters (1 and 2) in this viral species, the Brazilian strains segregating in both of zzso The mean zzso identity between the 15 Brazilian strains was zzso with a mean zzso acid similarity of zzso zzso from cluster 2 showed a deletion of 6 zzso acids inside domain II of the spike protein that was also found in human coronavirus strain zzso supporting the recent proposal of a zzso zzso over of zzso These results contribute to the molecular characterization of zzso to the prediction of the efficiency of zzso and to the definition of molecular markers useful for zzso surveys on zzso zzso
