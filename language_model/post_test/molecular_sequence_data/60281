The Ral zzso is activated by zzso which is one of the zzso proteins for zzso Previous studies have suggested that Ral might function to regulate the zzso however, its in zzso function is zzso We have identified a zzso zzso of Ral that is widely expressed during zzso and zzso disc zzso Two zzso zzso Ral zzso zzso zzso and zzso were generated and analyzed for zzso binding and zzso zzso The zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso and zzso act as zzso active and dominant negative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not cause any visible zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso caused defects in the development of various zzso including the zzso surface, which is covered by parallel zzso of polarized structures such as hairs and sensory zzso The dominant negative zzso protein caused defects in the development of hairs and zzso These zzso were genetically suppressed by loss of function zzso of zzso and basket, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso active zzso protein caused defects in the process of zzso closure during zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso regulates zzso cell shape changes through the zzso zzso
