It has been shown earlier that the choice of zzso salt has a large effect on the retention in zzso zzso of proteins and zzso The influence of different zzso zzso cannot be predicted or zzso explained, zzso to the current lack of an adequate theoretical zzso In this work a general characterization is made by using a considerable number of proteins and peptides and all zzso zzso found zzso Principal component analysis is used to interpret the large amount of data that is zzso The results of the analysis indicate that most of the retention variations are due to zzso effects and can be explained by changes in the apparent zzso zzso zzso the increase in zzso strength per unit volume, and the zzso strength of the starting zzso This differs from the interpretation given earlier, where the selectivity changes were attributed to specific effects of the zzso However, as it is impossible to test all existing proteins and zzso specific effects are still possible, but they might be less common than previously zzso
