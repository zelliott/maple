We have developed an zzso DNA zzso system for the rescue of infectious influenza A virus from cloned zzso In this zzso expression system, viral zzso is inserted between the zzso zzso I zzso I) promoter and zzso zzso This entire pol I zzso unit is flanked by an zzso zzso II zzso zzso promoter and a zzso zzso The orientation of the two zzso units allows the synthesis of zzso viral zzso and zzso zzso from one viral zzso zzso This pol zzso II system starts with the initiation of zzso of the two cellular zzso zzso zzso from their own zzso presumably in different compartments of the zzso The interaction of all molecules derived from the cellular and viral zzso and translation machinery results in the generation of infectious influenza A zzso The utility of this system is proved by the recovery of the two influenza A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso hours after the zzso of eight expression plasmids into zzso zzso and zzso cells, the virus yield in the zzso of the zzso cells was between 2 zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso infectious viruses per zzso We also used this zzso system for the generation of single and quadruple zzso viruses between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because the pol zzso II system zzso the design and recovery of both zzso and zzso influenza A zzso it may also be zzso to the recovery of other zzso viruses entirely from cloned zzso
