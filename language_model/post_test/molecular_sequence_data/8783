T cell expression of zzso 3 zzso is directed by positive and negative zzso DNA elements clustered within 300 base pairs of the zzso start zzso A strong zzso element, termed nuclear zzso protein (NIP), was previously mapped to a segment of the zzso promoter between zzso zzso and zzso zzso characterization of this element demonstrates that it can mediate repression when linked in zzso to a zzso zzso DNA binding experiments were carried out to characterize the zzso zzso Using varying conditions, three distinct complexes were shown to interact specifically with the NIP region, although only one zzso with zzso zzso Complex 1 results from binding of a ubiquitous zzso that recognizes the 3' portion of this sequence and is not required for zzso Complex 2 zzso to binding of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso to an zzso motif in the zzso portion of the NIP zzso DNA binding specificity of complex 3 zzso with that of upstream zzso factor but is clearly zzso To determine which of the latter two complexes represents NIP activity, we incorporated small zzso into the NIP site of an zzso zzso reporter construct and examined their effects on zzso zzso zzso specificity for repression matches the DNA binding specificity of complex 3; both zzso activity and complex 3 binding require the consensus sequence zzso
