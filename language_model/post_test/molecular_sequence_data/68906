The efficiency of detection of single base zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was tested on 86 randomly distributed point zzso in a zzso DNA zzso of the mouse zzso zzso Multiple parameters were zzso including zzso temperature, buffer zzso gel zzso zzso ratio, and/or addition of different compounds to the gel zzso zzso with a higher concentration of zzso and lower zzso gave optimal zzso and all 86 zzso can be clearly distinguished from the wild type on a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso gel at 4 degrees zzso Most of the zzso are also resolvable from wild type on gels with zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso or zzso The relative position of the zzso and zzso single strands were followed by an zzso zzso zzso We found that most of the zzso comes from the zzso rich zzso which appears to be much more sensitive to changes in the zzso The position or type of zzso showed no correlation with its ability to be zzso However, the neighboring base sequence around the zzso appears to have an effect on zzso For example, zzso zzso in zzso regions significantly increase the mobility shift of the zzso zzso while most zzso changes decrease zzso We conclude that zzso is a very efficient method for the detection of point zzso if the parameters that effect the separation are zzso for a particular DNA zzso
