For many years, sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has served as an important tool for determining zzso relationships between zzso The features of this molecular target that make it a useful zzso tool also make it useful for bacterial detection and identification in the clinical zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene is a powerful mechanism for identifying new pathogens in patients with suspected bacterial disease, and more recently this technology is being applied in the clinical laboratory for routine identification of bacterial zzso Several studies have shown that sequence identification is useful for zzso unusual, and fastidious bacteria as well as for bacteria that are poorly differentiated by conventional zzso The technical resources necessary for sequence identification are zzso This method requires zzso and zzso for amplification and sequencing, a database of known zzso and software for sequence editing and database zzso Commercial zzso are available, and zzso zzso for amplification and sequencing have been zzso Likewise, there are an increasing number of commercial and public zzso Despite the availability of resources, zzso identification is still relatively zzso The cost is significantly reduced only by the introduction of more automated zzso As the cost zzso this technology is likely to be more widely applied in the clinical zzso
