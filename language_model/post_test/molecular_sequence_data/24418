zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transport of zzso and zzso drugs (including zzso across the cell zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport by the zzso zzso is driven by pH zzso while the profile of pH sensitivity is regulated by a closely related zzso zzso We investigated the zzso structure of zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence zzso database revealed that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso by the same gene located in zzso 13, consisting of 24 zzso zzso is zzso by 23 zzso and zzso by 6 zzso zzso sequences of zzso share 3 zzso completely and 2 zzso partially with zzso The zzso organization of zzso shows high similarity with its mouse zzso zzso boundaries occur mostly in the zzso connecting zzso segments zzso suggesting a modular gene structure reflecting the zzso repeat units in zzso The putative promoter region of zzso contains zzso boxes and zzso regions and a potential insulin responsive zzso
