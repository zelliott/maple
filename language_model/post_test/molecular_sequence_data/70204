We have used affinity zzso zzso zzso and regional chemical zzso in order to determine regions of the human zzso zzso zzso important in hormone zzso zzso discrimination between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso labeling studies with the zzso tamoxifen zzso and the estrogen, zzso zzso have identified zzso zzso in the zzso hormone binding domain as the primary site of zzso In the absence of a zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso becomes the site of zzso tamoxifen zzso zzso Hence these two zzso although far apart in the primary linear sequence of the zzso zzso must be close in the three-dimensional structure of the zzso in the zzso zzso binding pocket, so that the zzso can reach either zzso zzso zzso of selected zzso in the zzso and zzso chemical zzso of the zzso hormone binding domain with initial zzso screening in zzso have enabled the identification of a region near zzso important in discrimination between zzso and zzso and of other zzso important in zzso zzso zzso Some zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso portion of the hormone binding domain are zzso inactive yet bind hormone and also function as potent dominant negative zzso suppressing the activity of zzso zzso at low zzso These studies reveal a separation of the hormone binding and zzso zzso functions of the zzso They are also beginning to provide a more detailed picture of the zzso hormone binding domain and zzso acids important in zzso binding and discrimination between different categories of zzso and zzso zzso Such information will be important in the design of zzso effective zzso In addition, since there is now substantial evidence for a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso in breast zzso our studies should provide insight about the zzso of these zzso receptors and their roles in modulating the activity of wild type zzso and should lead to a better understanding of the possible role of zzso receptors in altered response or resistance to zzso and zzso therapy in breast zzso In addition, some dominant negative receptors may prove useful in examining zzso mechanisms of action and in suppressing the zzso growth of breast cancer zzso
