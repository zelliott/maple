zzso zzso zzso zzso activate zzso fatty acids zzso containing 22 or more zzso to their zzso zzso We cloned the human zzso zzso of the gene zzso the rat liver zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso zzso are expressed primarily in liver and zzso and have a potential zzso targeting signal 1 zzso at their zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso activated the zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso fatty acid zzso and two zzso fatty zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies localized zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso of zzso cells, zzso was zzso oriented facing the zzso and not the zzso This orientation, coupled with the observation that zzso activates zzso fatty zzso suggests that zzso could play a role in the zzso zzso of zzso acid produced via zzso of zzso zzso
