In most references, the zzso initiation site for the zzso and zzso genes has been described to lie 37 zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso however, a review of data zzso such as zzso and zzso showed a report of the zzso zzso initiation site occurring at position zzso relative to the initiation zzso To confirm the occurrence of these zzso for both the zzso and zzso genes and to document their expression levels, we initiated our current zzso Total zzso from the peripheral blood of 15 healthy volunteers was analyzed using both zzso chain reaction zzso and real-time zzso protocols developed in our laboratory, with zzso designed to enable distinction between the zzso and zzso zzso observed two distinct zzso products for each of the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of 11 individual zzso products revealed that the zzso and zzso transcripts are present in both a long and a short zzso initiating at positions zzso and zzso zzso The shorter zzso zzso is expressed approximately zzso times more strongly than the longer zzso demonstrating differential expression within the healthy zzso This study, for the first time, confirms the presence of two zzso for both the zzso and zzso genes with varying zzso levels in healthy zzso The short zzso is expressed at significantly higher levels than the longer zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on our zzso we propose that despite the contribution of the long zzso to the total zzso zzso pool, the short zzso are the main zzso zzso
