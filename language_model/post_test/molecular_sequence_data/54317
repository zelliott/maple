zzso zzso is expressed during zzso in the zzso neural plate, with its anterior boundary at the prospective zzso region providing a zzso cue for zzso zzso A similar function and expression is known for zzso in mice, suggesting a shared regulatory mechanism for zzso patterning in zzso zzso To understand the evolution of the regulatory mechanisms of key genes in patterning of the central nervous system, we examined how zzso zzso is regulated in zzso zzso and compared the regulatory mechanisms between zzso and zzso that have undergone an additional zzso zzso By promoter analysis, we found that the expression of the reporter gene zzso zzso expression when driven in transgenic zzso by a combination of the upstream zzso DNA and downstream zzso zzso Furthermore, reporter expression expanded zzso when transgenic zzso were exposed to zzso acid zzso or zzso or injected with zzso zzso implicating the zzso DNA examined here in the responsiveness of zzso to zzso zzso We further identified at least two functional zzso responsive elements in the downstream DNA that were shown to be major regulators of early zzso expression during zzso while the upstream DNA, which harbors repetitive sequences with apparent similarity to the zzso sequence of mouse zzso contributed only to later zzso zzso during zzso zzso implications in zzso evolution are discussed based on these zzso
