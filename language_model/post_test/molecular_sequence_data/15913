The processed gene zzso a member of the mouse gene family for zzso protein zzso could zzso a 135 zzso acid protein nearly identical to zzso The zzso region of the gene contains zzso and zzso sites at positions commonly found in expressed zzso The zzso gene lies within highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso studies suggested that an zzso transcript might be produced, an zzso probe specific for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso probe to zzso indicated fewer than zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that extreme caution is required when measuring zzso from related zzso
