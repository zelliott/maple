The zzso parameters for the zzso zzso opposite zzso positioned in the center of the complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso duplex are pH zzso A previous paper established zzso zzso pairing in the zzso zzso duplex at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso this paper focuses on the pairing alignment at the zzso site at pH zzso The observed zzso between specific zzso zzso zzso and both the zzso zzso of zzso and the sugar zzso zzso of zzso and A14 establish that zzso is positioned toward the zzso base pair with the zzso ring directed between zzso and A14 on the partner zzso The observed zzso between the zzso zzso of A14 and the zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso establishes that A14 at the zzso site is directed toward the zzso base zzso zzso are detected between all zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso confirming that both zzso and A14 are directed toward the interior of the zzso The zzso alignment at pH zzso is zzso within the zzso with retention of zzso pairing at zzso zzso and zzso base zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso segment at pH zzso establishes that zzso and A14 are directed into the zzso partially stack on each other, and are not stabilized by zzso hydrogen zzso The zzso base is partially zzso between zzso and A14 on the unmodified zzso while A14 is partially zzso between zzso and zzso on the modified zzso This results in a larger separation between the zzso and zzso base pairs zzso the zzso site in the basic pH zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the transition between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurs at pH zzso establishing an unusually high zzso for zzso of the A14 ring opposite the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the interplay between zzso and zzso contributions modulated by pH defines the alignment of zzso opposite zzso in the interior of DNA zzso
