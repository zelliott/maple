zzso zzso encodes an zzso orphan zzso zzso zzso that is zzso active as a zzso and displays potent zzso activity when zzso Here we describe a zzso protein of approximately 68 zzso designated zzso as the product of an alternative zzso transcript that retains zzso zzso This alternative transcript specifies 340 zzso identical to zzso I and II from the zzso domain of zzso followed by a unique zzso sequence of 79 zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso product of the alternative transcript specifically binds to zzso cells with a zzso of approximately 14 zzso and was chemically zzso to zzso whereas the zzso zzso sequence alone also binds with high affinity to zzso cells and associates with zzso zzso from cell zzso The zzso zzso is expressed in normal human fetal kidney and liver, but is at reduced levels relative to zzso zzso in zzso cells that contain an amplified zzso zzso zzso appears to be an inhibitor of zzso because it zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso growth of transformed cells that zzso zzso
