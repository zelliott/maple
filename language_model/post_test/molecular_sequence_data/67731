The zzso H zzso zzso zzso of zzso reverse zzso play an essential role in the replication cycle of zzso During reverse zzso of the viral zzso zzso an zzso hybrid is created whose zzso strand needs to be zzso by the zzso H to enable synthesis of the second DNA strand by the DNA zzso function of the reverse zzso Here, we report the solution structure of the separately zzso zzso H domain from zzso zzso virus zzso revealing the so-called zzso and the adjacent basic loop, which both were suggested to be important in zzso binding and zzso 

The solution structure of zzso zzso H shows that it contains a mixed zzso zzso which is sandwiched by four zzso zzso including the zzso on one side and one zzso zzso zzso on the opposite zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that upon zzso addition signal changes can be detected predominantly in the basic loop as well as in the zzso All these regions are oriented towards the bound zzso In addition, signal zzso corresponding to zzso in the zzso and the active site decrease, while only minor or no changes of the overall structure of the zzso H are zzso upon zzso zzso Dynamic studies confirm the zzso state of the zzso H zzso zzso comparisons with zzso zzso zzso which lacks the basic zzso indicate that the basic loop is relevant for zzso interaction, while the zzso appears to fulfill mainly structural functions, zzso positioning the basic loop in the correct orientation for zzso zzso 

The structural data of zzso zzso H demonstrate the importance of the basic loop, which contains four positively charged zzso in zzso binding and the function of the zzso in positioning of the zzso In the zzso full length zzso zzso the function of the basic loop is carried out by a different loop, which also harbors basic zzso derived from the connection domain of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso H which are also active as separate zzso might need a functional basic loop for proper zzso zzso
