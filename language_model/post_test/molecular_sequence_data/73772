Information about genetic variation within the canine major zzso complex zzso class II genes is zzso In common with most other zzso species the canine zzso or zzso includes genes which are zzso to human zzso zzso and zzso Recently, at least one functional zzso zzso zzso has been zzso but so far systematic screening efforts have been zzso In the present study, we zzso both zzso and zzso clones derived from zzso zzso genes of Irish zzso zzso This breed was of interest, since it shows a high prevalence of zzso sensitive zzso zzso which may be a useful animal model for zzso disease zzso of zzso Interestingly, few of the zzso found in Irish zzso were identical to those previously detected in other zzso Three novel zzso zzso and four novel zzso zzso zzso were discovered in 19 unrelated zzso Strong association between certain zzso zzso zzso and CD of man prompted us to screen the zzso zzso of members of a family of zzso Irish zzso zzso No zzso or zzso were shared by all affected dogs, but one frequent zzso in this family was also detected in an unrelated zzso Irish zzso this zzso was absent in the healthy zzso This observation warrants further investigation by screening the zzso zzso of a large population of unrelated zzso Irish zzso
