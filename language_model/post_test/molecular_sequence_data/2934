zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso cause deletions of segments in the zzso and also affect zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso that were zzso the defects in the segment pattern and the zzso zzso are parallel in zzso We have zzso the DNA of four zzso zzso that show normal spatial and zzso patterns of zzso protein zzso Three of the four zzso have single base pair zzso that result in a single zzso acid zzso The exchanges occur in the putative zzso domain of the zzso zzso which is characterized by four repeats of the zinc finger zzso zzso comparison of the finger motifs helped to define the structural requirements for the folding of the finger domain to some zzso Our data on the zzso zzso support the view that has emerged from the evolutionary zzso
