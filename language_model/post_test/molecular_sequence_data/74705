zzso to the original immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso technique is zzso zzso is used instead of native PAGE for improved extraction of zzso from a mixture of zzso zzso samples treated with zzso zzso zzso instead of native sample buffer ensure that proteins are zzso zzso These negative charges on the proteins assure that the proteins migrate zzso towards the zzso regardless of their zzso values and hence pass through the region embedded with the metal zzso Another benefit of treating proteins with zzso is that it unfolds the zzso exposing the zzso groups to facilitate the zzso zzso zzso zzso can only be extracted after zzso sample buffer zzso Data show that there is no zzso effect upon zzso treatment on the extraction of zzso from a mixture of zzso zzso migration of zzso zzso upon encounter with metal zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso proteins migrate zzso
