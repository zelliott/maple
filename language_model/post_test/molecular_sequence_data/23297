zzso zzso and zzso zzso are effective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso proteins differ at their N and C zzso the zzso zzso in zzso is replaced by zzso in zzso The role of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso retention was investigated by zzso human embryonic zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso or a series of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso acids were deleted zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells by using zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso zzso at its N zzso with the zzso zzso even when zzso were restricted to the zzso However, zzso zzso deletions of zzso which lacked zzso were not localized to zzso and did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso by zzso The shortest deletion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not express stable protein zzso However, all zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed zzso and localized to the zzso when they were zzso with zzso These results show that zzso zzso distribution depends on zzso zzso and on its zzso zzso zzso zzso By using zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein 94 were identified as proteins that interact with zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, in the absence of zzso retention of zzso in the zzso is zzso through its association with other components through the zzso zzso zzso
