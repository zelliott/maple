The genetic variation and evolution of cucumber mosaic virus zzso from aromatic, medicinal and ornamental plants in northern Italy was studied by sequence analysis of the movement protein gene and comparison with equivalent sequences of zzso from other zzso zzso of zzso and synonymous zzso suggested that zzso of zzso acid sites were under negative selection and only one was under positive zzso zzso zzso diversity and genetic differentiation analyses suggested that long-distance migration plays a role in the evolution and determination of the genetic structure and diversity of zzso in northern Italy and other zzso
