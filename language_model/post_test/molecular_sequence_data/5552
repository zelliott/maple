The zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso is not a part of the zzso zzso as in most zzso but rather is located downstream of the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso zzso Two types of transcripts were detected for this gene zzso The level of the major zzso transcript was about 10 times higher at 22 degrees C than at 38 degrees C, whereas the minor zzso zzso transcript was more abundant at the higher zzso The level of the zzso protein in relation to total protein was three times lower at 38 degrees C than at 22 degrees zzso Analysis of isolated zzso indicated that zzso was present at an zzso ratio with regard to other zzso proteins at 22 degrees C but that its level decreased with zzso zzso the relative abundance of zzso increased with zzso A decrease in the level of zzso at high temperature was also found in zzso in which zzso is located downstream of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the adaptation to changes in temperature in zzso
