We cloned zzso the most recently described member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso from normal human zzso zzso zzso is involved in the signal zzso pathways of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors by association with their common zzso zzso zzso is critical to zzso development, as recently established by the linking of zzso in zzso to a zzso of patients with zzso and the generation of zzso mice with severe disruptions in normal zzso zzso However, zzso expression is not restricted to the zzso compartment of bone zzso but is found in a wide range of zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that zzso is also expressed in adult zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso protection zzso and zzso indicate that zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso zzso cell lines with zzso and/or zzso zzso In normal human bone zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso which is highly enriched in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found a zzso zzso of zzso which is formed by the zzso of zzso with zzso II of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso analyses indicate that this zzso zzso zzso is normally expressed in almost all zzso and zzso zzso shown to express zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we have localized zzso to zzso the same region of zzso 19 to which the zzso zzso hormone maps zzso
