Growth hormone zzso has many important zzso roles in the control of growth, metabolism and zzso which is zzso by growth hormone zzso zzso In this study, two zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the liver of Nile zzso zzso zzso The two zzso one consisting of 1908 zzso and the other of zzso zzso zzso for putative zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), shared zzso identity in zzso sequence and zzso in deduced zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated a single zzso transcript of zzso and a single zzso transcript of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that both zzso and zzso zzso were presented in all zzso tested and expressed extremely highly in the zzso In most zzso zzso expressed significantly higher than zzso Analysis of the zzso expression profiles in the zzso during zzso cycle indicated that the zzso levels of zzso in zzso were significantly higher at sexual matured stage while those in zzso were significantly higher at sexual zzso stage, suggesting that zzso axis might be involved in reproduction under a regulatory mechanism of zzso gene zzso
