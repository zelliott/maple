In humans, two zzso have been isolated zzso zzso alpha zzso differing only in part of the zzso untranslated zzso zzso extension data show that the two zzso are near full-length zzso zzso protection analysis of different cell types showed that the transcript corresponding to the alpha zzso zzso isolated from a zzso library resided only in mature B zzso In contrast, the transcript corresponding to the alpha zzso zzso isolated from a zzso library was found in all cells zzso Our results also indicate the existence of a third alpha zzso transcript in the zzso cell line zzso zzso B cells were found to express high amounts of alpha zzso zzso compared to other cell types tested, as shown by Northern zzso zzso zzso there was an increased expression of zzso alpha zzso zzso in activated B cells compared to resting B zzso In zzso zzso and translation of the zzso resulted in a protein of 45 zzso but the transcripts were translated with different efficiency, suggesting a role for the zzso untranslated region in regulation of zzso We have also made an alpha zzso construct lacking the specific zzso regions of the two zzso A transcript generated from this construct was translated more efficiently in zzso than the two alpha zzso zzso
