zzso constitutes a very poorly known zzso of zzso whose essential characteristic is that all representatives of the zzso are cultivated by termites zzso in their nest and that all the zzso cultivated by termites belong to this zzso For the first time, the zzso relationships of several African zzso species was studied by the sequencing of their internal zzso zzso region zzso It appeared that this group is clearly zzso and belongs to the zzso zzso The total zzso of the ITS zone of several zzso zzso of different zzso zzso indicated that the specific diversity of this group is in fact less important than previously zzso Finally, the comparison between the zzso zzso tree and the zzso tree of zzso showed that if for certain zzso the hypothesis of zzso zzso is acceptable, it should not be applied for all zzso
