In about zzso of patients with mild zzso A, no candidate gene zzso are apparent after complete gene zzso 

To analyze factor VIII gene zzso zzso for zzso in five families with mild zzso A with no apparent zzso zzso and a reduced response to zzso 

In four cases, zzso studies revealed the presence of an abnormal zzso transcript in addition to normal zzso zzso zzso of the abnormal transcripts revealed complex zzso which allowed the identification of three different zzso variations zzso zzso and zzso at the DNA level, absent from zzso normal zzso By in zzso analysis, zzso and zzso were strongly predicted to result in the generation of new zzso sites with the introduction of premature termination zzso while zzso was predicted to generate a new protein with 30 additional zzso zzso However, these predictions were not homogeneous across the different zzso and programs zzso The zzso effect of two zzso was also confirmed by in zzso expression zzso These changes were also identified in related female carriers and in other mild zzso patients not included in the original zzso No zzso zzso was identified in the remaining zzso 

Although rare, deep zzso variations may be responsible for mild zzso A where no other zzso zzso have been identified and may be associated with a reduced zzso response to zzso zzso zzso analysis is a useful tool for the identification of deep zzso variation not zzso by standard DNA zzso
