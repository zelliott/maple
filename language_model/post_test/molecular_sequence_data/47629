zzso zzso produces zzso complexes zzso made of zzso cell wall degrading zzso tightly bound to a scaffolding protein zzso by means of their zzso zzso It has previously been shown that the zzso zzso in zzso are the zzso zzso and that the zzso interaction is zzso In the present study, surface zzso resonance was used to demonstrate that the free zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso have the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as that of the entire zzso and a larger zzso of zzso the latter of which zzso in addition to zzso a cellulose binding domain and a zzso domain of unknown zzso This demonstrates that neither the zzso domain of zzso nor the zzso zzso of zzso have any influence on the zzso zzso zzso are composed of two zzso segments of 22 zzso removal of the second segment zzso the affinity for zzso whereas modified zzso having twice the first segment, twice the second, or both segments but in a reverse order have zzso values for zzso in the same range as that observed for zzso zzso These data indicate that if two segments are required for the zzso with the zzso segments 1 and 2 are similar enough to replace each zzso zzso overlay experiments revealed that the zzso domain has one calcium binding site per zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso and zzso zzso indicates that this domain is well structured and that removal of calcium only zzso affects the secondary structure, which remains zzso zzso
