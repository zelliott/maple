We describe the zzso and cloning of human DNA zzso at the onset of S phase in zzso cells synchronized with zzso A survey of the overall structural properties of these sequences did not show any distinctive features except for an enrichment in zzso zzso The two longer fragments were completely zzso and studied in more zzso Both were shown to contain zzso signals associated with promoters and/or zzso such as the binding sites of zzso T zzso and nuclear factor zzso In one instance, a binding site for a known cellular zzso factor zzso was located inside the sequence by zzso zzso by zzso zzso and Northern zzso the same sequence was shown to contain an active zzso The significance of these findings with respect to the role of zzso in initiation of DNA replication at the origin is zzso None of the tested fragments exhibited autonomously replicating sequence zzso activity in zzso zzso The problems connected with the detection of zzso activity in human cells are critically zzso
