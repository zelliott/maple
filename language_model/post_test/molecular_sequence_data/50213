We have used an affinity zzso zzso which when combined with Northern zzso techniques permits us to estimate the degree of zzso of individual zzso species in zzso zzso We observe that the levels of zzso zzso zzso in many but not all zzso varies dramatically at different bacterial growth zzso Five zzso are completely zzso at all growth rates, while another eight zzso are incompletely zzso and the fraction of the zzso form of these zzso species increases as the growth rates zzso Transfer zzso contains zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso of zzso is zzso with growth zzso Surprisingly, none of the thirteen zzso species that we have studied is completely unmodified in all growth zzso In particular, at the zzso growth rates every zzso class that we have studied contains a form that has zzso zzso
