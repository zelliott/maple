The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect several forms of zzso zzso zzso expressed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso based on the zzso sequences in the zzso area of the zzso zzso cells were found to contain zzso for type III and type VI zzso In addition, a novel zzso message was zzso The cloned zzso excluding primer areas, represented 69 zzso acids with most similarity to rat zzso II and zzso Northern analysis of zzso from zzso cells demonstrated a zzso zzso zzso zzso protection zzso revealed that in zzso cells the novel zzso zzso was dominant compared to types III and zzso Human embryonic kidney cells zzso were also used a source of zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso cells were found to contain message corresponding to type II, III, VI zzso as well as the novel zzso zzso The novel zzso message was also detected in human brain tissue and was most abundant in the zzso zzso and zzso The smallest amount of novel zzso zzso in the tested brain tissue was found in the zzso The zzso for the novel zzso was relatively abundant in human zzso
