zzso imaging of reporter gene expression using various imaging zzso playing an increasingly important role in defining molecular events in the field of cancer biology, cell biology, and gene zzso In this study, a novel reporter zzso was constructed zzso a fusion protein comprised of a zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso optical reporter gene joined by a 20 zzso acid long zzso zzso We validated the activity of the two zzso zzso by the fusion protein zzso in cell zzso Then, tumors zzso expressing the zzso fusion gene were zzso both by zzso and zzso using a cooled charge coupled device camera in zzso living zzso Using a single fusion reporter zzso gene should accelerate the validation of reporter gene approaches developed in cell culture for translation into zzso and clinical zzso
