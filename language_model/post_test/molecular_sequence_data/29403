zzso zzso is an zzso that specifically degrades the zzso zzso chains of zzso a component of blood vessel walls and the zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrated that zzso expression is increased in a variety of zzso and may play a critical role in tumor zzso The zzso gene and its zzso structure have been recently cloned and zzso To understand the mechanisms of zzso gene expression and regulation, we first mapped the zzso start site of the zzso gene and found that zzso zzso was transcribed from the zzso position 101 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso A zzso promoter region of the zzso gene was zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso promoter of the zzso gene belongs to the family of zzso zzso This zzso promoter region exhibited strong promoter activity in two zzso tumor cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter identified a minimal zzso region that had strong zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso promoter revealed three zzso sites and four zzso elements zzso significantly contributing to zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso to the zzso sites by zzso and to the zzso sites by zzso protein zzso was confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso and competition and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso construct plus the expression zzso zzso the zzso zzso or zzso gene induced zzso gene zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso or zzso sites reduced zzso expression in both zzso cells and zzso tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso further increased zzso reporter gene zzso Our results collectively suggest that zzso zzso with zzso to regulate zzso promoter zzso
