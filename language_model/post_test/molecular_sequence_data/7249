zzso in the terminal zzso zzso of the zzso repeats of the bacterial zzso zzso were zzso by measuring zzso zzso to the attachment site, zzso The zzso zzso present at either end of zzso reduces zzso only zzso but in the double zzso with C2 at both ends of zzso no zzso is zzso zzso zzso have no effect on zzso zzso Replacement with zzso at the right end of zzso apparently zzso zzso yet in the double zzso where the zzso repeats are restored by substituting this sequence at both ends of zzso zzso is partially zzso This suggests that the mechanism of zzso zzso requires communication between the two zzso zzso zzso has always been seen to generate a zzso target zzso This is presumed to result from a staggered cut, plus repair synthesis during zzso We found that two of our zzso zzso C2 and zzso sometimes yielded a zzso target zzso This observation implies that zzso of the target site might also involve interaction with the donor ends which, when zzso relax the specificity for zzso zzso
