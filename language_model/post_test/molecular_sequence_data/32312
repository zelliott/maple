zzso zzso proteins are bound to zzso by a zzso sequence located very close to the zzso followed by a short zzso polar zzso Their active zzso are exposed to the zzso zzso proteins are zzso on free zzso zzso and are found on the surface of every zzso zzso where they play various zzso The basic mechanisms of sorting and targeting of zzso proteins to the correct membrane are poorly zzso In zzso cells, the net charge of the zzso region determines the sorting to the correct target zzso a positive charge leading to zzso and negative or zzso charge to the zzso zzso zzso Here sorting signals of zzso proteins were studied in plant cells and compared with those of zzso zzso using in zzso zzso and in zzso expression in tobacco zzso or zzso It is shown that rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso with a negative charge is faithfully sorted to the plant zzso whereas a change to a positive charge leads to zzso targeting (instead of to zzso as observed in zzso zzso The zzso location of two zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso both with positive net zzso was then zzso zzso is targeted to the zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso The results show that the plant zzso unlike the zzso zzso can accommodate zzso with opposite zzso net charge, and plant cells have a specific and as yet zzso mechanism to sort zzso proteins with the same positive zzso charge to different zzso
