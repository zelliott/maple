zzso zzso in the zzso structures of zzso zzso by zzso cells were examined by zzso zzso zzso Slowly zzso zzso cultures produced zzso with a approximately zzso greater proportion of zzso zzso zzso than rapidly zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso V zzso zzso and zzso were measured in cell extracts from zzso and zzso zzso While the activity of zzso remained relatively constant, the activity of zzso V was approximately zzso lower in zzso cultures than in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso is due, at least in part, to the regulation of zzso V zzso
