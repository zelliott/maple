zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were designed and zzso These compounds carry both an zzso zzso and an zzso component zzso by a zzso of variable zzso The zzso zzso unit was constructed using a combination of a zzso support and a zzso zzso zzso zzso starting with a zzso bound to low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso successive zzso with donors having zzso group produced the zzso which was subjected to the zzso zzso using zzso loaded zzso zzso units carrying zzso zzso were separately zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and each zzso zzso on the donor unit readily zzso and produced the zzso zzso The introduction of the UMP component gave target zzso All of the zzso compounds had significant activities to zzso and zzso Their zzso were dependent upon the zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive to these zzso and optimum zzso length was clearly different between these zzso The most potent inhibitor of zzso had zzso zzso while that of zzso had Ki zzso zzso zzso
