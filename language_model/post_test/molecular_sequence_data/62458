zzso protein 4 zzso is a recently identified circulating protein expressed primarily in zzso tissue and zzso Also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso factor, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes increase of plasma very low density zzso levels by zzso of zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso and other zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso is zzso zzso among several zzso species and that full-length zzso protein is an zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso processing to release its zzso zzso domain, which zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain mediates its zzso which by itself is sufficient to form higher order zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells shows that conversion of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso activity induced by zzso These findings demonstrate a novel property of zzso proteins and suggest that zzso and zzso processing of zzso may regulate its biological activities in zzso
