The zzso zzso genes zzso alcohol zzso I zzso alcohol zzso II zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso containing the zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of these zzso genes in zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in alcohol zzso I activity, a zzso increase in alcohol zzso II activity, and a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso Small changes in the activities of these zzso did not affect zzso flux in cells which are at zzso zzso activity, indicating that flux under these conditions is controlled at some other point in zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso at high specific activities (above 8 zzso of cell zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso flux zzso flux control zzso which was most pronounced for zzso zzso Growth rate and flux are zzso coupled in this zzso Neither a twofold increase in flux nor a 50% decline from zzso flux caused any immediate change in growth zzso Thus, the rates of zzso and growth in this zzso are not limited by energy generation in rich zzso
