zzso display was used to identify sequences that mimic structural zzso in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso A coiled zzso stem loop zzso zzso scaffold library was constructed with its turn region zzso and panned for binding zzso against human zzso zzso alpha chain zzso Competition zzso zzso zzso identified zzso zzso for which binding to zzso was zzso by zzso The most frequently selected and zzso zzso contain charged zzso zzso and zzso in their turn zzso in this regard resembling a beta strand sequence in the zzso zzso region, of zzso that has been proposed to present a key zzso for zzso zzso alpha chain zzso The most dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso charge pattern similar to that seen in the original CD zzso To test the zzso of zzso zzso sequences to the zzso zzso recognition zzso zzso was grafted into the sequence zzso of a zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso was able to bind to zzso in zzso zzso to elicit zzso cell proliferation and to induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso The results help discern sequence patterns in the zzso CD turn region which are key in driving zzso recognition and demonstrate the utility of zzso zzso scaffold zzso display to identify local zzso zzso sequence arrangements that may ultimately lead to zzso zzso
