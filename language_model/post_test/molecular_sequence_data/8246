The alpha zzso zzso zzso contains a highly zzso stretch of zzso acids zzso within the third zzso zzso To investigate the role of this region, we zzso zzso zzso to delete these 16 zzso acids as well as to substitute them with zzso thereby zzso size but not zzso The zzso and zzso alpha zzso receptors were permanently expressed in zzso zzso Neither substitution nor deletion of this region affected zzso zzso zzso or zzso binding zzso zzso zzso formation of the zzso zzso protein complex, or functional zzso of the zzso to zzso We considered that since alpha zzso zzso zzso is due to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso (or a related zzso that this region may be important for establishing the zzso zzso required by this zzso zzso the consequences of 30 zzso of zzso zzso on subsequent alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso and on zzso zzso binding were determined for the zzso and these two zzso The zzso alpha zzso zzso underwent approximately zzso functional zzso and a approximately zzso loss of zzso binding after such zzso In contrast, deletion and substitution of this zzso stretch of zzso acids zzso zzso as assessed by both zzso These results correlated with those obtained in whole cell zzso zzso zzso expressing each zzso were incubated with zzso and exposed to zzso and receptors were zzso by zzso The deletion and the substitution zzso receptors underwent zzso zzso at levels of only 44 zzso zzso and 50 zzso zzso respectively, relative to zzso alpha zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
