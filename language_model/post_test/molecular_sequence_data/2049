By zzso zzso with the zzso chain reaction zzso and by studying in zzso generated zzso we have identified an zzso in the zzso of wheat dwarf virus zzso a zzso of zzso zzso whose expression is essential for the replication of the viral DNA have been zzso They are zzso by two distinct overlapping open reading frames zzso The joining of these two zzso by deletion of the zzso as well as the introduction of a zzso zzso within the zzso do not prevent replication of the viral zzso in suspension culture zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso of zzso plants possess a single continuous ORF, highly zzso to the two individual ones of zzso We propose that zzso zzso is a common feature of all zzso of the zzso and might contribute to their host class zzso The existence of a functional zzso is a novel finding for the plant zzso
