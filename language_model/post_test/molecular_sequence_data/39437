The floral zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso encodes a zzso box zzso factor required for specifying zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso which arose by gene zzso zzso with radiation of the core zzso Although zzso lacks genes in the zzso Tomato zzso box gene 6 zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso possesses both zzso and zzso zzso which have functionally zzso A zzso zzso in Tomato zzso zzso resulted in zzso transformations of both petals and zzso whereas zzso zzso reduction in zzso function resulted in flowers with zzso defects primarily in zzso The functional differences between these genes can be ascribed partly to different expression zzso When zzso in an equivalent domain, both genes can partially rescue the zzso zzso indicating that relative levels as well as spatial patterns of expression contribute to functional zzso Our results also indicate that the two proteins have differing zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso play zzso different roles in floral zzso they also support the ideas that the ancestral role of zzso lineage genes was in specifying zzso development and that zzso and divergence in the zzso lineage allowed for the acquisition of a role in zzso zzso in the core zzso
