The zzso core proteins of zzso U2, zzso and zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F and G zzso We have isolated zzso clones zzso the zzso protein using the zzso zzso as zzso Southern zzso and DNA sequencing analysis of these clones revealed the presence of an zzso zzso family in the human zzso Three gene members have been zzso Two of the genes are without zzso and contain zzso compared to the zzso zzso They appear to be processed zzso The third zzso termed zzso shares zzso identity to the zzso sequence including both zzso and zzso regions zzso it contains three zzso Analysis of the zzso region of the zzso gene revealed promoter activity, suggesting this is the functional gene that encodes the zzso zzso The promoter activity was localized in a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso reporter gene fusion zzso zzso of an zzso zzso element did not enhance the zzso directed by that zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso promoter sequence with the promoters of the zzso gene and zzso zzso genes revealed several zzso zzso suggesting that genes zzso the zzso components may be zzso zzso
