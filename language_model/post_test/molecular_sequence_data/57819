Thirty-four pancreatic zzso were studied for the presence of zzso gene zzso by the zzso zzso zzso method and by direct sequencing of zzso zzso zzso protein expression was zzso evaluated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in 14 zzso The transitions were six G to A and two A to zzso the zzso were one C to G and two A to zzso the remaining three were zzso zzso zzso results were identical with both zzso Nuclear zzso zzso cells were found in nine zzso zzso cases and in 12 cases in which no zzso was zzso In most of these latter cases only a minority of cancer cells showed zzso zzso zzso cases, including all zzso zzso zzso were known to contain zzso 12 zzso gene zzso Also in the light of the demonstrated cooperation of zzso and zzso gene zzso in the transformation of cultured cells, our data suggest that zzso zzso is one of the genetic defects that may have a role in the zzso of a proportion of pancreatic zzso
