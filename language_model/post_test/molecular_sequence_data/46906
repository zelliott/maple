zzso zzso zzso zzso are key zzso in zzso synthesis for all living zzso Although zzso and viral zzso zzso have been studied zzso little is known about their bacterial zzso To characterize the zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso region encompassing its gene zzso was cloned and zzso a high degree of conservation with the corresponding region of zzso coli was zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso in zzso coli, where the zzso represented over zzso of total soluble zzso The CD spectrum of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was characteristic for proteins rich in zzso zzso Its zzso stability was significantly lower than that of zzso coli zzso zzso However, the most striking difference between the two zzso was related to their ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso of both species had comparable zzso values for this zzso they differed significantly in their zzso for zzso Whereas zzso coli used zzso as a relatively good zzso the zzso zzso zzso had a zzso 100 times lower with zzso than with zzso This fact explains why zzso a potent zzso agent against zzso coli, is only moderately active on zzso zzso zzso comparisons between zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso along with the three-dimensional structure of the zzso coli zzso suggest that segments lying outside the main regions involved in zzso binding and zzso are responsible for the different rates of zzso zzso
