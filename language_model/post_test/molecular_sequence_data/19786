The zzso zzso in zzso zzso causes hypersensitivity to zzso White, along with other drug sensitivities that indicate a zzso in cell wall zzso We have cloned zzso by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso strain contains a zzso predicted to introduce a charged zzso zzso in place of neutral zzso at a zzso site located immediately beside the zzso regulatory zzso Both zzso and zzso map to the same region of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and growing zzso as well as to the zzso zzso of zzso indicating a role for zzso in polarized cell wall zzso These observations support the hypothesis that the role of zzso in zzso zzso is comparable to that played by zzso in the zzso zzso cell wall integrity zzso
