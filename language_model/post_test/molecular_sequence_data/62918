We report here the existence of interactions between a zzso zzso zzso from rice, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not only related to zzso repair but also to the zzso system, while zzso has a function in zzso zzso The relationship between the two is unexpected, but of great zzso The open reading frames of zzso and zzso zzso predicted products of 152 and zzso zzso acid zzso respectively, with molecular weights of zzso and zzso zzso and pull-down analyses indicated that zzso binds to zzso and transcripts of both zzso and zzso were found to be strongly expressed only in the zzso zzso such as the shoot zzso zzso suggesting that their expression is cell zzso The amount of the zzso zzso in cultured cells increased rapidly after division was zzso and zzso levels of zzso and zzso were induced by zzso and zzso agents such as zzso or zzso The zzso zzso for repair or the zzso system may thus require zzso as zzso zzso
