zzso 71 H zzso zzso an isolate from an adult patient with zzso disease zzso in China, was zzso similar to the zzso strain zzso zzso which was isolated from a patient with zzso zzso The study further analyzed the similarity of zzso H to zzso zzso at the zzso region zzso a location in zzso zzso that recently was found to be related to zzso in zzso and Venezuelan zzso encephalitis zzso Using a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso technique and a unique primer pair I, a zzso zzso product was detected from zzso zzso Cox A9 zzso Cox A16 zzso Cox B1 zzso zzso zzso Cox B5 zzso zzso and ECHO 11 zzso but not from zzso zzso Cox zzso zzso and ECHO 5 zzso However, all of the viruses generated a 154 zzso product using a universal zzso primer pair zzso Further comparative analysis using zzso sequencing of both the zzso H and zzso zzso 154 zzso products revealed that they differed by 12 zzso The variations between the two viruses were clustered in two zzso one in the region of zzso zzso with eight variations, and the other in the region of zzso zzso with three zzso The differences within the zzso between the zzso H zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses might provide a clue to explain why zzso was associated with two different clinical zzso zzso disease in the United zzso Australia, and Eastern Europe, zzso in China, Japan, and zzso
