We report the complete zzso sequence and the zzso structure of the human zzso zzso An analysis of the expression pattern of the human zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso in developing bone zzso zzso cells was also zzso The full length zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and encodes a predicted protein of 288 zzso acid zzso The zzso and zzso genes share zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso zzso at the zzso acid zzso Four potential sites for zzso zzso are zzso as are a stretch of zzso acids between two zzso zzso resembling a zzso zzso domain, and another region containing a motif similar to an zzso zzso zzso zzso Isolation of the zzso locus of the zzso gene reveals that the gene is composed of five zzso located on human zzso 2 at band zzso The zzso zzso region lacks zzso and zzso zzso zzso but includes a number of potential zzso factor binding sites and a dominant zzso start zzso The zzso gene was zzso expressed in zzso cells from zzso adult bone zzso Although zzso was not zzso expressed in zzso cells from human fetal bone zzso treatment of isolated zzso cells with zzso resulted in a dramatic increase in zzso These data suggest that zzso may play a role in zzso differentiation during the zzso cell zzso
