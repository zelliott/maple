The synthesis and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso compounds that target zzso zzso protein zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso have been described previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Inman, zzso zzso Huang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rice, zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso 42, zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were employed to determine the mechanism of modification of zzso by two lead compounds, zzso zzso and zzso zzso ne zzso zzso 45 and 47, zzso Although both compounds exhibit zzso activity in zzso zzso we failed to detect appreciable ejection of zinc from zzso under conditions in which previously described zzso zzso readily zzso zzso However, upon zzso by zzso compound 45 reacted with zzso resulting in the zinc ejection from both zinc zzso The reaction followed a zzso mechanism in which zinc was ejected from the zzso zinc finger faster than from the zzso zinc zzso Both compounds zzso modified the protein with zzso zzso zzso 45 modified zzso 36 and 49 of the zzso zinc zzso The results obtained zzso demonstrate that zzso compounds can be constructed that selectively target only one of the two zinc fingers of zzso thus providing an impetus to pursue development of highly selective zinc finger zzso
