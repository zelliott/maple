The tobacco zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates lateral expansion of the cell plate at zzso Here, we show that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso act as zzso of zzso zzso analysis suggests that direct binding of zzso to zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso is accumulated specifically in M phase and zzso with zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of a truncated zzso protein that lacks the motor domain zzso zzso concentration at the zzso zzso and cell plate zzso zzso zzso is also observed when expression of zzso and zzso is zzso by zzso gene zzso and in embryonic cells from zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso is zzso Thus, we conclude that expansion of the cell plate requires zzso to regulate the activity and zzso of zzso
