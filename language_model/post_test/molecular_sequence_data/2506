zzso is a zzso membrane binding protein that not only zzso zzso but also acts as a zzso calcium zzso We have isolated and zzso a set of overlapping zzso clones for human zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of zzso reveals strong zzso in the zzso domain with a previously identified class of zzso membrane binding zzso These include zzso II, zzso I, zzso I heavy chain zzso protein II, and zzso zzso The Mr zzso zzso zzso can be divided into a unique, highly zzso zzso domain of 167 zzso acids and a zzso zzso region of 299 zzso zzso The latter domain is composed of alternating zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the entire structure reveals possible insights into such diverse properties as zzso calcium channel activity, zzso zzso affinity for zzso and membrane zzso
