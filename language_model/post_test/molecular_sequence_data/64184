The zzso proteins make up a major branch of the Ras zzso of small zzso To date, 22 human genes zzso at least 25 proteins have been zzso The best known zzso members are zzso zzso and zzso zzso related zzso of these three proteins have not been studied as zzso in part because it has been assumed that they are functionally identical to their zzso zzso This now appears not to be the zzso Variations in zzso modifications and zzso targeting cause otherwise highly zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to exhibit surprisingly divergent biological zzso Whereas the classical zzso zzso are regulated by zzso zzso other zzso zzso are also regulated by other mechanisms, particularly by zzso zzso Newer members of the family possess additional sequence elements beyond the zzso domain, which suggests they exhibit yet other mechanisms of zzso
