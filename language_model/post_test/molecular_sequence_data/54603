We have previously demonstrated that the release of zzso E virus zzso from infected cells depended on zzso zzso which zzso one or two zzso zzso To zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso protein during zzso zzso five zzso zzso derived from an infectious zzso 3 zzso clone of zzso that can grow efficiently in zzso cells were zzso Four zzso including zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso acids in the authentic zzso motif are zzso and zzso (the changed zzso acid in the additional zzso motif is zzso generated zzso as efficiently as the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso level in the culture zzso of zzso zzso cells was significantly lower than in cells zzso with the zzso zzso similar to an zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso with no intact zzso motifs banded at zzso g zzso in zzso and was captured by zzso but not by zzso with or without prior treatment with zzso zzso sodium zzso The absence of the zzso protein on the zzso particles in the culture zzso was confirmed by Western zzso despite the expression of zzso protein in the zzso cells, as detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso at least one of the two intact zzso motifs in the zzso protein is required for the formation of zzso zzso particles possessing zzso proteins on their surface, thus suggesting that the zzso motif plays a role as a functional domain for zzso zzso
