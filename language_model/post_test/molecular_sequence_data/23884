zzso and primer design for single zzso zzso zzso detection can be very challenging for zzso zzso targets, requiring long sequences with lower specificity and stability, while zzso DNA targets present limited design options to lower zzso sequences zzso We have developed the zzso Eclipse zzso System, which is composed of the following zzso zzso Eclipse zzso and zzso specially developed software for the design of zzso and zzso a unique set of modified bases and a Microsoft Excel zzso for automated zzso which ably zzso in large part, this zzso zzso zzso Eclipse zzso are modified zzso containing zzso attached zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is a trademark of zzso zzso zzso zzso which has the combined properties of allowing the use of short sequences and providing great mismatch zzso The zzso zzso prevents probe degradation during zzso chain reaction zzso allowing the researcher to use real time zzso zzso zzso can be accurately measured by a zzso zzso melt curve zzso Using zzso Eclipse zzso and zzso containing modified bases further enhances the analysis of difficult zzso zzso zzso or zzso sequences can be zzso to analysis due to zzso base zzso zzso of normal G with zzso modified G prevents zzso base zzso allowing both superior zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso The use of modified A and T bases allows better zzso by significantly increasing the zzso of the zzso zzso A creates zzso base pairs that have a stability slightly lower than a zzso base pair, and modified T creates zzso base pairs that have a stability about 30 per cent higher than the unmodified base zzso Together, the modified bases permit the use of short zzso providing good mismatch discrimination and zzso that allow zzso of zzso zzso The combination of zzso Eclipse zzso and zzso enriched with the zzso zzso and modified bases has allowed the analysis of zzso zzso where other methods have zzso
