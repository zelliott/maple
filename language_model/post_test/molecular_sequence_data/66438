zzso dynamics simulations of the zzso zzso zzso interacting with a model zzso membrane have been used to investigate the mechanism by which zzso peptides zzso Multiple copies of the zzso were randomly placed in solution close to the zzso The zzso readily bound to the zzso and above a certain zzso the zzso was observed to zzso induce the formation of a zzso zzso shaped pore in the zzso In sharp contrast with the commonly accepted model of a zzso zzso only one zzso was typically found near the center of the zzso The remaining peptides lay close to the edge of the zzso maintaining a predominantly parallel orientation with respect to the zzso
