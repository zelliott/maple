A zzso zzso domain, derived from a T cell zzso that recognizes an zzso type II collagen zzso was used to zzso against zzso arthritis in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain comprises zzso gene segments and is representative of the V alpha zzso expressed by zzso T cells in this disease zzso zzso of mice 28 days before type II collagen zzso zzso with this V alpha zzso domain resulted in a significantly decreased zzso of arthritis in zzso mice, in contrast to vaccination with a V alpha zzso alpha 40 domain derived from an zzso T cell zzso specific for zzso Disease blockade is accompanied by a reduction in T and B cell responses to both the zzso bovine zzso and the zzso zzso zzso V alpha 4 and V alpha zzso zzso were found to be highly zzso in zzso mice, inducing both T cell proliferation and the production of V alpha specific zzso indicating that the vaccination effect of V alpha zzso is zzso This is the first report of V zzso zzso in an zzso disease model and demonstrates the potential use of zzso zzso vaccines in the treatment of zzso diseases that involve zzso zzso T zzso
