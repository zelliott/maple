zzso of breast tissue zzso levels could provide a powerful method to predict the risk of developing breast cancer but obtaining sufficient amounts of tissue from women is difficult from a practical zzso Assessment of zzso in zzso zzso fluid or fine needle zzso from breast might provide a surrogate marker for tissue zzso levels but highly sensitive methods would be zzso These considerations prompted us to develop an zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso which is up to one million fold more sensitive than standard zzso zzso We initially validated this zzso using multiple zzso from the zzso transgenic mouse and found that zzso of variation for measurement of replicate samples averaged less than zzso We demonstrated a zzso enhancement in zzso message in the transgenic versus the wild type mouse breast but surprisingly, levels in the transgenic animals were highly zzso ranging from zzso to 27 relative zzso The zzso of zzso expression in the transgenic breast did not correlate with the degree of breast development and did not appear to relate to hormonal manipulation of the zzso promoter but probably related to lack of exhaustive zzso and mixed zzso of transgenic zzso zzso validation in mouse zzso provided confidence regarding the zzso in human zzso since nearly identical methods were zzso The human zzso was sufficiently sensitive to detect zzso in a single human zzso zzso cell, in all breast zzso measured, and in zzso zzso zzso zzso
