The translation initiation of zzso coli zzso is known to be facilitated by a zzso element upstream of the initiation zzso called the zzso zzso zzso This sequence complementary to the 3' end of 16 S zzso enhances the formation of the translation initiation complex of the 30 S zzso zzso with zzso It has been debated that a zzso element called the downstream box downstream of the initiation zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso formation of the translation initiation complex; however, conclusive evidence remains zzso Here, we show evidence that the downstream box plays a major role in the enhancement of translation initiation in concert with zzso
