The zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from the violet root rot zzso zzso zzso and zzso The promoter region contains a zzso box, zzso box, and zzso zzso The gene is interrupted by eight zzso and is predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The putative zzso acid sequence of the zzso product of zzso gene from zzso zzso shows high zzso to the other known zzso genes and is zzso identical to the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso Three zzso clusters associated with the zzso centers involved in electron transport were particularly well zzso One of these clusters contains a critical zzso zzso implicated in zzso sensitivity in the zzso Only one copy of the gene was present in the zzso of zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso analysis of zzso expression showed that the zzso gene was transcribed in potato zzso zzso
