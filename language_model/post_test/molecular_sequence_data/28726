zzso diverse clones of the partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were collected from the symbiotic microbial communities in the guts of six zzso species without zzso Combined with the sequences reported zzso a total of thirty zzso of the zzso were identified and classified into five zzso zzso One that was comprised of the zzso from a single zzso species was related to the zzso zzso Two were clustered each with some cultured zzso zzso of which have not been clearly defined zzso The remaining two clusters had no zzso representatives, suggesting the presence of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso From these sequence data, we designed a specific primer for the zzso zzso which was successful in the zzso zzso length zzso analysis to detect the zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso
