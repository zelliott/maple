Genes of the Sox family zzso zzso zzso zzso group box containing zzso factors, which play key roles in various events of zzso zzso In this study, we identified 15 zzso genes by searching for the zzso group domain in the zzso zzso and by zzso chain reaction using zzso designed from the results obtained from zzso protein zzso All zzso zzso genes except a novel zzso zzso zzso are zzso in 5 groups as zzso 4 zzso genes in group zzso 3 zzso genes in group D and zzso zzso 2 zzso genes in group C and zzso respectively, while no zzso genes were found in groups A, G, zzso I, and zzso The zzso zzso does not fall within any of the previously defined groups zzso Here we have assigned it to a new group zzso Together with the Sox protein sequences of other species, the zzso relationship was analyzed and zzso Our findings point to recent zzso gene loss, zzso and divergence occurring during the evolution of zzso and zzso zzso The expression pattern shows that zzso genes play a variety of roles in the early embryonic development of zzso
