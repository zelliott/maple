The frequency of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was investigated in plasma cell zzso zzso zzso from 128 patients were selected for this zzso 30 zzso zzso of zzso significance, 8 solitary zzso 77 multiple zzso zzso and 13 plasma cell zzso zzso A zzso experimental approach was zzso All samples were screened for zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments displaying an altered zzso mobility were further studied by direct sequencing to confirm and characterize the nature of the zzso Ras zzso are not randomly distributed because they are zzso only in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, 13, and 61 and zzso zzso 12 were found to be zzso but zzso zzso 61 zzso was the most frequent finding zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso were found in zzso and in a subset of zzso characterized by zzso disease and adverse zzso zzso Furthermore, based on our findings, it is possible to speculate that zzso zzso represent a late molecular zzso in the process of zzso zzso
