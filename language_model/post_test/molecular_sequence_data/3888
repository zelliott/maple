zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso outgrowth in a variety of zzso cell lines through the zzso of protein zzso A zzso We show here, using both zzso zzso embryonic zzso culture and intact zzso zzso zzso that the nerve zzso action of zzso is zzso in part by the zzso of zzso at a single zzso acid zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso that prevents zzso at this site, or introduction of zzso zzso directed against this site, decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso mimicking zzso zzso at this site increased zzso zzso both under zzso conditions and in the presence of a zzso zzso These results provide a potential molecular approach for stimulating zzso zzso after injury and in neurodegenerative zzso
