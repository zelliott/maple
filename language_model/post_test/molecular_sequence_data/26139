A zzso acid zzso probe which specifically zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso malaria has been derived from a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso This probe, zzso consists of zzso zzso pairs and does not zzso with up to 6 zzso of human or zzso zzso zzso zzso contains at least two copies of a 205 base pair repeat zzso The zzso repeat probe, zzso reacted with 73 of 76 microscopically diagnosed zzso zzso samples but not with any of 17 human DNA samples or any of 8 zzso zzso DNA samples from cultured zzso It was possible to detect zzso zzso in mixed infections in which only zzso zzso zzso were identifiable by zzso This zzso zzso DNA probe provides a useful zzso tool for malaria control zzso
