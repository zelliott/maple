Two zzso zzso at the zzso zzso locus zzso and zzso were analyzed by determining zzso structures at different zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of the affected zzso regions, and direct sequencing of the resulting zzso DNA zzso zzso adults and larvae accumulate abundant zzso zzso (adult) and zzso zzso transcripts that are shorter than transcripts in zzso flies by a zzso located in the second zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the amplified DNA region showed that zzso contains a zzso zzso deletion that removes 23 zzso acids near one border of the second zzso zzso with these findings, we observed a shorter zzso protein present at only zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso adults and larvae accumulate much smaller amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso have an identical aberration in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the amplified zzso DNA region showed that zzso contains a zzso deletion that removed and rearranged DNA at the zzso zzso junction of the zzso zzso No zzso zzso material is detected in zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso are present zzso and within the zzso DNA zzso The patterns of DNA deletion and deletion accompanied by sequence addition at the zzso sites suggest a slipped zzso mechanism during DNA replication or repair that involves local DNA zzso
