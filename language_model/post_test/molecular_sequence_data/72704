An zzso zzso gene was isolated from zzso zzso on a approximately zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a protein of 521 zzso acids with extensive sequence similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and various other zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso sequence characterized in the zzso sequencing project, the open reading frame of the zzso zzso zzso gene is interrupted by a small zzso zzso zzso with typical zzso boundaries and a consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are detected in both the zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso as judged by Northern zzso Growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells is inhibited at 1 zzso of zzso acid zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso per zzso whereas zzso hosting a zzso with the zzso gene are resistant to zzso levels of up to at least 40 zzso The resistance of cells to zzso is gene dosage dependent and suggests that zzso can be used as a dominant selection marker in zzso zzso
