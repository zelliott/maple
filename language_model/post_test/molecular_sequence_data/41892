A zzso transition is the single prevalent zzso representing zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that causes zzso zzso We and others previously devised a molecular method for the detection of the zzso zzso that involves zzso coupled with zzso zzso The method has been widely zzso However, when used for the analysis of dried blood samples, it sometimes produced ambiguous results with weak target bands in the presence of numerous artifact zzso An improved version of the method has been developed here, involving two stages of amplification using two different sets of zzso In the first stage, the entire zzso was zzso A small zzso (5 zzso of the first zzso products were directly used as a template for the second zzso zzso The second zzso is similar to the original method, but zzso a pair of zzso encompassing a smaller section within zzso The upstream primer incorporates a substitution at zzso so that a zzso site involving zzso is introduced in the copies of the zzso zzso as in the original zzso zzso The improved zzso method produces an intense target band with a very high sensitivity, yet devoid of artifacts, providing clean, unequivocal zzso
