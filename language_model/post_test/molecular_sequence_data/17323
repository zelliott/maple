By zzso zzso and screening of mouse zzso zzso library, we have identified seven zzso from the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso alpha and probably beta are likely involved in zzso DNA zzso Other zzso have distinctive zzso zzso zzso zzso and iota form a zzso zzso while zzso delta contains zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and small open reading frame zzso identical to zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso structures revealed unusual zzso organizations: the first three zzso of delta and the first zzso of zzso are respectively mapped to the zzso locus on zzso 2 and the zzso locus on zzso 10; the remaining zzso of both zzso are mapped to the zzso locus on zzso zzso The first zzso of zzso beta is located on zzso 16, while the others are located on zzso zzso zzso of these zzso is assumed to require zzso zzso alone zzso and zzso or in combination with zzso zzso Most zzso zzso zzso are mainly expressed in zzso but a small amount of each zzso except for zzso is also expressed in brain, heart, zzso zzso and embryonic zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso fusion experiments showed that all the zzso are zzso and most of those proteins are localized to a particular zzso zzso It also appeared that expression of zzso delta zzso cell zzso This study suggests that the dynamic zzso zzso zzso generates functional diversity of the mouse zzso zzso
