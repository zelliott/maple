zzso (also called zzso 3) is the skeletal zzso zzso and is considered to be a zzso zzso in various cellular zzso Analysis of zzso at the protein level is an urgent issue because the loss of zzso zzso activity causes zzso muscular zzso type zzso In this study, we zzso characterized one alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks two of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso which has hardly been studied zzso due to its zzso zzso and apparently zzso zzso activity, zzso was zzso expressed in zzso and insect zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso activities and an inhibitor spectrum similar to those of the conventional zzso However, zzso did not inhibit zzso and is a zzso for zzso which is consistent with the properties of zzso presenting zzso as a possible regulator of the conventional zzso zzso We also established a zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso using the zzso sequence specifically to measure zzso zzso This method detects the activity of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that it has potential to evaluate zzso activity in zzso and in the diagnosis of zzso muscular zzso type zzso
