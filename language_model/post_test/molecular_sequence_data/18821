The zzso zzso zzso lineage zzso zzso was identified recently as an essential checkpoint in the programmed necrosis or zzso cell death zzso In the present study, we report the crystal structure of the human zzso zzso domain at zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso resolution and probe its zzso mechanism by performing zzso zzso By comparing the structures and zzso zzso of human and mouse zzso zzso the present study provides insights into the evolution of zzso mechanisms among zzso and their zzso divergence from conventional zzso active protein zzso
