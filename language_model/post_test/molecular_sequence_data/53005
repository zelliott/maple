zzso zzso fragments corresponding to putative cellulose zzso genes zzso were inserted into potato virus X zzso for functional analysis in zzso zzso by using zzso gene zzso Plants infected with one group of zzso had much shorter zzso zzso small leaves, and a zzso zzso zzso with a loss of cell wall zzso zzso large and in many cases zzso cells ballooned from the zzso of leaves, particularly in regions adjacent to vascular zzso zzso analyses of wall zzso prepared from infected leaves revealed a zzso decrease in cellulose zzso zzso levels for at least one member of the zzso cellulose zzso gene family were lower in infected zzso The decrease in cellulose content in cell walls was offset by an increase in zzso in which the degree of zzso of zzso groups decreased from approximately 50 to approximately zzso The results suggest that feedback zzso zzso the cellular machinery controlling cellulose and zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso features of the infected plants, changes in wall zzso and the reduced abundance of zzso zzso we concluded that the zzso fragments silenced one or more cellulose zzso zzso
