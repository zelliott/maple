The role of the zzso zzso of zzso together with the zzso zzso properties of zzso in solution, in the process of zzso interactions was zzso The natural zzso and the synthetic zzso containing the zzso and zzso groups as the zzso zzso respectively, were used in binding experiments to rat zzso zzso zzso Regardless of the cell culture conditions, such as the presence of absence of fetal calf serum, the association of zzso to the cells was much greater than that of zzso zzso was present in the incubation medium as zzso After zzso a large part of the total zzso associated to cells, zzso depending on the experimental conditions, was removed by washing with protein zzso The remaining associated zzso was not removed by repeating washing with protein solutions or zzso treatments and was considered as a component of the zzso The cell association of zzso present in solution as zzso as well as zzso could be classified as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso form of association, corresponding to the molecules zzso inserted into the zzso was zzso higher, the proportions varying with increasing incubation time and decreasing zzso zzso This form of association was particularly high when incubation was performed in the presence of fetal calf zzso zzso experiments performed with a mixture of zzso and zzso in a zzso ratio which allowed their presence in the medium as zzso as well as mixed zzso led to a zzso association suggesting that besides the zzso properties of the zzso other zzso properties are involved in the zzso interaction zzso
