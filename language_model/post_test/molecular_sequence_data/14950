Human zzso zzso is one of several proteins known to cause zzso zzso zzso changes in its native structure result in zzso of the zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins comprise a protein family of zzso zzso with structural similarity to zzso In this study, we tested the zzso properties, if any, of sea zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso protein zzso which share zzso and zzso sequence identity, respectively, with zzso We obtained zzso structures from all three proteins under various conditions, but, interestingly, different structures displayed different zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed thin, curved zzso at low pH zzso zzso that bound zzso zzso but did not stain with zzso Red zzso zzso zzso formed at the slightly higher pH of zzso had different zzso displaying predominantly zzso zzso zzso material of zzso was found in this material, in agreement with previous zzso zzso remained soluble at pH zzso at ambient zzso By raising of the temperature, zzso formation could be induced at neutral pH in all three zzso Most of these zzso zzso were thicker and zzso than the in zzso zzso seen at low zzso In other words, the zzso zzso were more similar to zzso seen in zzso The melting temperature of zzso was zzso degrees zzso This is approximately 30 degrees C lower than the melting temperatures of zzso and zzso Information from the crystal structures was used to identify possible explanations for the reduced zzso of zzso
