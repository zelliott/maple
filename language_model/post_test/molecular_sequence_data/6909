A family of proteins called zzso was discovered that compete with zzso but not zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso I and II are highly zzso zzso proteins that are tightly zzso with zzso identity among zzso zzso and human zzso zzso They are enriched in zzso where they zzso with zzso and zzso in addition, zzso II is expressed zzso at low zzso zzso bind zzso to zzso alone and not at all to zzso and zzso but strongly to the zzso zzso complex composed of these three zzso They compete with zzso for binding to the core complex but not with other interacting zzso including zzso I, suggesting that the zzso regulate the sequential interactions of zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso during zzso
