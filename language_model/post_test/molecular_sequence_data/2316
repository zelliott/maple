zzso of zzso and protein from the human zzso zzso zzso gene region zzso units zzso to zzso was analyzed at early and late times after zzso The level of zzso present at late times zzso to 72 h after zzso was significantly higher than that present at zzso times (5 h after zzso The profile of zzso zzso in the zzso of infected cells was different from that previously reported on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Witte, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso zzso major zzso region 1 zzso which codes for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso region 2 zzso spliced zzso which codes for the zzso zzso zzso may be zzso associated with zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which codes for an zzso zzso may be zzso zzso This zzso was abundant in the zzso under zzso conditions but was not present on zzso in significant zzso This indicates that zzso gene products may be involved in zzso control of zzso zzso At late times, new zzso takes place within region zzso A zzso zzso is transcribed from a late promoter in region 2 that apparently does not function in cells infected with zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso gene region is transcribed throughout infection and that multiple levels of regulation zzso
