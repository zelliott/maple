A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is the cause of Hunter syndrome zzso type zzso Here, we report a study of the human zzso locus at zzso An unexpected finding was an zzso region zzso which is located on the zzso side of the zzso gene within 80 zzso We have identified sequences in this locus that are zzso to zzso 2 and 3 as well as sequences zzso to zzso 2, 3 and 7 of the zzso zzso The zzso 3 sequences in the zzso gene and in the zzso locus showed zzso zzso The overall identities of the other identified regions were zzso A locus for zzso was also found to be located close to zzso The existence of the zzso locus zzso the diagnosis of zzso in zzso DNA from patients with Hunter zzso However, information about the zzso locus makes it possible to analyze the zzso gene and the zzso locus separately after zzso zzso
