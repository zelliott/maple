To determine whether zzso or zzso zzso is responsible for zzso stimulation of rat liver zzso formation, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were carried out with zzso coli and rat liver zzso and their respective zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation was observed only when zzso from the rat liver was zzso zzso bound to rat liver zzso but not to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso formation revealed that zzso increased the zzso and zzso values for rat liver zzso The zzso value for zzso and zzso did not change significantly in the presence of zzso Furthermore, higher zzso of rat liver zzso tended to inhibit zzso formation if zzso was zzso zzso restored zzso zzso exchange in the presence of rat liver zzso an inhibitor of this zzso The zzso sequence of rat liver zzso was determined and compared with that of zzso coli zzso zzso in zzso sequences of the two zzso were observed mainly in the zzso and zzso zzso Limited zzso zzso zzso of the zzso rat liver zzso showed that both the zzso and zzso stems were structurally changed by zzso and that the structural change by zzso was different from that by zzso The influence of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso was different from that of rat liver zzso The results suggest that the interaction of zzso with the zzso and zzso stems may be important for zzso stimulation of rat liver zzso zzso
