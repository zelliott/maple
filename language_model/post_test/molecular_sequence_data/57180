The zzso G binding site in the zzso regions of human complement zzso zzso has been investigated by chemical modification of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Only the modification of zzso zzso with zzso fulfills the requirements of a specific modification without unwanted side zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso with zzso results in loss of immune complex recognition without affecting the binding of zzso to form zzso The gross structure of zzso is not changed by zzso treatment, and immune complex binding is restored to zzso of the control upon zzso zzso zzso zzso and isolation of the modified peptides indicate that the modification by zzso of 4 to 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to interact with immune zzso These zzso define two areas (and possible binding sites for zzso on the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso exposure zzso studies favor site 2 as the zzso G binding site on the zzso regions of zzso although the participation of site 1 cannot be ruled zzso
