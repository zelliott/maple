A zzso derived from the intervening sequence zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso + G in equilibrium with zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso This reaction is analogous to the first step in zzso of the zzso with the product zzso analogous to the zzso The following zzso conclusions have been derived from zzso and zzso kinetic zzso at 50 degrees C and neutral pH in the presence of 10 zzso zzso The value of zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso with zzso G represents zzso zzso This rate constant for binding is of the order expected for formation of a zzso duplex between zzso zzso and zzso analyses have shown that this zzso is recognized by base pairing to a complementary sequence within the zzso The value of zzso zzso zzso zzso represents zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The product zzso zzso first from the zzso because of this slow zzso for zzso The similar binding of the product, zzso and the zzso zzso to the zzso binding site of the zzso with zzso zzso 1-2 zzso shows that the zzso portion of the zzso makes no net contribution to zzso Both the zzso and product bind approximately zzso (6 zzso stronger than expected from base pairing with the zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso interactions are involved in zzso zzso of zzso and binding of G are zzso These and other data suggest that binding of the zzso zzso zzso and binding of G are essentially random and zzso The rate constant for reaction of the zzso complex is calculated to be zzso approximately equal to 350 zzso a rate constant that is not reflected in the zzso rate parameters with zzso zzso The simplest interpretation is adopted, in which zzso represents the rate of the chemical zzso A zzso zzso reaction zzso by the zzso zzso in the absence of G was zzso the rate of the chemical step with zzso replacing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is approximately zzso slower than that with zzso zzso The value of zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso reaction is only slightly smaller than that with zzso zzso because the binding of the zzso zzso is predominantly zzso in both zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
