zzso zzso in a range of pore sizes, were investigated as zzso acid affinity zzso for the detection of target DNA or zzso sequences using a sandwich zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso derivatives were zzso linked to zzso and zzso supports with greater than zzso zzso zzso These zzso supports were further zzso with zzso zzso to provide zzso supports which show low zzso binding for zzso zzso zzso While all the zzso supports capture complementary zzso with high zzso the pore size was found to be a critical zzso in sandwich zzso zzso The superior zzso characteristics of the zzso support was ascribed to a combination of its zzso nature, zzso and the terminal attachment of its capture zzso
