A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso from the skin zzso of Atlantic zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated using acid zzso and zzso exchange and reversed phase zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso termed zzso was determined by automated zzso degradation and mass zzso to be zzso The zzso zzso group was zzso The theoretical mass of zzso was calculated to be zzso zzso which was in good agreement with the mass of zzso Da determined by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso was shown to be derived from zzso zzso by zzso amplifying the zzso sequences from Atlantic zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed sequence similarity with the zzso zzso zzso I of Asian zzso and the zzso zzso zzso I of zzso Fifty of the zzso zzso in zzso were identical to the zzso region of zzso zzso from rainbow zzso zzso showed strong zzso activity against several zzso and zzso bacteria and activity could be detected down to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso was prepared by zzso zzso synthesis and shown to have the same zzso activity as the natural zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a new zzso zzso zzso found in the skin zzso of Atlantic zzso
