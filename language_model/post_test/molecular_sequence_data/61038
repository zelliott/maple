zzso characterization of a gene often requires the discovery of the full spectrum of its associated zzso zzso in the human zzso gene have been identified in zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We studied the involvement of zzso in additional zzso of digital abnormalities in one family zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso three families zzso zzso and zzso with dominant zzso (with zzso and zzso in the same family), and one family with zzso zzso analysis showed no zzso with zzso zzso Family zzso had a zzso zzso zzso resulting in a truncated protein of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso due to a zzso deletion was found in family zzso resulting in a truncated protein of zzso zzso zzso Family zzso had a nonsense zzso zzso and family zzso had a zzso zzso zzso in a highly zzso zzso acid of domain zzso The patient with zzso had a nonsense zzso zzso These results add two zzso to the zzso spectrum caused by zzso zzso the combined zzso and zzso These zzso do not support the suggested association between the zzso in zzso and the resulting zzso We propose that all zzso associated with zzso zzso be called zzso zzso since the zzso borders of the resulting syndromes are not well defined and there is no apparent zzso zzso
