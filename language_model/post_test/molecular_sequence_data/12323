zzso cells specialized in nitrogen fixation in zzso zzso zzso zzso lose the potential for cell division once fully zzso This suggests that cell division activity is zzso regulated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been shown to play a crucial role in bacterial cell zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were designed to zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso was cloned and used as a probe to isolate the entire zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shares strong similarities with other zzso zzso suggesting remarkable conservation of the zzso protein during zzso An zzso downstream of zzso which would be transcribed in the opposite direction compared to zzso could zzso a zzso with significant sequence similarity to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso for both zzso and the zzso zzso gene did not yield any double zzso either in the presence or in the absence of combined zzso suggesting that both genes are essential for cell growth under these zzso
