zzso receptors bind modified zzso zzso zzso on a zzso domain which possesses a zzso cluster at the zzso zzso We previously constructed a zzso model zzso containing the zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated the zzso specificity of the zzso model zzso It selectively bound zzso and not zzso The binding of zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a manner similar to that of the natural zzso Both zzso and zzso acids inhibit the zzso binding whereas zzso acid did zzso These results indicate that the zzso cluster in the zzso domain has important roles in both zzso binding and zzso zzso
