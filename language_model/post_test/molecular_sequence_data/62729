We describe zzso the cloning of a group of zzso in zzso that are associated with the plasma zzso Initially, multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were designed from sequences of known plasma membrane associated zzso Combined experiments using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso colony zzso and reverse dot zzso yielded three distinct zzso zzso two zzso libraries derived from the zzso central nervous system zzso were screened and four distinct zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from zzso cloned full-length zzso The predicted zzso acid zzso sequences zzso were identical for zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the 265 zzso zzso segments for the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso differed at 13 zzso zzso within this zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained 290 zzso zzso and both contained a zzso domain zzso zzso and a zzso site zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained only the zzso whereas zzso zzso was truncated zzso zzso and had neither a zzso nor a zzso zzso All zzso zzso showed great identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso from various other zzso zzso protection zzso zzso analyses revealed distinctive expression patterns for individual zzso transcripts but all were zzso in the zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso produced against zzso zzso zzso of zzso identified a protein of approximately 35 zzso found only in zzso zzso
