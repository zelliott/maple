zzso zzso is a complicated process, involving numerous zzso base modification and assembly zzso All zzso share the same general architecture, with small and large zzso made up of roughly similar zzso species and a variety of zzso zzso However, the fundamental assembly process differs significantly between zzso and zzso not only in distribution and mechanism of modifications but also in organization of assembly zzso Despite these differences, members of the zzso zzso family and their zzso modification of zzso zzso are found throughout evolution and therefore were present in the last common zzso In this paper we report that zzso zzso from zzso and zzso are able to complement for zzso function in bacteria, both in zzso and in zzso This indicates that all of these zzso can recognize a common zzso zzso and that the recognition elements must be largely unchanged since the evolutionary split between the three zzso of zzso
