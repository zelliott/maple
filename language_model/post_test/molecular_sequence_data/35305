The very zzso domain of the zzso protein is directly located upstream of the zzso zzso zzso plays a decisive role in several important properties of this large protein and in the development of zzso zzso This zzso zzso domain is on the one hand known to markedly increase zzso zzso rates and on the other hand has been shown to be involved in cellular membrane zzso Here, we determined the high-resolution structure of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of its zzso domain in oriented zzso zzso Using two-dimensional solution zzso zzso the low-energy zzso of the zzso were identified in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso In a next step a set of four solid-state zzso angular restraints was obtained from zzso zzso labeled with zzso and zzso at selected zzso Of the zzso ensemble of zzso zzso only a limited set agrees in quantitative detail with the solid-state angular restraints of zzso zzso obtained in supported zzso zzso zzso zzso the solid-state zzso data were used to further refine the domain structure in zzso zzso At the same time its membrane zzso was determined and different zzso regimes of this zzso domain were zzso The pronounced structural transitions of zzso zzso upon zzso result in a zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso up to the very start of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso is aligned nearly parallel to the membrane surface zzso angle zzso and is characterized by a zzso zzso on one side and an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso that run along the zzso face of the zzso This arrangement zzso zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso and possibly with the zzso zzso zzso
