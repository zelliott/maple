Very little is known about the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso we analyzed bacteria associated with three zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which represent typical moss species of three zzso plant communities at the southern Baltic Sea coast in zzso By use of two zzso techniques, zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso DNA, a high degree of moss specificity was found for associated bacterial zzso This specificity could be further evidenced by a zzso approach for the following zzso zzso plate counts of bacteria on zzso zzso zzso proportion of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity as well as spectrum against zzso and zzso diversity and richness of zzso zzso The proportion of zzso with zzso activity against the zzso model fungus zzso zzso was highest for zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A high percentage zzso of zzso zzso bacteria produced zzso zzso The high recovery of zzso zzso strongly suggests that zzso represent an ecological niche which harbors a diverse and zzso largely zzso microbial population with yet unknown and untapped potential zzso applications, zzso for biological control of plant zzso
