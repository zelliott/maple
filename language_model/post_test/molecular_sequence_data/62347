zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the industrial starter strain zzso zzso zzso was generated through zzso transfer by mating zzso with zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso which encodes the genetic zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and for a zzso resistance mechanism of the zzso infection zzso The many significant applications of this strain prompted a genetic analysis of its apparently unstable zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso produced by zzso were associated with the appearance of an zzso zzso designated zzso which was derived from DNA originating from zzso zzso zzso and a resident zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso was shown to be derived from the zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso into zzso The presence of zzso at a high copy number was found to correlate with increased levels of zzso zzso in zzso compared to the zzso containing zzso zzso transfer of zzso into the zzso strain zzso by zzso allowed a direct zzso comparison with zzso also studied in the zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso resistance similar to that by zzso although it was less zzso as demonstrated by a larger plaque size for zzso zzso infection of zzso While this locus is flanked by zzso zzso the sequencing of zzso junction sites established that this event was unlikely to be zzso sequence zzso and most probably occurred by zzso zzso followed by deletion of most of zzso This was not a random zzso as nine other zzso investigated were found to have the same junction zzso Such derivatives of commercial strains producing increased levels of zzso could be exploited as protection cultures for food zzso
