zzso zzso zzso isolated from Thai fish sauce produced numerous zzso zzso zzso Our objectives were to zzso characterize and identify these zzso zzso 

Three major zzso zzso including 19, 34 and 44 zzso were partially zzso and showed maximum activity at pH 8, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed stability at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and were completely inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso The zzso points of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were at zzso zzso and zzso respectively, based on zzso zzso zzso mass fingerprint and de zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso peptides using zzso and zzso respectively, suggested that all three zzso were novel and zzso to zzso zzso 

The three major zzso are a member of zzso zzso zzso exhibiting zzso and zzso characteristics with high stability at zzso zzso 

This is the first report on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with a distinct zzso zzso They showed potential to be a processing aid for food and zzso applications, particularly in high salt zzso
