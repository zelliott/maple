To understand better the organization and linkage of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso we prepared long-range restriction maps of five zzso artificial zzso zzso containing zzso We determined that zzso and zzso are within zzso zzso and that the regions surrounding these genes contain several zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that three of the five zzso clones contain zzso zzso sequences originating from multiple human zzso
