zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso able to grow in media containing aromatic zzso A novel zzso from zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso For the first time, the presence of two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a core zzso these two zzso were found to possess different absolute zzso The structure of the zzso backbone was determined using either alkaline or acid zzso zzso treatment, aimed at recovering the complete zzso zzso was carried out by mild zzso zzso followed by zzso using hot zzso The zzso was also analyzed after acid treatment, attained by mild zzso with zzso acid, to obtain information on the nature of the zzso and zzso zzso The two resulting zzso were isolated by gel zzso zzso and investigated by compositional and zzso zzso by zzso mass zzso and by zzso zzso and zzso zzso These experiments led to the identification of the major zzso structure representative of core zzso zzso All zzso are zzso and zzso if not stated zzso Based on the structure found, the hypothesis can be advanced that zzso zzso are used to block zzso of the zzso zzso This would lead to a less zzso cellular surface, indicating an zzso response of zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso
