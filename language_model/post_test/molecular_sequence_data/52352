zzso growth factor zzso was fused to the zzso end of a modified zzso zzso A that has its toxin binding domain zzso This zzso toxin designated as zzso zzso kills zzso cells through the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used a random zzso approach to make point zzso on zzso followed by replacing the wild type zzso in zzso zzso with these zzso zzso We have constructed 14 different zzso zzso and examined their zzso zzso binding activity as well as their zzso to zzso zzso Our results showed that individual zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso resulted in an increase in the binding affinity to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso On the other hand, individual zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso to Ala in the zzso domain of zzso zzso lead to a decrease in the binding affinity to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso In addition, zzso of any of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the loss of their binding activity to zzso zzso and a corresponding loss of their zzso This study indicates that the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells may be used as an indicator to screen zzso of zzso important in zzso zzso
