zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed from the zzso acid sequence of zzso fragments produced from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the garden snail zzso zzso From the zzso zzso the total zzso or the zzso was zzso Combination of a universal primer with the zzso delivered zzso fragments of about zzso zzso and 280 zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso These fragments were cloned into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The resulting zzso sequence consisted of zzso zzso including an open reading frame of zzso zzso The zzso protein consists of 159 zzso zzso including the putative signal sequence zzso The mature protein should comprise 141 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso in zzso coli resulted in a soluble protein reacting specifically with rabbit zzso raised against the native zzso
