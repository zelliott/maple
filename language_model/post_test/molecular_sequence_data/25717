The 19 zzso acid signal zzso of rat liver zzso zzso possessing a zzso substitution for an zzso and containing 3 extra zzso acid zzso at the C zzso was studied by two-dimensional zzso in a zzso zzso In this zzso environment, the zzso contains two zzso regions, both of which are zzso separated by a hinge zzso The zzso located closer to the C zzso is more stable than is the zzso located near the N zzso This suggests that the zzso face of the zzso zzso is buried within the zzso region of the zzso On the basis of these results a general model for protein zzso is presented in which the zzso zzso zzso of the signal region in the zzso first binds to the zzso membrane and then zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso then recognizes the zzso zzso of the signal region, which is not anchored to the zzso To explain how this signal zzso was imported into isolated zzso in the absence of energy or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a model for signal zzso zzso across a membrane barrier without the need for auxiliary membrane proteins is zzso In this model the faces of the two zzso fold upon each other, resulting in the mutual shielding of positively charged zzso by the complementary zzso face of the other zzso zzso
