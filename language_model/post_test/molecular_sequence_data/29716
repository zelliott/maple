zzso zzso exchange is present in virtually all cells, zzso the exchange of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and, thus, plays an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso cell volume, and zzso zzso zzso Recent transport studies demonstrated the presence of a novel zzso zzso exchange in the zzso membrane of zzso cells of rat zzso zzso We describe the cloning of a zzso full-length zzso from rat zzso colon that encodes zzso zzso acids and has six putative zzso spanning zzso Of the zzso zzso acids 375 zzso acids at the zzso region are identical to zzso exchange zzso zzso with the remaining 63 zzso acids zzso a completely novel C zzso In zzso zzso revealed that this transcript is expressed in zzso zzso cells, whereas Northern zzso analysis established the presence of its zzso zzso in multiple zzso Despite its much smaller size compared with all other known zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this zzso exhibited zzso zzso pH recovery to an acid load that was zzso and inhibited both by zzso an zzso zzso and by zzso acid, a zzso channel blocker, but only minimally affected by 25 zzso zzso an zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso exchange zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso exchange zzso abundance was increased by dietary sodium zzso Based on these results we predict that zzso zzso exchange represents a new class of zzso zzso that may regulate zzso transport in several zzso
