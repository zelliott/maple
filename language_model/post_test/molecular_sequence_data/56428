zzso and precursor B zzso with the capacity of long-term proliferation on zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso can be cloned ex zzso from fetal liver, zzso blood, and zzso and from adult bone zzso zzso in zzso that are similar in different strains of mice and that change with zzso A wave of zzso cells appears before birth and disappears after birth in zzso Up to 2 weeks after birth, high zzso of zzso cells are present in zzso but become zzso at 6 to 8 weeks of zzso In zzso high zzso (1 in 50) of zzso cells are present early after birth, and then decrease continuously to zzso to zzso lower levels at 6 to 8 months of zzso The earliest zzso cells have at least part of their zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso of zzso B cells apparently continue to rearrange zzso to zzso segments on both zzso zzso without zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso are found in fetal liver, while zzso zzso in zzso B cells of zzso and zzso throughout life have zzso zzso At least half of all primary zzso zzso clones develop zzso B cells after differentiation to zzso B zzso zzso pro and zzso B cells are enriched in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell populations of zzso The zzso of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso cell population decrease zzso to zzso during 8 months of life, while those in the zzso zzso population remain constant, although their absolute numbers drop zzso to zzso during that zzso All long-term zzso clones express the surrogate L chain zzso 5 as well as zzso and zzso on all zzso The number of total zzso pro and zzso B cells is at best zzso of the number of cells required to produce the estimated daily output of 5 zzso zzso zzso cells in a zzso This suggests that the production of a relatively constant number of B cells during adulthood may be zzso by zzso which are not zzso on zzso cells and zzso with long-term zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso transplantation experiments indicate that a mouse retains zzso zzso throughout life, from which zzso B and B cells can be generated in old mice in zzso characteristic of young zzso
