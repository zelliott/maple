Nerve growth factor zzso is a zzso factor that promotes the differentiation and survival of certain populations of zzso in the central and peripheral nervous zzso zzso zzso is an alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 complex in which the zzso zzso (the active zzso is associated with two zzso and two zzso zzso which belong to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is an active zzso zzso capable of processing the precursor form of zzso whereas zzso is an inactive zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso could be used as a starting point to design zzso that prevent zzso binding to its zzso as a potential treatment of neurodegenerative zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso zzso shows that the two zzso zzso make extensive interactions with each other around the twofold axis of the complex and have the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bound within their active zzso The zzso zzso of each of the zzso zzso is in an inactive zzso zzso and makes extensive interactions with the zzso zzso The two zinc zzso that stabilize the complex are located at the relatively small zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso 

The structure of zzso zzso shows how the twofold axis of the central zzso zzso organizes the symmetry of this zzso growth factor zzso The extensive surface of zzso buried within the zzso complex explains the lack of zzso activity observed for zzso zzso The regions of the zzso zzso that contact the zzso zzso overlap with those known to engage zzso zzso Two zzso zzso on zzso make multiple interactions with zzso and suggest that it might be possible to design peptides that inhibit the binding of zzso to its zzso
