Two zzso D zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso activities were isolated from zzso zzso There were substantial differences in the kinetic properties of the two zzso zzso towards zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most striking difference was that the higher molecular weight zzso zzso approximately 57 zzso could be activated zzso with a low mole fraction of zzso acid zzso incorporated into a PC zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 273 zzso zzso zzso a tightly associated complex of two zzso one of 42 zzso and the other 20 zzso had a zzso higher zzso toward PC zzso than zzso and was not activated by zzso zzso sequencing of both zzso indicated that both components of zzso were zzso products of zzso The larger component included the zzso segment of zzso and contained the active zzso The zzso of the smaller zzso corresponded to the zzso region of zzso this zzso had no zzso activity by zzso zzso the pH of zzso to zzso followed by zzso of zzso on a zzso Q column at pH zzso separated the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex had about the same specific activity with or without the zzso zzso The lack of PA zzso for the zzso protein and for zzso indicates that an intact zzso region of zzso is necessary for zzso by zzso Furthermore, the mechanism for transmission of the zzso signal requires an intact zzso
