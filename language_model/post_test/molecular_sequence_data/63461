zzso has been found to play roles in many different compartments of the immune system during differentiation of immune cells and development of zzso zzso and during immune zzso The activity of zzso is primarily regulated by a family of structurally related proteins known as the zzso zzso zzso we report the molecular cloning and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the alpha inhibitor of zzso zzso The full-length zzso consists of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso a 313 zzso acids protein zzso zzso number zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso protein zzso possesses the characteristic organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso receiver domain, a central zzso repeat domain, required for its interaction with zzso and a putative zzso sequence in the zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso heart, zzso artery and zzso cells than in small and large zzso and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso identical to human zzso and zzso identical to chicken zzso These results confirm the existence of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and suggest a similar functional interaction between zzso and zzso Based on the results and the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso these studies help to highlight a potentially important regulatory zzso for the study of the related functions in zzso immune zzso
