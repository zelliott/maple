zzso proteins play diverse roles in regulating numerous zzso processes in zzso This study isolated a gene zzso from rice zzso an zzso domain protein and characterized its role in seed zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso acid zzso The transcripts of zzso were increased upon zzso of rice seeds and the increase was markedly suppressed by zzso zzso of seeds with zzso of zzso was less suppressed by zzso than that of zzso seeds, while zzso had greater zzso for zzso of seeds with zzso of zzso by zzso interference zzso than that of zzso zzso The differential response of zzso of the transgenic and zzso seeds to zzso may be accounted for by differences in zzso content among zzso zzso and zzso seeds such that zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso led to lower and higher zzso zzso respectively, than that of zzso seeds in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for zzso synthesis zzso zzso and an increase in expression of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso These findings indicate that zzso plays a regulatory role in the regulation of zzso suppression of seed zzso by targeting zzso zzso
