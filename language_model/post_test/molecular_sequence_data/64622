zzso zzso that are able to sustain multiple rounds of replication may find many zzso However, one critical feature of such zzso is the ability to maintain an intact zzso cassette during repeated rounds of zzso We here report on the stability of a zzso cassette consisting of an internal zzso entry site followed by the enhanced green fluorescent protein coding sequence inserted in different zzso into zzso leukemia virus zzso In two of the zzso the insert was located in the upstream part of the zzso region while in the third construct it was inserted in the 3' untranslated region of the viral zzso Furthermore, in two of the zzso the zzso cassette was flanked by a direct zzso while no such structure flanked the third zzso Our results show that deletion of the zzso zzso cassette is observed for all zzso upon extended cell culture and that the number of replication rounds before zzso are detected can be postponed by decreasing the length of the repeat zzso the zzso zzso
