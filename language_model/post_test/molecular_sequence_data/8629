The expansion of zzso zzso repeats in the translated region of the human HD zzso zzso a protein zzso of unknown function, is a dominant zzso leading to manifestation of zzso zzso zzso disruption of the zzso mouse gene zzso to examine the normal role of zzso shows that this protein is functionally zzso since zzso zzso become zzso retarded and zzso and die between days zzso and zzso of zzso Based on the observation that the level of the zzso zzso cell death in the embryonic zzso a layer expressing the zzso zzso is much higher than normal in the zzso zzso we propose that zzso is involved in processes zzso the operation of an zzso zzso
