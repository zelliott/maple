zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein expressed mainly in bone and zzso and is a member of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, appears to evolve rapidly in comparison with other zzso zzso even though such functionally important molecules usually evolve more slowly than less important zzso The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize an zzso of the zzso gene in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to clarify molecular evolutionary zzso in zzso associated with zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, we analyzed the zzso expression of this gene to zzso its functional change in bone and developing tooth germ in comparison with zzso zzso The similarities of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso to that of the corresponding zzso proteins were low, although they did share several unique features specific to zzso and have similar zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso but only zzso observed in zzso as in zzso These results suggest that zzso has zzso several functions during zzso zzso This indicates that continuity of zzso properties has been more important in maintaining zzso functionality than that of the sequence of zzso acid zzso which has undergone change over the course of molecular zzso
