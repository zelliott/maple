The recently published crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso B was a major breakthrough for structural and functional understanding of zzso containing zzso zzso it opens a new era of research and provides new opportunities to those interested in the zzso and pharmacology of those important drug zzso In particular, it allowed accurate modeling of human zzso A, both proteins sharing over zzso sequence zzso In the present contribution, we zzso the efforts made in order to obtain structural information on the human zzso A, including sequence analysis, secondary structure predictions, and preliminary models obtained by fold recognition and comparative modeling based on proteins sharing low sequence zzso
