A novel bacterial strain, designated zzso capable of degrading a variety of zzso was isolated from seawater of an oyster farm in the South Sea, zzso It was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 25 zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of 2 % zzso zzso A zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso % to the type strains of recognized zzso species and less than zzso % to other zzso named zzso The zzso data concurred with the zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso G and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids of strain zzso were zzso and two unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso properties, together with its zzso zzso enabled strain zzso to be differentiated from the recognized zzso zzso On the basis of the data presented here, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
