The zzso zzso of regulated zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are crystal zzso composed of multiple zzso zzso synthesis involves a series of steps beginning with protein zzso followed by the zzso and precise geometric assembly of the zzso zzso These steps may to various degrees be determined by the cargo proteins zzso A prominent group of zzso zzso in zzso as well as in zzso zzso and zzso cells, are zzso zzso and bind zzso We focused on a protein with these characteristics named zzso lattice protein 1 zzso which represents zzso of total zzso zzso and we have now cloned the corresponding zzso zzso in which the zzso copies of zzso have been disrupted continue to zzso zzso zzso but are nonetheless defective in regulated protein zzso To understand the nature of this zzso we characterized zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the sorting of the remaining zzso proteins appears normal, and they zzso to form a zzso zzso However, the condensed zzso do not demonstrate a visible zzso zzso and are notably different from wild type in size and zzso The cellular zzso zzso arises from failure of the zzso zzso zzso to undergo rapid expansion and zzso after zzso fusion of the zzso and plasma zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso and precise zzso assembly are distinct in their requirements for zzso
