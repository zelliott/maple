The zzso of the dual zzso method to zzso zzso was examined with the aim of establishing a zzso method of zzso diagnosis for human genetic zzso Mouse zzso obtained by in zzso zzso were zzso The zzso gene sequence and the zzso sequence were amplified as the zzso and internal control zzso zzso zzso of as little as 10 zzso of mouse zzso DNA was possible with the dual zzso method, the sensitivity being zzso greater than that of the single zzso zzso The sex was identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso tested at the 16- and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the sex of all four single zzso zzso from zzso zzso agreed in zzso zzso of the specimens tested and zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be zzso The sex of single zzso zzso from zzso at the zzso stage could be zzso After transfer of 13 male and 25 female zzso zzso six viable fetuses were zzso zzso examination showed that all these fetuses were of the predicted zzso zzso of zzso single zzso by the dual zzso method was rapid and reliable, suggesting its feasibility for zzso diagnosis of in zzso zzso human zzso
