The zzso gene cluster zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso is located on the zzso of the producer, zzso zzso strain zzso zzso in a region that zzso to 348 degrees on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso It consists of 10 open reading frames and zzso in addition to the previously described zzso structural gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso coding for zzso involved in zzso modification of the zzso one zzso zzso coding for a zzso with an associated zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a group B ABC zzso that could be involved in producer zzso Additionally, three regulatory genes are part of the gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso a zzso regulatory system which seems to be necessary for the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso which encodes a protein with similarity to response zzso zzso of zzso sets in at early stationary phase (between 8 and 16 h of zzso
