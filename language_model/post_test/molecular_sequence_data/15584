zzso zzso is thought to contribute to a number of inflammatory diseases, hence the development of sensitive and specific zzso techniques to detect zzso zzso zzso in biological samples is highly zzso zzso zzso scanning for zzso zzso of oxidized zzso acid zzso was investigated as a zzso zzso approach to mapping specific zzso in a complex mixture of zzso Using zzso zzso as a model system, it was found that the zzso zzso of oxidized zzso and zzso formed in zzso analysis could not be used as diagnostic zzso zzso to the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso from unmodified zzso Using a double zzso linear zzso trap mass zzso precursor zzso scanning was combined with detection of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso decomposition zzso sequencing to achieve selectivity for the zzso For zzso the zzso zzso at zzso zzso fragmented to yield diagnostic zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso gave diagnostic zzso at zzso and zzso zzso Selective zzso zzso zzso were also identified for zzso and zzso The method was used successfully to map these zzso in a mixture of nine proteins that had been treated with zzso thereby demonstrating its potential for application to complex biological zzso
