The zzso of short spliced leader zzso zzso onto the zzso ends of zzso occurs in a diverse range of zzso In zzso all species so far characterized zzso a zzso zzso spliced leader, zzso as well as zzso that are employed in the resolution of zzso Here we report the identification of spliced leader zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and show that this zzso does not possess a zzso zzso but rather has at least 15 distinct spliced leaders, zzso by at least 19 zzso zzso zzso The individual spliced leaders vary in both size and primary zzso showing a much higher degree of diversity compared to other known zzso zzso In a survey of zzso zzso zzso individual zzso were found to be zzso to a number of different spliced leader zzso These data provide the first indication that the last common zzso of the zzso zzso zzso spliced leader zzso and that the zzso spliced leader, zzso found in zzso zzso evolved after the divergence of the major zzso zzso This discovery sheds important light on the nature and evolution of zzso processing in the zzso
