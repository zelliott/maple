The zzso zzso of zzso A contains a zzso zzso zzso that mediates protein zzso zzso is the only polar zzso acid in this motif with the potential to stabilize the zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso is used to establish a robust protocol for incorporating zzso A zzso peptides into membrane zzso Analysis of the zzso ratio of the zzso zzso I zzso indicates that peptides zzso by zzso dialysis have a zzso orientation with a zzso crossing angle of zzso zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso is used to establish high resolution structural restraints on the zzso and packing of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resonance measurement of a zzso distance between the zzso and backbone zzso zzso of zzso is consistent with a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate close packing zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso group with the backbone nitrogen of zzso across the zzso zzso The short zzso distance places the zzso of zzso within zzso range of the backbone zzso of zzso on the opposing zzso These results refine the structure of the zzso A zzso in membrane zzso and highlight the complementary role of small and polar zzso in the tight association of zzso zzso in membrane zzso
