The gene copies for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were isolated and characterized in both zzso and zzso male sterile zzso zzso Two copies, an intact gene and a truncated zzso were detected in both zzso The accumulated data, based upon a comparison of the sequences (the open reading frames as well as the zzso and 3' zzso zzso of the two zzso copies, both in zzso and zzso zzso indicate that: zzso they differ in their zzso organization and zzso a common zzso zzso containing two copies of an intact zzso zzso served as the origin for the zzso copies of the fertility and zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso intact zzso sequences is assumed to have caused the zzso in the 3' portion of the zzso open reading frame and the generation of the truncated zzso zzso It is thus suggested that the zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso originated from a common zzso zzso zzso zzso
