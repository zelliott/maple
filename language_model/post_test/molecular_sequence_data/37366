zzso is potent zzso inhibitor of an zzso involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso a critical zzso zzso that regulates signal zzso and synaptic zzso zzso Interestingly, a number of genes involved in the regulation of zzso synthesis and zzso are found in regions of the zzso previously mapped in bipolar disorder zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso One is zzso a member of the zzso zzso family that zzso zzso at the zzso position of the zzso ring as part of the zzso synthetic zzso zzso maps to zzso in a region believed to contain a zzso gene for psychiatric zzso zzso of two functional zzso of zzso and the promoter region resulted in the identification of 15 different zzso zzso zzso at a consensus zzso donor site and the promoter region were found in a total of three patients with zzso three with schizophrenia zzso and only one zzso Several common zzso changes and a common single zzso zzso zzso at position zzso in the putative promoter were identified and analyzed in patients with zzso zzso and zzso There was no difference in the zzso distribution in mentally ill subjects and controls for two zzso zzso and zzso both located in the zzso zzso zzso There was, however, a trend toward significance in the distribution of the zzso promoter zzso in bipolar subjects and zzso Although the results of this analysis were modest, considering the zzso of zzso and zzso and the hypothesis that zzso may be caused by abnormalities in genes that regulate zzso phenomena in the brain, the zzso we detected in the zzso gene should be analyzed in a larger data set to help determine their significance in zzso mental zzso
