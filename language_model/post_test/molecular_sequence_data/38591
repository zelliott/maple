zzso twist and zzso are expressed in zzso limb territories of early chick zzso When zzso beads are implanted in chick flank, an zzso limb develops and zzso is zzso activated as early as 1 zzso zzso zzso and twist expression are activated much later at 17 and 20 zzso zzso zzso can also induce zzso but much later, and in this case zzso occurs simultaneously with that of twist and zzso via the zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in leg and wing forming regions, respectively, in a similar pattern to zzso and zzso zzso leads to zzso expression of zzso and zzso as rapidly as zzso expression of zzso but the patterns of zzso transcripts suggest that induction of zzso and zzso gene expression occur via different zzso
