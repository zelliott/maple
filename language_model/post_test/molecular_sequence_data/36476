Experimental data are reported on zzso activity of the synthetic zzso zzso consisting of the two zzso zzso units linked zzso through two or three zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA restriction zzso and zzso analog in the presence of zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso resulted in selective zzso of the DNA at or near the preferred sites for binding of zzso zzso A similar zzso pattern is observed after X-ray zzso of DNA complexes with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso patterns are found to be dependent on the length of the connecting chain between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analog containing three zzso zzso in the connecting chain, but not the analog with a shorter zzso chain, can generate an intense zzso of one of the two zzso chains at a position corresponding to the presumed binding site for the zzso zzso zzso More than 50% of the total DNA can be zzso at this position after X-ray zzso From analysis of the zzso sequences surrounding the preferred zzso site on several DNA fragments we found that the consensus is zzso where N is an arbitrary zzso The zzso zzso of DNA occurs at the second zzso zzso by an zzso from the zzso of the zzso The greatest zzso activity is observed when the zzso ratio of zzso to the zzso analog is equal to zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso species interacts with each other to form a zzso bound to DNA at the zzso zzso To test the zzso of this model we have studied the binding of zzso zzso analog and zzso analog zzso with zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso It is found that binding of zzso zzso analog to the DNA zzso zzso with zzso form of the zzso is a cooperative process for which interactions between the two bound zzso are zzso The zzso zzso is estimated to be on the order of factor zzso Finally, a model is proposed in which a zzso stabilized by zzso zzso binds in the minor DNA zzso
