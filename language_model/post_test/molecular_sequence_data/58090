zzso study the geographical variation of the prevalence of zzso B virus zzso DNA in zzso B surface zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was used to amplify the core region of zzso The zzso was able to detect 10 molecules of a full length zzso zzso zzso applied to zzso negative zzso wax embedded liver samples from Italy, Hong Kong, and the United zzso a geographical variation in the prevalence of zzso zzso was zzso Two of 18 zzso of Italian samples and zzso zzso of Hong Kong samples were positive for zzso while none of the 70 cases from the United Kingdom was positive by zzso zzso zzso by zzso DNA was excluded using a novel method based on zzso zzso One zzso positive case had idiopathic chronic active zzso but the diagnoses in the other three zzso positive cases did not suggest any zzso connection between zzso zzso and liver zzso zzso could be detected in the liver zzso of a proportion of zzso negative zzso The prevalence of such cases is related to the endemic rate of a geographical zzso The use of zzso zzso on zzso wax embedded zzso will be valuable for future studies on the molecular epidemiology of zzso
