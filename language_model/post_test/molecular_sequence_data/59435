Novel zzso zzso or zzso are sought in large pools of random zzso zzso Because of the large number of random positions in an individual pool zzso only a vanishingly small fraction of the possible sequences are actually zzso Even so, increasing the length of the individual pool molecules significantly increases the probability of finding a particular complex zzso Because zzso are typically composed of zzso sequences zzso with regions that can vary in sequence and zzso a longer zzso allows a greater number of possible arrangements of a given zzso zzso increasing the likelihood that it will be present in the zzso Once a zzso motif has been found, rational and irrational zzso techniques can be used to identify related zzso sequences with greater zzso
