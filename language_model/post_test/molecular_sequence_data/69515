zzso zzso has been successfully used as condensing agent for the zzso bond formation in the synthesis of zzso via zzso zzso The mechanism of a zzso component zzso with this zzso has been investigated with the help of zzso zzso zzso It was shown that zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso has no influence on the efficiency of the zzso This zzso is highly zzso zzso and stable on storage at room zzso The effectiveness of zzso zzso in the zzso chemistry has been demonstrated in the zzso synthesis of zzso on zzso 1 and 10 zzso zzso The use of this zzso for the zzso of zzso supports as well as for the synthesis of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and a zzso is zzso
