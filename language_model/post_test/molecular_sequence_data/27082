The cellular prion protein zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso This protein is expressed in the central nervous system zzso and serves as a precursor to the zzso zzso zzso in prion zzso The zzso prion disease is zzso in zzso and whereas zzso exhibits common zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso genetic variation in mouse zzso is zzso Recently the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to resemble zzso both in a central zzso domain and in activity in a toxicity zzso performed in zzso zzso Sho protein levels are reduced in prion infections in zzso zzso by these properties of the Sho protein we investigated the extent of natural variation in zzso 

zzso the case for zzso versus human and zzso zzso we failed to detect significant coding zzso that alter the mature Sho protein in a sample of zzso normal humans, or in diverse strains of zzso However, zzso zzso exhibited 4 zzso zzso and zzso in a series of 5 tandem zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso expansion of zzso zzso to zzso reached zzso of zzso with other zzso including zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins with similar stability and zzso processing in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso coding zzso are a hallmark of the sheep zzso gene and our data indicate a similar situation applies to zzso zzso Whether a common selection pressure balances diversity at both zzso remains to be zzso
