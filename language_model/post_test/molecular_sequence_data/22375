zzso was initially characterized as a zzso zzso zzso associated to zzso a short zzso repetitive element specific of zzso zzso It carried a single zzso that coded for a putative reverse zzso H zzso suggesting that it could be a truncated copy of a longer zzso zzso we report the identification and characterization of a complete zzso long zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso for a zzso a zzso zzso and a reverse zzso H zzso zzso elements were also found in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso On the basis of its reverse zzso zzso zzso was classified as an zzso zzso However, zzso was structurally related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso grouped with the zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso within a major branch of zzso zzso Taken together, zzso structure, the nature of its zzso zzso the unique features of its reverse zzso zzso consensus motif and the fact that it was found in zzso an early branching zzso suggest that zzso may be the closest relative of the founder element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso known up to zzso Our analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso were originated as early in evolution as zzso zzso and suggests that zzso zzso and zzso elements may constitute a third group of zzso distinct from both zzso and zzso zzso
