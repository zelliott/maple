zzso transformation of zzso has relied upon two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso B zzso There is a need for multiple independent zzso zzso since zzso is zzso and experimental sexual crosses are not currently zzso Here we report on the development of two additional zzso zzso zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance to the zzso drug zzso We constructed a set of four analogous shuttle zzso with these four zzso using DNA segments zzso the zzso major H region zzso gene to provide information required for zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were successfully zzso into zzso major, mostly with efficiencies comparable to those observed with previous zzso zzso and zzso zzso The exception was zzso which zzso zzso less efficiently; this may be related to the zzso mechanism of resistance zzso by zzso All four zzso were shown to replicate zzso zzso zzso bearing all paired combinations of zzso zzso were obtained by a second round of zzso These data show that the four markers are functionally independent and in conjunction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso brings the number of zzso markers available in zzso to zzso
