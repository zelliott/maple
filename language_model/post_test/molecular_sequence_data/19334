A zzso zzso extremely zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the saline Lake zzso in Inner zzso zzso It formed small zzso zzso zzso elevated colonies on zzso zzso The strain required at least zzso M zzso and 5 zzso zzso for zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso belongs to the family zzso showing zzso % similarity to the type strain of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso % zzso respectively, to the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Polar zzso analysis supported the placement of strain zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies (32 % with zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso allowed strain zzso to be differentiated from zzso zzso A novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore proposed to accommodate this zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
