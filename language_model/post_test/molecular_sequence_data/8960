Changes in zzso gating represent a common zzso mechanism for genetically inherited zzso such as benign familial zzso zzso or peripheral nerve zzso caused by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in channel zzso dependence are most often zzso from zzso current zzso a technique unable to provide a detailed assessment of the structural zzso underlying channel gating zzso by contrast, gating currents directly measure zzso displacement during zzso zzso In this work, we describe zzso and gating current zzso together with molecular modeling and zzso simulations, from channels carrying zzso responsible for benign familial zzso zzso and/or peripheral nerve zzso zzso channels, highly related to zzso channels both functionally and zzso were used for these zzso The data obtained showed that zzso affecting charged zzso located in the more zzso portion of zzso decrease the stability of the open state and the active zzso domain zzso but do not directly participate in zzso zzso whereas zzso affecting a zzso zzso located more zzso in zzso caused zzso of zzso currents at zzso zzso These results reveal that distinct molecular mechanisms zzso the altered gating behavior of channels carrying zzso zzso at different zzso domain locations, thereby expanding our current view of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
