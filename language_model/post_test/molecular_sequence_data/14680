Previously, we found that the zzso of 42 out of 198 mouse zzso zzso which are distributed among all zzso except the Y zzso changed from zzso to zzso zzso in a genetically modified zzso mouse zzso In this study, we further examined whether zzso also relates to the zzso zzso in gene knockout zzso mouse zzso The same 42 zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso in 29 zzso zzso mouse strains via short tandem sequence repeat zzso scanning and direct sequence cloning to justify zzso zzso The zzso and 129 mouse zzso from which these 29 zzso mice were zzso were chosen as the background zzso The results indicated that 10 out of 42 zzso zzso showed zzso in some of these mouse zzso Except for the zzso repeat locus of zzso which had zzso zzso in strain number 9, the core sequences of the remaining 41 zzso were zzso repeats, and 9 out of 41 zzso showed zzso among detected mouse zzso However, 11 out of 29 zzso zzso mice strains were recognized as having zzso The popular zzso motifs in zzso were zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso and zzso repeats were zzso zzso According to cloning sequencing results, 6 zzso mouse strains showed insertions of zzso whereas 1 showed a zzso Furthermore, 2 zzso zzso and zzso revealed zzso in 2 zzso and mouse strain number 9 showed zzso in two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these results indicated that zzso zzso were present in the examined zzso zzso zzso
