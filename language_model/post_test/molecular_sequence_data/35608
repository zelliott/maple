A zzso zzso in zzso growth factor 1 zzso promoter was associated with zzso variation of circulating zzso zzso Previously, we reported that such association was due to variation of zzso unit in a linkage zzso block composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of an interaction between zzso In this study, reporter zzso were performed to investigate the regulatory effect and interaction of genetic zzso on gene zzso We used an in zzso system to compare the zzso activities of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso region of zzso zzso In zzso zzso a longer zzso had a lower zzso activity zzso zzso zzso for 17 repeats and zzso zzso zzso for 21 zzso whereas in zzso zzso such trend could not be observed, as the zzso with 21 repeats had the highest zzso activity zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso and zzso affected the zzso activity of each other, there may be an interaction between them in the regulation of zzso zzso For the first time, we demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso could act as a functional unit and interact with zzso in the regulation of zzso in human zzso
