We describe here the development of a zzso transformation method for zzso a zzso plant of major zzso zzso zzso from zzso tissue of zzso max have been successfully transformed by zzso The transforming DNA carries a zzso resistance gene zzso under the control of tobacco zzso regulatory expression zzso flanked by two adjacent soybean zzso sequences allowing its targeted zzso between the zzso gene and the zzso zzso All generated zzso resistant plants were zzso and no remaining wild type zzso copies were zzso No spontaneous zzso were zzso The transformation efficiency is similar to that of tobacco zzso All zzso zzso plants were fertile and zzso progeny was zzso zzso zzso showing the stability of the zzso zzso This is the first report on the generation of fertile zzso zzso
