The ability to make informed decisions on the suitability of alternative marker zzso is central for population and zzso zzso This issue was addressed using zzso zzso as a model population by generating zzso sequence data from 33 gene fragments in a representative sample of 30 zzso zzso the data with pre-existing zzso sequence typing data, an zzso tree based on approximately zzso zzso of sequence was reconstructed and the goodness of fit of each individual gene tree was zzso No strong association was noted between gene function per zzso and zzso zzso but it is suggested that candidate zzso should possess at least the average degree of zzso diversity for all genes in the zzso In the case of zzso zzso this threshold is zzso % mean zzso zzso
