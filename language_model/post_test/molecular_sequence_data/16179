The expression of the gene for the zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso is induced in response to zzso growth factors, and zzso zzso In this report we show that the zzso of zzso zzso after zzso disease virus induction is caused by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the sequences of zzso and zzso clones along with zzso protection and primer extension analyses revealed that the zzso zzso gene possesses multiple cap sites and that the zzso 1 consists exclusively of zzso zzso We observed that DNA regions analogous to those found upstream of the zzso zzso genes are present within zzso 1 of the zzso zzso To investigate the possible role of zzso zzso 1 in gene zzso we used a functional zzso based on the zzso of plasmids in which the DNA segment to be tested is placed in proximity to a marker gene driven by the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso 1 contains DNA sequence elements capable of modulating the activity of a zzso promoter in two different ways: zzso by enhancing zzso expression and zzso by zzso virus zzso These results suggest that zzso 1 may be involved in the zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso
