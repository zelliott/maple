G zzso receptors zzso are important zzso of cell signaling and a major family of drug zzso Despite recent zzso experimental zzso of zzso structures remains a formidable zzso zzso modeling of zzso structures of zzso provides a practical tool for zzso the structural zzso governing the interactions of these important receptors with their zzso The working model of the binding site can then be used for virtual screening of additional zzso that may fit this site, for determining and comparing specificity profiles of related zzso and for zzso design of zzso and zzso The current review presents the protocol and zzso the steps for modeling and zzso the zzso involved in zzso zzso The main stages include zzso modeling the zzso structure using an automated zzso approach, zzso predicting potential binding pockets, zzso zzso known zzso zzso analyzing predicted interactions and comparing with positions that have been shown to bind zzso in other zzso zzso zzso the structural model by zzso
