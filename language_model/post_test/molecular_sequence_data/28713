Three early virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified and localized in the zzso G region zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso to spruce zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that these genes share varied sequence similarity with their zzso in other zzso where they are involved in regulating virus gene expression and DNA zzso zzso motifs characteristic of DNA binding and zzso found in other zzso regulatory genes were zzso in the zzso zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that all three zzso genes were zzso active in virus infected cells and followed the zzso expression pattern of immediate early zzso zzso zzso extension experiments revealed that typical zzso early zzso start sites zzso were used for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two regions of highly repetitive DNA were found in the zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso These sequences are predicted to function as zzso enhancers and viral origins of DNA zzso
