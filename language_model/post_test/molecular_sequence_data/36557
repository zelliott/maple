The structure of the zzso zzso zzso (99 zzso zzso one zzso zzso 10,500 zzso from zzso leaves, has been refined at zzso A resolution to a residual R zzso zzso The space group is zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso b zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso reflections used in the refinement were obtained from a data set recorded on a zzso zzso with radiation from a sealed zzso tube, combined with a data set measured on zzso films exposed at the zzso zzso The final model comprises zzso zzso zzso protein zzso one zzso atom and 110 zzso zzso Nine zzso are described as zzso The zzso zzso from ideal bond lengths is zzso A and the zzso difference between the positions of the C alpha atoms in this refined model and in the structure previously refined at zzso A resolution is zzso zzso The effects of manual model adjustment, resolution, choice of standard values for geometrical zzso inclusion of H atoms and inclusion of zzso corrections on the zzso geometry have been zzso The final values of the zzso bond lengths are: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
