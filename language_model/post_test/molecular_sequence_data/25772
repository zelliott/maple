The binding of the zzso coat protein to synthetic zzso containing one or two coat protein binding sites was characterized by using zzso filter and zzso zzso zzso with two available sites bound coat protein in a cooperative manner, resulting in a higher affinity and reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso strength, and temperature when compared with zzso containing only a single zzso The zzso can contribute up to -5 zzso to the overall binding affinity with the greatest zzso found at low zzso high zzso strength, and high zzso Similar solution properties for the zzso of the related zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso is due to favorable interactions between the two coat proteins bound to the zzso This system therefore resembles an intermediate state of zzso zzso No cooperative binding was observed for zzso containing a single site and a zzso or 3' extension of zzso zzso indicating that zzso coat protein has a very low zzso binding zzso Unexpectedly weak binding was observed for several zzso due to the presence of alternative zzso states of the zzso
