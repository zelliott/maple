The zzso scanning model for zzso initiation predicts that zzso zzso should, as a rule, be zzso However, cases have recently been described of zzso zzso producing more than one protein through alternative zzso initiation at several different zzso zzso The present work reports the occurrence of two zzso start sites on the zzso zzso zzso 2 of the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat and zzso We show that the zzso zzso is able to direct synthesis of not only zzso but also zzso zzso zzso experiments using a zzso zzso directed against zzso detect both zzso zzso in zzso or cell lines expressing only the zzso zzso Thus, the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso must be zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso translation of synthetic zzso zzso demonstrates that both zzso zzso are zzso by initiation at different zzso zzso Furthermore, by introducing zzso to zzso zzso translation from the second zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells with those zzso we are able to correlate the production of zzso and zzso with different zzso start zzso These results lead us to conclude that the zzso zzso is able to produce both zzso and zzso zzso This investigation has altered our understanding of the zzso expression of the zzso protein zzso during development of the central nervous system zzso
