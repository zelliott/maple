Two major protein groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso were used for the screening of the zzso library constructed from zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso clone obtained by screening with an zzso zzso protein zzso had an insert zzso zzso and an open reading frame for a zzso of 268 zzso zzso The analyses of the zzso zzso acid sequence and in zzso translation product suggested that the protein was zzso as a zzso with a molecular weight of 27 zzso and then processed into two mature peptides with a molecular weight of zzso and zzso zzso and an extra zzso with a molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso clones obtained using the zzso zzso protein zzso were highly zzso with each zzso One of them had an insert zzso zzso and an open reading frame for a zzso with 209 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of this clone indicated that the 25 zzso proteins were zzso to the zzso zzso of soybean and winged bean as well as zzso the storage proteins of sweet zzso
