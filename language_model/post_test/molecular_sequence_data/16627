zzso resistance in zzso zzso to zzso zzso was investigated in 25 strains by identifying and sequencing the genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso which code for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso These proteins are involved in zzso salvage and zzso zzso An association between a zzso zzso and resistance to zzso was found within zzso where the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso position 301 results in the replacement of zzso with zzso at zzso acid position 101 in zzso zzso that are zzso for this zzso display increased levels of resistance to zzso whereas zzso zzso have reduced zzso zzso protein modeling of zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso the zzso structure of the zzso which is zzso to compromise optimal zzso zzso A single resistant zzso lacking the above zzso in zzso has a zzso zzso in zzso that results in a zzso substitution at position 28 in zzso zzso
