Studies of the zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso have largely centered on zzso zzso of zzso in particular the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the colonization factor zzso zzso causes illnesses that range from mild zzso to severe zzso zzso These differences in disease severity are not readily accounted for by our current understanding of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso is zzso on a large zzso element of approximately 46 zzso that shares multiple features with previously described zzso coli zzso zzso Further analysis of the region downstream from zzso revealed the presence of several candidate open reading frames zzso in the same zzso orientation as zzso The putative proteins zzso by these zzso bear multiple motifs associated with bacterial zzso zzso An zzso deletion in one candidate gene identified here as zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in marked diminution of zzso of the zzso zzso and lack of fluid zzso in a rabbit zzso loop model of zzso Although previous studies have suggested that zzso coli lacks the capacity to zzso zzso our studies show that zzso release of zzso from the zzso of zzso is dependent on one or more elements zzso on a zzso zzso
