zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a crucial zzso in the de zzso folate zzso zzso The crystal structure is not yet available for this zzso however, zzso model of the zzso reported previously revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso sequences from other zzso reveals two insertions relative to the corresponding zzso in other organisms, zzso zzso and zzso The former encompasses zzso acid zzso zzso while the latter covers zzso zzso In order to investigate the roles of the two zzso we constructed a number of zzso in which parts of these two insertions were zzso zzso of the zzso altered proteins revealed that deletions of zzso zzso in the zzso sequence of the zzso but not that of the zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso A longer deletion zzso zzso in the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso completely zzso both zzso and zzso zzso However, deletion in the zzso sequence from zzso zzso did not disrupt the activities of zzso and zzso but the kinetic properties of the zzso proteins were slightly zzso The importance of zzso sequence on the zzso activities of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso could have implications for development of zzso targeting the zzso region of this zzso important zzso
