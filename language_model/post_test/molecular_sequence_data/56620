Recently we have published a sequence of the coding region of the son zzso containing at least six areas of the tandem repeats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992, zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of several areas of tandem repeats with different zzso sequences of the repeated elements within one and the same gene supports the proposition that zzso zzso of the sequence influences its zzso Here we present a zzso sequence of the son zzso isolated as the result of zzso screening of a human zzso library using the sequence of the son gene as a zzso The comparison of the gene and the zzso zzso sequences shows that the sequence of zzso does not contain five repeated units of an area of the tandem repeats, which are presented in the zzso sequence of the son zzso Because the zzso was probably generated by the reverse zzso transcript zzso to the zzso and so the zzso sequences of the coding region of the gene and the sequence of the zzso were identical at this moment, the differences between the gene and the zzso are the results of their evolution after the generation of the zzso zzso factors, influenced the son gene and the son zzso evolution are zzso
