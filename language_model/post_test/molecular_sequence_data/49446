Clinical zzso requires both zzso of zzso T cells as well as a failure of peripheral tolerance zzso We previously identified one such mechanism that involves regulatory T cells recognizing zzso V beta zzso zzso peptides in the context of zzso How this regulation affects the fate of target V beta zzso T zzso in zzso that mediate experimental zzso zzso has remained zzso The present study using zzso and zzso analysis demonstrates that the expansion of regulatory zzso and zzso T cells in zzso results in zzso depletion of the dominant, zzso basic zzso V beta zzso T cells, but not zzso V beta zzso T zzso The elimination of only activated T cells by this negative feedback mechanism preserves the remainder of the zzso V beta zzso T cell repertoire and at the same time results in protection from zzso These studies are the first in clearly zzso the fate of zzso basic zzso zzso T cells in zzso following zzso
