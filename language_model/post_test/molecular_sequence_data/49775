G proteins are molecular switches that control a wide variety of zzso functions, including zzso zzso zzso cell migration, cell zzso and zzso The ability of zzso to participate in signaling events is determined by the ratio of zzso to zzso forms in the zzso All known zzso exist in an inactive zzso and an active zzso zzso which are zzso by zzso zzso exchange factors and zzso proteins zzso zzso In this study, we identified and characterized a new family of zzso zzso and zzso zzso named zzso zzso contain an zzso Ras zzso domain, called the G domain, followed by a zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso GAP domain, and a tandem zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso analysis indicates that this new family of proteins has distinct cell zzso tissue distribution, and even message zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso have high zzso activity through direct zzso interaction of the zzso G domain and the zzso GAP zzso In the absence of the GAP domain, the zzso G domain has very low activity, suggesting a new model of zzso protein regulation via zzso interaction like the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso leads to changes in cell zzso and zzso of gene zzso
