zzso syndrome of premature zzso separation zzso zzso with mosaic variegated zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso disorder characterized by growth zzso zzso childhood cancer, premature zzso separation of all zzso and zzso for various zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were recently reported in five of eight families with zzso syndrome (probably identical to the zzso zzso We here describe molecular analysis of zzso zzso zzso in seven Japanese families with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in all seven families zzso a zzso deletion zzso in four zzso and a zzso site zzso a nonsense zzso and a zzso zzso in one family zzso zzso derived from the patients with the zzso zzso and the zzso site zzso were significantly reduced, probably due to zzso zzso zzso No zzso was found in the second zzso in the seven families zzso but zzso of zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso indicated a modest decrease of their zzso zzso in the cells from two patients showed both reduced protein expression and diminished zzso zzso Their expression level of zzso a specific zzso of zzso complex, was normal but its zzso association was zzso zzso transfer of zzso 15 zzso zzso into the cells restored normal zzso levels, zzso zzso of zzso and the normal responses to zzso zzso These findings indicate the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso checkpoint zzso and suggest that zzso decrease in expression (or zzso of zzso is involved in the zzso zzso
