The activity of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso varies greatly between individuals because of genetic zzso zzso is involved in the zzso and zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso These drugs are used in the treatment of acute zzso leukemia and inflammatory zzso zzso A total of 29 sequence zzso have been identified so far in the zzso zzso However, most of these zzso are rare and not fully zzso 

In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel zzso sequence zzso originally found in a Swedish man of Italian zzso zzso of the variable number tandem repeats region of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso revealed a zzso transition at zzso zzso causing an zzso acid substitution from zzso to zzso at zzso acid zzso positioned in an zzso approximately zzso from the active zzso This new zzso was found in the patient and in his zzso Both had intermediate zzso activity zzso packed red blood cells and zzso packed red blood cells, zzso and neither carried other zzso in the coding region of the zzso To be able to study this zzso in more detail, the zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, and an zzso characterization of the zzso revealed that the protein was zzso and showed a stronger tendency towards degradation at zzso than the zzso zzso The individuals carrying the zzso zzso had less zzso protein and lower zzso activity in both red and white blood cells compared with a zzso zzso 

We present a detailed zzso and zzso characterization of a novel zzso sequence zzso zzso causing decreased zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso might have an increased risk for developing severe side effects if treated with conventional doses of zzso
