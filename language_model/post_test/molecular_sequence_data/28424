A sequence similarity has been found between two segments of zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine pancreatic zzso A, and zzso zzso a segment of the zzso protein of human immune zzso virus zzso which has been implicated in blocking viral attachment to the T4 zzso The two similar sequences of the acid zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since the X-ray zzso structures of the acid zzso and zzso are known, it has been possible to determine whether the three-dimensional structures of the segments are zzso zzso of both the segments of acid zzso are directly zzso on the structure of the zzso A zzso zzso The fact that the three similar sequences from two completely unrelated proteins give rise to almost identical structures raises the possibility that these segments may be involved in zzso the folding of these zzso In addition, this provides further support for the concept that the zzso sequence of zzso T of zzso which is also similar in sequence to the zzso sequence of zzso A, is also structurally similar to these zzso which adopt a zzso zzso Furthermore, comparison of similarities and differences in the structure of these similar sequences provides an explanation for zzso in the biological activity of various truncated or zzso derivatives of zzso T and additional confirmation of the structural requirements for zzso T in zzso zzso
