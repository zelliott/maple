zzso of the zzso tumor zzso protein has been observed in a large number of human zzso zzso of zzso zzso either growth arrest or programmed cell death zzso The growth arrest function of zzso is zzso by induction of zzso zzso but the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso are still largely zzso To investigate these mechanisms, we have identified six zzso expressed transcripts in a human colon cancer cell line undergoing zzso zzso One of the zzso genes showed significant zzso to zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and is likely to be its human zzso Our results suggest a possible connection between zzso zzso and the production of zzso oxygen zzso
