zzso zzso of the zzso gene family zzso zzso A zzso zzso has been reported as a means for reducing zzso content in cell walls and increasing overall growth rates, thereby improving zzso quality for paper and zzso zzso Using hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we applied this strategy and examined zzso zzso for both effects on wood zzso and tree zzso The reductions in zzso contents obtained correlated well with zzso zzso zzso with a sharp decrease in zzso amount being observed for zzso expression below approximately 50% of the zzso zzso Relatively small zzso reductions of approximately zzso were associated with reduced zzso decreased wood zzso zzso zzso ratios, and a small increase in the level of incorporation of zzso zzso into cell zzso zzso events with less than approximately 50% zzso zzso expression were characterized by patches of zzso discolored wood that had approximately twice the zzso content of controls zzso complex zzso There was no evidence that substantially reduced zzso contents increased growth rates or zzso zzso Our results suggest that the capacity for zzso reduction is zzso below a zzso large changes in wood chemistry and plant metabolism were observed that adversely affected productivity and potential ethanol zzso They also underline the importance of field studies to obtain zzso meaningful results and to support technology development with transgenic zzso
