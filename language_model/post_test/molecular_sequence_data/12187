zzso zzso fate in the zzso eye induced by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso We show that expression of a zzso activated zzso zzso in zzso precursor cells is sufficient to induce zzso fate independent of upstream signals normally required for zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso interacts with the zzso domain protein zzso to promote zzso zzso This interaction is cooperative when both proteins are targeted to the same promoter and is antagonized by another zzso domain zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso a putative zzso target of zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso behaves as a zzso of activated zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso and zzso act on common target genes to promote zzso differentiation in the zzso eye, and that zzso might be such a common zzso
