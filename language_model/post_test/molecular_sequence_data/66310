zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes synthesis and release of sex zzso in zzso We have identified and functionally expressed a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relationships of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso library revealed three putative zzso zzso and zzso sequence comparisons suggest that they are produced through alternative zzso at the zzso zzso amplified zzso zzso from female zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso are highly sensitive to zzso and related zzso especially those sharing the zzso zzso core, zzso zzso S or zzso zzso replacements in the zzso zzso zzso revealed the relative importance of each zzso in the active core as zzso zzso This study provides a framework for the rational design of zzso zzso and/or zzso that could be exploited for disruption of zzso function in zzso important insect zzso
