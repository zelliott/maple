zzso zzso is a zzso processing event in which an internal zzso is excised from a protein precursor and the terminal zzso are then zzso together, resulting in the production of two zzso This report presents direct evidence for protein zzso by demonstrating in zzso zzso of zzso precursor that accumulated when the protein zzso element from zzso DNA zzso was cloned into a foreign zzso In zzso zzso was temperature and pH zzso A slowly zzso species exhibited kinetic properties of a zzso intermediate and was shown to be a zzso zzso by zzso zzso The precursor and slowly zzso species were zzso in response to pH zzso
