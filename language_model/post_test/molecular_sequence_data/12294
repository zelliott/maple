We have developed a transformation system for the zzso zzso zzso A novel strategy was applied to construct the transformation system, since zzso zzso which could be used as hosts for transformation are not zzso A gene zzso the zzso protein zzso was cloned from zzso zzso which is sensitive to zzso and used as a marker gene zzso zzso resistance after modification of its zzso acid zzso The marker gene was constructed by substitution of the zzso zzso at position 56 with the zzso zzso by in zzso zzso as it had been reported previously that the 56th zzso acid zzso of zzso is responsible for the zzso sensitivity of various organisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso DNA coding for zzso of zzso zzso was also cloned and used as a zzso target for the integration of zzso DNA into the zzso which resulted in a high transformation zzso zzso were obtained by zzso with a maximum efficiency of approximately 1,400 zzso per 1 zzso of zzso DNA carrying the gene for zzso resistance and part of the zzso zzso No zzso were obtained with intact zzso Multiple copies of the zzso zzso were integrated into the host zzso by zzso zzso Southern analysis of the zzso in which zzso DNA was integrated at the zzso gene locus indicated that there are two copies of gene for the zzso protein per cell, suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso zzso were obtained from a variety of zzso zzso zzso indicating that this method is zzso to the transformation of other zzso zzso zzso even though there is significant zzso in zzso zzso among these zzso
