Type VI zzso systems zzso are zzso machines of the cell envelope of zzso bacteria responsible for bacterial killing and/or zzso towards different host zzso Here, we characterized the regulatory mechanism underlying expression of the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso gene zzso We identified zzso as the main regulator of the zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the promoter region showed the presence of three zzso zzso which are target of the DNA zzso zzso zzso Using a combination of reporter fusion, gel shift, and in zzso and in zzso Dam zzso zzso we dissected the regulatory role of zzso and zzso zzso We showed that the zzso gene cluster expression is under the control of an zzso switch depending on zzso fur binding prevents zzso of a zzso zzso whereas zzso at this specific site decreases the affinity of zzso for its binding zzso A model is proposed in which the zzso promoter is regulated by iron zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso
