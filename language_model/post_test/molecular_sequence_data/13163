To zzso the effect of an zzso on airway smooth muscle zzso responses and its mechanism of action, we studied canine zzso segments under zzso conditions in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not alter the resting tension or the zzso responses to zzso but zzso the relaxation induced by zzso the zzso of zzso required to produce a zzso effect were decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso by zzso and from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso by zzso This effect of zzso was zzso and was abolished by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso likewise caused a zzso displacement of zzso zzso for zzso but was without effect on those for zzso and zzso Also, zzso did not affect the zzso responses to zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso smooth muscle with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso from 258 zzso 22 zzso tissue zzso to zzso zzso 27 zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso an effect that was abolished by zzso These results suggest that stimulation of zzso zzso specifically zzso beta zzso zzso probably by acting at the site zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
