The gene coding for zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The gene open reading frame was zzso zzso and it codes for zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso showed identity with members of zzso zzso family zzso The zzso had high content of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but low content zzso and Met zzso From the alignment of zzso zzso acid sequence with other zzso zzso family I members, zzso and zzso were predicated as the zzso donor and zzso zzso The zzso program was used to predict the secondary zzso According to the zzso model, the zzso has zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 of the 35 Pro were located at the second sites of zzso zzso interaction, zzso bond, zzso and Pro had important contribution to zzso zzso
