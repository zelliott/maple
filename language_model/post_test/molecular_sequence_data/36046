The V region repertoire of the human zzso response to the type b zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is being defined at the molecular level using zzso zzso from serum of zzso zzso The zzso of this response is restricted to the zzso zzso while the zzso can be divided into two zzso The most common zzso expressed in zzso zzso of adults and usually zzso the majority of a subjects zzso zzso response, is restricted to the product of a single V zzso II gene known as zzso that probably lacks zzso zzso The product of the zzso gene is invariably joined to one of several J zzso products by an inserted zzso at the V zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the restricted nature of the dominant zzso zzso the second category of zzso constitutes a zzso group of at least seven different zzso gene products that often contain zzso zzso and generally exhibit zzso with a related zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso V regions at the molecular level will permit examination of zzso relationships among these clinically important zzso and should make the V region repertoire to zzso a useful model for studying human V gene zzso
