zzso of zzso and circular zzso composed of either zzso or zzso units, with completely matching or partially zzso complementary DNA sequences was zzso Melting experiments revealed considerable differences among the zzso of these hybrid zzso zzso stability and selectivity was displayed by zzso 2 and zzso It was concluded that a linear stretch, attached to zzso of zzso unit zzso increases the selectivity of zzso and stability of the complex as a zzso This allows one to aim the target DNA very precisely at its zzso part as well as at adjacent sequence zzso zzso on termination of primer extension zzso by different zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso 5, composed of zzso appears to be a highly selective and potent inhibitor of replication in zzso Features of zzso zzso composed of zzso seem to be useful for design of highly specific zzso zzso
