Although zzso viruses zzso are endemic among nonhuman zzso zzso infection among humans is zzso Recently, zzso zzso virus zzso infection was reported in 4 of 231 individuals zzso exposed to primates zzso Secondary transmission to spouses has not been seen, suggesting that while zzso is readily zzso humans may represent dead-end zzso Among different zzso species, zzso demonstrates significant sequence diversity within the zzso region of the long terminal repeat zzso and 3' accessory open reading frames zzso To examine if persistent human zzso infection and apparent lack of secondary transmission are associated with genetic adaptations in zzso regulatory regions, we conducted sequence analysis of the zzso internal promoter, zzso and zzso on a tissue culture isolate and peripheral blood zzso cell samples from a human infected with zzso of African green monkey origin zzso Compared to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso internal promoter, and zzso zzso zzso showed sequence zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is not dependent on zzso adaptation to these zzso important zzso However, zzso contains a number of deleterious zzso predicted to result in premature termination of protein zzso zzso codes in part for the zzso zzso fusion zzso proposed to be involved in the establishment of persistent cellular zzso zzso These results suggest that persistent human infection by zzso and reduced zzso may be influenced by the absence of a functional zzso
