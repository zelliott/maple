zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso In the zzso it acts as a zzso in the zzso of zzso the zzso for aromatic zzso acid zzso In the nucleus, it functions as a zzso zzso of zzso and increases the zzso activity of zzso To deepen our understanding of this zzso we characterized its expression in human zzso and zzso Human zzso was present predominantly in liver and zzso with significant amounts in zzso and zzso trace amounts in zzso and zzso levels in whole brain, heart, and zzso It was expressed in all of the cells that were zzso zzso it was also present in the nucleus of zzso cells, which lack zzso and in the zzso of zzso that have little or no zzso The expression of human zzso in the liver and zzso cells was compared at both the zzso and protein zzso Although the zzso level in liver was only fourfold higher than that in zzso and zzso the zzso zzso protein level was zzso higher than that in normal human zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso and 3' untranslated region zzso of human zzso zzso revealed that it has 53 zzso more of zzso zzso untranslated sequence than the published liver zzso In zzso zzso and translation analysis showed that the longer zzso zzso resulted in about a zzso decrease in translation zzso These data show that human zzso is not only present in cells where zzso is zzso or zzso is present but is a widely distributed zzso Its differential expression in different zzso and cells is regulated not only at the zzso level but also at the zzso zzso
