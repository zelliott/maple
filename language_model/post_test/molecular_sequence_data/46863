We investigated the zzso hypothesis of schizophrenia by generating sequences with zzso zzso based on a zzso sequence recovered by Yee et zzso zzso zzso Res zzso from a zzso library from zzso brain tissue from an individual with psychosis in a zzso region zzso that has been tentatively linked to schizophrenia and zzso disorder by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the block of zzso with zzso that was generated by a zzso between the zzso and Homo sapiens we find two zzso zzso and zzso with a high degree of zzso to but not identity with the schizophrenic brain zzso The closest match of these three sequences is to a family of zzso that has evolved from the zzso family of zzso zzso some members of which zzso zzso appear to be specific to the human zzso This element has been reported as a cause of zzso muscular zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso Such zzso as agents of change in the human zzso provide a strategy for investigating zzso On account of their zzso location in a region that has been subject to change in the course of zzso evolution, and that may have a relationship to psychosis and/or cerebral zzso we conclude that these particular insertions deserve further zzso
