To identify DNA regions important for zzso and zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso a series of clustered point zzso were prepared within the immediate zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments representing the zzso and 19 different zzso zzso of the zzso gene were each linked to a zzso marker zzso and the DNA zzso were transferred into zzso zzso tumor cells by zzso zzso activity was determined 24 h after zzso in extracts from control cells or cells treated with zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso The individual clustered point zzso covered a region from just zzso of the zzso box zzso zzso to a position 193 zzso zzso from the start of zzso Five regions in which zzso produced substantial decreases in both zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression of the marker gene were zzso Three of these regions zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso to previously identified binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The fourth and fifth regions do not zzso to zzso sites and presumably represent sites for an unidentified zzso Within these regions, sequences with some similarity to a consensus zzso response element and an zzso site have been zzso These data confirm the importance of zzso as a key factor in zzso gene zzso In addition, the results suggest that additional zzso factors are probably required for efficient expression of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
