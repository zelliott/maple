When studying gene function in zzso during development, gene expression has to be controlled in a precise zzso and spatial zzso Technologies based on zzso interference zzso are well suited for such studies, as they allow for the efficient zzso of a gene of zzso In contrast to challenging and zzso approaches in zzso systems, the use of zzso in combination with zzso animal models allows zzso control of gene zzso in a fast and precise zzso We have developed approaches using zzso in the chicken zzso to analyze gene function during neural tube zzso Here we describe the construction of plasmids that direct the expression of one or two artificial zzso zzso to knock down expression of zzso zzso of interest upon zzso into the spinal zzso The zzso cassette is directly linked to a fluorescent protein reporter, for the direct zzso of zzso zzso The transcripts are under the control of different zzso which drive expression in genetically defined cell zzso in the neural zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso allows zzso zzso of two or more genes in different cell types of the spinal cord, thus permitting the analysis of complex cellular and molecular interactions in a fast and precise zzso The technique that we describe can easily be applied to other cell types in the neural tube, or even adapted to other organisms in zzso zzso
