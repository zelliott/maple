The complete zzso acid sequence of a basic liver fatty zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of sequences shows that it has more similarity to chicken basic zzso than to zzso zzso The zzso analysis suggests that basic zzso from zzso chicken and zzso zzso from the zzso protein before the zzso zzso thus zzso that the two types are zzso by different zzso Supporting this conclusion, a zzso zzso structurally closely related to zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso indicating the presence of the two genes in the same zzso The zzso basic zzso binds only one fatty zzso while zzso zzso bind zzso The former has more affinity for zzso acid than for zzso acid, in zzso to the latter zzso
