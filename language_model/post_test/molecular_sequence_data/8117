We recently demonstrated a high frequency of loss of zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in primary prostate cancer, suggesting that the zzso gene and/or other tumor zzso zzso located within the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and/or within the vicinity of this zzso may be important in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further define the exact boundary of the deleted region zzso zzso and to detect other possible zzso regions on the long arm of zzso 17, we zzso 23 matched normal and tumor zzso with 15 zzso zzso markers spanning zzso zzso Eleven of 22 zzso zzso tumors showed zzso deletion at one or more of the zzso zzso A minimal area of zzso was identified to extend from the zzso boundary at the zzso locus to the zzso boundary at the zzso zzso spanning an estimated zzso 2 zzso segment on zzso zzso Our results suggest that a potential tumor zzso zzso may reside in the zzso 2 zzso region zzso zzso to the zzso gene and that this tumor zzso zzso may be involved in the formation of prostate zzso
