zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso is zzso expressed in developing zzso zzso Our current studies are aimed at identifying the role of zzso during cell growth and zzso Little is known about the function of zzso zzso Recent studies in our laboratory have focused on the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso domain that is zzso among all zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso potentially functions as a universal regulator of pocket protein zzso Pocket proteins exhibit distinct expression patterns during development and function to regulate cell cycle, zzso and zzso gene zzso We show that zzso interacts with all three pocket zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, this interaction occurs specifically between the zzso zzso motif and the zzso zzso of zzso proteins responsible for zzso association with other zzso zzso of the effects of disruption of zzso protein expression by zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso depletion decreases cell zzso zzso cell cycle zzso and zzso zzso Given its expression in developing cells, its association with pocket zzso and its effects on zzso cell cycle, and viability of cells, we suggest that zzso functions in a similar manner to zzso to disrupt association of zzso proteins with appropriate binding zzso Thus, the zzso interaction serves to retain cells in a zzso actively zzso state despite the presence of zzso proteins during zzso Our data suggest that zzso is unique among zzso family members in that it specifically functions during zzso development to regulate the activity of zzso proteins during cell division and zzso Furthermore, we discuss the distinct possibility that a yet unidentified zzso zzso of the closely related human zzso serves a similar function to zzso in zzso
