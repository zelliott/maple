We have generated zzso zzso between the mouse zzso zzso zzso and parts of the zzso zzso gene to explore the potential of zzso as a zzso signal for larger zzso We demonstrated that the fusion proteins are zzso by comparing the mobility of fusion proteins prepared from a zzso strain and a zzso zzso zzso on zzso and by an in zzso zzso zzso In contrast to unmodified zzso the fusion proteins could be zzso from cell extracts by zzso zzso experiments indicated that the highly zzso zzso zzso renders the fusion proteins zzso explaining why the zzso are not zzso into the culture zzso
