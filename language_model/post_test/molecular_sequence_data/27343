The zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer by promoting cellular zzso Recent studies suggest zzso is a master regulator of zzso progression and possibly a licensing factor for DNA replication yet the mechanisms remain poorly zzso Here we report that zzso targets the human zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso is an essential regulator of DNA replication in zzso cells and its zzso expression is zzso modulated by zzso or zzso treatment in zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso binds at a distinct zzso element zzso in the zzso promoter that is functionally required for zzso zzso zzso We found that peak zzso occupancy at the novel ARE occurs during the zzso phase zzso with peak zzso zzso zzso We also identified several of the zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso regulation in zzso and further characterized zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells markedly decreases zzso expression and zzso cellular zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso is a key regulatory target for zzso and provide new insights into the mechanisms of prostate cancer cell zzso
