Since the zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors are the main zzso zzso zzso expressed in rat brain, we characterized the activity and affinity of nine zzso zzso zzso using these receptors in zzso as well as their activity in a zzso zzso behavior in the zzso grooming zzso We report here that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have significantly higher affinity and potency on the rat zzso zzso zzso as compared to the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the only zzso with higher affinity and potency on the rat zzso zzso zzso The potency order of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not that of zzso zzso zzso zzso fitted with the potency of these zzso to stimulate grooming behavior, when administered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso as well as zzso grooming zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also effective in inducing grooming behavior when administered zzso In the absence of purely selective zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that careful comparison of zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso in zzso could identify which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grooming zzso Furthermore, blockade of zzso grooming behavior by zzso demonstrated that this zzso stress response is zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso
