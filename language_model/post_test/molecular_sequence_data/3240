Among the set of genes expressed during the zzso zzso phase of the cell cycle zzso zzso zzso encodes for a zzso anchor protein associated to the plasma zzso which is able to induce growth arrest when zzso in zzso zzso In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that seems to be transcribed as an zzso together with a gene zzso for a protein similar to human acid zzso zzso structure is very similar to its zzso zzso zzso almost all zzso zzso and it is expressed in the zzso from its early formation, in the zzso zzso until the adult zzso Surprisingly, while zzso is expressed in all zzso zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso together with zzso is absent in zzso and is very abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in growing zzso zzso is able to inhibit the zzso entry in a similar manner as its zzso zzso On the other hand, when zzso is zzso or zzso in zzso zzso no specific zzso due to its zzso zzso can be observed, despite its localized expression suggesting a role in zzso function or zzso
