zzso is a recently discovered zzso zzso induced by the zzso of the zzso factor zzso Here we have examined a role of zzso in cell growth regulation in zzso and in zzso Western zzso using an zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso as a approximately 21 zzso zzso protein in human breast cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso detection method showed the zzso zzso of zzso human zzso in zzso zzso zzso 435 human cancer cells zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased growth rate as compared to control zzso zzso as measured by the cell viability zzso zzso zzso and zzso procedures ( approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also displayed an increase in cell migration in collagen I as compared to control zzso ( approximately zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso showed significantly enhanced tumor growth as compared to control zzso zzso tumor volumes, day zzso control, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The examination of a limited number of clinical specimens revealed higher expression levels of zzso protein in certain human tumor zzso as compared to the matched normal adjacent zzso Taken together, the present studies demonstrate zzso as a novel zzso factor in cancer zzso
