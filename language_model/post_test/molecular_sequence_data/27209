Crystal structures and simulations suggest that zzso changes are critical for the function of zzso reverse zzso The zzso is an zzso zzso of two zzso zzso and zzso The two zzso have the same zzso zzso with the zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso H zzso We used hydrogen exchange mass zzso to probe the structural dynamics of zzso zzso exchange revealed that the fingers and palm zzso of both zzso form the stable core of the zzso In the crystal structure, the zzso fold of the zzso zzso is more compact than that of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso yet both zzso show similar zzso The zzso zzso contains the zzso and zzso H zzso zzso zzso exchange indicated that the zzso H domain of zzso is very zzso The zzso zzso lies at the base of the thumb zzso of zzso and contains highly zzso zzso involved in zzso binding and zzso zzso Using the unique ability of hydrogen exchange mass zzso to resolve slowly zzso species, we found that zzso zzso zzso slow cooperative unfolding with a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso exchange results are discussed in relation to existing zzso zzso and sequence zzso
