zzso 15 zzso is expressed specifically by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in concert with zzso growth, zzso and zzso zzso contains a predicted zzso recognition domain zzso as well as zzso and zzso recognition sequences for zzso zzso Studies tested the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso development, as well as growth, migration, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso were produced in zzso by standard conditions, and putative zzso were cultured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Rates of zzso zzso and zzso formation were not affected by zzso zzso moderately increased proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells, which could be partially inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso cells was zzso by zzso that was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso increase in zzso cell attachment to zzso was found that could be inhibited by zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso binding sequence of zzso to zzso decreased its ability to promote zzso cell attachment, whereas zzso of the zzso had little zzso zzso induced formation of robust focal zzso in zzso cells that was abolished by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso these results support the hypothesis that zzso stimulates zzso cell migration and attachment via zzso binding and zzso which are critical to zzso zzso and zzso
