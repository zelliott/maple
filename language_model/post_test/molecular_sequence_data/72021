zzso is an zzso protein that belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso According to the crystal structure and zzso studies, this zzso consists of two zzso one responsible for protein zzso the other for DNA zzso and both presumably for DNA zzso To define the DNA binding site of zzso zzso was used to identify zzso acid zzso in contact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the minimal recognition sequence and containing single zzso zzso in almost all positions of the recognition sequence were zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso with a zzso laser zzso zzso The best zzso yield zzso zzso was obtained with an zzso with a zzso at position zzso in the bottom zzso The subsequent analysis showed that zzso had occurred with zzso acid zzso 6 zzso acids after the second zzso zzso With the zzso zzso of zzso or in the presence of excess unmodified zzso no zzso was observed, indicating the specificity of the zzso zzso Chemical modification of His zzso in zzso by zzso leads to a substantial reduction in the binding and zzso activity of zzso This zzso can be suppressed by zzso zzso This result further supports the finding that at least one His zzso is in close contact to the zzso Based on these and published results, conclusions are drawn regarding the DNA binding site of zzso
