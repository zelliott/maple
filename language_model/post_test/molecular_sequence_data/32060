zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 10), and evaluated its induction in miniature zzso zzso cells in response to various human zzso The cloned sequence is zzso zzso long, and the open reading frame consists of 312 zzso The deduced protein sequence includes a predicted mature protein of approximately 83 zzso The comparison of zzso zzso and its human, zzso zzso zzso and sheep counterparts exhibited high similarity among different zzso zzso The sequences of important regulatory elements such as the zzso response element zzso and two zzso binding elements are zzso in the zzso promoter region of zzso zzso like other zzso zzso Human zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, while both human zzso and human zzso zzso Together, the data of this study suggest that zzso zzso may interact with human zzso across the species zzso
