The expression of human zzso zzso 1 zzso is highly dependent on the growth states and cell cycle stages in zzso zzso The amount of zzso is significantly increased in the cells during progression to the S and M zzso and becomes barely zzso in the early zzso phase by a zzso control during zzso zzso This tight regulation is important for providing the correct pool of zzso for DNA synthesis at the right time in the cell zzso Here, we investigated the mechanism responsible for zzso degradation of zzso We show that zzso is zzso via a zzso zzso in zzso cells and that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not only a necessary but also a zzso factor for zzso degradation of zzso Furthermore, a zzso box sequence located in the zzso region of zzso is required for its zzso degradation and interaction capability with zzso By in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso is targeted for degradation by the zzso zzso zzso dependent on this zzso box zzso Taken together, we concluded that zzso of the zzso complex during zzso exit controls timing of zzso destruction, thus effectively minimizing zzso formation from the salvage zzso in the early zzso phase of the cell cycle in zzso zzso
