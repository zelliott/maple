A virus isolate was recovered from blood zzso of a patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso by zzso zzso and cultured on zzso of zzso E6 cells in the presence of zzso zzso in roller tubes during the first 72 hours of incubation followed by rolling culture for three weeks in zzso zzso the first subculture was done in a plastic flask and afterward at at least 6 week zzso zzso was first detected after 6 months and 2 weeks of zzso When tested by zzso zzso and patient zzso the isolate had the characteristics of a zzso zzso zzso amplification using zzso zzso and subsequent partial sequencing of the S and M segments revealed that the zzso virus differs from the Finnish zzso zzso zzso zzso virus and is similar but not identical to zzso strains of zzso virus acquired from the same region as the patient zzso It is we concluded that the first human isolate of the zzso agent of zzso in zzso was recovered from blood zzso zzso with zzso by long-term culture in zzso E6 zzso The isolate belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso as shown by its zzso profile and partial sequencing zzso
