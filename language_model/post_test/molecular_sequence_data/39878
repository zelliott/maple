zzso and zzso have striking zzso innovations associated with the zzso One of the zzso in zzso is spurred and zzso while in zzso the petals are fused into a cap and zzso cups are associated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso have surprisingly been shown to be closely zzso since both belong to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, several thorough zzso studies thus far have not revealed shared derived characters zzso that support a close relationship between these zzso In the zzso zzso transitions from entirely green flowers to flowers with zzso zzso zzso can be zzso The primary role of class B genes in core zzso is to specify the identity of zzso and zzso floral zzso zzso zzso of which zzso is a zzso have been identified as redundant zzso that zzso zzso zzso potential on protein complexes that specify organ zzso Given the zzso function of zzso zzso genes in model plants, but the rapid molecular evolution in zzso it remains controversial whether these genes have been involved in shaping floral zzso We have identified a zzso gene and a total of five class B genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and report their quantitative expression in the floral zzso In zzso two zzso genes were identified with strongly divergent zzso zzso one truncated and one unusually zzso Both genes show a gradual decrease in expression towards the outer zzso zzso but no zzso gene expression is observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso is absent from the green zzso but present in the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso protein interactions of the cloned zzso genes were studied in zzso and by using gel zzso In zzso strong overlapping class B gene expression is limited to the zzso but a zzso gene is strongly expressed in the zzso zzso indicating that both zzso and zzso show zzso expression of a zzso zzso We discuss several candidate mechanisms for zzso zzso involving modified gene expression and protein interaction of zzso and class B zzso
