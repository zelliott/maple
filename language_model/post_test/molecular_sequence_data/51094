The interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an zzso with a high affinity for both for the zzso and native zzso is being studied as a model for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the free zzso at pH zzso indicated the presence of a significant population, about zzso of type II zzso spanning zzso zzso At pH zzso little, if any, turn structure is zzso The zzso zzso which, for zzso reasons, would be expected to preserve the zzso and the zzso zzso which would not be expected to have this zzso feature, were zzso and zzso studies confirmed the respective structural zzso The affinity of the zzso analog for zzso zzso is even greater than that displayed by native gamma zzso while the affinity of the zzso analog is less than one-tenth that of the native zzso Both zzso and zzso effects involving zzso zzso may be important in recognition by zzso zzso Since gamma zzso includes a zzso zzso binding locus of zzso and this and related peptides are zzso of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso were tested for zzso zzso Neither of the zzso displays any measurable zzso zzso indicating that the recognition requirements for the zzso zzso differ considerably from those for zzso zzso
