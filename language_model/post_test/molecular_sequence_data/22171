zzso zzso and traffic between zzso and nuclear compartments are fundamental processes in zzso zzso Nuclear pore complexes mediate transport of zzso zzso and zzso particles in and out of the zzso Here we present zzso cloning of a plant zzso zzso zzso essential for a symbiotic signal zzso zzso shared by zzso bacteria and zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in a temperature sensitive zzso deficient zzso and absence of zzso zzso Root zzso developing with reduced frequency at zzso temperatures are ineffective and electron zzso show that zzso bacteria are not released from infection zzso zzso of zzso zzso using a zzso dye show that zzso is required for the zzso zzso normally zzso within minutes after application of zzso zzso zzso signal molecules to root zzso zzso of zzso in the nuclear envelope of root cells and root hair cells shown with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein fusion proteins suggests a novel role for zzso zzso in a rapid zzso communication after zzso recognition of symbiotic zzso Our results identify a component of an intriguing signal process requiring interaction at the cell plasma membrane and at zzso nuclear and zzso zzso to induce a second zzso
