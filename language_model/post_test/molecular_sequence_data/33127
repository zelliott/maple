zzso protein 3 zzso and zzso zzso family 2 zzso exhibit zzso activities and belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso (another tumor zzso both of which are members of the zzso family, have been recently reported to possess zzso activities related to zzso zzso we examined possible zzso activities of human zzso and zzso together with human zzso The zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso functioned as zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner with zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The proteins were active with various zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for most of zzso the zzso activity was much higher than the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso of zzso to form zzso and zzso of zzso PC to form zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso at relatively low zzso Moreover, these three proteins showed different expression profiles in human zzso These results suggest that the tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso metabolism with different zzso zzso
