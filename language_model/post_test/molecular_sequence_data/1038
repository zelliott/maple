Class I zzso zzso zzso catalyze the reduction of zzso to zzso zzso zzso comprise two zzso the zzso zzso which contains zzso and zzso zzso binding sites, and the zzso zzso which houses a zzso essential zzso radical zzso In zzso zzso there are two zzso of the zzso zzso called zzso and zzso zzso is unique in that it lacks three zzso zzso zzso in all other zzso Nevertheless, zzso is required to activate zzso and the functional species in zzso is believed to be a zzso complex between the two zzso The crystal structures of the zzso and zzso zzso have been determined and are compared to that of the zzso The zzso are very similar to the zzso and to mouse zzso in overall fold, but there are several key zzso In the zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso In the zzso interactions with a loop region connecting zzso zzso zzso and zzso stabilize this zzso zzso which donates iron zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso prevent the same interactions from occurring in the zzso zzso These findings provide a structural rationale for why the zzso is the preferred complex in zzso The zzso region in the zzso zzso reveals interactions not apparent in the zzso supporting previous conclusions that this zzso does not bind zzso When taken together, these results support a model in which zzso zzso zzso for zzso assembly and zzso
