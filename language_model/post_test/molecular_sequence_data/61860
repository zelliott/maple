zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a naturally selected zinc zzso and zzso zzso zzso This plant differs zzso from its close relative zzso zzso by accumulating zzso specifically in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in order to zzso on a zzso scale, genes with a potential involvement in cellular metal zzso or zzso in the shoots of zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso transcript abundance of several genes was found and confirmed to be substantially higher in zzso zzso after 4 days of exposure to low as well as high zzso zzso in the zzso culture zzso The identified candidate genes zzso proteins closely related to the following zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative cellular zzso zzso system and member of the zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso protein zzso of metal zzso the putative zzso metal zzso zzso the zzso diffusion zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso and zzso can function in cellular zzso zzso Our data indicate that, at the transcript level, the zzso tolerance strategy of zzso zzso involves high zzso expression of metal zzso genes in the shoots to accommodate higher zzso levels of zzso zzso and possibly to prepare for sudden increases in zzso influx into shoot zzso Furthermore, profiling of metal zzso gene transcripts in shoot and root zzso by real-time zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso respond differently to changes in plant zzso zzso
