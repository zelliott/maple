Experimental probing of the model of the zzso zzso zzso binding site proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models of neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40, zzso was achieved by mutating each zzso proposed to interact with zzso zzso zzso analysis of the different zzso receptors zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells was performed with a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso prevented binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a reduction in affinity greater than zzso indicating essential contributions of these zzso to the binding site for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso had very large effects on the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso but modest effects on the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso resulted in a greater than zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alter binding of most zzso but not of zzso zzso makes little contribution zzso zzso to the binding site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are likely to be part of the binding site for zzso and also to contribute to the binding site for zzso zzso Some of the predicted zzso do not seem to be part of the zzso zzso binding site but zzso is important for proper zzso binding on the zzso zzso zzso as predicted by the proposed zzso
