zzso deletions to zzso 10 have been extensively documented for human zzso zzso To identify gene products that may be involved in zzso zzso a zzso zzso was performed between zzso cells and hybrid cells suppressed for zzso following zzso transfer of zzso zzso One novel zzso isolated from this zzso showed consistent zzso zzso 4 to zzso that correlated with the zzso zzso of the hybrid zzso zzso analysis resulted in the identification of a full length zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression was either not detected or detected only at low levels in cultured zzso cells and primary zzso specimens compared to normal brain zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed predominantly in normal brain with lower levels in heart and zzso zzso analysis showed no significant zzso to known gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso were present in approximately zzso of zzso cell lines zzso Also, zzso mapped to zzso zzso a region that is known to be altered in zzso zzso The differential expression pattern, tissue distribution and zzso location of zzso suggests it serves as a molecular marker for or may play a role in the zzso progression of zzso
