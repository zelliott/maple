As zzso zzso sequence analysis has proven inadequate for the differentiation of zzso zzso from closely related species, we employed the zzso B gene zzso as a molecular diagnostic zzso The zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso zzso zzso primer sets were designed from within zzso sequences of the respective bacteria for the specific amplification and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results from the amplification of zzso sequences correlated well with results obtained with the zzso zzso zzso study but not with the results of their zzso zzso Some of the reference strains of both zzso zzso (three zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were not positive in zzso amplification zzso with zzso zzso However, complete sequencing of zzso zzso fragments of these reference strains showed that these zzso had, in fact, lower zzso than their originally designated zzso We developed and tested a procedure for the specific detection of the target zzso in boiled rice that entailed 15 h of zzso followed by zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso This method enabled us to detect an initial zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells per g of boiled rice food zzso without zzso zzso However, a simple zzso zzso step is required to remove zzso zzso zzso
