zzso is a zzso zinc finger protein that we find to be involved in the primary selection of zzso precursor cells in zzso zzso of this gene is positively regulated by the zzso protein zzso and zzso regulated by the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso is able to promote zzso zzso differentiation and to zzso zzso to lateral zzso but only in cooperation with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function zzso normal zzso as well as zzso zzso caused by zzso of zzso On the basis of these findings, we suggest that zzso is a novel, essential element in the cascade of events that allows cells to escape lateral zzso and to enter the zzso that leads to terminal zzso zzso
