zzso of zzso coli with zzso zzso zzso resulted in the appearance of a protein zzso with activity towards zzso zzso zzso reached a maximum near the point of cell zzso and declined zzso The zzso was zzso zzso by zzso while zzso and zzso were much less zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso 1 and 2, zzso acid, zzso and zzso distinguishing it from the major zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also capable of zzso other zzso in the presence of zzso although activity towards zzso zzso was zzso lower, and activity towards zzso zzso and zzso zzso 25 zzso lower than with zzso No zzso zzso activity was present in either zzso cells, or in zzso coli infected with zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso lacks part of the open reading frame zzso zzso previously shown to zzso a protein with sequence similarity to protein zzso and protein zzso of zzso cells zzso Collins, zzso zzso & da Cruz e zzso (1988) Gene 69, zzso the results indicate that zzso is the protein zzso detected in cells infected with zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of zzso with other zzso protein zzso defines three highly zzso regions which are likely to be essential for zzso The first of these is deleted in zzso zzso
