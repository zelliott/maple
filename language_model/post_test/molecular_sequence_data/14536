The consortium responsible for the sequencing of the tomato zzso zzso zzso initially focused on the sequencing of the zzso regions using a zzso zzso We analyzed the compositional features of the whole collection of zzso sequences zzso zzso This analysis highlights specific peculiarities of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso the whole zzso collection has zzso a large zzso in repeat and gene content, zzso a positive and significant correlation of zzso zzso of the Gypsy class with the repeat content and zzso the preferential location of the zzso (short zzso nuclear zzso in zzso sequences showing a low repeat zzso Our results point out a typical design of the tomato zzso and pave the way for further investigations on the relationship between DNA primary structure and zzso organization in zzso zzso
