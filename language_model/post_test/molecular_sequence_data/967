Genes zzso zzso of the zzso virus zzso protein are present in all zzso for which sequence information is available, yet neither the role of the protein nor its requirement for virus replication is zzso zzso was predicted to be involved in the zzso of core zzso based on a zzso study and the presence of an zzso motif found in a subset of zzso In the present study, we engineered a zzso zzso virus containing a single copy of the zzso gene with a zzso zzso tag that is zzso regulated by the zzso coli zzso zzso In the absence of zzso expression of zzso was zzso and virus replication was zzso zzso of infectious virus was achieved by expression of zzso zzso in zzso but not when the putative zzso active site zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso Nevertheless, the synthesis and zzso processing of major core and membrane proteins appeared unaffected under zzso conditions, distinguishing the zzso of the zzso zzso from one in which the gene zzso the zzso zzso was zzso zzso virus zzso assembled in the absence of zzso did not attain the oval shape or characteristic core structure of mature zzso The zzso composition of these zzso however, closely resembled that of zzso zzso zzso and shorter forms of the zzso protein were found in the core fraction of virus particles assembled in the presence of zzso suggesting that zzso is processed by zzso or by another zzso
