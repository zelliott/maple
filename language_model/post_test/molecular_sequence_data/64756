In insects, there are two different modes of zzso In the higher zzso insects (like zzso their zzso takes place almost simultaneously in the zzso zzso By contrast, in the zzso insects (like zzso zzso the anterior segments form almost simultaneously in the cellular zzso and then the remaining zzso part zzso to form segments zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Although most of their zzso of the zzso zzso genes may be involved in their zzso little is known about their zzso We have investigated zzso processes of zzso zzso focusing on its zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wingless zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed to be expressed in the each anterior segment and the zzso zzso zzso In order to know their roles, we used zzso interference zzso We could not observed any significant effects of zzso for zzso and zzso on zzso probably due to functional replacement by another member of the corresponding gene zzso zzso obtained by zzso for zzso exhibited abnormal anterior segments and lack of the zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling is involved in the zzso sequential zzso in the zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso are likely to act as the zzso genes in the anterior zzso similarly as in zzso
