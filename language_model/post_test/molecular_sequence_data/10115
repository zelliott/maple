Human zzso are composed of long zzso of zzso repeats that form a zzso complex required for the protection and replication of zzso zzso One component of human zzso is the zzso repeat binding factor 1 zzso a zzso expressed zzso related to the zzso zzso that is present at zzso throughout the cell zzso Recent evidence has implicated zzso in the control of zzso zzso zzso is proposed to be an inhibitor of zzso acting in zzso to limit the zzso of individual zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of zzso a distant zzso of zzso that carries a very similar zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso was zzso zzso bound specifically to duplex zzso repeats in zzso and localized to all human zzso in zzso zzso zzso was shown to have an architecture similar to that of zzso in that it carries a zzso zzso motif and a large zzso zzso domain near its N zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso did not zzso suggesting that these proteins exist predominantly as zzso While having similar zzso binding activity and domain organization, zzso differed from zzso in that its N zzso was basic rather than zzso and zzso was much more zzso than zzso The results indicate that the zzso repeat zzso at the ends of human and mouse zzso bind to two related zzso Because zzso and zzso showed significant differences, we suggest that these factors have distinct functions at zzso
