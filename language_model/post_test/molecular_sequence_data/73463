zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso disease in susceptible mouse strains after zzso zzso The clinical symptoms and zzso of the central nervous system appear to be similar to those of human multiple sclerosis zzso and thus, this system provides an excellent infectious animal model for studying zzso The zzso zzso is immune zzso and the genes involved in the immune response such as those for the zzso zzso zzso and major zzso complex zzso zzso are known to influence disease zzso To define whether the zzso zzso zzso or zzso genes are associated with zzso we have analyzed zzso mice from crosses of susceptible zzso zzso mice and resistant zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso to zzso zzso is associated with restriction zzso length zzso reflecting the zzso zzso zzso region rather than the zzso zzso This association becomes stronger when the zzso zzso is considered in the linkage zzso However, differences in the zzso zzso zzso zzso have no significant influence on the zzso of zzso zzso
