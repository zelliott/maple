The zzso zzso zzso zzso TO zzso zzso zzso disease resistance protein mediates recognition of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso repeat zzso family and is activated by zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso Here, we present a zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso using transient expression zzso in zzso zzso We found that substituting the zzso domain of zzso for the zzso zzso domain did not alter zzso specificity and only moderately reduced its ability to activate programmed cell death, suggesting that the zzso domain does not play a direct role in the recognition of zzso zzso Analysis of an zzso Yellow Fluorescent zzso fusion revealed that zzso zzso to the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso of predicted zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affected zzso PM zzso protein stability, and function in an additive manner, indicating that PM zzso is essential to zzso zzso The first 20 zzso acids of zzso were sufficient for directing super Yellow Fluorescent zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that the first four zzso repeats are sufficient for zzso zzso zzso however, the complete zzso domain was required for the recognition of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain resulted in the zzso of zzso indicating that the zzso domain must zzso with the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso domain functions to suppress zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso and promotes zzso zzso in its zzso
