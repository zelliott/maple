The protein sequence derived from a cloned zzso gene and partial zzso has high sequence identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins of higher zzso zzso The open reading frame of the gene is flanked by consensus sequence motifs characteristic of zzso protein genes and the pattern of zzso of the gene in zzso cells subjected to nutritional shift or temperature shock is also typical of a zzso protein zzso The gene is single copy and essential for zzso The predicted sequence of the zzso of the protein identifies it as a zzso zzso protein variously known as zzso zzso or zzso the least basic of the zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso
