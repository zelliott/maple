The complete zzso sequences of the zzso genes from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The DNA sequence of the coding region of the zzso coli zzso gene contained a single zzso change compared with the zzso coli zzso gene sequence whereas the zzso zzso gene differed at 7 zzso In both cases, the predicted proteins were identical in primary structure to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequences of the zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to the zzso coli zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso and zzso identical respectively, to that of zzso coli zzso The zzso proteins from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly in sequence in the last 50 zzso whereas they showed striking conservation throughout the first 300 zzso acids which include an zzso region and a zzso interaction zzso A putative zzso zzso binding site was localized upstream of each of the zzso zzso
