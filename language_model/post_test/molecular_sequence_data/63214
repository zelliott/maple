The biological behaviors of zzso zzso and numerous other functional zzso molecules are critically dependent on their zzso folding and their ability to sample multiple functional zzso The zzso zzso and partially folded nature of most of these states has rendered their characterization by high-resolution structural approaches difficult or even zzso Here we introduce a method to rapidly zzso the zzso zzso arrangements of large zzso molecules in their native and non-native solution zzso zzso zzso radical zzso zzso analysis zzso enables the zzso detection of numerous pairs of zzso zzso via random incorporation of radical zzso agents followed by two-dimensional gel zzso We validated this technology by zzso the unfolded and native states of a well studied model zzso the zzso domain of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso We then applied zzso to a recently discovered third state of the zzso zzso that is stabilized by high zzso of zzso salt and whose partial order zzso conventional techniques for structure zzso The three-dimensional portrait of a zzso non-native zzso state reveals a well ordered subset of native zzso zzso in contrast to the dynamic but otherwise similar molten zzso states of zzso With its zzso to nearly any solution state, we expect zzso to be a powerful tool for illuminating the many functional structures of large zzso molecules and zzso zzso
