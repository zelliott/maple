The detection of DNA damage activates DNA repair pathways and checkpoints to allow time for zzso Ultimately, these responses must be coordinated to ensure that cell cycle progression is halted until repair is zzso Several zzso complexes containing members of the structural maintenance of zzso family of proteins have been zzso including the zzso and zzso complexes, that are critical for zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso complex is required for a coordinated response to DNA damage and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso cells lacking functional zzso initiate a normal checkpoint response to DNA damage, culminating in the zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso Despite this, cells enter a lethal zzso presumably without completion of DNA zzso Another zzso of the complex, zzso is a zzso member of this complex and is also required for this zzso We propose that the failure to maintain a checkpoint response stems from the lack of ongoing DNA repair or from defective zzso organization, which is the signal to maintain a checkpoint zzso The zzso complex is fundamental to zzso integrity and may function with the zzso and zzso complexes in a coordinated zzso
