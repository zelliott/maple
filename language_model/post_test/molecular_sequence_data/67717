The zzso family of genes has been shown to play a significant role in the development of zzso zzso including dry and zzso zzso In this study, the molecular properties of an zzso like zzso box zzso factor in banana zzso Giant governor zzso zzso AAA group, zzso zzso has been zzso We have detected a zzso sequence binding zzso zzso protein in banana flower and fruit nuclear extracts in zzso interaction zzso The protein fraction in the zzso complex was analyzed by mass zzso and using this information we have obtained the full length zzso of the corresponding zzso The deduced protein sequence showed zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso a zzso protein described previously from zzso We have characterized the zzso of the identified zzso zzso protein involved in DNA binding and zzso formation in zzso using full-length and truncated versions of affinity zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in order to gain insight about how DNA zzso is achieved by this zzso factor, we performed circular zzso and phasing analysis using the wild type zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein identified in this study has been found to predominantly accumulate in the zzso fruit pulp and also in female flower zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso have revealed specific binding of the identified zzso zzso protein to zzso sequence in the promoters of major zzso genes in banana zzso Overall, the expression patterns of this zzso protein in banana female flower zzso and during various zzso of fruit zzso along with the interaction of the protein to the zzso sequence in the promoters of major zzso genes lead to interesting assumption about the possible involvement of this zzso zzso factor in banana fruit zzso and floral zzso organ zzso
