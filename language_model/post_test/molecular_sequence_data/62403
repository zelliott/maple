The two best known zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso found in all zzso zzso They are probably involved in many zzso signal zzso although the details are not yet zzso The zzso are zzso of a specific large zzso zzso or zzso and a common small zzso zzso zzso zzso have been obtained by zzso of large and small zzso in zzso coli and in zzso cells, with variable zzso zzso with the zzso zzso is very low, but is much higher with a zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso is well expressed in zzso coli but mouse zzso zzso is poorly zzso even though the zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso It had also been reported that human zzso could be expressed in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso To investigate these differences, hybrid zzso and zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso It was shown that zzso and zzso which are specific to the mouse zzso zzso caused poor zzso High expression of human zzso in zzso coli could be achieved by providing the correct zzso zzso binding zzso The results provide a simple method to obtain approximately zzso amounts of human zzso and a slightly modified mouse zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso both in zzso coli and in zzso cells, varying both the small zzso and the zzso zzso alone was not active, but with zzso or zzso zzso was active in both cell zzso The zzso domain was partially zzso during zzso releasing an active zzso zzso
