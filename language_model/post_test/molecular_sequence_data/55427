An zzso plate screening zzso was used to determine whether 100 zzso bacterial zzso previously obtained from zzso soils, had the ability to transform zzso and zzso zzso percent of the zzso were capable of reducing zzso on zzso zzso The zzso also grew in the presence of high zzso of zzso but none of the bacterial zzso oxidized zzso to zzso under the growth conditions zzso About 14 % (13 of 95) of the tested zzso transformed high levels of zzso zzso zzso when tested using the zzso blue zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso genes indicated that the zzso belonged to two broad zzso groups: zzso and zzso Ten zzso were assigned to four species in the zzso zzso and three zzso belonged to two species in the zzso zzso and zzso Taken together these results indicate that zzso diverse bacteria isolated from zzso zzso in an old tin mine area in Thailand have the ability to transform zzso to zzso
