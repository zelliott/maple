In order to examine the zzso forces in zzso zzso zzso values and their zzso strength dependence of His zzso of zzso egg white zzso zzso and human zzso zzso were measured, and they were compared with those calculated zzso zzso values of His zzso in zzso zzso and short zzso were determined from chemical shift changes of His side chains by zzso zzso The associated changes in zzso values in zzso and zzso were calculated by solving the zzso equations zzso for zzso zzso zzso The calculated zzso changes and their zzso strength dependence agreed fairly well with the observed zzso The contribution from each zzso of each zzso zzso to the zzso values and their zzso strength dependence was analyzed using Green's zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso the zzso of His zzso are largely affected by surrounding zzso and polar zzso zzso the zzso strength dependence of the zzso values is determined by the overall charge zzso and their zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso make a significant contribution to the zzso when the His zzso is close to the zzso zzso and not fully exposed to the zzso
