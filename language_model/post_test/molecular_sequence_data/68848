To purify the zzso V2 zzso and identify zzso involved in hormone zzso zzso labeling of the zzso bovine V2 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The labeled 30,000 zzso protein was zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequencing showed that the isolated protein which contains the zzso bound hormonal zzso represents an zzso truncated bovine V2 zzso The zzso labeled V2 zzso zzso protein was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso fragments were zzso zzso zzso and comparison with the zzso sequence of a cloned zzso product identified two zzso and two zzso peptides of the bovine V2 zzso zzso was incorporated into two zzso acid zzso localized in the second zzso zzso Our results indicate that this zzso domain is involved in zzso zzso binding of the V2 zzso
