zzso III zzso zzso represents a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso The simplest bacterial zzso contains an zzso domain zzso and a zzso binding domain zzso zzso III can affect zzso structure and gene expression in either of two ways: as a zzso zzso that zzso zzso or as a zzso binding protein that binds but does not cleave zzso We previously determined the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso and modeled a zzso complex of full-length zzso III with zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of zzso III in complex with zzso revealing a zzso zzso The major differences between the two functional forms of zzso zzso are the zzso of the protein and the orientation and location of zzso The flexibility of a 7 zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso enables the transition between these two zzso
