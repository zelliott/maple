We have used a strategy based on the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify and construct full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Two zzso internal zzso were zzso based on their zzso to published consensus sequences of the SS gene of zzso and zzso zzso of full-length zzso was achieved by an anchored zzso method utilizing zzso which extend to zzso and 3' ends of specific zzso In the first step, a zzso zzso tail was added to the 3' end of zzso zzso The two SS zzso were zzso one with a zzso end zzso and the other with a 3' end zzso using one internal SS primer and the other anchored end zzso Finally, overlapping fragments were identified by restriction zzso and the zzso fragments were excised and zzso to reconstruct full-length zzso zzso sequences of the reconstructed zzso zzso and zzso were compared with the published SS sequences to confirm that the amplified DNA was a copy of the SS zzso
