As a basis towards a better understanding of the role of the zzso zzso zzso family in the maintenance of pregnancy, detailed investigations are described on the expression of a recently identified rat zzso gene zzso at the zzso and protein zzso Using specific zzso zzso zzso transcripts were identified after reverse transcription, zzso chain reaction, and zzso with a zzso internal zzso zzso were only found in significant amounts in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts at day 14 post zzso zzso in secondary zzso giant cells and in the zzso Only those secondary giant cells lining the maternal zzso were zzso In contrast, primary giant cells did not contain zzso zzso At day 18 zzso zzso transcripts were almost exclusively zzso in the zzso No zzso transcripts were found in rat zzso of these two zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated against the zzso zzso zzso domain and against a synthetic zzso containing the last 13 zzso zzso acids of zzso Both zzso recognized a 124 zzso protein in day 18 rat zzso extracts as identified by Western zzso zzso The zzso zzso recognized a 116 zzso protein in the serum of a 14 day zzso pregnant rat that is absent from the zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these results confirm exclusive expression of zzso in the rat zzso but unlike human zzso negligible or no expression is found in other zzso such as fetal liver or zzso zzso indicating a more specialized function of zzso Its zzso expression pattern is conducive with a potential role of zzso in protecting the fetus against the maternal immune system and/or in regulating the invasive growth of zzso zzso
