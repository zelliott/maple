zzso is a zzso factor that shares a common structural motif with members of the zzso zzso The zzso for zzso is found in growing zzso and in zzso or zzso cells of the early mouse zzso zzso is zzso in zzso during differentiation events associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression is also zzso when zzso embryonic stem cells or zzso zzso cells are induced to differentiate in the presence of zzso zzso A zzso zzso that can recognize a unique zzso sequence in the zzso of mouse zzso has been zzso It specifically recognizes zzso protein as tested by Western blots and gel mobility shift zzso This zzso has been used to measure zzso protein levels during zzso acid induced differentiation of zzso zzso zzso cells, It was observed that zzso protein was abundant in zzso zzso cells but decreased to levels below detection as the cells zzso consistent with changes in levels of expression in early zzso
