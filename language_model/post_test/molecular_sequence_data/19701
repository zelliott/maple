The coat protein zzso of potato zzso virus zzso is the primary component of the zzso and is a zzso protein known to be involved in zzso transmission and virus movement within plant zzso in addition to particle zzso Thirteen zzso were generated in various regions of the zzso and tested for their ability to affect zzso and zzso zzso Nine of the zzso prevented the assembly of stable zzso These zzso were unable to zzso zzso four different host zzso Furthermore, although virus replication and translation of the zzso were similar for the zzso and zzso virus in individual plant cells, the translation of the zzso zzso product was affected in several of the zzso Four of the zzso were able to assemble stable particles and zzso host plants zzso similarly to the zzso zzso however, two of the zzso were transmitted less efficiently by zzso zzso Based on a computer-generated model of the zzso zzso the zzso that prevented zzso assembly were associated with zzso zzso while the zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso were associated with surface zzso This and previous work indicates that the zzso structural model has value in predicting the structural architecture of the zzso
