zzso zzso Factor 2 zzso proteins are a small family of zzso factors that play pivotal role in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso In zzso there are four zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are located on different zzso After birth zzso zzso zzso transcriptions are expressed zzso whereas zzso transcripts are restricted to skeletal muscle, brain, and zzso In this study, on the basis of the sequences of the bovine zzso 7 zzso zzso available in the zzso database, sets of zzso zzso were designed and to amplify the bovine zzso gene promoter region, zzso 1 zzso and part sequence of the zzso zzso Seven overlapping fragments of the bovine zzso gene were amplified and then zzso Altogether, these fragments were composed in the zzso sequence which was deposited in the zzso database under zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso included the putative site of the promoter region and zzso start of the zzso zzso The sequence analysis of these fragments in individual animals representing different zzso zzso breeds revealed four variations in promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and four zzso within zzso 1: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No zzso was found within sequence of the zzso 1 zzso These zzso were identified for first time using these sequences and were confirmed by zzso or zzso zzso
