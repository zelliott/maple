By zzso zzso zzso activity on the zzso zzso A zzso gene in humans, length variation of a repetitive sequence zzso number of tandem repeat zzso in the zzso promoter influences a constellation of personality traits related to aggressive and antisocial behavior and increases the risk of zzso and psychiatric zzso Here, we have analyzed the presence and zzso of this zzso promoter repeat in several species of nonhuman zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso control region revealed the presence of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gorilla zzso zzso orangutan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a single repeat with a sequence identical to the zzso sequence in zzso In contrast, analyses of the remaining species revealed shorter sequences similar to the first 18 zzso of human zzso Compared with other nonhuman zzso the zzso sequence of zzso zzso showed the highest length zzso with zzso zzso of 35, 25 and zzso for the five, six and seven repeat zzso zzso The extent of zzso of the zzso promoter repeat in both zzso monkeys and humans supports the notion that there may be a relationship between functional zzso expression and zzso traits in humans and zzso zzso zzso
