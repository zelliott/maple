The mouse zzso growth factor II gene zzso is transcribed from three promoters zzso zzso and zzso and is expressed in a zzso and zzso regulated zzso however, little information is available on the zzso factors controlling zzso zzso The zzso complex is a zzso factor involved in the regulation of a variety of zzso including those zzso certain growth zzso We show that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in a transient expression zzso and that this effect is zzso through two zzso zzso binding sites zzso by zzso interaction zzso zzso analysis indicates these sites are required for zzso responsiveness and full promoter zzso
