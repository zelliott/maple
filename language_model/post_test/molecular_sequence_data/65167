The zzso acid zzso protein of zzso zzso excludes zzso zzso zzso by blocking zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Multiple interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso complex are involved in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso motif binds zzso sequence in nascent zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso binds zzso zzso and contacts DNA zzso zzso zzso is required for interaction with DNA and zzso zzso We analyzed the role of the adjacent zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso had no effect on zzso arrest in zzso or in zzso zzso zzso was partially active, whereas zzso zzso was defective in zzso and failed to exclude zzso All zzso bound zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not zzso DNA zzso These results suggest that zzso arrest is facilitated by zzso interactions between positively charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso charged DNA zzso zzso These may assist zzso of zzso into zzso
