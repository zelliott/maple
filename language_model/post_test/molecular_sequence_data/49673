The regions zzso the zzso zzso gene have extensive sequence zzso and comprise various zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso promoter and zzso region from several zzso species revealed that the zzso spacing and orientation of the zzso boxes are zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso gene of both species and the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso are transcribed from two zzso whereas the zzso gene of zzso zzso is transcribed from a single zzso zzso with total zzso showed that zzso and zzso were expressed in both species at all growth zzso Analysis of the promoter activity using zzso fusion plasmids and zzso expression plasmids indicates that the zzso gene is zzso although the degree of zzso zzso was zzso zzso was also detected in the vicinity of zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso These results suggest that a more complex zzso mechanism may be involved in the zzso zzso which regulates the expression of zzso and initiation of zzso DNA zzso
