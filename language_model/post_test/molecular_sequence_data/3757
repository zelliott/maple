The aim of this study was to explore the potential of a combined chemical and zzso approach as part of a study of organic carbon zzso processes in zzso An assessment of zzso diversity using molecular techniques was carried out in combination with high resolution chemical zzso at the zzso interface of a coastal zzso affected by zzso in autumn zzso There was a zzso zzso overlap between the zzso and zzso zzso pH showed a maximum just above the zzso interface coinciding with an oxygen zzso suggesting zzso activity, and a minimum coinciding with the zzso zzso The zzso potential was high in bottom water and surface zzso reflecting the presence of oxygen and zzso and reached low values after a zzso decrease at zzso zzso Reduction of zzso occurred within the zzso at the zzso interface and was mostly due to reduction by zzso The elevated zzso of dissolved zzso in the zzso water may have been caused either by in zzso production within organic zzso or lateral water flow from sites nearby at which zzso zzso out of the zzso zzso related to zzso zzso were retrieved from the zzso samples, which is consistent with the small overlap between zzso and zzso observed in this zzso Although the resolution of techniques used was different, sequencing results were consistent with chemical data in zzso the same horizons according to zzso pH or ecological zzso
