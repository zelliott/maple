The zzso translation initiation factor zzso recognizes the zzso cap, a key step in translation zzso Here we have characterized zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have either the typical zzso zzso or a zzso zzso cap derived from spliced leader zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso has similar binding specificity for both zzso We present the first crystal structure of an zzso with similar binding specificity for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure demonstrates that the zzso protein binds zzso cap in a manner similar to that of single specificity zzso and exhibits a structure similar to other known zzso The structure suggests an alternate orientation of a zzso key zzso in the zzso pocket that may contribute to dual binding specificity and a position for zzso bound to zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso of zzso chemical shift zzso in zzso zzso on binding zzso and zzso identified key differences between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significant thermodynamics differences for the binding process with the two caps zzso versus zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso data suggest the importance of intrinsic zzso flexibility in the zzso zzso that enables binding to zzso zzso
