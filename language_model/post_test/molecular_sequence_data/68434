The creation of new zzso was studied by generating a zzso zzso break in zzso strains of zzso zzso that are unable to carry out zzso zzso New zzso formation occurred approximately zzso of the time but only when zzso was present zzso to the break zzso About half of the healing events occurred at a number of zzso to zzso G or G, T sequences located as far as 128 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Surprisingly, in 16 events at sites ending in zzso the first zzso zzso added always included either an zzso or a zzso sequence zzso or zzso after which each new zzso zzso into a less ordered zzso zzso Moreover, at zzso of the remaining addition sites, these same zzso or zzso sequences were found overlapping the junction between the zzso primer and the newly added zzso We propose that short G, T sequences near an organizing sequence such as zzso can act as zzso to pair with the template zzso of a zzso and add new sequences that are complementary to that zzso
