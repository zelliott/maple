To identify which segments of the beta 1 domain of the E beta k zzso control T cell recognition of zzso E beta genes were constructed with zzso zzso zzso Five independent zzso with insertions mapping to positions 24, 50 and 93 of the E beta k zzso were zzso Cell lines expressing these zzso genes were zzso by zzso using a panel of 20 zzso zzso zzso None of the tested zzso insertions has resulted in the loss of zzso binding zzso In striking contrast, zzso at position 93 and at a lesser level 50 were indicative of a crucial role of the corresponding regions in zzso recognition, because they led to significant or complete loss of zzso function with all but one of the T zzso zzso These data are discussed with regard to a model of the foreign zzso binding site of zzso zzso
