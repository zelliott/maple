zzso A3, which belongs to the family of zzso zzso is an attractive target for adoptive therapy given its zzso in various tumors and limited expression in normal zzso We developed an zzso T cell zzso zzso directed to a human zzso zzso zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso for use in adoptive zzso zzso zzso investigations revealed no zzso zzso recognition zzso nonetheless, administration to patients of T cells expressing the zzso zzso A3 zzso resulted in a serious adverse event zzso and fatal toxicity against cardiac zzso We present a description of the zzso in zzso functional analysis of the zzso A3 zzso which failed to reveal any evidence of zzso activity, and a full analysis of the zzso in zzso zzso which reveal zzso of an zzso zzso Using an zzso acid scanning approach, a zzso from the muscle protein zzso zzso was identified as an alternative target for the zzso A3 zzso and the most likely cause of in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso have considerable zzso functions in zzso and highlight the potential safety concerns for zzso T zzso Strategies such as zzso scanning and the use of more complex cell cultures are recommended in zzso studies to mitigate the risk of zzso toxicity in future clinical zzso
