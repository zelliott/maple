The evolution of plant zzso during zzso events provides clues to the origin of crop species and the evolutionary zzso of structural zzso The zzso zzso a floral regulatory zzso has been implicated in the cauliflower zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso population genetic analysis indicates that zzso carrying a nonsense zzso in zzso 5 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene are segregating in both wild and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying this nonsense zzso are nearly fixed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which show evolutionary modifications of zzso zzso Tests for selection indicate that the pattern of variation at this locus is consistent with positive selection at zzso in these two zzso This nonsense zzso however, is also present in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that specific zzso of zzso were selected by early farmers during the zzso of modified zzso structures in zzso zzso
