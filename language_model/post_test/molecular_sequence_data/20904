zzso zzso is an aquaculture pathogen that can zzso a number of fish zzso The zzso mechanisms of aquatic zzso zzso remain largely zzso Many zzso zzso strains are able to zzso an zzso zzso called zzso yet no zzso proteins have been identified in zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso In this study, a gene zzso an zzso zzso was cloned from zzso a zzso zzso zzso strain isolated from diseased zzso In zzso zzso is zzso into the zzso zzso and the production of zzso is controlled by growth phase and zzso zzso of zzso has multiple effects, which include impaired abilities in interaction with cultured host cells, adherence to host zzso zzso of host immune response, and dissemination and survival in host zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits apparent zzso activity, which is optimal at pH zzso and 50 degrees zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso is enhanced by zzso and zzso and reduced by zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso has profound toxic effect on cultured fish zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is an zzso zzso that is involved in bacterial zzso
