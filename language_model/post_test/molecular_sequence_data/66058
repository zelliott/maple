Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso regulates gene expression by zzso translation or directing zzso degradation of complementary zzso Here, we report new evidence in which zzso may also function to induce gene zzso By scanning gene promoters in zzso for sequences complementary to known zzso we identified a putative zzso target site in the promoter of zzso zzso of zzso and its precursor hairpin zzso zzso into zzso cells readily induced zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed that induction of zzso by zzso required the zzso maturation protein zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso zzso protein C2 zzso which possesses a putative zzso target site within its promoter, was also readily induced in response to zzso and zzso Furthermore, enrichment of zzso zzso II was detected at both zzso and zzso promoters after zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso indicated that gene induction was specific to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the concurrent induction of zzso and zzso by zzso required the zzso target sites in both zzso In conclusion, we have identified a zzso that targets promoter sequences and zzso gene zzso These findings reveal a new mode by which zzso may regulate gene zzso
