zzso zzso zzso zzso the first committed step in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the unique presence of these zzso pathways in plants and zzso zzso has been widely investigated as an attractive target of several classes of zzso Recently, the crystal structure of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been resolved at zzso A (1 zzso zzso showing that the active site is located at the zzso interface and is near the zzso zzso In this structure, the existence of two zzso regions, a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso is worth zzso Although these regions contain the zzso that are known to be important in zzso specificity and in zzso resistance, they are poorly folded into any distinct secondary structure and are not within contact distance of the zzso In the present study, we have tried to demonstrate the role of these regions of tobacco zzso by constructing zzso with serial zzso based on the structure of zzso zzso In contrast with the zzso zzso the truncated zzso which removes the zzso zzso zzso and the internal deletion zzso without the mobile loop, zzso impaired the binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso and showed different zzso profiles representing a zzso form in zzso zzso Our results suggest that these regions are involved in the zzso of the active zzso and zzso zzso
