The presence of zzso in plants is now well zzso but their functions and natural zzso remain largely zzso Recently, a zzso zzso has been zzso characterized and several zzso have been engineered in order to explore its zzso This work focuses on some zzso functions of the zzso According to our findings, the zzso zzso can serve as an electron donor to the bacterial zzso zzso as it supports both the zzso by the zzso in zzso and zzso a zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso is able to reduce the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso (in zzso reduction of zzso zzso Although this zzso is described as an electron donor to a zzso zzso whose function is to zzso zzso we found that it does not directly reduce hydrogen zzso or other zzso zzso as described for zzso and rice zzso However, the zzso zzso may be involved in the response to zzso stress as its zzso in zzso coli resulted in a higher resistance toward hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso zzso
