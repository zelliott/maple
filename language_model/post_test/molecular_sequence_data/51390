A novel zzso expression zzso zzso that directs the synthesis of a fusion protein with a zzso zzso at its zzso and a foreign protein at its zzso was zzso The fusion gene is controlled by a strong zzso promoter, leading to high-level expression of zzso protein in several bacterial zzso the protein is deposited mainly as an zzso mass in inclusion zzso The fusion protein can be zzso from the zzso cell fraction by zzso affinity zzso based on the selective interaction between the zzso zzso and a metal zzso zzso charged with zzso zzso The principle of this new system was tested by expressing and zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso With the use of column zzso and pH zzso zzso about 25 zzso zzso zzso of bacterial culture was zzso
