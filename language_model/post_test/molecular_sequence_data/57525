It has been thought that zzso zzso especially Lewis zzso blood group zzso are zzso zzso 

The authors conducted zzso studies to investigate the expression of seven different types of Le zzso zzso in breast cancer tissue and their usefulness as an indicator of the degree of zzso and as a zzso zzso 

When this expression was compared in the zzso portion of 300 breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in each of the patients, reduced expression of type 1 zzso zzso and increased expression of type 2 zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso No correlation was detected between the zzso expression and zzso zzso The prognosis of patients in whom type 2 zzso zzso were increased in the zzso portion, especially Lex zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was poorer than in patients in whom they were not increased zzso zzso zzso 

The relative expression of type 2 zzso zzso in breast cancer tissue seems capable of serving as a zzso zzso
