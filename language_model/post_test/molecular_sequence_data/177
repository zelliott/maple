A zzso approach is proposed to predict zzso location of zzso Instead of zzso features from protein sequences as done zzso our approach is based on a complexity decomposition of symbol zzso In the first step, distance between each pair of protein sequences is evaluated by the conditional complexity of one sequence given the zzso zzso location of a protein is then determined using the zzso neighbor zzso Using three widely used data sets created by zzso and Hubbard, Park and zzso and zzso et zzso our approach shows an improvement in prediction accuracy over those based on the zzso acid composition and zzso model of protein zzso
