Work in our laboratory has shown that in addition to previously characterized changes in the level of zzso in zzso brain, the activity of zzso zzso responsible for zzso metabolism is also zzso In addition to other reported zzso in zzso zzso we have observed that zzso degradation is increased in zzso area 22 whereas substance P degradation is increased in zzso zzso Changes in the degradation of these zzso known to be affected in zzso correlate well with zzso in the activity of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is increased in zzso zzso area 22 which parallels the increased degradation of zzso The activity of zzso zzso is decreased in zzso zzso which zzso to the decreased degradation of substance zzso Changes in the activity of these zzso zzso in zzso brain can potentially affect the action of other zzso zzso because the zzso discussed here terminate the action of several zzso As more zzso and zzso zzso zzso are discovered in zzso greater emphasis may be placed on the role that peptides and zzso play in the progression of zzso
