zzso proteins are universally zzso zzso proteins that are essential for viability in zzso zzso in different organisms are involved in various cellular zzso including DNA zzso The goal of this study was to zzso the zzso relationship of zzso coli zzso with regard to DNA replication in general and sensitivity to stalled replication zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso were constructed and tested for sensitivity to the replication inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso domain was shown to be zzso for normal growth of zzso However, a region within this domain is involved in the cellular response to replication fork zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso library was constructed by zzso zzso and screened for increased zzso zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso located within distinct zzso of zzso display zzso effects leading to zzso hypersensitivity when zzso These effects are abolished in strains with a single deletion of the iron zzso zzso or combined deletions the zzso zzso zzso strains both of which have been shown to be involved in a zzso that stimulates zzso radical formation following zzso zzso Moreover, the observed zzso effects are lost in the presence of the zzso radical scavenger zzso Together, these results indicate involvement of zzso radical toxicity in zzso protection against replication fork zzso
