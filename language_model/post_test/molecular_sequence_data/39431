zzso zzso a major quantitative trait locus affecting tolerance to complete zzso in zzso rice zzso zzso contains two or three zzso response factor zzso genes whose transcripts are regulated by zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso this locus encodes two zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the tolerant zzso line containing the zzso locus from the zzso zzso zzso the locus additionally encodes the zzso gene zzso During zzso the tolerant zzso displayed restrained leaf and zzso zzso zzso degradation, and zzso consumption, whereas the zzso activities of zzso zzso and alcohol zzso were increased significantly compared with the intolerant zzso zzso levels of genes associated with zzso consumption, zzso zzso and cell expansion were distinctly regulated in the two zzso zzso and zzso transcript levels were shown to be zzso by zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso also zzso by treatment with zzso acid zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso region zzso determines zzso and zzso zzso and zzso responses to zzso through differential expression of zzso and zzso zzso tolerance in zzso rice is zzso by a specific zzso zzso of zzso that zzso zzso production and zzso zzso causing zzso in growth that zzso with the capacity for regrowth upon zzso
