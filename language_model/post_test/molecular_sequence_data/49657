The zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso is an zzso truncated form of the zzso zzso Although zzso shares none of zzso transforming and signal zzso activities, we recently reported that zzso can zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso by the zzso strain of zzso zzso from zzso 129 zzso of the zzso open reading frame zzso The recent report that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is not zzso in the zzso strain of zzso prompted us to screen a panel of zzso cell lines for conservation of zzso and zzso zzso We found that 15 out of 16 zzso virus zzso zzso zzso an zzso or zzso zzso in place of zzso in the zzso zzso at position zzso and tumor cell lines harboring zzso lacking an zzso at zzso 129 did not express the zzso zzso In contrast, we found that zzso DNA from 22 out of 37 healthy zzso donors retained the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso occurs zzso within distinct zzso strains and its presence cannot be predicted by zzso strain zzso Thus, zzso is not peculiar to the zzso strain of zzso but rather can be found in the background of several zzso distinct zzso zzso Its absence from zzso zzso from tumors raises the possibility of selective pressure on zzso in zzso zzso
