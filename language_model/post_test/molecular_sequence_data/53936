zzso is well known to be a rat protein zzso by a highly zzso zzso family with more than zzso zzso We report here the cloning and identification of major zzso zzso species expressed in various zzso Initially, eight individual clones zzso were obtained from a male zzso zzso zzso zzso Data base analysis with zzso demonstrated six zzso to be novel, all clones being characterized by highly zzso sequence motifs as zzso All zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso and zzso 181 zzso acid proteins showing zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid identity, zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso with sequence analysis showed that zzso is a major member in the female zzso zzso and in the zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso while the counterpart in male liver and the zzso zzso was found to be zzso Numbers of zzso species including zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso no sex-related difference being zzso These results directly demonstrate complex zzso and zzso expression of zzso in terms of zzso species, providing useful information for understanding regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
