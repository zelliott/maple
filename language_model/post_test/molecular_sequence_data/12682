In this paper we report the zzso sequencing and expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso A single gene was found to code for zzso zzso activity with its identity being confirmed by expression in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence was found to be similar to that of zzso zzso of several other zzso A region downstream of the sod gene also showed similarities to the corresponding sequences of the two main zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso activity showed this zzso in zzso zzso required zzso as zzso
