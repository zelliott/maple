The zzso binding protein zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by removal of tenaciously bound DNA with zzso and the zzso zzso partially zzso zzso zzso was generated against a synthetic zzso of 14 zzso acids at the zzso of the zzso This zzso was employed to examine the accessibility of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of isolated zzso revealed only weak zzso with specific zzso zzso within replication bands was demonstrated, and could be zzso by preparation of nuclear zzso zzso a dot zzso analysis, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were revealed after extraction of zzso zzso (and some zzso A different aspect of zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was considerably less susceptible to zzso by zzso than were zzso zzso and zzso The relative zzso of zzso was not a consequence of zzso zzso structure, since soluble zzso zzso in low salt exhibited the same burying of zzso zzso by dot zzso analysis, and the same decreased zzso to zzso as did isolated zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso spread in low salt revealed that most zzso appear zzso without stable zzso zzso The mechanisms for the relative zzso of zzso are not yet known, but probably arise as a consequence of the strong interactions of zzso with the zzso zzso sequence and additional interactions of zzso with various zzso zzso perhaps including zzso zzso
