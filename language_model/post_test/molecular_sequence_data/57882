We report the identification and molecular characterization of zzso a zzso gene located at zzso on the zzso The deduced protein of zzso zzso acids contains eight zzso zzso repeats not described in zzso before, but lacks the zzso type III repeats and the zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso codes for a large transcript which exhibits extremely long zzso and 3' untranslated zzso zzso transcripts show a specific zzso zzso within cells and are mainly expressed in the central nervous system, in the brain and near muscle attachment sites during zzso During zzso zzso zzso is detected in the zzso These expression patterns are reminiscent of those of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences are also detected in other zzso of zzso and in various other organisms, indicating the existence of a family of genes related to zzso
