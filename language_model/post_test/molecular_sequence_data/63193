zzso analyses of zzso DNA zzso zzso and combined data have provided consistent support for many of the major branches within the zzso zzso zzso Here we use sequences from three zzso zzso to test the existing broad scale zzso and in an attempt to resolve several relationships that have remained zzso zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso analyses of a combined zzso data set recover trees broadly consistent with previous studies, although resolution and support are lower than in the largest zzso zzso Combining zzso and zzso data results in a generally zzso and very strongly supported zzso but the previously recognized problem areas zzso To investigate why these relationships have been difficult to resolve we conducted a series of experiments using different data partitions and zzso substitution zzso Usually more complex modeling schemes are favored regardless of the partitions recognized but model choice had little effect on zzso or support zzso In contrast there are consistent but zzso supported differences in the zzso recovered from coding and zzso zzso These conflicts directly zzso to relationships that were poorly resolved in analyses of the full combined zzso data zzso We suggest zzso signal has contributed to our inability to confidently resolve these problem zzso
