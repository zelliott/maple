Identification of adult fruit flies primarily involves microscopic examination of diagnostic zzso characters, while immature zzso such as larvae, can be more zzso One of the Australia's most serious zzso zzso the zzso Fruit zzso zzso zzso zzso is of particular zzso concern as the immature life stages occur within food produce and can be difficult to identify using zzso zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I zzso gene could be employed to increase the accuracy of fruit fly species zzso In our study, we tested the utility of standard DNA zzso techniques and found them to be problematic for zzso Fruit zzso which zzso possess a nuclear copy (a zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso that can be zzso and zzso as in previous zzso zzso analyses closely related zzso complex species appear zzso We found that the presence of a large deletion in the zzso copy of zzso allowed an alternative primer to be designed to only amplify the zzso zzso locus in zzso fruit zzso Comparisons of alternative commonly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II and zzso zzso revealed a similar level of variation to zzso however, zzso is the most zzso for DNA zzso given the large number of sequences from other zzso fruit fly species available for zzso zzso DNA zzso for the identification of problematic fly specimens provides a powerful tool to distinguish serious zzso fruit fly zzso zzso from endemic fly species of lesser zzso
