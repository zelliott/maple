We have previously demonstrated that the zzso regulation of human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression is, in part, the consequence of the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are expressed in the zzso whereas promoter II zzso appears to be the only active promoter in the corpus zzso zzso and zzso sex zzso tumors with zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso in zzso boys and zzso zzso in girls with zzso syndrome zzso have been previously zzso In the present study, we investigated the regulatory elements directing zzso gene zzso in samples of zzso from three zzso boys and a girl with zzso and an zzso zzso cell tumor from an adult woman, as well as in healthy fetal and adult zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue was used as a zzso Using zzso chain reaction linked to reverse zzso and northern zzso we determined the zzso use of various zzso promoters by analyzing specific zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate a universal zzso promoter zzso directs zzso gene expression in healthy fetal and adult zzso and zzso as well as in zzso of the zzso and an adult zzso zzso cell zzso These results are interpreted to mean that use of zzso in human zzso and zzso is preserved from the fetal period into adult life as well as in transformed zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, transcripts from zzso are specific for zzso (and to a much lesser extent, zzso In zzso zzso zzso is detected only in the zzso of zzso cells, whereas the zzso sex cords do not contain any zzso zzso These results further suggest that the markedly increased zzso expression of these transformed zzso cells is not a consequence of using different zzso zzso Rather it appears to involve zzso (or failure of zzso of the upstream regulatory elements of the same promoter, which is normally functional in all zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso
