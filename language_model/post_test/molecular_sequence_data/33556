zzso zzso an agent of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and causes an emerging zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso contains a large number of zzso genes zzso 44 zzso major zzso zzso and it is known that a specific zzso gene is predominantly transcribed from a single expression zzso This study successfully characterized the zzso expression site for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso ticks inhabiting a northern part of zzso Comparative analysis of the sequences revealed that the structures of the expression sites in Japanese zzso zzso were similar to those of US strains from human patients and European strains from a dog and zzso but zzso zzso from zzso and a truncated zzso zzso from zzso in the zzso expression site seemed to share similarities with those of US and European zzso The central zzso region sequences of Japanese zzso were found to be quite diverse zzso % zzso acid zzso and distinct from their closest relatives from US human patients or animal host origins zzso % zzso acid zzso with some zzso Thus, this study provides significant information about the molecular characteristics of zzso zzso in East Asia, as well as the global diversity of zzso
