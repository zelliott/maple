There are currently four crystal structures of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso available at the Brookhaven Data zzso 2 zzso from zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1994; zzso and zzso zzso and one from zzso zzso and another from zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso They consist of two zzso and one zzso and have been described to resemble a zzso right zzso The zzso zzso are two zzso zzso zzso which are located opposite to each other in an open active site zzso The zzso mechanism is thought to resemble that of the zzso zzso zzso The role of one zzso is to act as an zzso catalyst whereas the other is a zzso and zzso the reaction zzso Complex structures of zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and three zzso structures of zzso from zzso zzso with zzso derivatives zzso et zzso zzso have provided important information on zzso zzso Family zzso zzso show clear zzso acid zzso and thus have a common zzso However, variations in their functional properties, such as zzso activity, zzso zzso patterns, pH zzso and zzso zzso
