The zzso and zzso zzso domain is highly zzso in a large family of zzso zzso and is crucial for their functions in zzso trafficking, membrane dynamics and zzso zzso From a fetal brain zzso library, we isolated a zzso of zzso zzso zzso a novel human zzso zzso which was named as human zzso 1 zzso zzso The zzso had an open reading frame zzso of 3006 zzso zzso a putative 1001 zzso acid zzso The zzso gene was located on human zzso zzso and consisted of 25 zzso spanning about 73 zzso of the human zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso protein contained a zzso motif zzso which suggested the protein might be located in the cell zzso The expression pattern was examined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso which showed that the transcripts were highly expressed in the human brain, zzso zzso and zzso while lowly in the zzso small zzso colon and peripheral blood zzso In addition, the zzso result of and Northern zzso showed that the novel gene was highly expressed in the zzso of different grade zzso especially in that of lower grade ones, which suggested it might be zzso with the zzso
