We identified a previously zzso zzso zzso maturation 1 zzso zzso a protein exclusively expressed in the zzso of steps zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso This protein contains no known functional zzso and is highly zzso across zzso zzso Male mice deficient in zzso were completely zzso because of zzso zzso characterized by a bent head wrapped around by the neck and the middle piece of the zzso We show that lack of zzso causes failure of the zzso to become loose and zzso from the head and the neck region of the developing zzso zzso zzso components mechanically zzso the zzso of the zzso head and the stretching of the growing tail, leading to the zzso of the head in the neck, followed by the wrapping of the head by the neck or the middle piece of the zzso zzso Our study reveals that proper zzso removal is a genetically regulated process requiring the participation of zzso and that lack of zzso causes zzso deformation and male zzso
