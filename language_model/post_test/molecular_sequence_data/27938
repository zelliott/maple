zzso zzso zzso zzso contains five separate copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso All five sequences are flanked by paired basic zzso acid zzso sites and linked together by connecting zzso zzso to synthetic zzso and zzso were used to investigate zzso processing in the zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso analysis of adult rat pancreatic extracts showed the presence of a major zzso zzso zzso at the position of zzso An additional peak zzso with zzso than zzso (less than zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso extended form of zzso zzso of zzso in pancreatic extracts indicated the presence of 22 zzso zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso zzso than zzso Treatment of rats with zzso markedly reduced the pancreatic content of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Light microscopic zzso showed that zzso zzso was exclusively located within zzso cells of the pancreatic zzso At the electron microscopic level, zzso zzso appeared to be concentrated in zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that processing of zzso generates both zzso and zzso peptides in the adult rat zzso Our data also indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso are the major source of zzso and zzso zzso
