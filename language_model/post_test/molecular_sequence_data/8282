We previously suggested that zzso 62 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a putative collagen zzso by the studies on zzso and zzso zzso in a patient zzso with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso who showed defective zzso zzso zzso zzso we confirm that zzso zzso zzso is a specific membrane protein recognized by zzso zzso using an improved zzso zzso To further study the functional role of this zzso a crude zzso fraction zzso was obtained from human zzso by serial zzso including zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso This zzso diminished the zzso activity of collagen and of zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso showed that it contained zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso molecules had a molecular weight similar to zzso on zzso However, zzso was also expressed on zzso zzso zzso both on zzso and flow zzso zzso Thus, zzso seems to be different from zzso
