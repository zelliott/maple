A novel zzso zzso zzso for the zzso detection of DNA with higher sensitivity and higher discrimination ability was described in zzso This DNA zzso is based on zzso detection strategy, which operates via a concept called zzso zzso processes zzso zzso encompasses a design strategy zzso two zzso that do not zzso to each other at a specific temperature can be made to zzso to each other in the presence of a template zzso via the formation of a zzso complex zzso junction zzso The resulting structure that forms after the zzso zzso then was detected by zzso method with zzso as signal zzso We demonstrated that the formation of zzso junction structure brings more zzso to the zzso surface via zzso interaction and results in an increasing zzso zzso The increasing zzso signal sensitively reflects the concentration of target DNA and shows a good linear relationship with the concentration of target zzso By employing above strategy, this DNA zzso could detect as low as zzso zzso target DNA and exhibited high discrimination ability even against zzso zzso In addition, this novel DNA zzso is easy to zzso and convenient to operate, and shows good stability, zzso and zzso
