Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from rice zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso full-length clone zzso 321 zzso acids zzso zzso while zzso is zzso zzso long and is a partial zzso clone zzso 314 zzso zzso These two deduced zzso acid sequences share zzso identity, and display a high degree of sequence identity zzso with previously isolated zzso of zzso zzso The zzso location studies show that zzso is positioned on the long arm of zzso 9, while zzso on the long arm of zzso 2 of rice zzso A marked increase in the level of zzso transcript was observed in zzso zzso rice zzso whereas the zzso zzso was greatly accumulated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor studies indicated that zzso promotion of the zzso zzso was not zzso through the action of zzso zzso Thus, it appears that there are two groups of zzso zzso transcripts in rice plants, either zzso or zzso The zzso zzso expression was partially inhibited by zzso while zzso induction of zzso zzso was completely blocked by zzso These results indicate that the expression of zzso zzso genes is regulated by complex hormonal networks in a gene specific manner in rice zzso zzso acid, a potent inhibitor of protein zzso effectively suppressed the zzso induction of zzso zzso suggesting that protein zzso plays a role in the induction of zzso zzso by zzso A scheme of the multiple regulatory pathways for the expression of zzso zzso gene family by zzso zzso and protein zzso is zzso
