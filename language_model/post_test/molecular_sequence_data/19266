Recent experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso can be zzso to a zzso state when fused to zzso The resulting hybrids are zzso as judged by zzso zzso but detailed analyses of the underlying zzso control of zzso zzso in such hybrids are required to better understand zzso zzso We produced hybrids of mouse zzso and zzso that, although nearly zzso exhibit characteristics of normal zzso including apparent zzso in culture, zzso colony zzso and zzso Comprehensive analysis of the mouse embryonic zzso hybrid zzso revealed global patterns of gene expression reminiscent of zzso However, combined analysis of zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed at least seven distinct classes of zzso regulated genes in comparisons of hybrids, zzso and zzso zzso The largest class includes zzso genes that are silenced in hybrids and zzso but a smaller class includes genes that are expressed at nearly equivalent levels in hybrids and zzso that contain many genes implicated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes are distributed throughout the zzso zzso events include both zzso zzso and zzso of genes residing on zzso of zzso zzso zzso hybrid cell lines resemble their zzso zzso partners in terms of behavior in culture and zzso However, they contain unique expression profiles that are similar but not identical to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a zzso system for the investigation of mechanisms of zzso Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this zzso
