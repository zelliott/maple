To obtain zzso zzso related to zzso zzso we screened strains from zzso zzso grown on zzso MRS zzso for zzso to a fluorescent zzso zzso DNA zzso Six strains were isolated and further characterized by zzso and molecular zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They had similar zzso characteristics and displayed zzso zzso zzso values of zzso % to each other, indicating that they belong to a single zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the novel zzso were members of zzso zzso group I, which includes zzso zzso the type species of the zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso (99 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were the nearest relatives of the novel zzso but their zzso zzso was found to be lower than 49 zzso One of the zzso strain zzso was further characterized using zzso and zzso zzso Together, the results enabled zzso and zzso differentiation of strain zzso from the other species that showed zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values greater than 97 zzso zzso zzso merits species status and the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
