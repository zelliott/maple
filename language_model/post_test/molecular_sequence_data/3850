Loss of or lowered zzso zzso expression has been included as a zzso indicator in breast zzso Low or no zzso expression is seen most commonly in high-grade breast zzso suggesting that a relationship may exist between loss of zzso and a less differentiated state, high proliferation rate, and high zzso zzso In this study, we compared zzso function in two established breast zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and in an established immortalized zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso were synchronized in zzso and were released for several zzso at which time total zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex formation were zzso zzso protein was significantly higher in the tumor cells than in zzso zzso However, zzso function was high for a longer duration in zzso cells as compared with zzso and zzso zzso Our data support the general conclusion that zzso function, but not necessarily zzso zzso is lower in highly zzso breast zzso cells as compared with lower grade tumor zzso These results emphasize the relevance of assessing zzso function over zzso zzso This is particularly important if zzso is to be used as a zzso indicator for breast zzso
