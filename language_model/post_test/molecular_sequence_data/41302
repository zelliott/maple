zzso response factors zzso are important zzso factors that form a side branch of the zzso signaling zzso and have been linked to zzso processes during zzso zzso proteins are defined as belonging to a specific zzso factor family by the presence of an zzso zzso domain and can be distinguished within this family by a zzso zzso domain involved in zzso zzso Here we further zzso zzso into five distinct zzso zzso represented across all major zzso zzso zzso sequences within each zzso contain a zzso zzso region distinct from other zzso suggesting ancient evolutionary divergence and specialization within this gene zzso zzso patterns of zzso regulation support these zzso zzso Despite these important differences, zzso appear to show preferential zzso or targeting to vascular tissue in quantitative real-time zzso and reporter line analyses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue expression within the zzso often appears the strongest in zzso reporter lines, and an analysis of zzso promoter sequences revealed conservation and significant enrichment of zzso targeting zzso suggesting a potential role for zzso in this zzso An examination of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso revealed zzso in higher order vein zzso This supports both the general link of zzso to vascular tissue and zzso differences between zzso since zzso in vascular patterning appear to be zzso zzso Together these findings indicate that zzso are potential regulators of zzso processes associated with vascular zzso
