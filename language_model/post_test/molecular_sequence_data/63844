Most zzso zzso families exert their function by means of a zzso common secondary zzso The zzso data base contains more than five hundred structurally zzso zzso zzso Unfortunately, searching for new family members using zzso models zzso is very time zzso zzso approaches that use the sequence conservation to reduce the number of CM searches, are fast, but it is unknown to which zzso 

We present a new filtering approach, which exploits the family specific secondary structure and significantly reduces the number of CM zzso The filter eliminates approximately zzso of the queries and zzso only zzso true zzso when evaluating zzso against zzso First results also capture previously zzso zzso zzso in a recent human zzso zzso 

The zzso shape index filter zzso is based on the following zzso An zzso family is zzso by structure, much more zzso than by sequence zzso zzso of individual family members, which naturally have different length and sequence zzso may exhibit structural variation in detail, but overall, they have a common shape in a more abstract zzso Given a fixed release of the zzso data base, we can zzso these abstract shapes for all zzso This is called a shape zzso If a query sequence belongs to a certain family, it must be able to fold into the family shape with reasonable free zzso zzso rather than matching the query against all families in the data base, we can first (and zzso zzso its feasible zzso and use the shape index to access only those families where a good match is possible due to a common shape with the zzso
