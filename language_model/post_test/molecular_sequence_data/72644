Previously we have isolated a zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso zzso zzso In the present report we describe a new zzso clone called zzso (or zzso from a zzso embryonic zzso zzso analysis indicates that these two clones share an zzso zzso zzso including a region of zzso domain, three copies of a repeat first found in complement proteins zzso and an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso protein has an additional copy of an zzso sequence followed by two copies of complement 1 zzso repeat in the zzso The overall protein structure predicted from the zzso sequence reveals that it encodes a protein zzso to zzso zzso Three zzso transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by northern zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso transcript zzso specifically with zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso transcripts zzso with zzso In zzso a major function of zzso is to augment the activity of the zzso gene product, a close relative of tumor growth factor zzso zzso members, zzso Although zzso and zzso are detected in various adult zzso of zzso the expression pattern of these two genes was not tightly zzso In the zzso the expression of zzso increased gradually from the zzso to the swimming zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso at the zzso stage caused an zzso of the zzso marginal zone zzso and converted zzso blood cells to zzso and muscle zzso at later zzso It was shown that zzso was less active and a zzso zzso lacking the signal sequence was zzso Further studies revealed that injection of zzso zzso into the zzso marginal zone induced zzso of zzso marginal zone zzso such as zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso may have a role in determining zzso patterning in zzso but in a different way from the zzso system demonstrated in zzso
