The zzso acid sequence of the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso hydride zzso transfer between zzso and zzso coupled to zzso zzso across the zzso inner zzso has been deduced from the corresponding zzso Two clones were isolated by screening a bovine zzso zzso zzso library, using two synthetic zzso and a zzso restriction zzso as zzso The zzso together covered zzso base pairs of coding zzso corresponding to zzso zzso acid zzso However, the reading frame at the zzso end was still zzso zzso sequence analysis of the isolated zzso indicated the presence of 8 additional zzso Thus, the mature zzso appeared to have zzso zzso acid zzso and a calculated molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso contained the sequences of four zzso peptides that had been isolated from the zzso Two of these were the peptides that had been used for construction of the zzso zzso The other two were zzso peptides isolated after labeling the zzso site of the zzso once with zzso zzso and another time with zzso The zzso zzso was found to be located immediately upstream of the zzso zzso about 230 zzso from the N zzso One of the zzso peptides used for zzso probe construction was the same as that labeled with zzso when the zzso site was protected from zzso zzso This zzso which might be at the zzso site of the zzso was located very near the C zzso of the zzso The central region of the zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso and appears to comprise about 14 zzso zzso By comparison, the zzso and the zzso regions of the zzso which contain the zzso and the putative zzso sites, respectively, are relatively zzso and are probably located outside the zzso inner membrane on the zzso zzso There is considerable zzso between the bovine zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso alpha with Mr zzso zzso and beta with Mr zzso zzso whose zzso acid sequence has been determined from the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Bragg, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
