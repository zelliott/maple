zzso recovery at a natural gas production plant in Japan involved the addition of zzso acid for pH adjustment, resulting in an additional about 200 zzso of zzso in the waste brine after zzso zzso zzso occurred at the waste brine injection well, causing a decrease in well zzso To examine the factors that contribute to zzso an on-site experiment was conducted by amending 10 L of brine with different conditions and then zzso the brine for 5 months under open zzso The control case was exposed to open air but did not receive additional zzso When zzso addition was coupled with low zzso there was a drastic increase in the total amount of accumulated biomass (and subsequently the risk of zzso that was nearly six times higher than the zzso The zzso zzso rate of carbon steel was zzso zzso which is four times higher than that observed under other zzso Analysis of the microbial communities by zzso zzso gel zzso revealed that the additional zzso established a sulfur cycle and induced the growth of zzso bacteria, including zzso and purple zzso In the presence of zzso and low zzso levels, zzso and purple bacteria zzso and the zzso of abundant biomass may have created a more conducive environment for zzso zzso zzso It is believed that the higher zzso rate was caused by a differential zzso cell that was established by the zzso distribution of the biomass that covered the surface of the test zzso
