zzso protein in mouse and man was recently found to be highly zzso zzso Here we zzso an zzso of this zzso zzso from zzso zzso to assess the conservation and thus likely importance of these zzso zzso showed the presence of six sites of zzso zzso five sites of zzso zzso and one zzso of zzso Many modifications on zzso showed either complete conservation with those on human or mouse zzso were present on nearby zzso and/or were present in the same zzso The conservation of zzso zzso an unusual zzso was of particular note and suggests a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites in human, mouse and zzso zzso zzso along with zzso sites zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso occurs in zzso and DE motifs or other small regions of zzso zzso zzso The conservation of zzso zzso in the same protein between zzso man and zzso suggests the presence of a zzso zzso protein zzso and that the modification is of functional zzso
