zzso zzso A zzso a chemically zzso zzso is the most sensitive marker protein of the acute phase and the precursor of zzso zzso which is characterized by deposits of zzso A protein zzso We investigated the zzso of the zzso gene family in one individual by sequencing 11 zzso clones from an zzso zzso zzso At least five different zzso zzso were deduced from six different zzso The 3' untranslated gene segments fall into two groups, based on zzso sequence and zzso in zzso Various zzso and zzso acid zzso were found predominantly in the 3' zzso Some of these zzso are unique and increase the number of zzso zzso in one individual to at least zzso Moreover, zzso DNA of four individuals was examined by analysis of zzso length zzso Besides two zzso strongly zzso bands, additional zzso bands were observed, indicating zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Finally, three different zzso species were detected by zzso analysis, a finding that might be of relevance for the stability of zzso zzso
