The zzso (for zzso zzso gene product is involved in the signal zzso cascade leading to both systemic acquired resistance zzso and zzso disease resistance in zzso We have isolated and characterized five new zzso of zzso that show a range of zzso from zzso impaired in chemically induced zzso zzso gene expression and zzso resistance to very strongly zzso We have isolated the zzso gene by using a zzso cloning zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein shows sequence zzso to the zzso signal zzso factor I zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B signaling pathways are implicated in disease resistance responses in a range of organisms from zzso to zzso suggesting that the zzso signaling zzso in plants is representative of an ancient and ubiquitous defense mechanism in higher zzso
