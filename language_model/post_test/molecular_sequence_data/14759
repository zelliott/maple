We report the zzso of six Australian zzso of zzso disease zzso zzso isolated between 1992 and 2004 and association of zzso with zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso specific pathogen free chickens were challenged at day 5 with 500 plaque forming units of zzso disease zzso The zzso induced gross zzso disease zzso in 53 to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso induced a protective index ranging from 38 to zzso by 56 days post zzso This experiment provides evidence that current Australian zzso of zzso vary significantly in zzso However, there was no clear evidence that the most virulent recent zzso were more zzso than zzso from the 1980s or that any of the zzso belong to the highest zzso category of very virulent zzso Evidence is presented that zzso can be predicted by zzso taken as early as 13 days post zzso The zzso gene sequences of five of the zzso used in the experiment were zzso When compared with the very virulent US isolate zzso there was a 177 zzso zzso and distinct point zzso in each of the five zzso There were no individual zzso in the zzso sequences that correlated with levels of zzso However, zzso acid alignment of the five Australian and 14 international zzso revealed that the number of repeat sequences of four zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso range 2 to 8) was strongly associated with zzso across all zzso with the most zzso zzso having the fewest number of zzso The results suggest that the presence of the 177 zzso zzso alone is not an indicator of zzso Rather, the number of zzso repeats, independent of the presence of the zzso is a better indicator of zzso
