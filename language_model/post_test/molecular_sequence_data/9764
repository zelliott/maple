The loss of zzso tumor zzso functions results in genetic instability, characteristically associated with changes in zzso zzso and gene zzso In zzso we find that cells from various zzso of 4 to zzso old zzso zzso mice display zzso and frequent gene amplification as well as evidence for zzso Regardless of tissue types, many zzso cells contain multiple zzso and zzso formed zzso zzso Thus, zzso instability in zzso may be associated with abnormal zzso zzso Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the number of cells zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with previous studies showing that zzso zzso is associated with gene amplification in zzso many of the zzso cells zzso in the same cell, zzso zzso and amplified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was frequently observed in cells isolated from zzso zzso The zzso cells contained zzso amplified zzso displayed zzso high levels of zzso zzso as well as gene zzso These results indicate that a high number of zzso cells is eliminated by zzso pathways in zzso
