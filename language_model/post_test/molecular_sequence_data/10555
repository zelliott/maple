zzso is a large zzso zzso expressed by the human zzso and zzso zzso In this zzso we present details of the deduced protein structure of zzso The zzso zzso domain is zzso zzso in zzso including zzso zzso of a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain with zzso to the zzso growth factor zzso -like structural motifs found in many zzso The region of zzso located upstream of the previously described zzso pair zzso tandem repeats, which zzso a major zzso and zzso domain, consists of a second type of repetitive structure with an imperfect zzso of approximately zzso zzso This domain is also zzso and appears to be considerably larger than 2000 zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene itself is large and zzso Using pulse field gel zzso and zzso analysis, the smallest zzso found that contained all human zzso DNA zzso to the zzso tandem repeat probe was 200 zzso with restriction zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso produced two sets of zzso fragments that were zzso within the human population with a pattern suggestive of both a variation in the number of tandem repeats zzso and sequence zzso These fragments varied independently of each other, but no genetic zzso was detected in a study of 40 human zzso Thus, the zzso gene encodes a very large zzso with a structure very different from that of any zzso currently zzso
