The small zzso of the zzso family play a key role in zzso zzso zzso In plants, a novel zzso zzso called zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso In zzso 12 zzso zzso have been identified which differ mainly at their zzso To test the zzso of two members of this zzso zzso and zzso we have generated zzso zzso with the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso cells revealed a zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso region, while zzso was localized almost exclusively to the plasma zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso produced a change in zzso As zzso are known to bind to the zzso of zzso of the zzso family, we searched for zzso zzso zzso We identified the zzso gene and mapped it to zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein which contains highly zzso zzso acids in the zzso binding pocket and exhibits zzso to 37% similarity to known zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was expressed in all zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we showed specific interaction of zzso with both zzso and zzso as well as with their zzso zzso but not with a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso could bind zzso from transgenic tobacco zzso cell zzso confirming the interaction observed with the zzso zzso
