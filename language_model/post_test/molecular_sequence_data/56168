The zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso and zzso zzso the two first zzso of the zzso branch of the zzso zzso acid family, were cloned from the DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two genes were clustered in a zzso zzso zzso but were separated by an open reading frame of 750 zzso The protein zzso by this open reading frame had little similarity to any protein in the data banks, and its function remains zzso The three genes were translated in zzso coli, giving the corresponding zzso
