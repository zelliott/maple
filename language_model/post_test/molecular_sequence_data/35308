An zzso zzso element in zzso zzso II, the trigger loop zzso has been suggested to play an important role in the zzso rate, zzso of selection of the matched zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso In response to zzso zzso the zzso zzso large zzso changes to switch between distinct open and closed states to tighten the active site and avail zzso A zzso strategy for characterizing the zzso transition zzso is presented to bridge the open and closed states of the zzso Information from a large number of independent zzso molecular dynamics zzso from zzso replica exchange and targeted molecular dynamics simulations is gathered together to assemble a connectivity map of the zzso zzso The results show that with a zzso zzso zzso closing should be a spontaneous zzso One major intermediate state is identified along the zzso transition pathway, and the key structural features are zzso The complete zzso from the open zzso to the closed zzso provides a clear picture of the zzso zzso
