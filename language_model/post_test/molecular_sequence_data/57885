The Max protein belongs to the basic zzso zzso family of zzso zzso Max zzso with zzso family proteins to form zzso zzso zzso In order to zzso the potential role of zzso and Max during zzso zzso we have isolated and analyzed the expression of two zzso Max complementary zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with their zzso counterparts demonstrates a zzso high degree of conservation at both the zzso and zzso acid levels, with the exception of a zzso deletion in both zzso proteins within their zzso zzso In addition, the two zzso Max proteins differ in that zzso contains a unique zzso acid zzso that interrupts the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso lacks this zzso Despite these differences, both zzso and zzso can form complexes with either zzso or human zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression during zzso reveals that both zzso and protein are expressed throughout early development, including the egg, zzso stage, and zzso zzso Although the expression of zzso zzso appears to predominate at all stages zzso the ratios of zzso to zzso protein vary during development as well as between different tissue culture cell lines, suggesting a potential for cell zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the presence of zzso Max throughout zzso development, raising the possibility that zzso and Max could function as a complex even during early zzso
