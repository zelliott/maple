L-shaped structures formed by two consecutive zzso joined by short connections are zzso The zzso with the alpha m gamma zzso alpha zzso are of particular value since they usually have Pro zzso in the second positions of the second zzso These structures can be divided into two classes, the zzso and zzso zzso depending on whether the second zzso is located on the right or the left, relative to the first one when viewed from the zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that in an ideal case the zzso and zzso zzso should have different sequence patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These sequence patterns can be used in the prediction of the L-shaped structures as well as in protein design and zzso
