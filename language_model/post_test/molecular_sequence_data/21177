zzso systems zzso are key regulatory pathways allowing bacteria to adapt their genetic expression to environmental zzso zzso a zzso zzso antibiotic, binds to zzso zzso the zzso carrier for cell wall zzso effectively zzso zzso zzso We have identified a novel and previously zzso zzso in the major human pathogen zzso zzso that we show to be essential for zzso and zzso zzso the zzso system zzso resistance zzso zzso The zzso genes are located immediately upstream from genes zzso an ABC zzso accordingly designated zzso We have shown that the zzso module is a key zzso and zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso In the presence of low zzso zzso zzso activate zzso of two zzso zzso ABC zzso zzso and zzso We identified a highly zzso imperfect zzso sequence upstream from the zzso and zzso promoter zzso essential for their zzso zzso by zzso suggesting it is the likely zzso binding zzso We demonstrated that the two ABC zzso play distinct and original roles in zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso sensing and zzso through zzso whereas zzso acts specifically as a zzso module and is sufficient to zzso zzso and zzso resistance when produced on its zzso We show that these processes require functional zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso and that the large zzso loop of zzso zzso its specificity in zzso zzso This is the first example of a zzso associated with two ABC zzso playing separate roles in signal zzso and zzso zzso
