The interaction between four zzso zzso zzso zzso and human alpha zzso was zzso The zzso activity of the zzso toxins zzso zzso and zzso against the large molecular weight protein zzso gelatin type I and collagen type IV, was completely inhibited by alpha zzso The zzso activity of zzso against the same zzso was not significantly zzso Each mole of alpha zzso bound zzso 2 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso These zzso zzso with alpha zzso rapidly at 22 degrees zzso Rate zzso based on intrinsic zzso zzso were zzso X zzso zzso zzso for interaction of alpha zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso for the interaction of alpha zzso with zzso zzso zzso with alpha zzso very slowly at 22 degrees zzso zzso the temperature to 37 degrees C and zzso the time of interaction with alpha zzso resulted in the formation of Mr 90,000 fragments and high molecular weight complexes (Mr greater than zzso in which zzso is zzso bound to the zzso zzso of alpha zzso The identification of the sites of specific zzso of alpha zzso shows that the zzso sites for the four zzso are within the bait region of alpha zzso zzso and zzso cleave only at one site, the zzso zzso bond, which is also the site of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso primarily at the same site, but a secondary zzso site at the zzso zzso bond was also zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
