The region zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso II, a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso was previously shown to constitute a zzso binding site, and to be associated with its toxic zzso The corresponding synthetic zzso zzso was coupled to diphtheria zzso as a carrier, and zzso as an zzso in mice, to explore the possible protection from the zzso activity induced by zzso II in zzso Mice receiving zzso injections produced zzso to zzso zzso which zzso to zzso II, as determined by zzso In contrast, no zzso against zzso zzso were detected in mice zzso with zzso II, despite the strong zzso response to the whole zzso Thus, region zzso of zzso II is not an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso After zzso with zzso zzso or zzso II, mice were challenged with zzso II, and the extent of zzso was estimated by determining their plasma zzso zzso activity, in comparison to zzso zzso After the challenge, both the group zzso with zzso II, and the group zzso with zzso zzso had a significant reduction of zzso These results demonstrate that region zzso of zzso II constitutes a zzso zzso and provide further evidence for the relevance of this region in its zzso effect in zzso
