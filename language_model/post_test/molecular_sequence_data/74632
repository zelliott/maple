The characteristics of a zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying specificity for zzso zzso zzso were defined using molecular zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso was found to be prevalent in zzso zzso subspecies zzso isolated from cases of bovine zzso and septic arthritis in zzso zzso was able to activate zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not human zzso zzso acid sequence analysis identified a limited level of zzso to other zzso zzso including zzso however, zzso was found to align well with and match in size the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate interaction with bovine zzso leading to formation of an zzso complex that was capable of recruiting and converting further zzso zzso into zzso Individual zzso peptides of zzso or bovine zzso were found to block the interaction between zzso and bovine zzso preventing the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso based upon structures of zzso zzso with human zzso supported these findings by placing critical zzso in close proximity to the zzso component of the zzso zzso
