zzso required zzso plasticity of zzso proteins implies that specific structural motifs have been integrated in zzso zzso zzso a database of zzso zzso and the large family of zzso coupled receptors we identified a series of overrepresented motifs zzso Pro with either zzso or zzso Thus, we have studied the zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso by molecular dynamics simulations in a zzso zzso Analysis of the simulations shows that zzso or zzso can significantly zzso the deformation of the zzso A series of zzso such as zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and the TAP and zzso motifs in the zzso zzso induce an increase in zzso angle of the zzso compared to a standard zzso apparently due to the additional hydrogen bond formed between the side chain of zzso and the backbone zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso decrease the zzso angle of the zzso by either reducing the zzso clash between the zzso ring of Pro and the zzso zzso or by adding a zzso in the form of a hydrogen bond in the zzso face of the zzso Together with a number of available experimental data, our results strongly suggest that association of zzso and zzso with Pro is commonly used in zzso zzso to accommodate the structural needs of specific zzso
