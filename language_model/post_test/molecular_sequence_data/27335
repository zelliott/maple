zzso zzso regulators zzso form the largest family of bacterial regulators acting as both zzso and zzso of target zzso controlling zzso involved in a wide variety of cellular zzso The zzso zzso from the human pathogen zzso zzso is zzso during zzso cell zzso Here, we report the crystal structures of both regulatory domain and full-length zzso the first of a novel zzso of zzso that form zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis and zzso zzso established that the zzso form of zzso is the zzso species in solution in both the presence and absence of an zzso encompassing the zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of the isolated zzso complex by mass zzso showed stabilization of a double zzso species upon DNA zzso Based on the observed structure and the mass zzso findings, a model is proposed in which a zzso array of two zzso zzso binds to its DNA target zzso
