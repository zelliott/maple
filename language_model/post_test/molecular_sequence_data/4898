In an effort to identify cellular zzso that mimic the action of zzso large zzso we performed replication protein A zzso affinity zzso on cell extracts from the mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso In this way, a novel DNA zzso was isolated and zzso to near zzso The most zzso zzso showed the presence of two proteins of 28 and 21 zzso Both proteins zzso with zzso partially duplex DNA when bound to zzso zzso and were efficiently zzso zzso to zzso zzso activity was strongly zzso by zzso on DNA zzso containing duplex regions longer than 18 zzso Only weak stimulation was observed in the presence of zzso coli single strand DNA binding protein zzso The zzso zzso DNA in the zzso direction in relation to the strand to which it zzso Only zzso and zzso were efficient as zzso zzso zzso and showed similar zzso values of approximately zzso zzso The properties of this zzso suggest that it may take part in reactions zzso by zzso such as those predicted to occur at replication zzso or alternatively may function during DNA repair or zzso
