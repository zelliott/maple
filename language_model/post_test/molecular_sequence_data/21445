zzso zzso D infections have been associated with rapid disease progression and zzso zzso have shown that zzso viruses are very zzso Recent studies indicate that the zzso zzso used routinely to assess zzso zzso may lack accuracy for non-B zzso Little is known about the zzso zzso of zzso zzso D zzso 

We determined the zzso zzso usage for 32 patients infected with zzso D by both a zzso virus zzso entry zzso and zzso sequencing to determine the correlation between zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso and that of the combined zzso and net charge rule was zzso for predicting zzso D zzso zzso but their zzso were poor zzso and zzso We have identified zzso D zzso in the zzso region associated with zzso use and built a new simple zzso rule for zzso the zzso prediction of zzso zzso D zzso We validated this zzso using an independent zzso data set of 67 zzso D zzso sequences of viruses of known zzso The zzso D zzso zzso was zzso sensitive and zzso specific for predicting zzso viruses in this data set, approaching the performance of zzso prediction of zzso zzso B zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso D zzso usage are slightly different from those for zzso B zzso zzso predictions based on a zzso zzso zzso appear to be preferable for characterizing zzso usage in zzso and zzso zzso
