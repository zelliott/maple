zzso of the control of DNA replication and zzso is considered to be a major cause of zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism that controls DNA replication and zzso stability, we used the zzso zzso technique zzso to eliminate the zzso zzso zzso from Schneider zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso cells leads to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso with cells containing single giant zzso and partial zzso between zzso and zzso DNA zzso The effect of zzso zzso is completely suppressed by zzso of Double parked zzso the zzso zzso of zzso a replication factor to which zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is also partially suppressed by zzso of zzso indicating the involvement of zzso in the checkpoint control in response to zzso We found that the zzso of zzso A, but not of zzso B, also promotes the formation of a giant nucleus and zzso However, in contrast to the effect of zzso zzso zzso A zzso leads to the complete zzso of the zzso from zzso to zzso We observed that the zzso of zzso causes rapid zzso of zzso which may contribute to the observed partial zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso A and zzso double knockout suggests that the effect of zzso A zzso is dominant over that of zzso zzso for cell cycle arrest and zzso Together, our studies indicate that both zzso A and zzso are required for the suppression of zzso and for zzso stability in zzso zzso
