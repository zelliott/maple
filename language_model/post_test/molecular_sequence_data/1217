Cell survival after DNA damage depends on specialized DNA zzso able to perform DNA synthesis on imperfect zzso Most of these zzso belong to the recently discovered zzso of DNA zzso none of which has been previously described in zzso We report here the isolation, functional characterization and expression analysis of a plant representative of the zzso This zzso which we have termed zzso is a zzso of zzso coli pol IV and human pol zzso and thus belongs to the zzso zzso We zzso zzso and found a zzso DNA zzso endowed with limited zzso that is able to extend zzso zzso The activity and zzso of zzso are enhanced markedly upon deletion of 193 zzso acids zzso from its zzso zzso zzso Loss of this region also affects the zzso selectivity of the zzso leading to the incorporation of both zzso and zzso opposite A in the zzso We detected three zzso forms, which result from the alternative zzso of zzso zzso and have distinct patterns of expression in different plant zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity in transgenic plants revealed that the zzso promoter is active in zzso cells, suggesting a possible role during consecutive DNA replication cycles in the absence of zzso
