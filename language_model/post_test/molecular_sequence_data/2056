The normal zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein gene zzso requires the interaction of a zzso and zzso regulatory zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso promoter in zzso transformed lines shows that induction of an zzso fusion gene is normal if sequences from zzso to zzso are replaced by those of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso are necessary for this expression but there is internal zzso within this region as two distinct upstream sequences of 18 and 22 zzso respectively are sufficient for zzso and zzso zzso albeit at reduced zzso A point zzso at zzso eliminates the zzso repression of the zzso promoter at zzso We report zzso of expression within the zzso zzso for a number of zzso transformed zzso
