zzso sequencing revealed that zzso the structural gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso genetic zzso The latter consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcribed from a 245 zzso regulatory region, each zzso an zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is transcribed from a zzso PA promoter, and a zzso zzso promoter which is zzso controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhancement of zzso and zzso respectively, suggest that these promoters control functions which antagonize each zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by a PA zzso The regulatory region comprises four zzso zzso present as two inverse zzso zzso zzso exhibits high zzso to analogous zzso zzso while zzso shows zzso zzso with the product of zzso coli zzso which is part of a regulatory unit involved in sugar zzso zzso zzso and zzso which define different zzso zzso patterns, were zzso They are transitions leading to substitution of zzso acids which occupy zzso positions, and are thus likely to be part of an zzso active zzso The nature of the possible receptors for defective zzso zzso and zzso is zzso
