The zzso relationships of all zzso described species of the zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso were analyzed by sequencing and comparing zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso exhibited a mean sequence similarity value of zzso corresponding to differences at 50 zzso positions on zzso The species of the zzso zzso exhibited relatively high levels of overall sequence zzso the mean similarity value was zzso which zzso to an average of 14 mutual zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso a group containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso clustered apart from the main zzso core, whereas zzso zzso formed a third zzso zzso Due to the very restricted zzso in zzso zzso sequences within the zzso zzso zzso signatures that have possible diagnostic value for zzso the zzso species could not be determined with zzso When sequence similarities were compared with zzso pairing data determined zzso there was only a limited zzso This illustrates the different resolving powers of the techniques for determining zzso zzso and for species zzso
