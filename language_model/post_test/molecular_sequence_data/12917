Although substance P is known to take part in the regulation of the anterior zzso no conclusive evidence for the expression of the zzso zzso zzso has been found yet in the zzso or zzso derived zzso With the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso method we could detect the low abundant transcripts of the zzso zzso in the rat zzso and in the zzso cell line zzso zzso Furthermore, the functional expression of the zzso zzso in zzso cells was confirmed by zzso of the zzso second zzso system when the cells were treated with substance zzso In addition, binding studies also indicated the functional expression of this zzso in zzso zzso Thus we provide the first evidence that the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells and the rat zzso
