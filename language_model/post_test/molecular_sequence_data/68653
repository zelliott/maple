Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes has proven to be important for detection of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso To improve the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we carefully determined the precise restriction map of the joining zzso and constant zzso region of the zzso zzso and evaluated relevant combinations of restriction zzso with zzso and C zzso zzso Our extensive Southern zzso analyses revealed that zzso in the zzso region are zzso zzso by use of a zzso probe in combination with at least two restriction zzso zzso which are not affected by zzso and which produce small zzso bands zzso zzso and zzso thereby reducing the chance of zzso of zzso and/or rearranged zzso Application of a zzso or a C zzso probe in combination with zzso or zzso zzso should be avoided, because of the large size of the restriction fragments and the occurrence of zzso zzso of different types of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso signals, independent of the rearranged zzso gene segment, are only obtained if the zzso probe is complementary to the 3' zzso sequences of the zzso gene region, such as our zzso zzso
