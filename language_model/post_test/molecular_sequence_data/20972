zzso tract binding protein zzso is a widely expressed zzso binding zzso In the nucleus zzso regulates the zzso of alternative zzso while in the zzso it can affect zzso stability, translation, and zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and to zzso in the cellular edge of mouse zzso zzso during zzso to zzso and the early stages of cell zzso This zzso zzso is associated with transcripts zzso the focal zzso scaffolding proteins zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso and that zzso depletion reduces zzso zzso at the cellular edge and limits the size of focal zzso The loss of zzso also alters cell zzso and limits the ability of cells to spread after zzso These data indicate that during the initial stages of cell zzso zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso and influences focal zzso formation through coordinated control of scaffolding protein zzso
