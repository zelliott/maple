zzso is a zzso enriched zzso zzso thought to function in synaptic zzso zzso in part through interactions with the zzso zzso 3 domain of zzso We have used zzso zzso from zzso cells after zzso zzso expression in overlay zzso to identify two major zzso proteins in rat zzso The first, at 125 zzso is zzso The second, at 40 zzso is the major zzso protein zzso is highly enriched in brain, is concentrated in a soluble synaptic zzso and zzso with zzso The zzso protein does not bind to a zzso construct lacking the zzso C zzso suggesting that its interaction with zzso is zzso through an zzso zzso 3 zzso The zzso zzso protein was partially zzso from rat brain zzso through a three-step procedure involving ammonium zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis identified the zzso protein as zzso a member of a novel family of zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso These data suggest an important role for zzso in synaptic zzso zzso
