zzso specific regulation of the chicken zzso locus is achieved by a combination of positive and negative zzso zzso Here we describe the molecular characterization of a newly discovered zzso element located zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is activated early in zzso zzso as indicated by zzso reorganization in zzso precursor zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso specificity of expression is achieved by a combination of zzso with ubiquitous zzso activity and zzso zzso The zzso contains binding sites for members of the nuclear factor I zzso family and a yet unknown zzso We could show by in zzso zzso that the zzso expressed factors occupy their binding sites only in zzso expressing zzso We conclude that a specific zzso architecture may be responsible for the differential activity of the zzso
