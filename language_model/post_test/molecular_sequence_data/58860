zzso an zzso filament capping zzso and zzso a component of zzso zzso are known to have 350 zzso regions of significant sequence similarity near their zzso zzso et zzso 1995, zzso J zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that these regions are zzso not only to each other, but also to the zzso domain of a putative protein zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and to other zzso We propose that the zzso portion of the zzso region of zzso and zzso represents a distinct zzso A detailed sequence comparison indicates that the zzso domain in zzso is unlikely to exhibit zzso activity, whereas in zzso it may possess a different zzso specificity from zzso zzso It is probable that the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso mediate binding interactions with zzso zzso they may therefore represent members of a distinct class of zzso recognition zzso
