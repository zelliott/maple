In the previous study we cloned zzso zzso gene coding zzso zzso into zzso expression zzso The zzso sequence revealed that zzso of zzso zzso consists of 510 zzso acids and has a molecular weight of 59, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It shows zzso zzso identity to the zzso sequence of zzso from zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso zzso can be produced with high yield by zzso coli strain and can be easy separated by zzso zzso of other bacterial proteins at 85 degrees C zzso D zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1998, zzso zzso 10, zzso In this study we presented a new expression system for producing zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso procedure for obtaining pure zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained a zzso tag at the zzso (20 additional zzso zzso that allowed zzso isolation by Ni affinity zzso The zzso was zzso by heat treatment (to zzso zzso coli zzso followed by zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso was characterized and displayed high activity and zzso This bacterial expression system appears to be a good method for production of the zzso zzso
