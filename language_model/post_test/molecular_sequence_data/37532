Consensus sequences are widely used in molecular biology but they have many zzso As a result, binding sites of proteins and other molecules are missed during studies of genetic sequences and important biological effects cannot be zzso Information theory provides a zzso robust way to avoid consensus zzso Instead of using consensus zzso sequence conservation can be zzso presented in bits of information by using sequence logo graphics to represent the average of a set of sites, and sequence walker graphics to represent individual zzso
