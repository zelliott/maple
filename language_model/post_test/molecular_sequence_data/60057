A zzso investigation was done on the members of the zzso zzso based on the DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso which encodes the 60 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso sequence data were determined for a near full-length zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene of the established zzso species and used to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trees were zzso from multiple sequence alignments by using both distance and zzso methods, which demonstrated an architecture composed of six zzso zzso The results are consistent with relationships deduced from recent sequence analysis studies based upon zzso zzso zzso and previously observed zzso and zzso zzso however, they showed greater statistical support at the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may be a more robust tool for zzso analysis of zzso zzso
