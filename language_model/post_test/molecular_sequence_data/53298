zzso changes in the zzso of patients with zzso disease were analyzed by high resolution two-dimensional gel zzso to investigate the pathological features of zzso zzso Two clear protein spots were found to be differently expressed between healthy volunteers and patients with zzso zzso One was a 53 zzso protein with zzso zzso that was detected in healthy volunteers but was nearly absent in the zzso The other was a 40 zzso protein with zzso zzso that was detected in the patients but nearly absent in the healthy zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence of the 40 zzso protein revealed that it was a truncated zzso with an zzso of zzso The presence of the truncated zzso in the zzso of patients was confirmed by Western zzso analysis using an zzso to the zzso of zzso The 53 zzso protein could not be identified because its zzso was zzso The presence of the truncated zzso in the zzso of the patients may be important in understanding the pathology of zzso zzso
