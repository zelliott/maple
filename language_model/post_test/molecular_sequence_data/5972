We report a case of a zzso syndrome caused by an autonomously zzso unilateral zzso zzso characterized by a clinically and biologically mild zzso state and an unusual response pattern to zzso Laboratory tests showed normal early morning plasma cortisol and zzso urinary cortisol zzso but lack of zzso variations and suppressed plasma zzso zzso cortisol zzso was not suppressed by either the low dose or the high dose zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso induced a marked increase in plasma zzso without an zzso of plasma zzso zzso zzso scan revealed an zzso mass of the left zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the tumor led to complete zzso of zzso zzso In zzso studies were then performed to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso on calcium zzso in cultured tumor cells using a zzso zzso Application of zzso in the vicinity of the cells induced a rapid and marked increase in the zzso calcium zzso zzso of the cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso totally suppressed the zzso stimulation of zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso chain reaction of tumor zzso acid with specific zzso amplified high levels of zzso zzso signal compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the V2 or zzso receptors amplified only a faint zzso This is the first report describing a mild case of zzso syndrome caused by an zzso zzso zzso The direct effect of zzso on cultured tumor cells was zzso through the zzso type of zzso zzso similar to that previously characterized in normal human zzso cells, suggesting that the tumor expressed an zzso zzso zzso zzso and exhibited zzso to zzso
