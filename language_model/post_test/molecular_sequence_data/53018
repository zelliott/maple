zzso sequencing studies in zzso have thus far focused primarily on the zzso of a few model zzso zzso are of interest to zzso because of their much smaller and highly streamlined zzso compared to zzso However, large-scale genetic work has been confined almost exclusively to the chicken; we know little about general aspects of zzso in nongame zzso This study examines the organization of a zzso region containing an zzso class II B gene in a representative of another important lineage of the avian tree, the zzso zzso We used a shotgun sequencing approach to determine the sequence of a zzso zzso insert containing a strongly zzso zzso zzso from house zzso zzso zzso There were a total of three genes found on the zzso zzso about the gene density expected for the zzso zzso a class II zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso and a zinc finger zzso zzso zzso in both the second and third zzso of zzso and the zzso of the gene after the third zzso suggest that it is a zzso zzso In addition, the identifiable zzso of zzso are more than twice as large as those of zzso zzso diversity in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso was much lower than zzso chicken and other functional zzso genes but higher than the expected diversity for a neutral locus in birds, perhaps because of zzso on a selected zzso locus close zzso The zzso zzso gene is likely functional, whereas the zinc finger motif is likely zzso A paucity of long zzso repeats and zzso is consistent with emerging rules of chicken zzso and a pictorial analysis of the zzso zzso of this zzso the first of its kind for birds, bears strong similarity to zzso signatures, suggesting common zzso structures in these zzso zzso The house zzso sequence is among a very few of its kind from zzso zzso and provides insight into the evolution of the avian zzso and of avian zzso zzso
