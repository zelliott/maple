Two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso in zzso was first found with an zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso DNA library prepared from the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that both genes contained open reading frames of zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso at the zzso which were named as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The calculated molecular masses were zzso Da for zzso zzso and zzso Da for zzso zzso These values were in good agreement with the zzso mass of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso (41 zzso There was an extremely high similarity between these two genes zzso of zzso in the coding regions and zzso of zzso acids zzso From the zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso it was shown that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso at an almost equal zzso Both showed similarity to other zzso especially to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were identical with this zzso Considering the evolution of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are supposed to have a common zzso It was noticeable that the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso contained a putative zzso targeting zzso zzso unlike those of other zzso reported zzso
