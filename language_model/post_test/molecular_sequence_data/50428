The primary sequence and secondary structural features of the zzso zzso were compared for 12 different zzso representing all the known cultivated zzso Analysis of these data show the zzso to form a zzso grouping consisting of three distinct families, which lies within the delta subdivision of the purple bacterial zzso The composition of the families is consistent with differences in cell and spore zzso cell behavior, and zzso and secondary zzso production but is not correlated with the zzso complexity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso lineage has evolved at an unusually rapid pace and its zzso shows numerous primary and secondary structural zzso
