zzso to zzso zzso is a distinct characteristic that zzso zzso zzso channels from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To identify regions necessary for the functional effects of zzso zzso zzso channels were constructed in which portions of motif III or motif IV of a zzso brain zzso channel, zzso were introduced into the zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso channels were expressed in zzso zzso and the effects of a zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The results show that the zzso region between zzso and zzso in motif IV of the zzso zzso channel is a major site for zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso molecules interact with distinct sites on the alpha 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The data further show that the zzso region of motif III is not involved in zzso action but may be an important structural component of zzso
