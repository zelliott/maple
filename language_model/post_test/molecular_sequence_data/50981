Using an zzso detection screen, we have identified zzso a new gene required for embryonic zzso development in zzso zzso that lack zzso expression have a diminished zzso zzso network and express zzso zzso late in zzso zzso zzso is unique among the previously described genes involved in zzso zzso in that its expression is restricted to a subset of zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso The putative zzso gene product contains a novel zzso domain and multiple zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it acts as a zzso factor necessary for the development of a subset of zzso zzso zzso
