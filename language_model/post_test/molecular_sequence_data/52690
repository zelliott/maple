zzso zzso zzso are involved in a zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso which is the key step in zzso zzso signals from the external environment to the zzso We report here the molecular cloning of carp zzso A partial zzso of the zzso zzso was initially identified from a zzso pool obtained by zzso the zzso from Con zzso carp head kidney zzso with those from zzso carp head kidney zzso The entire coding sequence was assembled by sequencing both strands of zzso clones amplified by using anchored zzso zzso The complete zzso was cloned by specific zzso designed against the partial zzso and then zzso to assure accuracy of the complete zzso zzso analysis reveals an zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso with the unique presence of two zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso clone shows approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with the known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso zzso of the carp zzso zzso shows higher similarities with the regions of human zzso than with human zzso The carp zzso is expressed as a single zzso zzso transcript at low levels in the head kidney and the zzso with the zzso level increasing when zzso are activated with zzso zzso The trace transcript was also detected by zzso in the carp liver, muscle and skin, but not in the egg zzso zzso analysis and pattern of expression suggest that this zzso represents the carp zzso zzso number in zzso zzso
