zzso have traditionally been appreciated for their zzso effects, whereas their impact on zzso memory has largely been zzso In this paper, we have compared three mechanistically distinct zzso aluminum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso toxin A1 fusion protein zzso Their influence on long-term memory development was dramatically zzso Whereas a single zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso that were comparable at 5 zzso zzso responses were maintained for zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso after zzso or zzso A zzso zzso increase in zzso center zzso size and numbers was found, with zzso of zzso B cell zzso hosting zzso at an optimal zzso zzso Roughly zzso of these zzso were zzso zzso This zzso effect correlated well with the persistence of long-term plasma cells in the bone zzso and memory B cells in the zzso zzso also facilitated increased zzso zzso and affinity maturation of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso fashion, hence arguing that large zzso not only promotes higher zzso zzso but also high-quality zzso zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso but not zzso B cells, at 1 y after zzso demonstrated functional long-term zzso zzso and zzso memory zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report to specifically compare and document that zzso can differ considerably in their support of long-term immune zzso zzso effects on the zzso reaction appear to be the basis for these zzso
