With the aid of computers, the zzso zzso for 52 zzso was cut up into peptides of zzso zzso acids in zzso From all possible peptides identified, we produced an extensive table of peptides unique to each zzso zzso The zzso types of donors and recipients of first zzso donor transplants were then converted to their peptides and used for zzso When compared to conventional matching, zzso matching was more effective in identifying patients with extremely poor zzso The total effectiveness of zzso matching was rather modest, although it is anticipated that this new zzso together with refined knowledge of the most zzso zzso will provide a more practical method of zzso matching for zzso
