zzso is the first zzso of classical zzso in the complement system and a major link between innate and acquired zzso The zzso zzso domain similar with zzso was also found in many zzso zzso zzso proteins which have similar crystal structure to that of the zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family, and also have diverse zzso In this study, we identified a total of 52 independent gene sequences zzso zzso proteins through comprehensive searches of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In comparison to 31 zzso genes in human and different numbers in other species, a significant selective pressure was suggested during zzso zzso zzso organization of zzso zzso proteins mainly includes a leading signal zzso a zzso region of variable zzso and a zzso zzso zzso There are 11 highly zzso zzso within the zzso domain, among which 2 are zzso within the zzso gene zzso A more extensive database searches also revealed zzso zzso proteins in other zzso zzso and even zzso but no zzso sequences for zzso zzso proteins were found in many species that have a more recent evolutionary history with zzso zzso further studies on zzso genes among different species will help us understand evolutionary mechanism of innate and acquired zzso
