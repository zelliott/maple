A set of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of reverse zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso which zzso on the virus a reduced sensitivity to multiple therapeutic zzso zzso has been zzso In this study, we defined the zzso properties of zzso with such zzso by using zzso zzso overproduction of zzso zzso and zzso kinetic zzso A single zzso zzso which developed first among the five zzso in patients receiving therapy, most profoundly reduced the sensitivity of zzso to multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso of other zzso to zzso further reduced the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso with the five zzso proved to be resistant by zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso kinetic studies revealed comparable zzso efficiency zzso of zzso carrying combined zzso as compared with that of zzso zzso zzso although a marked difference was noted in zzso zzso zzso zzso Ki of a zzso zzso carrying the five zzso was zzso higher for zzso than that of zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso of zzso zzso recognition, caused by these zzso accounts for the observed zzso resistance of zzso The features of zzso zzso should provide insights into the molecular mechanism of zzso discriminating zzso from natural zzso
