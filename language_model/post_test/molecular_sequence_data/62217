zzso zzso zzso involves tissue zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this study we investigated zzso gene expression in circulating zzso isolated from normal tension glaucoma zzso patients in comparison to healthy zzso 

Blood samples were collected from 6 glaucoma patients and 6 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso were separated using zzso zzso zzso pools were used for zzso zzso to identify genes with altered zzso The zzso genes were zzso and individual zzso pools were zzso using zzso zzso Target zzso products were confirmed using zzso restriction zzso In this study we focused on zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were zzso as zzso genes in the group of zzso zzso zzso of these genes was confirmed by zzso and zzso analysis in all 6 zzso The expression of the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso was slightly enhanced in patients as compared with zzso zzso of zzso was not detected in zzso either in glaucoma patients or in healthy zzso 

A simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso gene expression and only slightly enhanced expression of zzso suggest an increased zzso zzso zzso activity delivered by zzso blood cells in these zzso
