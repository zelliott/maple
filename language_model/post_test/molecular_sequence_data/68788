zzso that have zzso activity are zzso by many zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides commonly contain unusual zzso acids that contribute to their properties and zzso Although bacteria zzso most of these peptides by zzso mechanisms, this review focuses on those that are zzso by pathways that involve zzso modification of zzso zzso precursor zzso A particularly interesting class of these zzso peptides is the zzso of which zzso and zzso are the zzso examples, although nearly a dozen new zzso have been discovered in recent zzso The fact that the zzso structures are derived from zzso peptides means that structural zzso of natural zzso can be constructed by zzso of their structural zzso Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular zzso of zzso has made the construction of novel zzso with enhanced chemical and zzso properties zzso This review describes these advances and proposes future trends of research, as well as potential application of engineered zzso in the context of the general field of zzso zzso
