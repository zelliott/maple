zzso zzso protein zzso plays an important role in DNA metabolism such as DNA zzso repair, and zzso and is essential for cell zzso This study reports on the zzso gene zzso gene expression and characterization of a zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso and is the first report of such a protein from zzso zzso zzso possesses a high sequence similarity to zzso coli zzso zzso identity and 57% zzso and has the longest zzso acid sequence zzso zzso acid zzso of all the known bacterial zzso with one zzso per zzso An analysis of zzso zzso by means of chemical zzso experiments, zzso analysis and size exclusion zzso revealed a stable zzso in zzso Using zzso we characterized the zzso of zzso zzso with a series of zzso zzso and the size of the binding site was determined as being approximately 35 zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso site size of zzso on zzso is 34 zzso per zzso under zzso conditions zzso zzso but increases to zzso zzso at zzso conditions zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso a transition between zzso binding zzso which is observed for zzso The binding properties of zzso investigated using zzso technology revealed that the affinity of zzso to zzso is typical of zzso zzso The only difference in the binding mode of zzso to zzso is a faster association phase, when compared to zzso though compensated by faster zzso zzso When analyzed by differential scanning zzso zzso the melting temperature zzso was determined as 63 zzso which is only a few degrees lower than for zzso
