zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene were precisely zzso using artificial zzso and zzso zzso The zzso fragments for zzso analysis were prepared by treating zzso specimens with our artificial zzso which consist of zzso zzso zzso and zzso bearing two zzso groups zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso always occurred at the zzso linkages in front of the two zzso even when the zzso specimens involved consecutive zzso sequences of different zzso Thus, even complicated zzso of these zzso specimens were completely zzso by using only one zzso zzso and by subjecting the reaction mixture to single zzso zzso Moreover, single zzso zzso zzso in the consecutive sequences could be zzso simultaneously with the zzso
