A novel set of zzso for zzso chain reaction zzso which amplified the portion of zzso sequence coding for the main zzso zzso zzso of zzso D zzso was used for detection of zzso zzso virus zzso DNA in 44 zzso fluid zzso samples from 29 patients with clinical symptoms of viral meningitis or zzso The zzso in question amplified the DNA of 9 out of 10 zzso zzso zzso and of 5 out of 10 zzso zzso zzso as well as the DNA of all laboratory strains examined when tested in the zzso fluid of infected cells zzso The zzso was positive in 5 zzso samples zzso on days 2, 4, 8, 10 and 56 after the onset of symptoms, but not later than day 8 after starting zzso zzso zzso obtained from 4 patients with zzso zzso zzso The zzso was repeatedly negative in zzso of 15 patients who had zzso to zzso in serum and zzso but did not show zzso zzso zzso It was also negative in 10 patients who had no zzso zzso in zzso Our results confirmed that positive zzso for zzso DNA in the zzso is an indication for starting and/or continuing zzso therapy even in the absence of classical symptoms of zzso zzso
