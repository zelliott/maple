zzso exchange and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso techniques were used to characterize the structure of oxidized horse zzso c at acid pH and high zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso c is known to assume a zzso zzso (A zzso with properties resembling those of the molten zzso state described for other zzso In order to measure the rate of zzso exchange for individual backbone zzso zzso in the A state, samples of oxidized zzso c were incubated at 20 degrees C in zzso buffer zzso zzso zzso M zzso for time periods ranging from 2 zzso to 500 zzso The exchange reaction was then zzso by transferring the protein to native conditions zzso zzso The extent of exchange for 44 zzso zzso trapped in the zzso protein was measured by zzso zzso zzso The results show that this approach can provide detailed information on zzso secondary and zzso structure in partially folded equilibrium forms of a zzso All of the slowly exchanging zzso zzso in the three major zzso of native zzso c are strongly protected from exchange at acid zzso indicating that the A state contains zzso elements of zzso secondary zzso By contrast, a number of zzso zzso involved in irregular zzso zzso of the native structure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are only marginally protected in the A state, indicating that these zzso are unstable or zzso The zzso results suggest that the major zzso of zzso c and their common zzso domain are largely preserved in the zzso zzso form while the loop region of the native structure is flexible and partly zzso
