zzso zzso proteins zzso by zzso genes expressed in zzso zzso cells mediate infection and zzso of plants by zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso that stimulates root growth and functions as a zzso for a putative plant zzso zzso We used in zzso and in zzso zzso interference approaches to silence this zzso gene in zzso and validate that the zzso gene has an essential function in zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso silenced the target zzso gene in zzso and resulted in reduced zzso zzso In zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso resulted in resistance effective against the four major zzso zzso Because no known natural resistance gene has this wide effective range of zzso resistance, zzso crops expressing zzso that silence target zzso zzso genes to disrupt the zzso process represents a viable and flexible means of developing novel durable zzso crops and could provide crops with unprecedented broad resistance to zzso
