zzso zzso is a membrane protein complex that zzso reduction of molecular oxygen to water and zzso the free energy of this reaction to generate a zzso zzso zzso during zzso The electron entry site in zzso II is a zzso zzso copper center in zzso that zzso zzso zzso This center has been lost during the evolution of the zzso branch of zzso zzso but can be restored by zzso zzso we describe the crystal structures of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso II zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso at zzso resolution and of the zzso with the engineered zzso copper center zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso is folded as an zzso mostly zzso zzso followed by three zzso The zzso copper center is located at the zzso between strands beta zzso 6 and beta zzso zzso The two zzso are at a zzso distance and zzso coordinated to the main zzso that are two bridging zzso and two terminal zzso The zzso that are distinct in zzso c and zzso zzso are around the zzso copper zzso zzso comparison suggests a common ancestry for zzso II of zzso zzso and blue zzso zzso
