A zzso zzso zzso sequence at 75 degrees on the genetic map of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The sequence of this region is adjacent to the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Twenty-six zzso were identified, one of which zzso to the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the deduced protein sequences of these zzso displayed significant zzso to known proteins in the data zzso One putative zzso was identified, consisting of five zzso that is probably involved in the zzso and processing of zzso The location of zzso in this sequence does not confirm the genetic mapping data, indicating that the gene is closely linked to zzso which is located at 80 degrees on the zzso zzso zzso
