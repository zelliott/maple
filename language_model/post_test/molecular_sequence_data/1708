We analyzed cell division patterns during the differentiation of zzso flowers of the zzso plant zzso zzso using in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso A1 zzso The gene expression patterns indicated that the zzso of cell divisions in whorls 3 and 4 was reversed in young male and female flower zzso During maturation of flower zzso a remarkable reduction in cell division activity occurred in the male zzso zzso and female zzso zzso Our analyses showed that differential zzso and reduction of cell division strongly correlated with zzso promotion and zzso in the sex differentiation of zzso zzso
