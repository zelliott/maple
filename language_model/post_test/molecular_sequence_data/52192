We have investigated whether J zzso zzso signal sequence zzso binding protein zzso zzso has any partial zzso activities involved in the zzso zzso reaction, such as zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso by J zzso affinity zzso did not show DNA zzso activities but contained a strong DNA zzso zzso To obtain a large amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli as a fusion protein and also in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso cells could bind J zzso it failed to show either zzso or DNA zzso zzso Since the DNA zzso zzso zzso has the zzso activity, the zzso zzso protein may form a complex with a zzso in zzso We have raised zzso zzso against the zzso zzso fusion protein which was zzso in zzso coli and unable to bind J zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have shown that the zzso zzso protein is expressed zzso in zzso zzso The ubiquitous expression of the zzso zzso protein is consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso protein may have dual function zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
