The structure of the 20 zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso replacing zzso zzso and zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that activates the zzso of genes whose products are required for nitrogen zzso The zzso zzso domain contains the zzso necessary for zzso and zzso of the full length zzso The zzso protein does not bind to DNA but retains many characteristics of the zzso zzso and the zzso domain expresses at high yield (20 zzso in minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation and zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso experiments were used to make backbone and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structures were calculated using a total of zzso zzso and zzso distance and hydrogen bond restraints zzso hydrogen zzso 44 hydrogen bond zzso and 88 zzso zzso restraints for zzso zzso through zzso in both zzso A total of 54 ambiguous restraints zzso or zzso involving zzso close to the zzso symmetry axis were also zzso Each zzso consists of four zzso zzso zzso A zzso and B zzso join with those of another zzso to form an zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso and D zzso of each zzso adopt a classic zzso zzso fold at either end of the zzso The backbone zzso zzso for the 28 best of 40 starting structures is zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso Factor for zzso zzso are zzso
