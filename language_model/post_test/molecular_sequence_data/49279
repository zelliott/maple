Previous studies have suggested the importance of zzso zzso and certain zzso in the zzso determining regions zzso of zzso zzso zzso implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso syndrome zzso The authors tested this hypothesis by carrying out a systematic analysis of all published zzso zzso 

Each zzso variable region sequence was aligned to the closest zzso counterpart in the zzso zzso zzso by using zzso software, allowing analysis of zzso zzso and distribution of zzso zzso The probability that this distribution arose as a result of zzso zzso of replacement zzso in the zzso was tested zzso 

There was no preferential gene or family use in the 36 zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso M zzso had few zzso zzso compared with zzso Of the zzso zzso 9 of 14 showed evidence of zzso zzso of replacement zzso in the zzso zzso analysis allowed a clearer statistical identification of sequences that had been subject to zzso zzso The more specific zzso zzso and some zzso zzso displayed an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso binding in zzso zzso but not in more specific zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso This may in part be caused by an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso which are zzso zzso in the more specific zzso zzso but often arise because of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

An understanding of the role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the binding of zzso zzso to zzso and to zzso I, may eventually help in the development of drugs to interfere with those zzso and thereby improve the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
