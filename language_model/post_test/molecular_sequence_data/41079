zzso is the most common primary brain tumor in adults with low average survival time after zzso In order to improve zzso treatment, new zzso targets need to be zzso Cell surface zzso are prime drug targets due to their accessibility at the surface of cancer zzso To overcome the limited availability of suitable zzso for cell surface protein zzso we performed a comprehensive mass zzso investigation of the zzso zzso Our combined cell surface capturing analysis of primary ex zzso zzso cell lines in combination with established zzso cell lines revealed zzso zzso which vastly extends the known data of zzso drug targets at zzso zzso We provide direct evidence of common zzso cell surface zzso and an approximate estimate of their zzso information that could not be derived from zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Apart from our zzso valuable repertoire of already and potentially zzso cell surface zzso we built a zzso zzso enabling directed, sensitive, and repetitive zzso zzso for clinical follow-up zzso The included Skyline zzso zzso zzso library provides an elevated starting point for parallel testing of the abundance level of the detected zzso zzso members in future drug zzso zzso
