zzso is an zzso of diverse zzso lineages that can induce various zzso of host reproduction for its own zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most common phenomenon, which results in embryonic zzso when males that bear zzso are zzso with females that do zzso In the cherry fruit fly, zzso zzso zzso seems to be responsible for previously reported patterns of zzso between zzso Here we report on the artificial transfer of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso into zzso zzso which was performed with two major goals in mind: first, to isolate zzso from zzso in order to individually test their respective abilities to induce zzso in the new host; and, second, to test the theoretical prediction that recent zzso associations should be characterized by high levels of zzso fitness costs to the new host, and inefficient transmission from mothers to zzso zzso was unable to develop in the new host, resulting in its rapid loss after successful injection, while zzso was established in the new zzso zzso rates of zzso were low, and the infection showed negative fitness effects, consistent with our zzso but zzso levels were unexpectedly lower in the new zzso Based on these zzso estimates, neither zzso nor zzso could be naturally maintained in zzso zzso The experiment thus suggests that natural zzso transfer between species might be restricted by many factors, should the ecological barriers be zzso
