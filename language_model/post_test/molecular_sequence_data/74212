zzso zzso was detected by zzso chain reaction in 13 zzso of 92 zzso captured from a mountainous area of Zhejiang Province in zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso nearly entire zzso zzso gene amplified from these zzso had zzso identity, but varied from all known corresponding sequences of zzso zzso deposited in zzso To further identify and zzso the zzso fragments of zzso partial zzso zzso gene zzso zzso major surface protein 4 gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were amplified and zzso The zzso sequences of the partial zzso gene amplified from the zzso were identical to each other, but distinct from previously reported zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso These findings indicate that the newly discovered agent represents a novel zzso zzso zzso
