The gene coding for a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been identified by the knockout of the zzso zzso zzso transformation was achieved by zzso zzso and gene replacement through zzso assortment, using zzso as the selective zzso A knockout cell line zzso showed a zzso consistent with that of the zzso deletion zzso zzso converted only zzso of the added zzso into the zzso zzso zzso while the wild type accumulated zzso larger amounts under similar zzso The decreased zzso activity is specific for the zzso position of zzso and zzso other zzso namely zzso and zzso were not zzso Analysis by reverse zzso reveals that zzso is transcribed both in the presence and absence of zzso in zzso cells, whereas the transcribed gene was not detected in zzso The growth of zzso was zzso from that of the zzso zzso zzso resembles known zzso zzso zzso displaying the three typical zzso zzso four zzso zzso regions, and two other highly zzso zzso of unknown zzso A zzso analysis placed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a cluster together with functionally characterized zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and plants, although in a different zzso
