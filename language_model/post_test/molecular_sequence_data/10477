A synthetic zzso an 18 zzso acid zzso zzso derived from a zzso domain of a cloned zzso type I collagen zzso was used to study the role of the zzso on types I and III zzso zzso zzso and the release of zzso The zzso zzso the type I, but not the type III, zzso zzso zzso and the release of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso specifically binds to type I zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner (with zzso zzso 10 zzso The binding of zzso can be inhibited by an excess of zzso zzso suggesting that the binding is zzso The labeled zzso does not bind to type III zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso type I collagen zzso (Mr 65 zzso The zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso on type I collagen zzso and rabbit zzso segments in a zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso site of the zzso zzso for type I collagen resides in this portion of the zzso
