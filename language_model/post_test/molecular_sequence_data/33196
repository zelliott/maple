Three bacterial strains that had been isolated from human blood cultures, zzso zzso and zzso were characterized for their zzso and zzso features, cellular fatty acid profiles, zzso profiles and zzso positions based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that the zzso were members of the zzso zzso These zzso were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The levels of sequence similarity among the three strains were zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The strains grew on media containing 20 % zzso These strains could be differentiated from zzso zzso by their ability to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso or to zzso zzso The major zzso of the zzso was zzso Based on these data, we propose a novel zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
