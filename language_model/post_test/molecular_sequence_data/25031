Two membrane proteins from the avian pathogen zzso zzso have been previously zzso using a simple, efficient and zzso method: a zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the current study, the zzso part of zzso was chemically zzso The molecular structure of the zzso component was determined to be zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of the zzso zzso indicated a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso acid zzso acid zzso acid zzso with zzso as the major zzso These findings, along with previously published results, support the conclusion that zzso is zzso a true zzso zzso although not zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is not a zzso zzso experiments using in zzso treatment with zzso and growth zzso in the presence of zzso serum provided evidence of the surface zzso of the zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was found to be similar to the zzso zzso from several zzso this zzso is a zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques revealed that the surface zzso zzso and zzso were specific to the species zzso zzso and the closely related species zzso zzso No zzso difference was revealed within these species with the zzso serum, while zzso serum confirmed the zzso zzso of zzso The potential of zzso and zzso as zzso in zzso diagnosis tests or as candidates for zzso zzso vaccines is zzso
