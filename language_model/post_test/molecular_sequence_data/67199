Two pigmented zzso isolated from zzso specimens were described by zzso tests, zzso fatty acid analyses by High Performance zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of zzso heat shock protein gene and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene and zzso zzso gene sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were deposited in zzso under zzso numbers zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew in about one week at 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C and produced smooth, yellow zzso It reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduction, zzso zzso zzso zzso heat stable zzso and zzso zzso tests were also positive, while zzso 80 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew in about 9 days at 37 degrees C and formed smooth, yellow zzso It zzso zzso 80, possessed zzso zzso zzso zzso and heat stable zzso however, it did not possess zzso and nitrate zzso These data, in addition to their position in the zzso tree, strongly support the status of novel species at least for zzso zzso zzso
