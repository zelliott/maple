zzso zzso is a newly identified species of the zzso zzso It was first isolated from a urine sample from a human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso changes its surface zzso profile with high zzso The changes originate from zzso phase variations of the zzso family of surface membrane zzso The zzso family zzso are major zzso recognized by the human immune system during zzso zzso infection and are zzso by the zzso zzso Phase variations of zzso family zzso occur at the zzso level of zzso zzso however, the precise genetic mechanisms are zzso In this study, the molecular mechanisms of surface zzso profile change in zzso zzso were zzso The focus was on the zzso protein that is present in zzso zzso strain zzso but not in the type strain, zzso The zzso protein was the product of a previously reported zzso zzso zzso with an zzso sequence identical to that of the zzso family zzso zzso sequencing analysis of the zzso gene region revealed that the zzso zzso DNA of this gene had the structure of an zzso element that functioned as a switch for gene zzso In addition, all of the zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso were identified using the zzso sequence data that has recently become available for this zzso There are at least 38 zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, most of these zzso genes possess zzso zzso zzso similar to those of the zzso gene zzso A model for the generation of surface zzso variation by multiple promoter zzso is zzso
