The feasibility of identifying zzso markers based solely on the identification of DNA fragments present in zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso The zzso structure of zzso has been well characterized using zzso zzso In Canada, zzso types zzso zzso zzso and zzso are being displaced from the natural population by type zzso and the latter type is associated with an increased prevalence of zzso C zzso zzso zzso analysis, which uses zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso amplification, was employed to identify zzso DNA fragments zzso that differ between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 14 zzso were cloned which were further characterized by Southern zzso analysis to identify six zzso that represent fragments either unique to or highly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso primer pairs were designed for each of the six zzso and zzso amplification was used to determine their prevalence across a panel of 167 zzso zzso representative of other zzso and zzso Among group C zzso only two of the six zzso designated as A and G, were effective in discriminating zzso from zzso zzso zzso A detects a deletion in the zzso gene which effectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso C zzso The frequency of zzso A and G detection in the other zzso and zzso was too great to facilitate their direct use as diagnostic markers for the differentiation of virulent zzso zzso
