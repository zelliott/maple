The zzso zzso zzso gene family consists of six highly zzso zzso factors that are of importance for normal embryonic zzso They are organized in two gene clusters in human, one on zzso and the other one on zzso respectively, and both the organization and the structure of the genes are highly zzso An open reading frame coding for an unknown protein is identified in the promoter of zzso on zzso zzso This new gene is composed of four zzso and it is zzso in a head-to-head manner to zzso Only a short zzso zzso segment separates the two translation start zzso and the two genes may share a zzso zzso This zzso promoter is embedded in a large zzso that also continues into both zzso zzso analysis of the new gene reveals two alternative zzso transcripts and a third zzso transcript can be predicted from zzso zzso The expression profile of the gene zzso in 9 different human zzso reveals that it is expressed in a coordinated fashion with zzso which has led to the name zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso protein lacks zzso to any known protein or protein domain in public databases, and a putative zzso terminal signal zzso suggests the protein is zzso or zzso compartment zzso The gene is only found in the human and the zzso zzso but not in the mouse or the rat zzso which suggests that zzso is unique for higher zzso As the identified zzso promoter not being a relic of an ancient compact zzso zzso may play an important role in the evolution of higher primates in coordination with the zzso zzso
