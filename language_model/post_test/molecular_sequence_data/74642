zzso activity of zzso the first characterized zzso zzso is associated with progression of many human zzso and zzso has attracted interest as a therapeutic zzso zzso is known to act in various zzso signaling systems to impact cell behavior, yet it remains likely that the spectrum of zzso protein zzso relevant to cancer is incompletely zzso To better understand the cellular impact of zzso zzso zzso activity, we extensively applied a mass zzso shotgun zzso zzso zzso strategy to obtain global zzso profiles of zzso mouse zzso as well as their zzso zzso A total of zzso peptides representing zzso distinct zzso sites on 374 different proteins were identified from the zzso cells, while zzso peptides representing 275 zzso sites on 167 proteins were identified from zzso zzso zzso characteristics of the two profiles were revealed by spectral zzso indicative of zzso site relative zzso and by complementary quantitative analysis using stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in cell culture zzso While both zzso profiles are replete with sites on signaling and zzso regulatory zzso the zzso profile is more diverse with enrichment in sites on zzso zzso and zzso and protein synthesis and processing zzso zzso zzso sites (32 zzso are predicted as major biologically relevant zzso targets on the basis of frequent identification in both cell zzso This select group, of particular interest as diagnostic zzso includes well-established zzso sites on zzso zzso but also zzso sites of potential relevance to the transformed cell zzso
