Hearing impairment zzso is clinically and genetically very heterogeneous, and auditory genes are discovered at a very rapid zzso The identification of deafness genes is enabling us to understand the molecular process of hearing, and it offers prospects for DNA testing of zzso However, the routine application of these tests is hampered by the large number of genes involved in zzso and by the fact that molecular screening of these genes is often quite expensive and time zzso An important gene that should be considered in zzso or childhood onset zzso zzso zzso is zzso since zzso in this gene account for at least 50% of this type of zzso In the present review, we describe the known deafness genes and we provide an overview of the zzso routinely used diagnostic DNA zzso
