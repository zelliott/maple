The healthy skin of a zzso female goat zzso zzso was sampled with a cotton tip zzso Total zzso DNA was extracted from the sample and subjected to multiply primed zzso amplification zzso zzso analysis showed that the complete zzso of a zzso was zzso measuring approximately 7,600 zzso in zzso The Capra zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from this zzso amplification product, and the complete zzso sequence was zzso The zzso zzso counts zzso zzso and contains the typical zzso open reading frames zzso Based on a zzso alignment of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso open reading frames of zzso and 54 other animal and human zzso types, a zzso zzso tree was zzso In this tree zzso clusters with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence alignments of the zzso open reading frame of zzso with its closest relatives showed less than zzso zzso placing the zzso in a novel zzso
