A zzso zzso duplex zzso has been investigated in solution by high resolution zzso zzso Almost complete resonance assignment of both zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso The duplex is essentially zzso with zzso apparent at the AT and zzso zzso These zzso and their affects on dynamics have been zzso by the measurement of zzso zzso and observation of water of zzso zzso opening rates were derived from zzso of zzso and effects on zzso of the T and G zzso zzso on addition of an exchange zzso Our results are generally in line with observations reported for other systems, but we see only a slight drop in the zzso zzso lifetime on moving out from the central zzso This observation is reinforced by the detection of zzso zzso for zzso distributed throughout the zzso zzso
