zzso zzso zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso and occur in animals, zzso bacteria and higher zzso Here, the zzso zzso a zzso of a zzso zzso plant was first cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the dependence of its expression on the cellular zzso state was zzso The presence of an zzso targeting signal indicates that, like zzso from higher plants, zzso zzso is zzso imported into zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso suppressed zzso gene expression and decreased zzso protein zzso With zzso the decrease in zzso transcript level was fast, concentration dependent, and correlated with the amounts of zzso taken up by the zzso In an approach to identify signaling zzso zzso was proved to be a highly potent inhibitor of zzso repression of zzso The zzso effect indicates that a zzso is involved in zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso
