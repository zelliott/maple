A zzso zzso designated zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso and the gene product was zzso Gene zzso contains zzso zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids composed of a zzso zzso family 10 zzso domain with a putative signal zzso a short zzso zzso and a family 2 zzso module zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shared the highest identity zzso zzso with a hypothetical zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso and zzso The optimum pH and temperature for zzso is zzso and 60 zzso Compared with zzso and zzso counterparts, zzso was more active at high temperatures, retaining zzso % of its maximum activity at zzso zzso and zzso % even at 80 zzso It had broad pH zzso zzso % activity at pH zzso and zzso zzso % activity after incubation at pH zzso for 1 h at 37 zzso and was highly zzso zzso % activity after incubation at 70 zzso for 3 h at pH zzso It may be the first zzso zzso zzso reported from zzso These favorable properties make zzso a good candidate for application in pulp and paper zzso
