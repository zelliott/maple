A novel zzso site has been identified in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso site is associated with the A13 zzso in the zzso core of the zzso zzso and is distinct from any previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the zzso affinity for this site and leads to an apparent zzso constant of zzso zzso at 25 degrees C for binding of a single zzso zzso The zzso data also show evidence of a structural change at this site upon metal binding and these results are compared with previous data on zzso structural changes in the core of the zzso zzso These zzso data were combined with the X-ray structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso McKay zzso zzso Nature zzso to model zzso zzso involved in binding the metal at this A13 zzso In this model, the A13 zzso site is structurally similar to the previously identified zzso zzso site and illustrates the symmetrical nature of the tandem G zzso A base pairs in domain 2 of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso represents an important method for both identification and characterization of zzso sites in zzso zzso
