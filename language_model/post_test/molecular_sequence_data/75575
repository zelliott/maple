zzso DNA clones zzso the zzso N precursor protein have been isolated from both bovine zzso zzso and rat zzso libraries using a zzso canine zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of these clones and comparison with the previously determined canine sequence has revealed that zzso of the zzso acid zzso are zzso in all three zzso The protein precursor sequences predicted from bovine zzso and canine zzso zzso clones vary at only 9 of 170 zzso acid zzso suggesting that within a species identical precursors are zzso in both the central nervous system and zzso The rat gene spans approximately zzso zzso zzso and is divided into four zzso by three zzso The zzso and zzso N coding zzso are zzso positioned on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis has revealed that the rat gene is transcribed to yield two distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso in size, in all gastrointestinal and all neural zzso examined except the zzso There is a striking variation in the relative levels of these two zzso between brain and zzso The smaller zzso zzso greatly zzso in zzso while both zzso species are nearly equally abundant in zzso brain zzso and zzso zzso comparisons and zzso zzso analysis indicate that these two zzso result from the differential zzso of two consensus zzso addition signals and differ in the extent of their 3' untranslated zzso The relative combined levels of the zzso in various brain and zzso regions zzso roughly with the relative levels of zzso zzso zzso except in the cerebral zzso where zzso levels are 6 times higher than zzso
