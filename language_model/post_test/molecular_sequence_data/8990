We recently reported that human zzso virus type 1 zzso carrying zzso and zzso L zzso ceased budding when the zzso zzso domain was zzso suggesting a role for NC in zzso zzso Here we investigated whether NC involvement in virus release is a property specific to zzso or a general requirement of zzso Specifically, we examined a possible role for NC in the budding of zzso relying on divergent L zzso and structurally zzso NC zzso that harbor diverse protein zzso We found that NC is critical for the release of viruses utilizing the zzso motif whether it functions within its native zzso in zzso zzso virus zzso zzso or zzso or when it is transplanted into the zzso zzso protein of zzso infectious anemia virus zzso In both cases, virus release was severely diminished even though NC zzso zzso proteins retained the ability to assemble zzso zzso Moreover, zzso NC zzso which displayed particles zzso to the plasma zzso were triggered to release virus when access to the cell zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso was restored zzso in trans expression of zzso We also examined the role of NC in the budding of zzso a zzso relying exclusively on the zzso L zzso We found that zzso late budding defects were rescued by zzso of the isolated zzso zzso domain zzso zzso rescue of zzso release required the zzso zzso zzso NC zzso lost interactions with zzso and failed to produce viruses despite retaining the ability to zzso Together, our studies establish a role for NC in the budding of zzso harboring divergent L zzso and zzso diverse NC zzso suggesting the zzso of a common zzso mechanism and/or cellular factor rather than a specific zzso
