A growing family of proteins is regulated by protein zzso C and zzso through zzso zzso a regulatory motif originally identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Doyle, zzso zzso Walsh, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso a nuclear zzso zzso contains an zzso domain, is zzso by protein zzso C, and interacts with zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso of zzso zzso its binding to zzso zzso and conversely, zzso binding to zzso interferes with zzso zzso Several other zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of these proteins also zzso their binding to zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso may regulate interactions of zzso and other zzso proteins with their zzso targets and that zzso zzso may provide a regulatory link between zzso signal zzso pathways and zzso zzso
