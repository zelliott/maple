zzso elements zzso account for zzso of the human zzso and have achieved this abundance by zzso via an zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is a crucial event in the zzso of the active human zzso element and is carried out by the zzso zzso zzso Previously, we performed zzso characterization of the human zzso zzso protein with reverse zzso zzso activity zzso to as zzso zzso expressed in zzso insect zzso In the present study, we describe the properties of zzso and zzso DNA synthesis zzso by the zzso zzso on the zzso templates in zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso at least zzso of zzso per template binding event utilizing zzso zzso in zzso Under zzso conditions the zzso zzso zzso zzso over 5 times longer than that zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso on the zzso zzso template used in these zzso These data are the first to demonstrate that zzso from the human zzso element is a highly zzso zzso among zzso zzso This report also presents a strong evidence of lack of zzso H activity for the zzso zzso protein in zzso distinguishing zzso zzso from zzso zzso Finally, we found strong pausing for of the zzso zzso during DNA zzso within the 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso that is result of contribution both zzso runs of the zzso stretch and immediately adjacent zzso zzso A mechanism zzso zzso DNA synthesis during reverse zzso of zzso element in zzso is zzso
