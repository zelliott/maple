The predicted second zzso loop domain of the zzso zzso is of particular interest because it is a region that is quite distinct from the analogous regions in other family members that are most closely related and because the initial report of the zzso labeling of a domain of this zzso included this region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Howard, zzso zzso and Miller, zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the current work, zzso zzso zzso were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single zzso to twelve zzso acid segments throughout this 67 zzso acid zzso Each construct was expressed in zzso cells and characterized for zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso calcium zzso The only segments that had negative impact on zzso binding and biological activity included deletion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is likely involved in the highly zzso and functionally important zzso bond linking the first and second zzso of G zzso zzso zzso replacements for each of the zzso acid zzso in the other two segments revealed that the zzso zzso at both ends of this loop, zzso and zzso and zzso were responsible for the negative impact on zzso binding and biological zzso Of note, these zzso responded normally to the zzso zzso zzso These data support important functional roles for both zzso and zzso zzso regions of the second loop for responses to the natural zzso zzso while supporting independent zzso for action of a zzso zzso zzso
