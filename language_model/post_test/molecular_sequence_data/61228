Pursuit of the zzso that make and degrade zzso has provided zzso zzso which confirm the ubiquity of zzso in microbes and animals and provide reliable means for measuring very low zzso Many distinctive functions appear likely for zzso depending on its zzso chain zzso zzso source and zzso location: an energy supply and zzso substitute, a zzso for zzso a zzso of metals, a buffer against zzso a channel for DNA entry, a cell zzso and, of major interest, a regulator of responses to stresses and adjustments for survival in the stationary phase of culture growth and zzso Whether zzso or human, we depend on adaptations in the stationary phase, a dynamic phase of zzso Much attention has focused on the early and zzso zzso of organisms, rather brief intervals of rapid growth, but more concern needs to be given to the extensive period of zzso Survival of microbial species depends on being able to manage in the stationary zzso In view of the zzso and complexity of basic zzso mechanisms, it would be surprising if some of the variety of zzso functions observed in zzso did not apply to aspects of human growth and development, to aging and to the aberrations of zzso Of theoretical interest regarding zzso is its zzso in zzso evolution, which, along with its high energy and zzso content, make it a plausible precursor to zzso DNA and zzso Of practical interest is its many industrial applications, among which is its use in the microbial zzso of zzso in marine zzso
