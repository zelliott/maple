zzso zzso is an industrially cultivated zzso with nutritional and environmental zzso Its zzso contains 35 zzso organized in 11 zzso There is currently available a genetic linkage map based predominantly on anonymous molecular markers zzso with the mapping of zzso controlling growth rate and industrial zzso To increase the zzso of the existing linkage zzso we have identified and mapped 82 genes expressed in the zzso Their manual zzso revealed that zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso genes zzso to previously unknown sequences or to hypothetical proteins without a clearly established zzso Furthermore, the expression pattern of some genes provides an experimental basis for studying gene regulation during the change from zzso to zzso zzso Finally, the identification of various zzso regulated genes involved in protein metabolism suggests the relevance of these processes in fruit body formation and zzso
