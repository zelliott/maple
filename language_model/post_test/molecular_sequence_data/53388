zzso zzso zzso a product of the zzso 19 gene and the terminal zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the pig and other zzso albeit to varying levels, zzso its functional zzso in pregnancy zzso The zzso produced by the pig zzso exists as three distinct zzso zzso I - zzso type II - zzso and type III - zzso with presumed differences in zzso zzso expression levels, activity, and mode of zzso In order to delineate the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso synthesis is regulated in these diverse zzso the present study examined if these zzso zzso represent products of multiple genes or of a single gene via complex zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA from a single animal was used as a template in the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso sequences corresponding to zzso 4 and 7, zzso zzso sequence analysis of the generated fragments revealed the presence of only clones corresponding to the three known zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library for zzso gene by zzso yielded a single clone approximately 80 zzso in zzso Southern zzso analysis, using zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 sequences indicated that the zzso zzso clone contains the entirety of the coding zzso as well as the zzso promoter zzso zzso analysis of the zzso generated with zzso 4 zzso determined that this zzso clone contains only the type II zzso The presence and relative orientation of the untranslated zzso zzso zzso and zzso previously demonstrated for the type III zzso were evaluated in the zzso clone and zzso DNA by zzso The 265 zzso zzso generated from both zzso reactions was confirmed by sequence analysis to contain zzso zzso and zzso that are located zzso to each other and separated by only three zzso A diagnostic procedure for typing zzso zzso was developed, based on the presence of specific restriction sites within zzso zzso The use of this protocol confirmed the existence of only three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and indicated changes in zzso types expressed by the zzso zzso as a function of pregnancy zzso The presence of distinct genes zzso each of the zzso zzso predicts important differences in the mechanisms underlying the molecular evolution and regulation of zzso zzso unique from those of other zzso and suggests a critical role for zzso zzso zzso products in zzso functions related to pregnancy zzso
