The zzso coding for zzso proteins zzso are subjected to zzso control during zzso zzso and zzso and also during nutritional changes in zzso cultured zzso This regulation, which appears to respond to the cellular need for new zzso operates by changing the fraction of zzso engaged on zzso each translated zzso zzso always remaining fully loaded with zzso All zzso analyzed up to now show this zzso behavior, and also share some structural features in their untranslated zzso In particular they all have rather short zzso untranslated regions, similar to each other, and always start at the very zzso end with a stretch of several zzso Fusion to a zzso sequence of the zzso untranslated region of zzso zzso has shown that this is involved in the zzso zzso
