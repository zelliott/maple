A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso hot spring on the zzso zzso The cells were straight zzso zzso zzso in diameter and zzso zzso long, and exhibited tumbling zzso by means of zzso zzso The strain grew at zzso zzso with an optimum at zzso zzso and at pH zzso with an optimum at pH zzso Growth of zzso zzso was observed at zzso zzso zzso with an optimum at zzso zzso The generation time under optimal growth conditions was 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso grew and reduced zzso zzso or nitrate with a number of organic acids and complex zzso compounds as electron zzso It was capable of zzso growth using molecular hydrogen as an electron zzso zzso but not zzso or nitrate as an electron zzso and CO2 as a carbon zzso It also was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content of DNA of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the closest relative of the isolated zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso properties and zzso zzso the isolate is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first described representative of the zzso zzso that possesses the ability to reduce metals and does not zzso zzso
