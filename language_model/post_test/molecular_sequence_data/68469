The zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, positively regulates the zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso its own zzso By zzso mapping analysis, the in zzso zzso zzso start site was located 63 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso start zzso zzso the zzso and zzso promoters overlap and direct zzso in opposite zzso The zzso translation initiation zzso was identified by zzso zzso and the zzso coding sequence was cloned under the control of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso expressed at a high level with a zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso by zzso zzso affinity zzso and ammonium zzso zzso yielded pure zzso zzso zzso shift zzso confirmed that zzso is a zzso protein like the other members of the zzso zzso The zzso regulatory protein binds specifically to a zzso DNA zzso encompassing both the zzso and the zzso zzso
