Using zzso array analysis combined with zzso zzso interference zzso we have identified zzso as a target gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso are zzso longer than wild zzso zzso analysis shows zzso to be one of several genes suppressed in such zzso zzso of zzso function by zzso also resulted in long zzso suggesting that it is a negative regulator of body zzso zzso was then mapped to, and shown to be identical to, zzso a known gene that affects body zzso zzso encodes a 312 zzso acid protein with a motif sequence that is zzso from plants to zzso zzso studies confirm that zzso is zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso is a novel downstream component of the zzso zzso growth regulation zzso zzso with this, zzso is expressed mainly in the zzso and adult zzso and has zzso effects on body length associated with changes in zzso zzso but not zzso cell zzso
