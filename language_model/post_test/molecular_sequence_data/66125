Whether zzso contributes to DNA zzso arrest in zzso has been zzso To investigate this issue further, we generated zzso zzso zzso cells by gene targeting and compared their cell cycle response to zzso radiation zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After moderate doses of zzso (4 zzso we find that zzso cells which are in zzso or S phase at the time of zzso arrest efficiently in zzso In contrast, zzso cells which are in zzso when DNA damage is incurred exhibit an impaired zzso delay compared to zzso with the result that cells enter zzso with damaged DNA as judged by the presence of numerous zzso zzso on condensed zzso zzso zzso delay as the result of zzso zzso can be detected at very low doses of radiation zzso zzso and may allow division with spontaneous DNA damage, since a higher proportion of zzso zzso cells bear spontaneous zzso zzso and damaged zzso during zzso growth compared to zzso The contribution of zzso to zzso delay is zzso to that of zzso since zzso cells exhibit no measurable zzso delay at any radiation dose zzso We suggest that this function of zzso could contribute to zzso suppression, since cell division with low levels of spontaneous damage is likely to promote genetic instability and thus zzso
