zzso zzso is the central domain of a zzso protein which has been zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso the zzso domain, zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso between species has enabled identification of three zzso of zinc at the zzso site as zzso 17 and zzso The zzso zzso acids of the zzso sequence zzso zzso from zzso are zzso between zzso from 8 zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso form a zzso at the active site and that zzso for which even the conservative zzso zzso yields an inactive zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso with a reduced affinity for zzso The zzso for zzso zzso increased from zzso to 11 zzso while the zzso decreased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso implicating this zzso in only a minor way with binding of zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso indicating involvement of this zzso zzso in both binding and zzso The zzso zzso increased the zzso for zzso zzso with a zzso increase in zzso suggesting that this zzso may form a hydrogen bond with the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
