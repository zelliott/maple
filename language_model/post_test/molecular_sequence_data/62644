zzso zzso zzso play important roles in both the zzso and zzso However, the mechanisms that regulate the formation, zzso and stability of zzso zzso zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we use the readily accessible mouse superior cervical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to examine the assembly of the zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso We find that novel zzso forms of zzso zzso density zzso are expressed in zzso By zzso we show that zzso proteins precisely zzso with zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso at zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso is enriched in the zzso fraction of zzso and zzso shows that zzso and zzso zzso form a complex in zzso Furthermore, two additional components of the well characterized zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso are also present at zzso zzso zzso To assess the function of this protein complex at zzso zzso zzso in zzso we examined zzso in mice that lack zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso form properly in zzso zzso zzso After zzso however, synaptic clusters of zzso zzso much faster in mice lacking zzso than those in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a key component of the zzso scaffold at zzso zzso zzso and plays an important role in synaptic zzso In addition, these results suggest that the mechanism of zzso scaffolding is zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
