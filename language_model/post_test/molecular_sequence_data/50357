The hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso have zzso structures very similar to that of human zzso zzso zzso was tested in detail by three separate criteria: zzso by analyzing each putative secondary structural element for conservation of appropriate zzso regions, zzso by detailed comparison of putative active site zzso in zzso with their authentic counterparts in human zzso and zzso by comparison of zzso at the putative zzso interface of the zzso with the authentic zzso in zzso All three criteria are satisfied in a convincing way for the 7 zzso that were considered, supporting the conclusion that the structural scaffolding and the overall zzso structure (which determines the location of functional sites and zzso are remarkably similar for the zzso and for zzso These analyses together with the crystal structures of human zzso zzso formed the basis for construction of a molecular model for human zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso acid were also included in the zzso zzso the surface zzso in the zzso that holds the zzso were found to be highly charged and predominantly zzso allowing us to predict that the region around the zzso in the zzso should be basic in zzso The molecular model can be tested by zzso zzso of zzso predicted to be in the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso
