zzso and zzso of the budding zzso zzso zzso are members of a zzso family of cell cycle checkpoint protein zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that these zzso zzso contain zzso zzso and are thus considerably larger than previously predicted by sequence comparisons zzso zzso In zzso expression of the zzso defined zzso zzso domain, but not a zzso containing only the predicted domain zzso inhibited the zzso induction of repair genes following replication zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso domain plays an important role in the zzso function of the zzso protein zzso
