zzso is thought to play an important role, not only in the metabolism of water and zzso but also in the regulation of zzso zzso This year, great progress has been achieved in molecular biology of zzso zzso First, the cloning of a complementary DNA, zzso the rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The liver zzso encodes a protein with seven putative zzso zzso which binds zzso zzso and related compounds with affinities similar to the native rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso is distributed in rat zzso known to contain zzso zzso Second, the cloning of a complementary DNA zzso the rat kidney V2 zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The kidney zzso encodes a protein with a zzso topography characteristic of G zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is detected only in the zzso Last year, an orally active and specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first zzso The zzso or zzso administration of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso while that induced by zzso II was not zzso zzso may have clinical zzso in certain zzso cardiovascular zzso In addition, an orally active and specific zzso V2 zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso administration of zzso inhibited zzso action of zzso zzso zzso is thought to be useful in the treatment of certain disorders, such as the syndrome of inappropriate zzso of zzso zzso
