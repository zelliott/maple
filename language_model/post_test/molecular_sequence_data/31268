In zzso cells alternative zzso of zzso zzso precursors zzso is a means of regulating gene zzso Although a number of the components that participate in regulating some alternative zzso events have been identified by molecular genetic procedures, the zzso of the zzso mechanisms governing alternative zzso requires in zzso reaction zzso The tissue specificity of P element zzso in zzso depends on the zzso restriction of zzso zzso of the P element third zzso zzso zzso P element zzso zzso zzso were spliced accurately in zzso in zzso human cell extracts but not in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell extracts that specifically inhibited zzso zzso in zzso were detected by a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso binding proteins were then used to detect a zzso protein that interacts specifically with zzso zzso sequences previously implicated in the control of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso could be correlated with binding of the zzso protein to zzso zzso zzso suggesting that one aspect of zzso zzso zzso involves zzso repression by specific zzso zzso
