zzso of the zzso zzso by specific zzso zzso has been shown to be essential but not sufficient for the development of zzso zzso zzso To identify other genes which either mark important steps in zzso or which reflect the cellular differentiation state of zzso cells we have compared tumor cells to immortalized zzso B cells by zzso zzso We have identified a complementary DNA clone which encodes a novel member of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso The corresponding zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso zzso but not in other cell lines either of the B cell lineage or of other zzso or zzso zzso This exclusive expression of zzso and the zzso potential of this zzso class supports the hypothesis that zzso exerts a regulatory function in zzso zzso and/or B cell zzso Moreover, the protein sequence is highly related to that of receptors for the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may represent a potential candidate involved in the process of zzso trafficking, zzso zzso and zzso of mature B zzso in zzso zzso
