zzso are zzso zzso molecules that mediate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate cell growth, zzso migration and zzso and as a consequence, can have a potential role in zzso progression and zzso In this study, we investigated 19 zzso zzso in the coding region of the human zzso genes representing 3 beta zzso and 13 alpha zzso for their potential role in melanoma zzso and zzso The zzso were selected on the basis of probable functional relevance and theoretical zzso Our data showed that no genetic zzso was significantly associated with zzso However, the zzso in zzso and zzso genes showed association with decreased risk, and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were associated with increased risk of zzso The zzso analysis revealed association of CA zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with the risk zzso A prediction analysis of functional effect, zzso zzso and multiple sequence alignments of zzso sequences from different species supported our data for linkage of zzso in the zzso and zzso genes with zzso The zzso acid changes in each of these zzso proteins could affect zzso and/or the interaction of the zzso Our experimental data indicated a possible role for some of the zzso zzso and/or zzso of the zzso genes in melanoma zzso which is zzso by the theoretical analysis zzso
