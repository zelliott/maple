zzso oxide produced by zzso oxide zzso appears to have an important role in the regulation of zzso tone, zzso zzso and smooth muscle cell zzso Our aim was to investigate the effects of balloon zzso on expression of zzso NO zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the pig carotid artery and to relate any changes in expression to the processes of zzso and vascular zzso 

Pigs were sacrificed at various time points to follow zzso expression in the zzso media and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso and zzso expression in the vessel zzso Relative amounts of zzso were measured using quantitative in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by competitive zzso based on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso carotid arteries exhibited dense uniform zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso cells and a marked reduction of zzso gene expression but a complete recovery was noted by day zzso In normal zzso carotid arteries no evidence of zzso zzso was zzso but 24 h after injury, marked homogeneous zzso zzso was detected in zzso vascular smooth muscle zzso By 5 days, zzso was evident in cells within the forming zzso layer with no evidence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso persisted in cells at the zzso surface at 7 days and zzso gene expression appeared to be sustained in some animals with zzso internal elastic zzso at 21 zzso 

zzso injury is associated with zzso and a marked reduction in zzso gene expression and zzso zzso is induced throughout the zzso media within zzso soon after balloon injury and persists for up to 21 zzso These observations imply an important regulatory role for locally generated NO in the zzso response to balloon zzso
