Nuclear hormone receptors zzso are zzso zzso factors that regulate target gene zzso We report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human zzso zzso zzso a zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso a approximately zzso protein zzso with zzso by zzso expression zzso zzso binds to zzso hormone zzso zzso and other zzso in a zzso manner and enhances zzso zzso activity of zzso The zzso region in zzso has been thought to play a critical role in zzso zzso zzso by the interaction with zzso Surprisingly, zzso retains strong zzso interaction with an zzso zzso of zzso zzso while zzso fails to interact with this zzso Furthermore, we identified a critical zzso binding site in rat zzso outside of zzso as zzso shows weak zzso interaction with a zzso 3 zzso binding domain zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso that may exhibit its activity by interacting with zzso of zzso other than the zzso region, in contrast to zzso
