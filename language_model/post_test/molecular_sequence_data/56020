zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso regulators and controls induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso was zzso by employing the zzso chain reaction to introduce an efficient zzso sequence and suitable restriction zzso sites for cloning into a chemically zzso zzso expression zzso When induced in zzso coli, the modified zzso gene rapidly zzso the zzso protein as an zzso zzso The zzso protein could be zzso with zzso M zzso and remained soluble when zzso against zzso M zzso The zzso properties of zzso were exploited to selectively zzso and zzso the protein in a nearly zzso zzso zzso was then zzso by a single zzso zzso step which demonstrated that zzso exists in solution as a zzso zzso zzso Several milligrams of zzso zzso could be obtained routinely from a 1-1 culture of induced zzso A zzso zzso buffer containing 300 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to stabilize zzso and used to demonstrate zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso binds a zzso DNA with an zzso sequence which competes with binding by the zzso zzso These findings are discussed in terms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to interact with its zzso operator as a zzso of zzso
