zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to be involved in zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of the zzso of zzso disease, we previously isolated and zzso the zzso genes of two B cell clones zzso and zzso producing a zzso zzso zzso zzso a stimulating type of zzso obtained from patients with zzso zzso In the present study, we produced a large amount of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells using these genes and characterized zzso First, we tried to identify their zzso in the zzso by using a panel of zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell surface expression level of each zzso was confirmed by zzso cell zzso analysis using a zzso zzso in the zzso (but not zzso region of the zzso domain of zzso zzso or reduced zzso activities of both zzso whereas they had opposite effects on zzso zzso zzso generation by zzso significantly decreased in the receptors zzso in zzso acids zzso and zzso and that by zzso decreased in zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and tested for binding to cells expressing high levels of zzso Although their affinities were lower than that of zzso their binding was not displaced by zzso The zzso binding was not mutually zzso These findings suggest that these zzso interact with the zzso region of the zzso and zzso a signal through binding sites different from zzso We believe that this is the first report of the characterization of human zzso zzso on their zzso and zzso confirming previous reports using patient zzso or zzso zzso zzso
