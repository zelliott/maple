A novel zzso zzso named as zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso of the hard zzso zzso zzso by gel zzso zzso exchange zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso Its zzso acid sequence was determined as zzso by zzso degradation and its molecular weight was zzso analyzed by fast atom zzso zzso mass zzso This is the first zzso zzso from ticks that lacks zzso in its primary zzso The zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso library zzso The predicted protein from the zzso sequence composed of 79 zzso acids including mature zzso zzso zzso exerted its zzso activities against bacteria and zzso No similarity was found by zzso search to any database entries and, thus, our findings describe a novel zzso zzso
