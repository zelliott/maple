Secondary or zzso structure in an zzso such as a zzso can create a physical barrier that requires the zzso to generate additional force to zzso The presence of such a barrier can dramatically increase the probability that the zzso will shift into an alternate reading frame, in which a different set of zzso is zzso The detailed zzso mechanism by which zzso is induced remains zzso Here we employ optical zzso techniques to investigate the structure of a zzso programmed zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence element located in the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso for zzso and is, to our knowledge, the first known human zzso zzso signal of zzso zzso We begin by presenting a set of zzso predicted structures that include zzso We then employ what we believe to be new zzso techniques for measuring the effective free energy landscapes of zzso We find that the zzso zzso element zzso several distinct unfolding pathways when subject to zzso force, one of which is consistent with a proposed zzso zzso and another of which we have identified as a folding zzso The dynamic ensemble of zzso that zzso zzso exhibits in the zzso experiments may be a significant feature of the zzso zzso
