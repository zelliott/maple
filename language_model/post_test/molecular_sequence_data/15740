The regulatory proteins zzso and zzso control expression of the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso does not bind directly to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but it binds to the zzso promoter, in a region overlapping with the zzso zzso zzso I zzso studies revealed a zzso protected region of 26 zzso zzso zzso two direct repeats of 11 zzso that zzso with the zzso binding zzso zzso experiments indicated a competition between zzso and zzso increasing zzso of zzso resulted in the disappearance of the zzso zzso zzso studies using the reporter zzso gene coupled to zzso promoter showed that zzso zzso zzso expression probably by a competition with the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso binds to other zzso promoters including those of zzso (a component of the zzso transport zzso and zzso zzso the two component system zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences in each of these promoters allowed us to distinguish the zzso binding sequence from the overlapping zzso zzso The zzso regulation of the zzso promoter by zzso and of zzso by zzso suggests a fine interplay of these regulators on the control of secondary zzso
