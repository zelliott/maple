The complete structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso by a combination of chemical, zzso and zzso methods, confirming an earlier proposed sugar sequence and assigning the locations of the zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by a zzso into zzso units which were uniform in zzso composition and zzso These units also contained a uniform distribution of zzso and zzso zzso zzso groups, and half of them were further zzso with zzso zzso A much smaller proportion (less than zzso of the zzso was further zzso by a second zzso zzso The locations of the zzso were determined chemically and by zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso structure of the zzso chain were determined by zzso analysis using zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso studies on the reduced, zzso zzso zzso studies were supplemented by zzso analyses on the original zzso The zzso were found to be zzso zzso with four sugar zzso in each branch, and the zzso sequence agreed well with that expected from earlier zzso In the zzso sequence and structure zzso the sugar zzso are zzso zzso through zzso The main chain zzso is composed of a zzso acid group zzso that is linked to zzso of a zzso acid zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso c is zzso to zzso of the branching zzso zzso zzso The side chain consists of a zzso zzso group zzso which is zzso to zzso of zzso 9 of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The reducing end of the resulting zzso zzso is zzso to zzso of the branching zzso zzso zzso In the native zzso this branching zzso is zzso to zzso of the modified zzso acid zzso zzso which is the zzso sugar in the zzso A small proportion of the zzso atoms of the zzso zzso acid zzso is zzso because of zzso zzso The two terminal zzso zzso and zzso of the branch chain bear zzso zzso The zzso groups of half of the zzso are zzso by zzso groups at zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
