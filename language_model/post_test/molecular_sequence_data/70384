The sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso have been obtained from a number of strains of zzso zzso that express zzso molecules with differing zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the mature proteins each comprise 308 zzso and show considerable zzso with the degree of sequence variation between zzso molecules being considerably less than seen previously with zzso but more evenly distributed throughout the zzso The positions of sequence variation are largely confined to the regions predicted to form one of eight zzso zzso suggesting a more widespread distribution of potential zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were used to zzso peptides for zzso mapping zzso Some zzso responsible for zzso specificity or recognized by zzso zzso zzso could be identified on the basis of their zzso with simple linear zzso whilst others recognized zzso zzso By comparison of sequence differences with zzso zzso it was possible to identify regions that appear to contribute to such zzso including separated regions of the zzso which together were required for the formation of the zzso zzso All the zzso identified lie at or close to the zzso of the predicted zzso zzso 1, 3, 6, or 8, focusing attention on these regions as accessible targets for immune zzso
