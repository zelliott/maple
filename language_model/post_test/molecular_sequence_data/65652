The bacterial zzso community of eight zzso confinement buildings zzso was monitored during two visits in the winter, and one during the zzso To our knowledge, zzso approaches and molecular biology tools such as biomass zzso and zzso analyses have never been applied to zzso building zzso zzso Total DNA of each sample was extracted and zzso by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso analysis using zzso targeting the bacterial zzso zzso zzso Even though the total bacterial concentration was higher in winter than in summer, the total bacterial concentration for both seasons was 100 zzso times higher than the total cultural zzso The concentration of zzso was influenced by the temperature indoors, which was regulated with an electronic fan system driving warm air and particles outside of the zzso zzso of the zzso profiles showed the same zzso in each zzso during both zzso The zzso analysis revealed a large number of sequences zzso related to zzso zzso bacteria, such as zzso and dominated by the zzso cluster I zzso zzso and the zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso The zzso diversity also contained also a low proportion of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the global community and zzso diversity showed that the main source of zzso could come from the pig zzso zzso
