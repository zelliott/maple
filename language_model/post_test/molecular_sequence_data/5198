A zzso zzso which encodes salmon zzso zzso activated zzso y zzso was amplified by zzso from the liver of Atlantic salmon zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the amplified zzso product was similar to the zzso of mouse and zzso 59% of the bases were zzso Northern zzso analysis of salmon liver zzso showed that the amplified zzso zzso zzso to three specific transcripts of lengths zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso administered to salmon zzso in culture, resulted in a zzso increase of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso after administration of zzso These results indicate that zzso is an important factor in zzso zzso response to zzso in zzso
