zzso genes were amplified by the zzso chain reaction from zzso isolated from peripheral blood B cells of rabbits zzso with protein zzso The amplified genes were cloned into a zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso A library of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened with zzso protein C and 30 positive clones were zzso Three of them were plaque zzso and the affinity of the single domain zzso to the zzso determined to be zzso zzso zzso The data indicate the feasibility of generating single domain zzso specific to protein zzso from zzso
