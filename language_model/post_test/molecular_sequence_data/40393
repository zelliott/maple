A considerable number of species of the zzso possess multiple copies of the zzso zzso gene that exhibit more than zzso zzso complicating zzso zzso Two additional problems have been pointed out: zzso the zzso zzso and zzso show a very close relationship, with some species being shown to overlap in zzso trees reconstructed by the zzso method, and zzso zzso and zzso species of the zzso zzso form definitely separate clusters in zzso trees, suggesting that these two clusters could be separated into two zzso In an attempt to solve these problems, the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used as an additional target zzso for zzso analysis, using partial sequences of zzso zzso In this work, a primer set was designed that consistently amplified the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso from 85 strains in 27 zzso of the zzso zzso in sequence length were found within the first 15 to 31 zzso and their downstream sequences zzso zzso were aligned zzso without any gaps or zzso zzso trees reconstructed from zzso sequences and deduced zzso acid sequences by the zzso method demonstrated that multiple zzso in most zzso individually formed cohesive zzso Two discrepancies were zzso zzso the two species of zzso were placed in definitely different positions, in that zzso zzso was placed in the zzso zzso while zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the three other zzso species in the protein tree, while all four species formed a cluster in the gene tree, although supported by a zzso value of less than zzso The six zzso zzso and the five species of zzso formed a large cluster in both trees, with zzso zzso and zzso zzso located in the cluster in the protein tree and zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso broke into the cluster of the zzso zzso instead of the zzso zzso in the gene zzso The six zzso species formed a tight cluster with two zzso of zzso species and zzso species, in both zzso Overall, our data strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso is a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso might represent a new zzso and zzso the two zzso zzso and zzso might constitute a single zzso As more and more novel species and zzso are proposed in the family zzso the full sequence of the zzso gene may provide a supplementary tool for determining the zzso position of new zzso
