zzso of the heat shock response in zzso zzso has indicated that at least 15 proteins are induced by a temperature zzso from 30 to 42 degrees zzso These so-called heat shock proteins include zzso and zzso two highly zzso molecular zzso Several genes zzso heat shock proteins of zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso The zzso zzso includes the genes zzso (a heat shock gene with an unknown zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso the genes zzso and zzso The zzso gene coding for a member of the small heat shock protein family constitutes a zzso zzso Interestingly, the heat shock response in this zzso is regulated by a zzso which is obviously different from that found in zzso zzso So far, no evidence for a heat zzso zzso factor of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been zzso In this zzso like in many zzso and several zzso bacteria, a zzso zzso repeat is located upstream of zzso stress genes such as zzso and zzso and may be implicated as a zzso regulatory zzso The zzso repeat is not present in the promoter region of zzso zzso in zzso zzso there are at least two classes of heat shock genes with respect to the type of zzso Evidence has been found that a zzso is involved in the regulation of the heat shock response in zzso zzso However, this regulation seems to be independent of the zzso repeat zzso and the mechanism by which the zzso repeat motif mediates regulation remains to be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
