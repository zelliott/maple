Bloom syndrome zzso is a rare genetic disorder characterized by small body size, zzso zzso and a high predisposition to various types of zzso zzso was identified as the zzso gene for zzso The zzso protein is zzso to DNA zzso and has two basic zzso acid clusters in its zzso zzso Previously, we reported that the zzso arm of these basic zzso acids clusters in the zzso protein functioned as the nuclear zzso signal zzso of the zzso In this study, we generated zzso zzso for expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso fused with various zzso protein zzso having a zzso with deletions or zzso in the basic zzso acid and analyzed the zzso zzso of the expressed zzso The zzso protein containing the basic zzso acid cluster region zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso was localized exclusively in the zzso However, the zzso proteins that lacked either zzso or zzso distributed in both the zzso and the nucleus zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in zzso in both the nucleus and zzso and substitution of zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso acids reduced the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso Mouse zzso protein which also migrate to the nucleus has two basic zzso acid clusters in the zzso and the basic zzso acids zzso zzso to the zzso are zzso between mouse and zzso These findings suggest that the zzso sequence at the zzso of the human zzso protein is essential for nuclear zzso of this zzso
