Active human tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + SP zzso referred to as zzso was zzso as a zzso protein in zzso coli, isolated, and zzso zzso is a relatively large and complex zzso approximately 38 zzso in size and containing nine zzso zzso zzso without a pro region was zzso into the zzso of zzso coli by fusing the protein to the zzso leader zzso expressed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso from zzso coli zzso as a zzso active zzso by using a combination of zzso and zzso inhibitor affinity zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and the zzso was identical with the predicted zzso acid zzso The specific activity of zzso zzso from zzso coli was compared against the equivalent zzso material zzso from zzso cells that was naturally zzso zzso or zzso after treatment with zzso zzso zzso from four different in zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso had similar zzso Both exhibited zzso higher specific activity than zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that an inaccurate picture of specific activity can be obtained if the effects of zzso are not zzso By zzso of zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso was zzso without in zzso zzso and was shown to be suitable for zzso zzso
