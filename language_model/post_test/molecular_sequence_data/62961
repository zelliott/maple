We have recently isolated a novel zzso at the active zone zzso zzso zzso and found it directly binds another zzso protein zzso and indirectly binds zzso through zzso zzso and zzso directly bind to each other and are implicated in zzso of synaptic zzso Here, we show that all the zzso proteins thus far known form a large molecular complex in the brain, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso directly bind to the zzso zzso and central region of zzso respectively, forming a zzso zzso zzso which is structurally related to zzso also binds to the zzso region of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso or zzso region of CAST zzso synaptic transmission in cultured superior cervical zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso domain of zzso or zzso also zzso synaptic transmission in the cultured zzso These results indicate that CAST serves as a key component of the zzso structure and is involved in neurotransmitter release by binding these zzso zzso
