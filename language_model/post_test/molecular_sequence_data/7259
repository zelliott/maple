zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso grown on zzso zzso Its zzso zzso acid zzso sequence was determined, as was that of a commercial zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso were made to the zzso region of the zzso gene from zzso using this information and to the 3' region using zzso zzso sequence data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso An almost complete zzso zzso was amplified from zzso zzso DNA via the zzso chain reaction zzso This zzso was zzso zzso and used to probe a Southern zzso from which a zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso open reading frame zzso was zzso The complete zzso sequence of this zzso zzso was determined and zzso to a protein of 364 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was cloned into zzso using zzso and transformed into zzso zzso zzso active zzso was produced to zzso of soluble zzso coli zzso The deduced zzso sequence of this zzso is compared to the zzso sequences of four known zzso from bacteria, zzso zzso and plant zzso
