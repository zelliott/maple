zzso zzso transformations are integral to zzso biological zzso Further, structured zzso molecules exist as a series of dynamic zzso in the course of folding or zzso with zzso Thus, an understanding of zzso folding and function will require deep and incisive understanding of its dynamic zzso However, existing tools to investigate zzso dynamics are zzso Here, we introduce a powerful zzso polarization zzso approach that zzso a rare base analogue that retains substantial zzso when incorporated into zzso We show that zzso zzso can be used to follow the zzso dynamics of individual zzso We then use zzso to probe the dynamics of an individual zzso referred to as zzso within the zzso zzso group I zzso Comparisons of the dynamics of the zzso zzso in wild type and zzso zzso and in model zzso reveal a highly immobilized zzso state of the zzso zzso as expected, and a relatively mobile zzso zzso or zzso zzso This latter result rules out a model in which slow zzso of the zzso zzso into its zzso zzso interactions arises from a stable alternatively zzso zzso The results are consistent with a model in which stacking and zzso interactions of the zzso zzso connecting the zzso zzso to the body of the zzso limit zzso mobility and slow its zzso and this model is supported by zzso zzso The ability to isolate the zzso motions of individual zzso within complex zzso and zzso complexes will be valuable in distinguishing between functional models and in discerning the fundamental behavior of important biological zzso
