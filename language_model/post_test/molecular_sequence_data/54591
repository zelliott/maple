zzso aspects of zzso synthesis in insects have been studied deeply in species with zzso zzso Information available in insects with zzso zzso is principally structural whereas molecular information in these species is zzso This paper seeks to balance the above situation by describing a novel zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso insect with reproduction regulated by juvenile hormone and with zzso zzso During previous work we discovered a series of novel genes which were specifically expressed during zzso formation in zzso zzso One of them, zzso named zzso was peculiar due to its high copy number and its very transient zzso In the present paper we characterize zzso in terms of structure and zzso The most prominent structural feature is that the protein contains a motif which is repeated 33 times encompassing almost all the zzso By using zzso techniques we have demonstrated that zzso is a key player in the building of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
