zzso in the zzso sequence that forms the core structure of zzso zzso are known to impact on zzso assembly and stability but the effect of changes on zzso zzso particularly relating to zzso zzso where the zzso core is zzso has not been systematically zzso In this study, the short zzso sequence zzso (also known as zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are used as a model system to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso and zzso influence the rate of zzso assembly in zzso samples with the zzso zzso at position 15 increasing the rate of zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso were also found to zzso more zzso indicating possible differences in mechanical zzso zzso of each type of zzso are capable of zzso and zzso generating zzso with a highly similar zzso core zzso The similar rates of assembly observed for zzso samples reflect the similar free energy of zzso calculated for these zzso while the zzso of zzso zzso is determined by the properties of the zzso zzso and its zzso arrangement within the zzso and zzso These findings illustrate that zzso zzso impact on zzso formation and zzso properties and demonstrate that the influence of zzso zzso should be considered when designing sequences for the production of zzso functional zzso zzso
