Here, we report and characterize deep sequencing data and zzso analysis of small zzso from zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso reads with perfect match to the zzso derived from zzso unique sequences were zzso zzso percent of zzso sequences were not found in previous reports from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that a large fraction of the small zzso are zzso zzso Up to zzso of small zzso mapped to zzso elements and zzso to zzso zzso Most of the abundant zzso small zzso are found in zzso and zzso libraries, suggesting that zzso also need to be silenced during early embryonic zzso zzso novel clusters of zzso whose expression is activated after zzso zzso begins were identified in the zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso were also identified and many of them are not present in zzso suggesting that zzso expression is zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high zzso data release and zzso characterization of small zzso during zzso early embryonic zzso
