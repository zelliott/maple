zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that exploits an existing zzso association between a zzso and a host zzso This unusual zzso is the only known zzso zzso land plant with a completely zzso life zzso The complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso to examine the effect of its zzso life history on zzso zzso zzso Using a partial zzso zzso library approach, the zzso was zzso and shown to be zzso zzso with a structure typical of green plant zzso Comparisons were made with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the only other zzso zzso sequence zzso All zzso genes are either absent or zzso Five of 15 zzso genes are zzso as are 2 of 6 zzso genes and 2 of 6 pet zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso The remaining complement of genes present in zzso zzso is present in the zzso of zzso zzso with intact open reading zzso All zzso and gene losses zzso with losses detected in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso though the latter has functional gene losses not found in zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso represents only the second zzso and first zzso to have its zzso zzso zzso We observed a pattern of zzso evolution zzso with functional gene losses in zzso zzso but suggest that its zzso zzso represents a zzso in the early stages of zzso following the relaxation of selection zzso
