The family zzso contains zzso bacteria with critical roles in ecology and zzso Within this family, many zzso and zzso strains are zzso plant zzso while many strains designated as zzso are plant zzso These contrasting lifestyles are primarily dependent on the zzso plasmids each strain zzso Members of the zzso also have diverse zzso zzso that include single zzso multiple zzso and plasmids of various zzso zzso strains have been divided into three zzso based on zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso I strain, zzso zzso zzso has been previously zzso In this study, the zzso of the zzso II strain zzso zzso zzso a commercially available biological control strain that zzso certain zzso zzso and the zzso III strain zzso zzso zzso a zzso strain that zzso grapes and zzso a hypersensitive response on zzso plants, were fully zzso and zzso zzso with other zzso members of the zzso provides new data on the evolution of zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso show extensive conservation of both gene content and zzso In contrast, secondary zzso share smaller percentages of zzso and zzso gene order is restricted to short zzso We propose that secondary zzso originated from an ancestral zzso to which genes have been transferred from a zzso primary zzso Similar patterns are observed in select zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results define the evolution of zzso architecture and gene content among the zzso and support a generalized mechanism for zzso formation among zzso
