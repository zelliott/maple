zzso zzso samples of zzso zzso zzso were obtained from South zzso Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and zzso From these samples, the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso zzso precise masses, and in zzso zzso activities were zzso We zzso two to four distinct zzso zzso from each zzso some of them displayed different zzso zzso toward zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso induced zzso but had no zzso zzso There was also a common basic zzso zzso in all the zzso We have cloned five zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso zzso masses and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso were matched with those deduced from the zzso zzso and the complete zzso acid sequences of five novel zzso zzso were thus zzso They share zzso or greater sequence identity, and a zzso based on the sequences of many zzso zzso zzso of New World pit zzso revealed at least two zzso The results contribute to a better understanding of the zzso adaptation of zzso and the zzso relationships and evolution of the zzso zzso in pit zzso zzso
