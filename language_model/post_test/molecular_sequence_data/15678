A zzso bacterial strain zzso zzso capable of zzso under extreme zzso conditions was isolated from soda zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The strain was classified within the zzso zzso According to the results of zzso zzso gene sequencing, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are most closely related to strain zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar to other members of the zzso the strain can grow within a wide range of zzso and zzso The strain was found to be capable of zzso reduction of zzso and zzso on mineral media at 160 zzso zzso and pH zzso The relatively low level of zzso similarity and the zzso characteristics supported zzso of strain zzso zzso as a new species zzso zzso
