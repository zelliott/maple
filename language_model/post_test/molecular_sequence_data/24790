Human zzso zzso is the most common zzso infection, and is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality in the newborn zzso zzso pig zzso zzso is transmitted through the zzso with resulting fetal infection, and provides an excellent model for the study of fetal zzso zzso We have characterized a cluster of late zzso zzso identifying zzso zzso of the zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also identified the zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso Surprisingly, no zzso zzso to zzso zzso was identified in the same zzso zzso Furthermore, two of the predicted zzso proteins share greater identity with zzso and/or zzso zzso than with other zzso zzso The identification of zzso zzso of zzso viral zzso particularly genes involved in zzso such as the G zzso zzso will facilitate future analysis of the role of these genes in zzso
