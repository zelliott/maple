zzso and zzso zzso channels differ in that the former are inhibited by zzso entering through its zzso while the latter are zzso It has been proposed on the basis of analysis of zzso zzso that the molecular zzso responsible for zzso zzso involve both a zzso zzso motif zzso hand) plus additional sequences located zzso to the zzso zzso Through construction of similar zzso zzso we transferred zzso zzso from zzso to zzso by replacing a zzso segment of zzso with the zzso zzso segment of zzso This segment is located immediately after the proposed zzso zzso zzso hand zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso hand with the corresponding zzso hand of zzso did not interfere with zzso of zzso by zzso and a triple zzso of zzso zzso that zzso the potential zzso ability of the zzso hand continued to be inhibited by zzso These results indicate that a small portion of the zzso C zzso is essential for zzso by zzso and place the zzso zzso site anywhere in zzso with the exception of its zzso zzso zzso
