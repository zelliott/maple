We have developed a data base of zzso proteins zzso by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso The data base contains two-dimensional patterns and derived information pertaining to zzso constituents of zzso and zzso mature T cells and immature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leukemia cells, and zzso cell zzso Using this data base, we have compared the protein constituents of mature T cells and immature zzso before and after zzso zzso A subset of zzso that are induced in mature T cells following zzso stimulation were found to be zzso expressed in immature zzso Other zzso exhibited differences in their expression between mature and immature zzso in a manner unrelated to zzso The identity of several zzso expressed or zzso induced proteins in zzso cells was established by zzso These initial findings point to significant differences in the molecular pathways leading to proliferation between mature and immature T zzso The construction of this database should facilitate further studies of zzso differentiation and zzso
