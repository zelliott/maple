A zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously identified as the critical domain for binding to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso We observed that the zzso core of this domain is poorly zzso between zzso and zzso and so may provide the basis for differences in G zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso peptides derived from the divergent sequences zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso competitively inhibited G zzso of the related zzso zzso confirming the involvement of this region in binding to G zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited G zzso activity of both zzso and zzso with zzso being significantly more potent than zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso peptides G showed the same relative zzso activities zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso This relative order of potency zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in a direct G zzso zzso No binding selectivity for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso G beta zzso was zzso The zzso value for G zzso of zzso was about double of that for zzso indicating a higher affinity between G zzso and zzso which is the expected result based on the findings with the zzso These findings show that the zzso peptides P represent the shortest sequence of zzso that can bind to G zzso and provide a demonstration of a functional difference between the G zzso binding zzso of zzso and zzso
