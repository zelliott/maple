zzso are important industrial zzso that convert zzso into their corresponding acids or, occasionally, zzso Atomic resolution structures of four members of the zzso zzso have been determined, but these differ from microbial zzso in that they do not form typical large zzso zzso At least two zzso the cyanide zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso form unusual spiral structures of 14 and 18 zzso zzso Evidence suggests that the formation of the spiral structure is essential for zzso zzso analysis reveals that the zzso differ from the zzso zzso by two insertions of between 12 and 14 zzso acids and a zzso extension of up to 35 zzso zzso The insertions are positioned at an zzso interface in the spiral and probably contribute to its zzso The other zzso responsible for the formation and/or stabilization of the spirals can also be zzso Comparative structure modeling enables identification of the zzso involved in these interacting surfaces, which are remote from the active zzso zzso of these interacting zzso usually leads to loss of zzso The effect of the zzso on activity in most cases can be rationalized in terms of a possible effect on spiral zzso
