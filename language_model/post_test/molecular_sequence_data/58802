A soluble zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso zzso This zzso is zzso by an zzso wavelength of zzso zzso a molecular mass of 21 193 Da (as determined by mass zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso sequencing yielded the zzso sequence up to the 50th zzso The iron content of zzso zzso and the zzso ratio of zzso identified this zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso revealed the presence of two distinguishable zzso species with zzso zzso 385 zzso zzso 20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso recorded on this zzso protein showed the presence of two distinct spectral species with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the higher potential zzso zzso In line with the differences in zzso values, the two zzso species were zzso by zzso with significantly differing zzso All the above mentioned properties demonstrate that this zzso protein belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso The characteristics and functional role of the studied zzso protein are discussed with reference to other zzso zzso described in zzso Its properties are zzso compared to other members of the zzso zzso zzso
