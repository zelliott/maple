The expression of zzso zzso was studied in guinea pig skeletal muscle at the zzso and protein level, and the effect of NO on zzso response was zzso zzso protection analyses demonstrated zzso I and zzso II zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In Western zzso zzso I and zzso II zzso were found in the particulate but not the soluble fraction of skeletal zzso zzso activity was found almost exclusively in the particulate zzso About 50% of this activity was zzso zzso In zzso the zzso I zzso stained distinct membrane regions of muscle zzso The most intense zzso was seen in zzso zzso identified by labeling with zzso The zzso II zzso labeled muscle fibers that contained zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso II was located to zzso structures and was also seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso of guinea pigs with bacterial zzso zzso markedly intensified zzso II zzso zzso zzso III zzso was detected only in vascular zzso In functional experiments, zzso muscle zzso were induced in zzso and zzso muscle by electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso of guinea pigs with zzso or addition of zzso to the organ bath markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, increased zzso force and reversed the effect of zzso Our data indicate that zzso II and zzso I are expressed in different structures of skeletal muscle and are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
