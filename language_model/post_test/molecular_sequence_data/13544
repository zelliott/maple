The zzso cell nucleus is a highly dynamic zzso This is illustrated most dramatically during zzso when the nuclear envelope breaks down, the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso apparatus distributes sister zzso to the dividing daughter zzso Many of these dramatic changes in nuclear architecture and zzso organization are controlled by zzso and zzso zzso Whereas the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso is well established, there is now clear evidence for the requirement of additional zzso protein zzso Studies into the regulation of zzso and other zzso zzso have revealed that these zzso undergo cell cycle dependent changes in zzso distribution, suggesting that zzso may contribute to regulating their zzso This article describes some recent findings relating to the zzso zzso of zzso complexes at the onset of zzso In addition, it summarizes recent information on two novel human protein zzso which have been implicated in the control of zzso zzso
