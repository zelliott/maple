Leaf zzso of barley have been identified as a novel class of cell wall zzso toxic to plant zzso zzso and possibly involved in the defense mechanism of plants zzso zzso Clausen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hiller, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso 7, zzso In the present work a second zzso of zzso has been detected within the leaf cell, mainly in the zzso zzso of both groups are closely related to each zzso They are toxic to zzso zzso as well as to plant zzso they share similar zzso acid zzso and their synthesis in zzso zzso of barley is zzso by zzso Despite these similarities each of the two zzso of zzso could be clearly distinguished by its zzso zzso In zzso sections of embedded zzso leaf material, cell wall zzso could be zzso labeled specifically by an zzso raised against a fusion protein of zzso coli zzso and the 15,000 Mr precursor zzso of zzso This zzso did not react with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were recognized specifically by an zzso raised against soluble leaf zzso The possible function of zzso zzso as part of a defense mechanism has been zzso
