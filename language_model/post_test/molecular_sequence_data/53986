The bacterial zzso sequence zzso when repeated in tandem efficiently promotes zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso An zzso junction region which had been engineered to contain unique zzso and zzso sites close to the zzso zzso was not affected in the ability to form zzso with target zzso Based on this finding, a novel procedure of random zzso zzso zzso was zzso Suicide plasmids containing the engineered junction region zzso and zzso formed zzso with target plasmids in an zzso host strain expressing the zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso were resolved in zzso by restriction with zzso or zzso and zzso thus, insertions of four or 11 zzso respectively, were created in the target DNA, practically at zzso The cloned zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso Of 20 different zzso insertions in zzso 11 zzso the zzso Among the remaining nine zzso zzso which retained zzso activity, three zzso zzso had reduced affinity for the zzso zzso and one had lost recognition of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso insertions obtained illustrate the usefulness of the method in the analysis of zzso relationships of zzso
