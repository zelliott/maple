We determined zzso base pairs of DNA sequence in the zzso small zzso zzso from two geographically distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso likelihood and zzso analysis of these sequences place zzso zzso in the order zzso of the class zzso The zzso zzso sequences from these two zzso only differ within a single region of 16 zzso zzso Based on the distant zzso relationship of these organisms to zzso zzso and similarity to zzso zzso we propose the zzso be renamed zzso zzso
