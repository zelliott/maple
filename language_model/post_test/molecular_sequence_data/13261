zzso zzso is a simple zzso that lives as an zzso until zzso triggers zzso The zzso forms a zzso which then develops into a zzso body with two main cell types, stalk and spore zzso Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain zzso zzso Studies using expression of the zzso gene as a zzso cell marker indicated that zzso of zzso determine cell fate in the zzso However, studies using zzso or the zzso zzso 2 zzso gene product as a zzso cell marker indicated that cell autonomous factors such as zzso phase at the time of zzso cause an initial choice of cell zzso To help resolve these differences, we have used transformed cells containing the promoter of the zzso gene zzso fused to zzso zzso and Williams, zzso to study the differentiation of zzso cells at low cell density, at which zzso interactions and zzso zzso are zzso We find that under all conditions of low cell density in which express zzso the zzso fusion gene occurs, it is invariably detected in less than zzso of the cells from a zzso zzso This suggests that a zzso mechanism is involved in zzso zzso We then used zzso zzso to examine the zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso In developing zzso 9 to zzso of the cells are zzso from 12 to 24 zzso of zzso The zzso cells are first detected at 16 zzso as a subset of the zzso cells and then increase in zzso At approximately 20 zzso the zzso cells and the zzso cells are almost completely overlapping zzso By late development, all of the zzso cells are zzso and an additional zzso of the zzso cells are also zzso This indicates that up to 20 zzso development, zzso is expressed only in zzso zzso The data thus suggest that zzso phase at the time of zzso causes an initial choice of cell type and that during later development other factors influence cell zzso
