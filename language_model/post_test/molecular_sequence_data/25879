A zzso zzso long zzso element called zzso was found in the 3' zzso region of a zzso zzso zzso ring zzso As shown by sequence comparison with a second zzso zzso is characterized by a perfect terminal zzso repeat of 17 zzso flanked by a duplicated target site of 8 zzso four internal imperfect zzso repeats of 17 to 26 zzso and terminal regions of about zzso zzso with a high number of short direct repeats of the consensus sequence zzso or zzso and zzso forms such as zzso or zzso The terminal zzso repeats and the 8 zzso target site zzso are reminiscent of zzso P and zzso elements but no long open reading frame starting with zzso is present, suggesting that the two zzso copies studied represent deletion derivatives of a longer element coding for its own zzso In zzso zzso revealed about 75 zzso sites distributed over all zzso with the zzso ring locus most strongly zzso Fifty percent of the sites are specific for a given individual, and these variable sites are often zzso for the zzso
