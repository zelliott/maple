zzso zzso zzso I zzso I) genes were used to increase the plasticity of plants by zzso external signals and regulating growth in response to environmental zzso The way zzso histories drove the evolution of the zzso I family in zzso species was zzso zzso I genes were searched in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and then divided into five zzso through zzso zzso zzso analysis was made based on zzso segments containing the zzso I zzso Some pairs turned out to conform with zzso zzso regions, while others corresponded to those that were zzso expanded, or contracted after the divergence of zzso Besides, we dated their zzso by zzso analysis and demonstrated that all the blocks were formed after the zzso zzso we observed zzso ratios representing strong zzso selections in the four zzso species which might have been followed by gene loss and zzso
