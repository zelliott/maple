The key three-dimensional features of zzso have been unveiled by X-ray zzso investigations carried out on the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso are made of a zzso domain fused with a zzso zzso zzso binding module and display highly zzso sequences in the active sites of both the zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso studies are discussed and zzso approaches to the solution of the crystal structures and to the analysis of the relevant zzso properties of the active sites are zzso The understanding of the structural properties of zzso serves as a guide for testing biological hypotheses and allows for a rational evaluation of zzso alignments within the zzso zzso
