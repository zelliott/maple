The zzso giant tube zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso an Mr zzso zzso and an Mr 440,000 zzso The former has a zzso zzso structure and consists of six zzso chains zzso a study of its zzso content shows that not all of the chains contain zzso The Mr 440,000 zzso consists of four zzso chains zzso We isolated most of the chains by zzso zzso and determined the zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso Eight chains zzso and zzso showed significant zzso with zzso chains of zzso giant zzso The highest zzso was found between zzso chain zzso and zzso chain zzso surprisingly, 18 out of the 20 zzso zzso are zzso On the other hand, chain zzso with an unusual Mr of zzso showed a rather different sequence and is likely to be a zzso chain which might act as a zzso protein in the assembly of the zzso zzso From these results, we conclude that the tube zzso Mr zzso zzso is highly zzso with zzso zzso
