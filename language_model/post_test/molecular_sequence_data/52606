The zzso zzso identified by the screening of a zzso zzso zzso DNA library with a zzso zzso encodes a protein with a zinc finger structure immediately followed by the consensus sequence of the zzso GAP zzso zzso The serum of mice zzso with the zzso protein recognized specifically the zzso of the late infected zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso database gave the highest scores with four proteins presenting an zzso GAP zzso If presenting also this activity, the zzso protein could be involved in the regulation of the zzso protein zzso transport and, consequently, in the zzso zzso
