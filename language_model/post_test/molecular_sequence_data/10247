zzso responses of the malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso were monitored systematically by the induced expression of five zzso markers after infection zzso One newly isolated marker encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and another zzso to a zzso zzso zzso Additional previously described markers that respond to immune challenge zzso the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso zzso of the immune responses was indicated by differing zzso patterns of induction of specific markers in zzso larvae and adults, and by variations in the effectiveness of different zzso and their components for marker induction in an zzso cell zzso The markers exhibit zzso distinct patterns of expression in the adult female zzso Two of them are highly expressed in different regions of the zzso one in the anterior and the other in the zzso zzso zzso induction indicates a significant role of the zzso in insect innate zzso zzso responses to the penetration of the zzso zzso by a malaria zzso occur both within the zzso itself and elsewhere in the body, suggesting an zzso signaling zzso
