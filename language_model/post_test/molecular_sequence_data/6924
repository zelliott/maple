Identification of zzso zzso from foreign proteins is the current focus of much zzso zzso using simple two or three position motifs have proved useful in zzso prediction for major zzso complex zzso class I, but to date not for zzso class II zzso We zzso data from pool sequence analysis of peptides zzso from two zzso zzso to construct a computer zzso for predicting the probability that a given sequence will be naturally processed and presented on these zzso We assessed the ability of this method to predict known zzso from these zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as an zzso zzso zzso We also compared the predictions of this scoring procedure with the measured binding affinities of a panel of overlapping peptides from zzso B virus surface zzso We concluded that this method may have wide application for the prediction of zzso zzso for both zzso class I and class II zzso
