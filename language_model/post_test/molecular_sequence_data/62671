zzso zinc finger proteins probably constitute the largest individual family of zzso factors in zzso These proteins often carry a potent zzso domain called the zzso Associated Box zzso which is known to effectively repress zzso through interaction with zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel human zzso A zinc finger zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso zzso and a zzso transcript from this gene is expressed in a variety of adult and fetal zzso Two zzso larger transcripts are expressed in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso A domain of zzso is followed by a zzso acid domain, zzso by a separate zzso This domain, which we designate zzso C, was also identified in more than 25 additional human, zzso and rat zzso zinc finger zzso On the basis of results from a previous study, we conclude that this novel zzso domain strengthens the interaction with zzso thereby improving the ability of these zzso zinc finger proteins to recruit zzso to specific zzso
