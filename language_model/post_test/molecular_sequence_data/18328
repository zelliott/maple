Our studies of the zzso availability of zzso factors, coupled with zzso zzso binding zzso that identify cell bearing receptors for these factors, should lead toward defining the zzso roles of these molecules in the zzso The use of the zzso zzso to identify zzso cell lines has also provided new model systems for the examination of zzso zzso as well as for the study of the subsequent induction of zzso response zzso To obtain insights into such zzso zzso we have zzso cloned genes zzso a family of zzso protein zzso most closely related to zzso involved in the zzso response to zzso These zzso may be crucial regulators of early steps in the response of zzso cells to zzso factors as well as other zzso zzso
