zzso zzso of zzso zzso functions as an electron transfer protein in a chain of zzso proteins that enables zzso zzso to grow on zzso It is a zzso protein of zzso zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as several other bacterial zzso zzso contain a zzso extension of zzso zzso acids of unknown function, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed to obtain structural and dynamic information on the protein in zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso zzso zzso was labeled with zzso and zzso using zzso grown zzso zzso as a host for zzso zzso zzso assignments were obtained for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the backbone and the zzso of the protein and the secondary structure was zzso zzso studies were performed to characterize the dynamic properties of the zzso The results indicate that the main part of zzso zzso zzso zzso exists in solution as a zzso zzso zzso with a secondary structure that is very similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso as observed in zzso The zzso extension, however, is zzso and highly zzso The possible origin and function of the extension are zzso
