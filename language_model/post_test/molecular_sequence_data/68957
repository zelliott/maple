Channel zzso L chain zzso was obtained through a zzso strategy and used to isolate multiple L chain clones from zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of full-length zzso indicates that the V region is preceded by a leader zzso and represented by framework and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso contain the zzso zzso and zzso as well as other zzso zzso L chain zzso The sequence similarity of the zzso L chain with higher zzso zzso and zzso however, does not readily allow the zzso L chain to be zzso Eight zzso clones isolated from a zzso library were shown to represent different processed derivatives of sterile L chain zzso These transcripts share a similar upstream sequence region and extend downstream to include a zzso or alternatively a zzso segment in partial zzso zzso that has been spliced into a zzso zzso comparisons indicate that these transcripts represent the product of different L chain zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses with zzso and zzso zzso indicate that there are at least 30 zzso segments and at least 15 zzso zzso The analysis of 17 zzso L chain clones showed that each zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the gene segments in three of these clones indicates a previously zzso pattern of zzso gene zzso Gene segments are found in clusters with zzso zzso and zzso segments in each zzso Within a cluster zzso segments reside upstream of single copies of closely linked zzso and zzso zzso The proximity of zzso segments downstream from zzso segments suggests that individual clusters may be closely zzso The zzso segments are located in opposite zzso polarity relative to the zzso and zzso gene zzso which indicates that zzso segments are likely rearranged to zzso segments by inversion rather than deletion zzso
