The DNA from a zzso zzso of a patient with multiple zzso zzso zzso type 1 was analyzed to detect a point zzso of the zzso alpha gene zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The patient had zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso examination revealed high serum levels of zzso and zzso The tumor was zzso diagnosed as a mixed zzso zzso cell zzso in which zzso and zzso were produced by different zzso zzso analysis of the zzso extracted from zzso sections of zzso zzso and zzso tumors demonstrated the substitution of zzso for zzso in zzso 201 of the zzso alpha gene that resulted in replacement of zzso zzso with zzso zzso only in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso specific point zzso zzso of the zzso alpha gene may be involved in the development of the zzso zzso in this zzso
