Although zzso zzso infected zzso zzso to cancer in the presence of several zzso there is insufficient molecular evidence that poor nutrition has any such zzso Because zzso folate zzso led to the zzso zzso of zzso nuclear zzso E1 zzso and activated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that included interaction with zzso zzso zzso we investigated the functional consequences of folate zzso on zzso in immortalized zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso it also specifically bound another zzso zzso zzso zzso in the early zzso element zzso of zzso zzso with greater zzso Together, these interactions led to a profound reduction of both zzso and zzso zzso and proteins without effects on zzso E6 and zzso in zzso and in cultured zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso developed in zzso low folate zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso contained fewer zzso viral zzso a similar zzso DNA viral load, and a much greater extent of integration of zzso DNA into zzso DNA when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso old zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso mice transformed this benign zzso raft tissue into an aggressive zzso cancer within 12 zzso zzso these studies establish a likely molecular linkage between poor folate nutrition and zzso and predict that nutritional folate and/or zzso zzso which are both common worldwide, will alter the natural history of zzso infections and also warrant serious consideration as zzso zzso in zzso transformation of zzso zzso to zzso
