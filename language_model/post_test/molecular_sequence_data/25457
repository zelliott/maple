zzso is a zzso of a hybrid zzso consisting of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso fused to the hinge region and the second and third zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso G zzso This zzso zzso termed an zzso was produced in an effort to combine the binding specificity of zzso with several potentially desirable properties of zzso molecules zzso et zzso (1989) Nature zzso zzso The structural characteristics of the zzso have been evaluated to demonstrate that zzso has the same features as the zzso region of soluble zzso while retaining those expected for the zzso portion of human zzso Identification of peptides recovered from the zzso map confirmed zzso of the expected structure of zzso The detection of zzso in peptides containing zzso and the retention time shift of this zzso zzso after zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso at this zzso Four pairs of zzso and two zzso zzso bonds were also zzso
