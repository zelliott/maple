Using zzso zzso zzso difference analysis, we have cloned a novel gene from zzso zzso zzso This gene is highly expressed in the zzso zzso and fetal liver of the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates that its zzso contains an zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso Further protein sequence and protein translation analysis shows that it belongs to a family of zzso zzso zzso and its molecular mass is 43 zzso zzso we have named this gene zzso Like other zzso zzso the zzso protein has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in many important cellular zzso In zzso adult mice, zzso is highly expressed in the zzso and in zzso zzso Among nine different zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso expression is zzso only in cell lines related to the zzso zzso Furthermore, its expression is regulated during zzso zzso cell zzso We have investigated its function in the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso was introduced into zzso cells by zzso gene transfer, and several zzso zzso clones were obtained for further zzso zzso and cell surface marker examination of zzso cells reveals that zzso of zzso blocks zzso terminal differentiation of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso by modulating either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso state of another regulatory zzso during zzso cell zzso
