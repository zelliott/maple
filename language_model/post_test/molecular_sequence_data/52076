zzso and zzso properties of ostrich zzso were examined with emphasis on the behavior of zzso a zzso that provides a potential probe of the zzso interface and of zzso zzso between this region and the binding zzso zzso ostrich zzso was found to bind zzso and related peptides with affinities comparable to the zzso zzso but induced a significantly different optical activity in bound peptides than the zzso zzso zzso studies indicated higher zzso zzso for the ostrich zzso than for the bovine zzso zzso with this, zzso was found to be largely zzso as monitored by zzso zzso and lack of zzso towards zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso protein with zzso under zzso conditions, followed by zzso allowed isolation of an active product with an altered interface region as partially evidenced by its zzso properties and consistent with its markedly altered CD zzso zzso of the CD zzso of the modified and native proteins and analysis of pH effects indicated the contribution of zzso to an unusual 237 zzso band in the zzso zzso Small shifts in the 350 zzso CD band of zzso zzso on binding zzso and apparent effects of zzso on the induced optical activity in bound zzso provided evidence of at least weak structural communication between zzso and the binding zzso However, no significant effect of zzso on binding affinity was observed, suggesting that, in the zzso zzso the region around zzso 35 is not a stringent zzso of the zzso behavior of the binding zzso
