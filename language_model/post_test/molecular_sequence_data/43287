zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a rare primary zzso caused by a defective zzso zzso We identified zzso of the zzso zzso gene in 13 unrelated Japanese zzso zzso Of the four patients with zzso zzso one had a zzso within the zzso domain, and the three others had zzso affecting the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso resulted in the substitution of zzso acids that are highly zzso in zzso family zzso Three patients had nonsense zzso all of which resulted in the zzso of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso Three patients had zzso DNA deletions of 2, 3 or 4 zzso zzso All of the deletions were flanked by direct repeat zzso suggesting that these deletions were caused by slipped zzso Three patients had zzso within zzso resulting in altered zzso and multiple zzso products were found in one zzso Thus, each of the 13 Japanese patients had different zzso 9 of them being novel zzso These results indicate that zzso in zzso are highly heterogeneous, although zzso 140 seems to be a hot spot of the zzso zzso gene since two additional point zzso were located at zzso zzso bringing the total numbers of zzso affecting zzso 140 to zzso In one zzso family with a zzso zzso prenatal diagnosis was performed by zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA of a male zzso
