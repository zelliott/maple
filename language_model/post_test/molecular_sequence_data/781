The complete zzso sequence of zzso mosaic virus zzso a member in the family zzso has been determined to be zzso zzso zzso excluding the 3' zzso zzso The zzso encodes a large zzso of zzso zzso acids with the zzso zzso of zzso including a small overlapping zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso has an unusually long zzso zzso region of zzso zzso with 12 translation initiation zzso and three small open reading zzso which resemble those of the internal zzso entry site containing zzso leader sequences of the members of zzso zzso comparison of 10 putative mature proteins of zzso with those of representative members of zzso in the family zzso revealed 33 to zzso zzso acid identity within the highly zzso zzso protein sequence and 15 to zzso zzso acid identity within the least zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a distinct member in the family zzso In contrast, zzso displayed 47 to zzso zzso acid sequence identity with available sequences of mature proteins of zzso streak mosaic virus zzso an zzso member of the zzso zzso analyses of the complete zzso zzso zzso and coat protein sequences of representative species of six zzso and zzso members of the family zzso suggested that zzso and zzso are sister zzso and share a most recent common zzso with zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso should be classified in a new zzso and we propose the zzso zzso in the family zzso with zzso as the type zzso
