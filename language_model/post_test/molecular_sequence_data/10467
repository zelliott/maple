The approximately 25 zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso protein zzso possesses an zzso activity that results in an zzso zzso of full-length zzso protein and zzso attachment of a cholesterol zzso to the newly generated zzso zzso We have identified a 17 zzso zzso of zzso zzso active in the initiation of zzso and report here its crystal zzso The zzso structure comprises two zzso zzso that appear to have arisen from tandem zzso of a primordial zzso zzso in the zzso active site have been identified, and their role in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Aspects of zzso structure, and reaction mechanism are zzso between zzso and the zzso regions of zzso permitting reconstruction of a plausible evolutionary history of zzso and the zzso
