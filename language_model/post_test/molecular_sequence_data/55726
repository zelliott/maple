A microbial expression system for the study of the zzso zzso zzso has been developed as a more useful alternative to the insect zzso expression system we have previously zzso A synthetic zzso precursor zzso gene was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso expression required fusion of the zzso sequence with the zzso zzso zzso region and a zzso host cell defective in the synthesis of zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso form of the inactive zzso precursor is not zzso but accumulates within the zzso zzso Complete conversion of the zzso zzso into active mature zzso could be achieved in zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso system has kinetic characteristics similar to those of the natural zzso An advantage of the zzso expression system over the zzso cell system is that we can perform zzso and screening of zzso zzso very zzso We have set up a zzso screening procedure for the simultaneous characterization of numerous zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells are grown and zzso in zzso plate zzso and the released zzso precursor is then activated to mature zzso This zzso allows easy discrimination between proteins with close to wild type properties and proteins that are not zzso We have applied this zzso to investigate the spectrum of zzso acids which are tolerated at zzso of zzso using two independently derived libraries of zzso at this zzso Many zzso acid zzso at this position are not accepted; only the zzso of zzso restored normal zzso
