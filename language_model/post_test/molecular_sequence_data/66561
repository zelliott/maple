Although the degradation of cellular or zzso proteins comprises the normal function of zzso zzso these zzso were also detected zzso during diseases such as zzso Since zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated to transform native LDL particles into a zzso type, the following study was undertaken to characterize the modification of LDL particles and the degradation of zzso zzso in more zzso LDL was incubated with zzso B, zzso K, zzso zzso and V at pH zzso and under zzso conditions zzso zzso for 2 h to mimic conditions of limited zzso zzso zzso analysis of the degradation products revealed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a fast process carried out by all zzso at pH zzso and by zzso S also at pH zzso zzso microscopic analysis showed that zzso degradation of zzso zzso rendered LDL particles zzso compared to zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso fragments from zzso zzso revealed an abundance of zzso zzso sites located in almost all structurally and functionally essential zzso Since the zzso sites zzso well with results from zzso specificity studies, they might be useful for the development of zzso zzso and zzso
