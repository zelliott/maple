Several learning approaches have been used to predict zzso zzso acids in a protein zzso but there has been little attempt to predict zzso zzso in an zzso zzso One of the reasons is that the differences between zzso in their interaction propensity are much smaller than those between zzso zzso Another reason is that zzso exhibits less diverse sequence patterns than zzso zzso predicting zzso zzso zzso is much harder than predicting zzso zzso zzso We developed a new method that removes data zzso in a training set of sequences based on their zzso The new method zzso a larger and more zzso training set than the standard zzso removal method based on sequence zzso and the constructed zzso is guaranteed to be zzso We zzso the interaction propensity zzso of zzso triplets by applying a new definition of zzso to an extensive zzso of zzso complexes, and developed a support zzso machine zzso model to predict protein binding sites in zzso zzso In a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso model predicted zzso zzso with an accuracy of zzso an zzso of zzso and a Matthews correlation zzso of zzso With an independent zzso of 56 zzso sequences that were not used in training, the resulting accuracy was zzso with an zzso of zzso and a Matthews correlation zzso of zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict zzso zzso zzso in a given zzso sequence from the sequence data zzso The zzso model and zzso are freely available for academics at zzso
