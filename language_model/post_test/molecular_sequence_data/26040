zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene affect eye and bristle development, leading to irregular spacing of zzso and bristle zzso in the adult zzso We have cloned the zzso gene by zzso zzso The zzso zzso unit is 12 zzso and consists of four zzso that are joined in a zzso zzso In an zzso trap screen we have isolated several zzso insertions close to the zzso zzso start zzso We have examined the expression pattern of zzso by in zzso zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso lines, and by zzso with an zzso zzso During zzso zzso is expressed in a dynamic pattern associated with neural zzso During zzso development, zzso is mainly expressed in the zzso zzso precursor cells in the eye zzso disc and in sensory organ precursor cells in other zzso In the wing disc, zzso expression is zzso with the zzso for zzso and is controlled by genes of the zzso zzso Based on its zzso zzso expression pattern, and the predicted structure of its product, a zzso zzso with zzso to the zzso gene family, we propose that zzso encodes a signal involved in lateral zzso within individual zzso of the developing nervous zzso
