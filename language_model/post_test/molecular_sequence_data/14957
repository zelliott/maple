zzso an zzso zzso protein with high zzso to zzso zzso is an essential component for zzso center zzso in organisms ranging from algae and zzso to zzso It plays an important structural role by contributing to the formation of zzso zzso filaments and some zzso zzso Previous work suggests that the zzso domain of zzso especially its first zzso fragment, is required for the zzso of zzso Native zzso gel zzso zzso pull-down zzso zzso resonance light scattering zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso also contributes to the zzso zzso besides its zzso domain in zzso and in zzso On the basis of our results, a zzso mode of zzso which is zzso as well as zzso (between zzso and zzso zzso as well as between zzso and zzso zzso is put forward providing maybe some insights into the molecular mechanism of zzso functions in the zzso
