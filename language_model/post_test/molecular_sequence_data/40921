The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zinc finger zzso which is zzso in a subset of zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso Recent findings indicate that zzso beside its role in zzso development, is also necessary for normal zzso of the embryonic heart, and may even be involved in zzso zzso The original purpose of this study was to decipher potential downstream zzso pathways of zzso for blood vessel zzso We found that the zzso zzso which functions as a zzso factor, zzso the expression of zzso 5 zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso and other vascular zzso zzso those zzso vascular zzso growth factor receptors 1 and 2, and zzso Furthermore, an zzso element was identified in the first zzso of the zzso zzso which bound to the zzso protein and was necessary for reporter gene zzso by zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso proteins could be zzso by double zzso zzso in zzso zzso of embryonic zzso zzso zzso transcripts were reduced in some but not all zzso of zzso mouse zzso These results indicate that zzso can stimulate vascular gene zzso By demonstrating that zzso protein zzso an zzso element in the first zzso we identified zzso as a novel target gene of zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso regulatory functions during vascular development and kidney zzso
