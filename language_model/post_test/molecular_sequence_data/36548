The zzso behavior in solution of two zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso Two zzso cross relaxation zzso zzso is used together with zzso constant data to obtain zzso distance zzso These results are used in conjunction with zzso energy zzso to indicate favorable zzso zzso is found to have a high degree of zzso order which is attributed to zzso restriction associated with the zzso of zzso The lowest energy zzso in zzso with the experimental zzso distances contains a zzso zzso distances indicate that zzso exists as a random zzso or in an extended chain zzso Energy zzso suggest that zzso is primarily an extended chain with internal zzso restricted by the zzso zzso These results may be related to the selectivity of these peptides for different zzso in that the zzso with zzso more stable than zzso are more zzso zzso
