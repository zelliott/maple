The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso gene encodes a mature protein of zzso zzso acids with a 25 zzso signal zzso The zzso acids involved in zzso function, as well as those forming the zzso binding site and those involved in zzso bond formation, are zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso gene has six zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes can be divided into three zzso on the basis of zzso zzso The zzso gene promoter contains putative metal response elements and heat shock elements which may be involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso by zzso the zzso for the zzso and by heat zzso
