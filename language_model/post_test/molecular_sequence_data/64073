The zzso zzso zzso from rat zzso contain many protein species of unknown identity, some of which are likely to play a critical role in the trafficking of zzso zzso we describe an zzso protein in zzso of rat zzso as a potential zzso traffic regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso protein sequence analysis, and zzso zzso have identified this protein as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in rat zzso zzso in rat zzso was mostly zzso and zzso in discrete zzso with enrichment in putative zzso zzso zzso Total cell zzso of zzso exhibited zzso zzso Next, we treated rat zzso with zzso acid zzso a potent zzso zzso and studied its effect on the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso there was a significant reduction (by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to the plasma zzso The zzso flux in zzso zzso was also delayed zzso of zzso by zzso treatment, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment and the zzso of zzso It is suggested that zzso may function as a regulator required for the zzso zzso zzso movement and/or its zzso thus may regulate zzso zzso recruitment in rat zzso
