We have previously reported various zzso effects of zzso oxide on human zzso We describe a novel and potentially important mechanism of zzso oxide zzso direct zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso We have found that zzso oxide treatment of zzso isolated from fresh human zzso enhances the ability of these zzso to zzso zzso and bind zzso In addition, treatment of whole cells with zzso oxide yielded zzso with enhanced zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 1, and zzso was greatly enhanced by zzso zzso In support of the existence of this zzso in whole cells, we found that the G protein zzso zzso blocked zzso B zzso induced by zzso oxide or zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso oxide greatly reduced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso of these zzso Because G proteins play a central role in many diverse signaling systems, zzso by an zzso and zzso zzso may represent a novel signaling zzso
