We have isolated and characterized the human zzso zzso zzso gene and its zzso Using zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso internal zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso searching to identify zzso zzso we determined that the zzso zzso the zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso in 8 zzso which are alternatively spliced to exclude zzso 2, 4, 6, and/or 7; the zzso coding sequence occurs within zzso zzso Analysis of zzso artificial zzso zzso and bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones and of zzso amplified zzso DNA, and zzso searching of human zzso 1 sequence provided from the zzso Centre zzso Cambridge, zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso gene spans at least 285 zzso A promoter zzso containing zzso zzso to zzso zzso to the most zzso zzso start zzso exhibited considerable zzso activity during transient zzso in cultured zzso zzso canine zzso zzso and zzso deletion analysis of promoter function revealed the presence of positive zzso regulatory elements between zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis disclosed three potential zzso binding sites in this zzso five more zzso consensus binding motifs occur between zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso expressing human zzso substantially increased zzso from zzso zzso promoter zzso containing 526 or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso promoter activity was enhanced by long-term serum deprivation of canine zzso zzso a treatment that is known to increase zzso zzso activity in these zzso Together, these data suggest that expression of the human zzso zzso zzso gene is regulated in part by zzso in airway smooth zzso
