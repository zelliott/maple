The North Pacific Coast zzso of North America is a region of high zzso zzso possibly due to its highly fragmented landscape and complex glacial zzso For example, four island and one mainland subspecies of zzso zzso zzso have been described as endemic to southeast Alaska zzso To better understand the role of past zzso change in generating diversity in the region, we examined DNA sequence variation in the zzso zzso b gene of 210 zzso from across North America, with an emphasis on Alaska and British zzso We found three distinct zzso zzso zzso lineages of zzso all of which occur in southeast zzso One lineage includes a southeast Alaska endemic and specimens from Alaska (outside of zzso and zzso A second lineage includes two southeast zzso zzso and zzso from western Canada and the zzso United zzso The close relationships of these zzso zzso to zzso outside of southeast Alaska suggest that they zzso the region from zzso and southern glacial zzso respectively, following zzso of the zzso The third lineage appears restricted to the Prince of Wales Island complex in southeast Alaska zzso zzso and Graham Island zzso zzso British zzso This restricted distribution suggests that these populations may be derived from zzso that persisted in a coastal zzso during the Wisconsin zzso Studies of nuclear genes and zzso zzso evolution are necessary to further explore discrepancies between the geographical pattern of differentiation based on zzso and the existing zzso zzso based on zzso
