zzso is an zzso human gene zzso a heavily zzso membrane protein zzso with zzso to the zzso tumor zzso gene zzso zzso As a first step toward studying the effects of zzso in this gene in a zzso system, the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso zzso has been determined along with the zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed and encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso acids with 93 and zzso identity to the human and zzso fish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso gene is likewise zzso with 12 zzso The location of the zzso zzso on the X zzso is also zzso between the human and the zzso Conservation of the zzso gene between mouse and human gives support to the notion that construction and study of a mouse knockout model may help establish the function of the human zzso zzso a potential tumor zzso zzso
