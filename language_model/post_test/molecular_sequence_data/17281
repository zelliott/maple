zzso contamination in environmental samples can be underestimated because a single cell line might reproduce only some enteric viruses and some enteric viruses do not exhibit apparent zzso effects in cell zzso To overcome this problem, we evaluated a cell zzso zzso based on a combination of zzso and Buffalo green monkey kidney zzso cell lines as a tool to monitor infectious zzso and zzso in river zzso Water samples were collected 10 times at each of four rivers located in zzso Province, South Korea, and then cultured on group 1 cells zzso cells zzso and group 2 cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiplex zzso were performed, followed by zzso analysis of the zzso Thirty zzso of the 40 samples were positive for viruses based on cell culture, and the frequency of positive samples grown on group 2 cells zzso was higher than the frequency of positive samples grown on group 1 cells zzso The number of samples positive for zzso was higher with zzso cells (13 zzso than with zzso cells (one zzso the numbers of samples positive for zzso were similar with both types of zzso By using zzso analysis, zzso zzso were grouped into zzso A, C, D, and zzso and zzso zzso were grouped into zzso B3 and B4 and zzso 6, 7, and 30, indicating that zzso and zzso cells were suitable for recovering a wide range of zzso and zzso zzso The cell zzso zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso cells and molecular identification could be a useful tool for monitoring infectious zzso and zzso in aquatic zzso
