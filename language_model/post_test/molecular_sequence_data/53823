zzso muscles are important target zzso for zzso hormone zzso The present study examines the influence of zzso status on muscle growth and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a commercial strain of the domestic duck zzso zzso Four groups zzso of zzso zzso were rendered either zzso by treatment with zzso (6 zzso 100 zzso body mass or 12 zzso 100 zzso body zzso or zzso by treatment with zzso (6 zzso 100 zzso body zzso in combination with zzso hormones (5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 100 zzso body mass or 10 zzso zzso and zzso 100 zzso body zzso zzso and tissue samples zzso zzso and zzso leg muscle, liver, zzso and cerebral zzso were collected from these four groups, and from a group of zzso controls, at 8 weeks of zzso Development of duckling zzso was retarded in zzso birds compared with that in zzso controls, as evidenced by differences in skeletal dimensions, primary feather zzso and body and muscle zzso Body mass was lower by zzso and relative masses of cardiac and zzso muscles were lower by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso beta 0, zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso were derived from chicken zzso zzso showed that zzso alpha zzso was expressed in all zzso but was not significantly affected by any of the experimental zzso zzso beta 0 zzso expression was significantly lower in the leg muscles of zzso treated with 12 zzso zzso 100 zzso body mass zzso zzso ratio, zzso compared with that in zzso controls zzso but was zzso in the zzso and cardiac zzso zzso of zzso beta 0 zzso was significantly higher in zzso (by zzso zzso zzso cardiac (by zzso zzso and leg (by zzso zzso muscles of zzso treated with zzso hormones compared with those in zzso controls zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso expressed significant levels of zzso beta 2 zzso
