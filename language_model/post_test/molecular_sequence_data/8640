The production of zzso directly from cardiac zzso has not been previously demonstrated and could represent an important mechanism and site of intervention in zzso and zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso are zzso zzso zzso that stimulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as being a major cellular source of zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso cells may also play an important role in producing zzso independently of zzso zzso cultures of adult rat zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were zzso with either zzso 1 zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in adult rat zzso following zzso Our studies indicate that zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and protein in both a zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso release, determined by zzso zzso zzso was biologically active, accounting for approximately zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso activity produced by these zzso These results suggest that cardiac zzso may directly recruit activated zzso into areas of zzso Such a recruiting process could zzso the migration of zzso into areas of zzso stress and play a role in development of zzso injury of zzso
