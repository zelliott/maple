The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular genetic basis of zzso zzso and identify the novel zzso at zzso locus in Chinese Han zzso All seven zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and promoter in the zzso gene of five samples from individuals with zzso discrepancies were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso the zzso products were screened by directly zzso the zzso of zzso 6 and 7 were analyzed by zzso cloning zzso The results showed that five samples were identified as zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were confirmed in one zzso individual and one zzso individual, zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was identified in three zzso zzso The two zzso acid zzso zzso zzso T and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso 7 resulting in two zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso in this novel zzso were observed, when compared with zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso of zzso zzso is found to be relatively variable in Chinese population, and a novel zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso is zzso zzso
