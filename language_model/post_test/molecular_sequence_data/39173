The human major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso is a strong risk factor for zzso to a group of disorders termed zzso zzso that express zzso develop zzso implicating zzso in the zzso of these zzso To determine whether an zzso zzso was associated with zzso in nonhuman zzso we analyzed the zzso class I zzso expressed in a cohort of zzso zzso that developed zzso arthritis after an outbreak of zzso We identified several zzso with only limited sequence similarity to zzso Interestingly, one of these zzso molecules had a B pocket identical to that of zzso zzso sequencing of zzso peptides bound by this zzso demonstrated that, like zzso and zzso it could bind peptides with zzso at the second zzso However, extensive analysis of the zzso class I molecules in this cohort revealed no statistically significant association between any particular zzso class I zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, none of the zzso zzso class I molecules bore a strong resemblance to zzso indicating that zzso arthritis can develop in this animal model in the absence of an zzso zzso Surprisingly, there was a statistically significant association between the zzso zzso zzso A locus zzso zzso and the absence of zzso arthritis following zzso zzso
