The zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were isolated in our laboratory, and are dependent on zzso for normal zzso The zzso in these cells displayed increased zzso in the absence of zzso In the present study, a zzso point zzso in zzso was discovered at zzso zzso to zzso Although zzso binds to zzso in the zzso sequencing of zzso class I did not reveal any zzso The expression of the zzso zzso was demonstrated using high-resolution zzso focusing and two-dimensional gel zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in the zzso cell zzso The region of zzso that encompasses zzso is near the zzso zzso that has been proposed as a site of interaction with zzso protein zzso 4 and zzso a zzso zzso In the zzso cells, the active zzso form of zzso was increased approximately zzso whereas the inactive zzso forms were barely zzso The inactive zzso forms of zzso were increased in the zzso and zzso cell zzso We zzso that these changes in zzso that result in increased zzso instability may be related to the zzso zzso and are compensated for by the stabilizing properties of zzso
