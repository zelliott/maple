Using zzso sequence zzso we cloned a zzso for rat neutral zzso zzso composed of 422 zzso acids that shares zzso and zzso identity with the mouse and human forms zzso The rat zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso at neutral pH in a zzso manner, and required zzso zzso zzso and zzso for its full zzso The cloned rat zzso shares zzso sequences with zzso from both zzso and zzso Introduction of single zzso into either of the zzso zzso at positions 136 and zzso putative active sites, entirely abolished the activity, supporting a common mechanism for the zzso family independent of the zzso However, zzso in zzso zzso zzso only in zzso also abolished the activity, suggesting zzso control of zzso linked to this zzso zzso This zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso zzso factor to yield zzso at a rate that is slightly lower than that with zzso
