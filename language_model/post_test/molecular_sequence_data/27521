A prominent surface loop links the first two beta strands of the zzso domain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso We show here that zzso this loop by two zzso generates a protein that populates two structurally distinct stable zzso an active, zzso zzso zzso and a functionally compromised zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was observed after exposure to temperatures above 50 degrees zzso zzso of two additional zzso from the loop caused the protein to adopt exclusively the zzso zzso zzso zzso structural studies of the zzso zzso reveal that the zzso half of the domain was unfolded and zzso whereas the zzso halves of two zzso had associated to form a structure with zzso symmetry and a zzso mimicking that of the folded zzso The surface loop is therefore a zzso zzso zzso in the folding process that leads to a functional zzso
