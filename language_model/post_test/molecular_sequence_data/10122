zzso B virus zzso zzso I has been shown to consist of several zzso sequences for the zzso gene expression efficiently in certain types of zzso zzso regulation of zzso X gene zzso by zzso I might be one of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis of zzso I function in the zzso zzso gene promoter complex, we characterized a specific zzso regulatory region zzso as a zzso element, zzso zzso of zzso I for the X gene promoter by means of the transient zzso technique using zzso and zzso zzso Based on the analysis of protein factors interacting with the zzso element, zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso or zzso X zzso alpha zzso zzso are probably implicated in the activity of zzso I for the efficient expression of X gene through their interaction with the zzso element in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the isolated zzso element was demonstrated to function alone as a specific zzso element and to be able to activate zzso from the X gene promoter efficiently in the zzso cell in an zzso zzso
