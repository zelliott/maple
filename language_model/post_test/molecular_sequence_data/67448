zzso zzso resistance has been reported in zzso zzso However, the genes responsible for the resistance have not yet been zzso Ninety-nine zzso zzso zzso recovered from zzso and zzso were tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identical for both turkey and chicken zzso whereas zzso was higher in turkey zzso (6 zzso than in chicken zzso (3 zzso zzso of the 99 zzso showed high-level zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso and the genes zzso for this resistance were characterized in zzso zzso zzso strain using primer zzso zzso analysis and percentages of zzso acid identity revealed putative genes zzso for both an ABC zzso and an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso These two mechanisms were shown to be both zzso by the putative zzso zzso under the control of a regulatory zzso zzso zzso pump inhibitor zzso was shown to increase significantly the zzso of strain zzso to zzso zzso and downstream from the zzso cluster was an zzso element, which may play a role in the dissemination of this resistance zzso zzso gel zzso with prior double zzso with zzso zzso followed by zzso analyses revealed that the zzso resistance genes zzso were located on the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this gene cluster is expressed under zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of these genes in all zzso resistant zzso This study reports the discovery of genes zzso for a putative ABC zzso and an zzso zzso zzso associated with high-level zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso from zzso and broiler zzso
