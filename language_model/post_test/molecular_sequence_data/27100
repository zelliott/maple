zzso zzso have been demonstrated to be involved in plant programmed cell death zzso Here, the time scale of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in single living plant cells undergoing zzso induced by ultraviolet C zzso zzso The real-time detection of zzso zzso zzso was achieved by measuring the degree of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso within a zzso zzso containing enhanced zzso fluorescent protein zzso linked by a zzso possessing the zzso zzso zzso zzso to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso zzso observations demonstrated that the zzso fusion protein could be expressed correctly and the zzso from zzso to zzso could be found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At 30 zzso after exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated by the decrease in zzso ratio occurred, taking about 1 h to reach completion in single living zzso zzso in the zzso tag or a zzso inhibitor could prevent the changes in zzso ratio induced by zzso treatment, confirming that the decrease in zzso ratio was due to the zzso of fusion protein as a result of zzso zzso zzso This zzso was further confirmed by in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, showing the occurrence of zzso in zzso protein but not in the protein with a zzso zzso zzso In zzso these results represent direct evidence for the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso technique is a powerful tool for monitoring key events of zzso in living cells in real zzso
