zzso in the radical SAM zzso domain family serve in a wide variety of biological zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pressures and relationships to other cellular constituents impose recognizable zzso on each class of zzso system, shaping patterns in results obtained through various comparative zzso zzso 

An zzso gene cluster found in many zzso and sporadically in zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso protein family that includes zzso from zzso zzso Members occur clustered with a zzso zzso small zzso we designate zzso similar in size to zzso and zzso precursor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the distribution of these markers identifies the zzso zzso but also a second tier of zzso zzso This zzso zzso is filled with up to zzso members per zzso from three zzso zzso that occur, one each, in three unrelated classes of zzso The pattern suggests these zzso zzso require not only zzso but also the novel gene zzso Further study was conducted using zzso a zzso zzso to search these zzso for zzso best correlated across multiple zzso to the presence of zzso For both the short chain zzso zzso and zzso zzso families, aligning zzso zzso sequences to zzso solved crystal structures shows signals centered over zzso sites rather than over zzso or active site zzso Previous studies on some of these proteins have revealed a zzso zzso zzso such that zzso activity in zzso requires an artificial electron zzso such as zzso zzso for the zzso to zzso 

Taken together, these findings suggest that the zzso precursor is modified by the zzso family zzso protein and other zzso in its zzso It becomes an electron carrier zzso that serves in zzso as zzso and other artificial electron zzso do in zzso zzso from three different zzso families show zzso relationships to zzso because they require its zzso This framework suggests a zzso zzso pool in which zzso mediates communication among zzso with zzso zzso
