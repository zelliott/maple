Class I zzso clones of the quail zzso zzso major zzso complex zzso were isolated and zzso Two clusters spanning the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso class I gene regions were defined by overlapping zzso clones and found to contain at least twelve class I zzso However, unlike in the chicken zzso no evidence for the existence of any zzso class II gene was obtained in these two zzso Based on comparative analysis of the zzso sequences with those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso these twelve zzso were assigned to represent one zzso zzso two zzso genes zzso and zzso four zzso genes zzso four zzso genes zzso and one new zzso zzso A class I zzso segment of zzso zzso in which five of these genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are densely packed were zzso by the shotgun zzso All of these five class I genes are very compact in size zzso base pairs zzso zzso and contain no apparent genetic zzso for functional zzso A zzso associated with the zzso processing zzso gene was identified in this class I zzso zzso These results suggest that the quail class I region is physically separated from the class II region and characterized by a large number of the zzso class I zzso (at least zzso in contrast to the chicken zzso where the class I and class II regions are not clearly differentiated and only at most three expressed class I zzso so far have been zzso
