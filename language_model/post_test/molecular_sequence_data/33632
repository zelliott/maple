The potential role of zzso growth factor zzso in the regulation of zzso factors in zzso cells is not widely zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso of a zzso factor, zzso in the expression of zzso zzso Genes associated with zzso induced by zzso were screened by using zzso zzso technology in zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso were further confirmed by real time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the levels of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were measured by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited by the zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso enhanced the binding activity of zzso to the zzso promoter in control cells, but not in the zzso zzso No zzso and zzso zzso binding activities to the zzso promoter were observed in control and zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso activities increased by zzso not in the zzso promoter, but in the zzso zzso zzso might play an important role in the zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso and contribute to zzso zzso which might be promising targets for zzso zzso zzso
