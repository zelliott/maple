Two distinct forms of zzso are expressed by zzso zzso These forms are known as the A band and the B zzso In an attempt to obtain a better understanding of zzso zzso zzso a previously isolated zzso gene known as the zzso gene zzso conversion protein for zzso common zzso zzso was zzso and zzso Previous protein expression data from our laboratory, along with zzso sequence analysis from the present study, suggest that the zzso protein is zzso by the open reading frame zzso zzso acid zzso reveals that this protein may be functioning as a zzso or as a zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso The distribution of this zzso gene among the 20 zzso zzso O zzso clinical zzso and other zzso species was also zzso Southern zzso results revealed that the zzso gene is present and zzso on a zzso zzso zzso among all 20 O zzso with the exception of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso gene is not universally found among all zzso however, zzso profiles are similar to that of zzso zzso when the zzso gene is zzso zzso were designed from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso amplification of a zzso product was found with each of the 20 O zzso Because of the conservation of this zzso zzso may be useful as a diagnostic tool for detecting the presence of zzso zzso as well as other zzso zzso
