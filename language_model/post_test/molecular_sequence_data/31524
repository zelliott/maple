Human zzso zzso such as severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso zzso and Middle East respiratory syndrome zzso zzso cause zzso of severe human respiratory zzso A zzso step of zzso replication is the translation and processing of zzso zzso containing 16 zzso protein zzso zzso 1 to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso processes zzso at 11 zzso sites and is essential for virus zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso activity and their conservation across divergent zzso are unknown, in part due to challenges in zzso many human and zzso zzso To test for conservation of zzso zzso zzso we engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human and bat zzso and zzso Exchange of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso which share the same zzso zzso zzso with zzso allowed for immediate viral recovery with efficient replication albeit with impaired fitness in direct competition with zzso zzso Introduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in clear differences in viability and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso These data indicate tight genetic linkage and zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso background and identify differences in zzso networks regulating zzso zzso Our results also provide evidence that zzso viruses within coronavirus zzso can be used to test zzso zzso of function and zzso in common zzso backgrounds and cell zzso
