Analysis of plant purple acid zzso zzso showed high conservation and different distribution of zzso zzso zzso structures of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso produced in insect cells were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking possibility of zzso at highly zzso sites were generated and expressed in insect zzso A role for zzso in the stability of zzso was indicated by unsuccessful attempts to zzso zzso and zzso zzso generated by replacing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso either zzso or in zzso We showed that zzso belongs to the group of zzso that require occupancy of all highly zzso zzso sites for zzso whereas replacing of the third position of the zzso zzso indicated that zzso may tolerate the absence of some zzso However, the zzso located at the zzso zzso was crucial for zzso of both zzso zzso specific activity of zzso zzso successfully zzso was similar to the zzso zzso zzso
