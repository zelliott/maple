The zzso zzso virus zzso regulatory protein zzso activates zzso zzso gene zzso through formation of a zzso complex on viral promoters that includes the zzso nuclear proteins zzso and zzso The zzso protein is a complex of zzso and zzso zzso derived from a large zzso zzso precursor by zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso region of zzso is sufficient to bind zzso stabilize zzso complex assembly with zzso and DNA, and activate zzso in zzso This zzso interaction region contains six zzso repeats, a zzso repeat motif that is likely to fold as a distinctive zzso zzso The third zzso zzso repeat includes a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso in zzso zzso cells, resulting in a zzso zzso in cell zzso This zzso zzso also prevents direct association between zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso mimics a cellular factor required for cell zzso zzso of the zzso cell proliferation zzso by zzso however, requires both the zzso interaction domain and an adjacent basic region, indicating that zzso zzso multiple regions to promote cell cycle zzso
