zzso of genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso varies between the two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso locus from the classical and El zzso strains has revealed differences in the zzso regions between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso which may be involved in zzso To investigate this possibility, zzso of zzso and the predicted upstream promoters for zzso and zzso has been zzso in the classical and El zzso strains using zzso zzso zzso zzso Together with primer extension zzso these studies indicate that the zzso and zzso promoters are zzso and suggest that zzso may be involved in zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that differences in the level of zzso expression in a classical and an El zzso strain are likely to be due to the effect of sequence variation on the ability of control factors to act on these regulatory zzso
