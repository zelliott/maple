The recent isolation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has expanded the known zzso distribution of zzso zzso beyond the domain zzso To further characterize zzso in the marine environment and explore the potential zzso contribution to this process, we zzso putative zzso genes and zzso in zzso zzso libraries and environmental DNA samples from coastal and open ocean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene copy numbers were low or zzso in stark contrast to zzso zzso genes that were broadly distributed and reached up to 6 zzso zzso copies zzso zzso in the North Pacific zzso zzso a deeply branching zzso group related to a hot spring zzso zzso was at times abundant below the zzso zzso zzso data suggested that the zzso relatives also contain zzso zzso zzso In both coastal and open ocean zzso close relatives of known zzso zzso species were well represented in zzso DNA libraries and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso depth zzso correlated with those of zzso Overall, the data suggest that zzso zzso are more zzso diverse than previously zzso Additionally, zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso species suggest potential zzso interactions between these groups in the ocean's water zzso
