Peanut is an important oil crop worldwide and shows considerable zzso but growth and yield are zzso affected by continuous zzso zzso zzso are efficient zzso of soil quality and plant health and are critical to the zzso of zzso zzso function and to successful plant zzso In this study, zzso zzso gene clone library analyses were employed to study the succession progress of soil zzso zzso under continuous peanut zzso Eight libraries were constructed for peanut over three continuous cropping cycles and its representative growth zzso zzso analyses indicated that soil zzso zzso obtained from the same peanut cropping cycle were similar, regardless of growth zzso Six zzso groups were found and zzso predominated in all zzso The zzso populations showed significant dynamic change and overall diversity increased over time under continuous peanut zzso The abundance and/or diversity of clones affiliated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed an increasing trend with continuous cropping but clones affiliated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased in abundance and/or diversity over zzso The current data, along with data from previous studies, demonstrated that the soil microbial community was affected by continuous zzso in particular, the zzso and beneficial zzso that were positively selected over time, which is commonplace in zzso The trend towards an increase in zzso pathogens and zzso of the beneficial zzso community could be important factors contributing to the decline in peanut growth and yield over many years of continuous zzso
