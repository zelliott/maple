The gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The gene has a deduced coding capacity for a zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso and zzso genes with the deduced sequence of the newly identified gene shows that 79 zzso acid zzso are strictly zzso in all four zzso among these 7 out of 9 zzso are involved in zzso zzso Of three zzso acid regions that have been implicated in zzso binding or zzso two are strictly zzso and the third involved in zzso binding zzso This zzso well with published data showing that zzso competes for the zzso binding site in the zzso zzso We propose that the gene be named zzso
