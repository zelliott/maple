Most zzso tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are now referred to as gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso The tumors differ from ordinary zzso and zzso in several zzso the zzso typically express zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso to 50% of them are zzso zzso positive for zzso muscle zzso and all are negative for zzso and zzso zzso Recently, zzso in the zzso 11 of the zzso gene have been identified and confirmed as a molecular genetic marker for the subset of zzso In this report, we describe a zzso tumor removed from the pelvic cavity of a 52-year-old woman, who is alive without disease 36 months after the zzso The zzso tumor was densely attached to the external aspect of the urinary zzso but was attached to small zzso by only zzso zzso The tumor zzso resembled a zzso and was zzso composed of sheets of zzso cells with a dense zzso zzso The zzso activity was low, less then 1 per 50 zzso zzso zzso the tumor cells were negative for zzso muscle zzso and zzso and positive for zzso and zzso zzso genetic analysis of the zzso 11 of the zzso gene revealed a point zzso in the region commonly zzso in zzso This zzso zzso T for A in the zzso zzso leading to the change of zzso acid sequence zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso This case illustrates that tumors zzso and zzso similar to zzso may present in sites other than the zzso gastrointestinal zzso
