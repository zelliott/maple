Recently deposited egg cordons are a source of zzso zzso that attract the marine zzso zzso into breeding zzso and coordinate male and female zzso behavior within the zzso A potential zzso zzso has been isolated from egg zzso zzso and the zzso partially characterized zzso Painter, zzso zzso zzso Fan, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso Using this information, we have cloned an zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a precursor protein containing a single copy of the full-length zzso and demonstrated that there are abundant levels of zzso zzso transcripts zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This is consistent with the reported function of the zzso zzso packaging the eggs into a zzso for zzso with behavioral studies showing that the zzso zzso is a potential source of zzso and more recent zzso studies in which the full-length zzso has been isolated from the zzso zzso This is the first candidate zzso zzso in zzso and the first in zzso The zzso regulatory system in zzso may provide a model system for examining the structural characteristics of zzso zzso
