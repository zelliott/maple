Upon zzso of zzso zzso in bovine serum, a 38 zzso protein was found to be tightly associated with the outer zzso The intensity of the 40 zzso zzso was reduced under these growth zzso Exposure of zzso zzso grown in zzso and zzso zzso to bovine serum for 1 h did not result in the appearance of the 38 zzso zzso Unlike the 40 zzso zzso however, the zzso mobility of this protein was affected neither by temperature of zzso nor by the presence of zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso of the 38 zzso protein revealed that his protein had zzso zzso to both the mouse and human complement zzso zzso
