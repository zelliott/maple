The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the detection of bovine coronavirus zzso using zzso plasmids as template zzso The zzso zzso detected a minimum of about 2 X zzso viral zzso after exposure for 1 zzso a detection limit similar to zzso zzso after exposure of the films for 60 zzso More than 8 h exposure to blots zzso with these zzso zzso resulted in complete zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso on zzso zzso permitted the detection of 5 X zzso zzso which zzso the capacity of zzso zzso zzso exposure did not increase the background as in case of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and zzso as opposed to zzso zzso However, the specificity of detection with zzso zzso as to random primed zzso was increased zzso About 10 viral zzso after zzso amplification by zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso synthesis was simple, highly zzso and allowed the synthesis of zzso for specific zzso
