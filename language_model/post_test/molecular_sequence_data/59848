zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso comprises two protein zzso zzso and zzso The formation of the zzso is a zzso complex process that involves the zzso association of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso portion of the zzso site is zzso within a group of zzso zzso that zzso similar zzso However, in contrast with zzso zzso in these other zzso the zzso region represented by zzso is present as a zzso zzso We have investigated the effect on the structural and kinetic properties of zzso zzso of linking zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso zzso unexpectedly, that zzso activity was still zzso dependent on protein zzso The zzso for zzso was unchanged from the wild type, whereas zzso was decreased to zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso increased zzso zzso Investigation of the zzso structure of zzso by equilibrium zzso indicated that the protein existed in equilibrium between zzso and zzso zzso Thus linking zzso and zzso together seems to substantially weaken the contacts that are responsible for the zzso of zzso The two zzso of the zzso zzso seem unable to zzso so that active zzso is formed by the zzso association of two zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
