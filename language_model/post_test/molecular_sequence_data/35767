A method, referred to as zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso has been developed to permit selective and specific amplification of zzso sequence from total cellular zzso This technique comprises zzso zzso of zzso with multiple restriction zzso zzso zzso of zzso products to zzso DNA zzso possessing a corresponding restriction site and zzso amplification of zzso restriction fragments containing a short, known sequence (but not all the other zzso zzso by zzso using the specific and cassette zzso the specific primer is designed to prime synthesis from the known sequence of the zzso whereas the cassette primer zzso to one strand of the zzso zzso from the cassette primer provides information to design a new primer for the next walking zzso The amplified zzso fragments are often larger than the maximum DNA fragments zzso zzso that can be zzso without the need of zzso internal sequencing zzso Each of such large zzso fragments is dissected into smaller DNA fragments by repeating zzso zzso zzso exploiting different restriction sites and different sets of cassette zzso This dissection process reduces the number of specific zzso to a zzso thereby increasing the speed of sequencing and minimizing the overall zzso We have successfully applied this zzso walking and sequencing by the zzso zzso zzso to the sequencing of an entire zzso zzso zzso segment of zzso strain zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
