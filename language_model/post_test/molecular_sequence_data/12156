zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 62 zzso zzso was studied in their native strains and zzso zzso coli zzso zzso plasmids were obtained that contained genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso under the control of their own regulatory sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso under the control of the zzso promoter and the zzso leader sequence zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso gene under the control of the regulatory sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in natural strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 62 and zzso zzso coli strains when genes zzso these zzso were under the control of their own regulatory zzso In contrast the zzso of zzso in the natural zzso zzso strain or in zzso zzso coli zzso not affected by zzso Neither did zzso zzso produce any effect on the zzso of zzso when the zzso gene was under the control of the zzso gene promoter zzso The leader sequences and promoters were found to be similar in the zzso and zzso zzso genes and differed considerably from the leader sequence and promoter of the zzso zzso The promoter regions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not of the zzso zzso contained sequences that resembled the zzso box of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso
