zzso of zzso mice zzso with zzso injected type II collagen zzso renders the animals resistant to induction of zzso arthritis zzso In order to clarify zzso zzso responses that zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso zzso response of zzso mice against zzso zzso zzso peptides of zzso and detected the strongest response to alpha zzso zzso zzso A panel of chemically zzso overlapping zzso zzso was used to deduce the minimum structure of this zzso which was found to be zzso zzso A zzso synthetic zzso zzso this region, zzso zzso was found to effectively suppress arthritis when administered as a zzso zzso these data identify the structural component within alpha zzso which is capable of inducing tolerance in zzso zzso A similar approach to the treatment of zzso arthritis, involving the institution of zzso has potential zzso to human zzso zzso
