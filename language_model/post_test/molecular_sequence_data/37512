To obtain very end full-length zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso region zzso and analyze its primary and secondary zzso 

A patient infected zzso zzso zzso was identified by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and restriction zzso length zzso zzso Total zzso isolated from the serum was used as template, and the zzso of the zzso region was amplified using rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The fragments were zzso by zzso clone strategy, and the zzso were confirmed by zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Secondary structures were zzso by zzso 

Very end full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso In five clones zzso three contained full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found as compared to zzso zzso results of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso did not alter secondary zzso Two of 5 clones were deletions of zzso and zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can be used to obtain the full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Genes deleted at the zzso of zzso circulate in zzso C zzso
