zzso primates are extremely valuable animal models for a variety of human zzso However, it is now becoming evident that these models, although widely used, are still zzso The major role that nonhuman zzso species play in AIDS research as well as in the testing of zzso zzso requires the full characterization of structure and function of their zzso zzso zzso is the zzso class mostly involved in protection at zzso zzso By binding to its specific zzso zzso zzso zzso plays additional and poorly understood roles in zzso zzso zzso heavy alpha zzso constant zzso genes were cloned and zzso in four different species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the high degree of zzso zzso present in nonhuman zzso Individual animals were either zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso variable hinge regions were shared by animals of different geographic origins and were present in different combinations in zzso zzso zzso it appears that although highly heterogeneous, hinge sequences are present only in limited numbers in various nonhuman zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated and used to assess its interaction with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to bind its native zzso as well as human zzso and zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso binding and blocking of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that, despite the presence of zzso zzso nonhuman primates appear suitable for studies that involve the zzso zzso
