The role of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso L has been zzso zzso L is the precursor form of a zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in large amounts by zzso transformed cells and cells treated with growth factors or tumor zzso As for other zzso zzso zzso L is predominantly zzso when it is zzso despite the presence of the zzso sorting marker zzso zzso To study the role of zzso in zzso L trafficking, we constructed a zzso in which the zzso for zzso was zzso to zzso zzso When this zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso cells, a completely zzso form of zzso L was zzso The protein appeared to be folded properly, as judged by its ability to be zzso processed to a lower molecular weight form during incubation at pH zzso zzso protein was stable, both as zzso zzso and after processing at pH 4, and it was predominantly zzso instead of being delivered to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso L were zzso by zzso zzso cells with identical zzso These studies therefore confirm that zzso is the normal functional zzso zzso in zzso L and that zzso in zzso zzso L serves predominantly as a zzso targeting zzso with little or no role in protein folding or zzso Furthermore, there does not appear to be a major zzso zzso route of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In experiments with a second zzso the zzso signal at zzso which normally is not zzso was capable of serving as a zzso zzso suggesting that there is normally a structural impediment to zzso at zzso in zzso zzso
