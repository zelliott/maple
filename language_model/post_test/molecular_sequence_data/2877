The zzso zzso zzso detected a 40 zzso protein in Western zzso zzso zzso screening of an expression library of human zzso cells with zzso led to the isolation of overlapping zzso zzso One of these, zzso was zzso zzso long and of about the same size as its corresponding zzso Preceded by an in phase stop zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso was present in zzso and a zzso product of only 33 zzso could be zzso zzso and zzso analysis established the relationship between the 40 zzso zzso and the isolated coding sequences and resolved the apparent zzso between the calculated molecular weight and the observed zzso zzso zzso sequence comparison of zzso to the zzso database revealed that zzso was nearly identical to a sequence claimed to zzso a zzso binding zzso Southern zzso and zzso sequence analysis indicated the presence of multiple copies of the gene in the human zzso At least five of these appeared to represent processed zzso
