An zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso that may be involved in function is characterized using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso Competition studies with zzso zzso determined that zzso 3, 4, and 5 of zzso were required for binding to the zzso These zzso are predicted to participate in an zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso of zzso Conservative zzso zzso that maintain the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso retained the ability to block zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso with zzso that disrupted the zzso of the zzso lost their ability to block zzso The zzso at position 14 was required as its removal in zzso zzso caused the loss of blocking zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso involves zzso zzso spanning 12 zzso and it appears that zzso 3, 4, 5, and 14 are an important part of the zzso Based on these characteristics and the observation that most continuous zzso are reported to involve shorter regions of up to 8 zzso this zzso may be described as a linear zzso zzso that may require the zzso zzso The data presented here provide further insight to the structure of a site that is involved in zzso zzso
