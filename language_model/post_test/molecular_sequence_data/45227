The zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso regulator zzso from zzso zzso activates zzso in response to zzso oxide zzso The mechanism of NO sensing has not been zzso for zzso or for any of its zzso from the zzso family of zzso zzso Using regulated expression of the zzso gene in zzso coli, evidence has now been obtained to indicate that zzso of zzso by NO does not require de zzso synthesis of the zzso zzso In zzso cultures, zzso is zzso slowly following removal of the source of zzso In contrast, exposure of zzso grown cultures to oxygen causes rapid zzso of zzso suggesting that the protein is zzso directly by zzso By random and zzso zzso two zzso of zzso were isolated (with zzso of zzso at position zzso that show high levels of activity in zzso cultures in the absence of zzso These proteins remain substantially inactive in zzso cultures, suggesting that the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso mechanisms, thus providing further evidence that zzso senses both zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso is close to the zzso that forms the zzso interface in other members of the zzso family and plays an important role in zzso the zzso signal between the regulatory and DNA binding zzso zzso of zzso activity in a zzso zzso of zzso coli provided preliminary evidence to indicate that zzso activity is zzso zzso
