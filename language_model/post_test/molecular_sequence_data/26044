zzso is a tobacco zzso protein that binds to the zzso zzso zzso element of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso We have produced zzso in zzso coli, zzso it from bacterial zzso and examined its effect on zzso in a human in zzso zzso zzso of zzso stimulates zzso by up to 20 times, and the stimulation is dependent on the presence of the zzso element in the zzso When zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso M zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso activates zzso by increasing the number of active zzso zzso After formation of the zzso complexes in the presence of zzso zzso containing zzso sites do not significantly affect the zzso level of zzso This result indicates that a complex remains committed to the promoter site after initiation and that this complex is used repeatedly during several initiation zzso Our study demonstrates for the first time that a plant factor can activate zzso in a human in zzso system and that the zzso mechanism of the plant factor is similar to that of zzso zzso
