zzso zzso transfer protein zzso is involved in the transfer of zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso to newly zzso zzso zzso zzso It is therefore essential for zzso synthesis and zzso in the liver and the small zzso Although several recent experiments have revealed the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso little has been revealed to date about zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso We here report that the human zzso gene promoter contains a pair of functional responsive elements for zzso and zzso the latter of which is another target gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso provide evidence that zzso zzso and zzso can bind these elements in zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso of either a dominant negative form of zzso or small interfering zzso zzso against zzso dramatically reduces the activities of both the wild type and the zzso site zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso regulates zzso gene expression either directly or indirectly through elevated zzso zzso When zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso acid zzso a zzso for the zzso X zzso zzso zzso levels for zzso and zzso B were reduced because of increased expression of the factor small zzso partner zzso which factor suppresses zzso zzso zzso acid, but not a synthetic zzso zzso attenuated expression of zzso bringing about a further suppression of zzso gene zzso Over time the zzso zzso protein levels and zzso B zzso in the culture medium significantly zzso These results indicate that two nuclear zzso zzso and zzso are closely involved in zzso gene zzso and the results provide evidence for a novel interaction between zzso acids and zzso zzso
