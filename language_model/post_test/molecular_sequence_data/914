To examine the relationship between structure and function of zzso zzso in fish, we undertook molecular cloning and zzso of zzso expression by zzso and zzso on diets with different zzso composition in the liver of the carnivorous fish, zzso zzso A zzso zzso the full-length zzso zzso zzso from the liver of zzso zzso was zzso This zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso with low zzso to the zzso zzso although it contains most of the key zzso required for zzso Based on zzso and membrane structure zzso we propose a model containing zzso regions for zzso zzso zzso Northern blots showed that zzso after a prolonged zzso rapidly reverses the zzso zzso cycle flux in the fish liver through decreased zzso expression and strong zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso different diets on zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso metabolism of fish fed diets with low zzso zzso diets is zzso towards zzso of dietary zzso by means of zzso of zzso zzso levels rather than zzso zzso These findings challenge the role attributed to zzso of zzso or zzso expression in the low ability of carnivorous fish to zzso zzso
