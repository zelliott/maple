zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is highly zzso in zzso tuberculosis zzso It zzso an overall reaction involving the transfer of the zzso group of zzso to zzso to yield zzso and zzso We have cloned and characterized the zzso from zzso zzso We report here the crystal structures of the zzso the first from any source, in the zzso form, external zzso with zzso with bound zzso and with its zzso zzso zzso In addition to interaction details in the active site, the structures reveal a zzso zzso through which the zzso changes zzso zzso The unique zzso zzso is recognized specifically when zzso maintains a zzso with zzso On the other hand, the binding of the common zzso zzso zzso and zzso is enabled when zzso switches away and zzso zzso The structures reported here, sequence conservation and earlier zzso studies suggest that the zzso zzso is an elegant solution devised by a zzso of fold type I zzso for recognition of structurally diverse zzso in the same binding site and provides for reaction zzso
