zzso the zzso structural protein of the zzso zzso has been considered to be composed of two zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso Of these two, alpha zzso has been previously shown to be an zzso protein while alpha zzso has been considered to be a zzso zzso Using an zzso directed against an zzso zzso of zzso we have detected a zzso protein in various rat zzso including the brain, liver, zzso zzso skin, and small zzso and in a number of established zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and Southern zzso analysis indicated the presence of alpha zzso zzso sequences in different zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest levels of alpha zzso protein and zzso The identity of alpha zzso sequences in the zzso was established by cloning and sequencing a zzso chain zzso region of alpha zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso and eye revealed almost zzso identity at the zzso zzso Interestingly, alpha zzso and alpha zzso seem to exist in an inverse quantitative relationship in the zzso and the heart, the two zzso zzso where they show highest zzso zzso The known zzso evolution of alpha zzso and the definitive demonstration of the zzso expression of this zzso suggest important zzso functions for this zzso
