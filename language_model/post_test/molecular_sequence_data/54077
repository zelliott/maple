DNA zzso have the ability to analyze the expression of thousands of the same set of genes under at least two different experimental zzso However, DNA zzso require substantial amounts of zzso to generate the zzso especially when bacterial zzso is used for zzso zzso zzso of bacterial total zzso contains approximately 2 zzso of zzso We have developed a computer-based zzso for prediction of the minimal number of zzso to specifically zzso to all genes in a given zzso The zzso zzso for example, that 37 zzso should prime all genes in the zzso tuberculosis zzso We tested the usefulness of the zzso zzso zzso in comparison to random zzso for gene expression profiling using DNA zzso Both types of zzso were used to generate zzso zzso and to zzso to an array of 960 zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso the zzso zzso were more sensitive and more specific, especially when zzso zzso samples were spiked with zzso zzso The zzso were used for gene expression profiling of zzso cultures grown to early log or stationary growth zzso This approach could be useful for accurate zzso expression analysis, especially for in zzso gene expression zzso as well as directed amplification of zzso zzso
