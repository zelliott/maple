The expression of zzso zzso zzso defines a discrete region in the zzso neural plate that will give rise to the zzso as well as zzso of the zzso and retinal zzso Here, we report on the identification and cloning of a second zzso gene in zzso termed zzso zzso sequence comparison suggests that zzso and zzso are derived from the zzso of a single putative ancestral gene that is zzso in other zzso as a single copy zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses indicate that the zzso genes belong to a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso Finally, quantitative reverse zzso and whole mount in zzso zzso experiments revealed a pattern of partial zzso expression divergence between the zzso zzso that zzso with sequence divergence in zzso regulatory zzso Our data support a zzso model that may explain the retention of duplicate zzso genes in zzso
