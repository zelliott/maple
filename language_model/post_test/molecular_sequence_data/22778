The zzso coupled receptors zzso recognize a large variety of zzso molecules (such as hormones, zzso growth and zzso zzso and several sensory messages (such as light, zzso and zzso zzso and their signal zzso zzso represent important specific targets for a variety of human zzso To investigate the potential roles of zzso in human normal prostate and prostate zzso we identified and characterized a novel human zzso coupled zzso zzso which is highly zzso in human prostate zzso Although zzso shares sequence zzso with human zzso zzso coupled zzso the expression of zzso is highly restricted to human prostate zzso and no expression was detected in 22 normal and 10 tumor zzso examined using Northern zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we investigated the expression levels of zzso in 133 human prostate samples with real-time quantitative reverse zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso expression increased significantly in human high grade prostate zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso zzso zzso as compared to normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso may play an important role in human prostate cancer development and zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso is a novel prostate specific zzso coupled zzso and may be useful as a tissue marker and molecular target for the early detection and treatment of human prostate zzso
