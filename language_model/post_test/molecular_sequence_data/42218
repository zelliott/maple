The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a complex pattern of zzso expression in which differential zzso regulation of zzso activity, protein levels and zzso levels is zzso This pattern of expression implies that zzso regulation occurs at multiple levels, probably involving both zzso and zzso zzso zzso control of zzso activity, in effect, actually regulates the protein from a zzso zzso In this report we have examined several zzso of this zzso We show that addition of zzso zzso to cells in suspension culture caused changes in zzso zzso activity and zzso levels that are identical to those observed during normal development, suggesting that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso could regulate zzso zzso expression at zzso as low as zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso appeared to occur through a mechanism that required zzso zzso zzso We identified regions of the promoter necessary for zzso expression by using zzso promoter deletions to drive the expression of a zzso reporter zzso zzso of these experiments suggested that zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso levels were the result of zzso in zzso The promoter analysis also suggested that a zzso specific element is located between zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso zzso necessary for zzso zzso and zzso expression appear to be located between zzso and zzso zzso from the cap zzso zzso elements located between zzso and zzso appear to be required for a zzso level of late zzso zzso
