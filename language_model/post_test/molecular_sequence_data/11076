zzso II has been zzso from crude pig liver zzso by a convenient procedure involving zzso Con zzso and affinity zzso on zzso zzso binding of zzso II to the affinity zzso required its prior separation from zzso I, which was accomplished by fractional Con zzso zzso The three-step procedure zzso with approximately zzso zzso recovery, a zzso zzso enriched zzso II, consisting of two proteins zzso zzso and 112 zzso Both zzso are zzso with probably one zzso chain, in line with their binding to Con zzso zzso zzso and other experimental data indicate that the 107 zzso zzso is derived from the 112 zzso species by partial zzso The occasional presence of a 60 zzso zzso zzso with the zzso activity suggests that zzso II may be associated with other protein zzso in a zzso membrane zzso zzso II zzso the zzso linkages in zzso as well as synthetic zzso efficiently but does not remove the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso has a pH optimum close to zzso and is not metal zzso zzso activity is strongly inhibited by basic sugar zzso including zzso zzso zzso Ki approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso Ki approximately 32 zzso and zzso zzso Ki approximately 40 zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso group in zzso by a zzso group reduces the zzso potential zzso We conclude from these observations that the two zzso groups are essential for zzso binding due to their ability to interfere as hydrogen bond zzso A zzso zzso raised against the 107 zzso zzso reacted specifically with two proteins from different cell types on Western zzso Their molecular masses were identical with those from pig liver zzso pointing to a highly zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso in molecular mass for zzso II reported for the zzso from other zzso and species may be due to partial zzso
