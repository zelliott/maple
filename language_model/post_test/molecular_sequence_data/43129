zzso zzso coronavirus zzso is an zzso coronavirus isolated for the first time in zzso zzso zzso respiratory zzso zzso have been derived from zzso The genetic relationship among six European zzso and five zzso of the zzso zzso cluster has been determined based on their zzso zzso The S proteins of six European zzso have an identical deletion of 224 zzso acids starting at position zzso The deleted area includes the zzso sites C and B of zzso S zzso Interestingly, two viruses zzso and zzso with respiratory zzso have the S protein with a similar size to the enteric zzso zzso and zzso viruses have 2 and 15 specific zzso acid differences with the enteric zzso zzso Four of the zzso changed are located within the deletion present in the zzso and may influence the enteric zzso of zzso in zzso A zzso binding site zzso used by the virus to zzso ST and other cell types might be located between sites A and D of the S zzso since zzso zzso zzso specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST zzso An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory zzso has been zzso According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent zzso which was circulating around zzso From this, secondary lineages originated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso in this zzso zzso squares zzso of the origin of zzso zzso showed a significant constancy in the zzso fixation zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
