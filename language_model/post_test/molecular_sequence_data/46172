A zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the regulation of zzso responses as well as in zzso zzso zzso harboring insertions into the zzso gene were screened for their ability to form zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease in the number of cells attached to the polystyrene surface was observed in zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability to form mature zzso was restored to zzso levels, providing functional copies of the zzso zzso gene to the zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that several basic zzso activities and a few zzso binding proteins of zzso zzso cells differed compared to those of zzso zzso These results are interpreted as evidence of a strong integration between zzso and zzso pathways in the process of zzso development by zzso zzso zzso
