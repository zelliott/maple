zzso is a satellite zzso associated with some zzso zzso and encodes a single gene zzso which is highly zzso in position and size among zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of Tomato yellow leaf zzso China virus zzso zzso upstream of the translation start site of zzso gene was tested for its promoter activity with zzso as a reporter zzso Analysis of zzso zzso activity following transient expression zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso had promoter activity and that zzso of 399 or 173 zzso of the zzso resulted in complete loss of its promoter zzso The zzso of zzso or 556 zzso of the fragment, however, did not affect its zzso zzso zzso revealed that this zzso can be used to express zzso gene specifically in zzso tissue of zzso transformed tobacco zzso Further studies have indicated that a 173 zzso segment from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was responsible for basic promoter activity and zzso zzso
