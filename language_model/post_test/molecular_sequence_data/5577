The zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 is required for productive replication in peripheral blood zzso Previous reports suggest that zzso viruses are limited in replication because of a zzso in the late steps of the virus life zzso One of the remaining questions is to determine whether the functional role of zzso involves a specific interaction with virus core zzso In this study, we demonstrate a direct interaction between zzso and the zzso precursor in zzso as well as in infected zzso No interaction is observed between zzso and the mature zzso zzso The zzso interaction is detected zzso in the zzso zzso system, with in zzso proteins demonstrating a critical role of the NC zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso with proteins expressed in infected zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 22 zzso acids of zzso zzso its interaction with the zzso zzso Furthermore, point zzso in the zzso domain of zzso which have been previously shown to abolish virus zzso and binding to cell zzso dramatically decrease the zzso zzso These results suggest that the interaction between zzso and the zzso precursor is a critical zzso of zzso zzso
