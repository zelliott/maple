In addition to its role as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to have a role in cellular processes including zzso and gene zzso zzso have been proposed to be modified by zzso in a zzso manner, providing a zzso by which zzso acts as a regulatory zzso for gene zzso However, there is uncertainty whether zzso attachment to zzso in zzso can be zzso to zzso as a native zzso zzso We critically examined a number of methods used to detect zzso attachment on zzso including zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso and mass zzso of affinity zzso zzso fragments with the objective of determining if the in zzso occurrence of zzso zzso could be zzso zzso We found for each of these methods that, while zzso could be readily detected on native zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso attachment on native zzso could not be detected in cell cultures from various zzso We conclude that zzso is absent in native zzso to a sensitivity of at least one part per zzso suggesting that the regulatory impact of zzso on gene expression must be through alternate zzso
