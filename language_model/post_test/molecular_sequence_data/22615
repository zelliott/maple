zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso possesses two zzso structural zzso zzso and zzso for zzso the component protein of zzso zzso zzso phase variation occurs by alternative expression of these two zzso This is controlled by the inversion of a DNA segment, called the H segment, containing the zzso zzso H inversion occurs by zzso zzso between zzso zzso sequences zzso the H zzso This zzso has been shown in zzso and in zzso to be zzso by a DNA zzso zzso whose gene is located within the H zzso However, a search of the complete zzso sequence revealed that zzso possesses another DNA zzso gene that is located adjacent to another zzso DNA segment within a resident zzso zzso Here, we named this gene zzso We constructed zzso and fin disruption zzso from zzso and examined their phase variation zzso The zzso disruption zzso could still undergo zzso phase variation, indicating that zzso is not the sole DNA zzso responsible for phase zzso Although the fin disruption zzso could undergo phase variation, fin zzso double zzso could zzso These results clearly indicate that both zzso and zzso contribute to zzso phase variation in zzso We further showed that a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to possess a naturally occurring zzso zzso lacks zzso which ensures the phase stability in this zzso
