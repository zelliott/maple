Nuclear factor zzso B proteins regulate the zzso of numerous genes involved in the immune response, zzso control, and viral zzso To examine the effect of zzso expression of zzso B proteins on zzso activity and gene zzso individual zzso B zzso genes were introduced into zzso zzso cells via zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso B1 zzso zzso B2 zzso and zzso increased the zzso level of nuclear zzso B DNA binding in zzso zzso cells, whereas expression of delta zzso zzso zzso and zzso B2 zzso zzso did not affect zzso level zzso zzso necrosis zzso treatment of the zzso zzso cells zzso the induced level of zzso activity, reflecting interaction between zzso zzso and zzso human zzso B zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso B1 zzso zzso B2 zzso and zzso B2 zzso zzso increased I zzso B alpha protein levels from 3- to zzso indicating that one mechanism to compensate for the increased expression of zzso B zzso was to increase the synthesis and/or stability of the regulatory I zzso B alpha zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso B2 zzso and zzso B2 zzso altered the induction zzso of zzso zzso after zzso virus infection, whereas zzso of zzso B1 zzso dramatically decreased zzso zzso zzso
