zzso bacteria zzso are a zzso diverse group which uses zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso for navigation in their aquatic zzso Although synthesis of these zzso zzso is of broad interdisciplinary interest, its genetic analysis has been restricted to a few closely related members of the zzso in which essential functions required for zzso formation are zzso within a large zzso zzso zzso However, because of the lack of cultivated representatives from other zzso it is unknown whether the evolutionary origin of zzso is zzso and it has been questioned whether zzso mechanisms and structures are present in unrelated zzso Here, we present the analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the deep branching zzso zzso by combining zzso and whole zzso amplification zzso with zzso zzso sequences obtained by zzso of cells, which were zzso collected and individually sorted from zzso samples, were used for zzso screening of zzso zzso This led to the identification of a zzso cluster containing several putative zzso genes with zzso to those in zzso A variety of advanced electron microscopic imaging tools revealed a complex cell envelope and an intricate zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso filaments suggests a similar mechanism of zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso as in zzso Altogether, our findings suggest a zzso origin of zzso and relevant genes were likely transferred zzso between zzso and representatives of the zzso zzso
