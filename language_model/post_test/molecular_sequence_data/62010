zzso zzso protein zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso manner, particularly in developing brain, and likely to contribute to zzso zzso zzso and zzso To understand the preferential expression of zzso in zzso zzso we have analyzed the putative core promoter region upstream of the first zzso of the human zzso zzso The core promoter region is zzso but contains several potential zzso zzso motifs such as a zzso all of which are well zzso between human and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis using zzso cells revealed that a zzso responsive element zzso motif zzso was zzso recognized by zzso and enhanced the core promoter zzso However, the core promoter activity was still potent even in zzso cells which barely express zzso Our results suggest that, for the selective expression of zzso zzso zzso negative regulatory zzso which locate outside of the core promoter region repress the potent basic promoter zzso
