zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso are closely related zzso and the zzso zzso specificity of each zzso is crucial for keeping the two signaling pathways zzso but the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso selectivity is zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding domain zzso is highly selective for zzso zzso and we have solved crystal structures of zzso with and without bound zzso These structures, combined with a comprehensive zzso analysis, allowed us to identify zzso and zzso as key zzso that mediate zzso zzso In addition, by comparing the zzso bound and zzso structures, we observed large zzso changes in the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso which were stabilized by recruitment of zzso as zzso zzso for zzso The observed zzso of the zzso zzso provide a mechanical insight into release of the zzso domain and zzso zzso
