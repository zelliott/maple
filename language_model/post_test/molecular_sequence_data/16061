zzso protein zzso from zzso coli binds to and protects from zzso zzso a substantial portion of zzso zzso of zzso zzso In particular, zzso derived from the sequence zzso were isolated and shown to zzso specifically to protein zzso in zzso Other zzso zzso also derived from domain IV zzso from zzso zzso did not zzso to protein zzso in zzso nor did others derived from domain zzso Given that protein zzso is widely believed to be located in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that domain IV of zzso zzso is also present in that active site of the zzso zzso
