zzso zzso produces a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso which have potent zzso zzso A zzso zzso strategy termed gene cluster displacement was used to construct zzso deletion strains with defined zzso and to clone the corresponding complementary DNA zzso functions for zzso zzso zzso Thirty-five unique deletions of zzso to zzso 100 zzso over a continuous zzso region were introduced into zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso strains defined the extent and ends of the zzso zzso gene zzso identified a regulatory region, and mapped several zzso zzso A zzso region in the central portion determines the synthesis of the zzso zzso A zzso region at one end of the cluster is responsible for synthesis and attachment of zzso zzso A zzso region at the other end has functions for positive regulation and zzso O zzso Physical analysis of the deletions and of in zzso fragments refined a zzso physical map of the zzso gene cluster zzso
