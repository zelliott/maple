zzso play crucial roles in regulating many aspects of plant zzso Although much has been learned about the effects of individual hormones, zzso between and integration of different hormonal signals are still not well zzso We present a study of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a putative zinc finger protein from zzso and suggest that it may be involved in zzso signals from multiple zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso among seed plants, each characterized by a very short sequence containing a central putative zinc finger zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused dramatic zzso zzso including zzso reduced zzso dominance, extreme zzso zzso leaves, altered flower zzso poor zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced root growth, and zzso root hairs on zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso in the dark, with root growth similar to that in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were demonstrated to be zzso to zzso zzso for cell zzso hypersensitive to the zzso synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but normally responsive to zzso The zzso zzso could not be rescued by the hormones zzso zzso with these zzso zzso expression profiling revealed that zzso zzso exhibited decreased expression of genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso signaling as well as cell zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso We propose that zzso or the zzso with which zzso zzso is involved in zzso the control of plant development by multiple zzso
