zzso of zzso efficiency at the zzso zzso site plays an essential role in gene expression at the zzso zzso zzso At this zzso site the consensus zzso zzso sequence is embedded in an extended zzso region and there are two downstream zzso regions which are zzso zzso As these sequences are involved in formation of the zzso zzso complex, we examined their function in zzso and in zzso zzso We show that the upstream zzso region can function in the absence of the consensus zzso sequence both in zzso and in zzso and that both zzso regions are necessary for full zzso activity in zzso and for formation of zzso complexes in zzso zzso zzso comparisons reveal that: zzso the dual structure is distinct for the zzso zzso zzso site compared with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of an zzso region close to the consensus zzso is zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that the dual structure of the zzso zzso zzso site provides a flexibility to accommodate changes in zzso complex components during regulation of zzso zzso
