Human zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso within the family zzso zzso Other members of this zzso respiratory zzso virus and avian zzso can be divided into zzso on the basis of genetic or zzso differences or zzso For zzso the existence of different genetic lineages has been described on the basis of variation in a limited set of available zzso We address the zzso relationship between genetic lineages in virus zzso zzso In addition, we analyzed the genetic diversity of zzso by zzso analysis of sequences obtained for part of the fusion protein zzso zzso 84) and the complete attachment protein open reading frames zzso zzso zzso On the basis of sequence diversity between attachment protein genes and the differences in virus zzso zzso two zzso zzso were zzso Each zzso could be divided into two genetic zzso but these did not reflect major zzso zzso
