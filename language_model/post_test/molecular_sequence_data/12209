zzso zzso is a zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso and protein zzso C zzso is traditionally believed to play a central role in zzso of this oxygen zzso In the present study, we have shown that the zzso activity in zzso is affected by zzso After only 2 minutes exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly increased in the zzso fraction of the zzso This increase was zzso but toward the end of the zzso period of 2 zzso the zzso zzso activity increased again to about zzso of zzso In the zzso zzso a small and hardly zzso decrease in zzso activity was zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso factor zzso another zzso zzso agent, showed no significant effects on the zzso zzso When the cells were zzso with the bacterial zzso zzso after a zzso period with zzso or zzso for 2 zzso no significant difference between treated and control cells could be zzso zzso oxygen zzso measured by flow zzso as an zzso of the fluorescent compound zzso was in these experiments significantly primed by zzso both at baseline and when zzso with zzso The protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso blocked the zzso responses to some extent, but not zzso However, no significant difference between zzso responses in control and zzso cells could be detected after administration of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
