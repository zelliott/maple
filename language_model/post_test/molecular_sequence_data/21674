In our laboratory, we have been studying the reductive processes that occur during zzso laser zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have finished an analysis of the zzso zzso effect on the zzso group in zzso zzso However, deep understanding of zzso bond zzso during a mass zzso zzso experiment is much more important in zzso as its reduction can cause serious errors in protein zzso zzso zzso we have focused on zzso and zzso zzso bonds as well as zzso bonds connecting zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso in model peptides during zzso zzso zzso While the reduction was not observed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso bonds, the zzso connection between zzso and zzso was always zzso It was proved that zzso and zzso zzso can act as a zzso zzso The results obtained enabled us to propose a reaction mechanism model which is able to describe the phenomena observed during the zzso process of zzso zzso
