zzso a protein zzso by the zzso zzso was shown to be present in almost all zzso zzso zzso were reported, some zzso samples were shown to be zzso positive and in a number of zzso samples no zzso zzso could be zzso In some of them lack of the zzso gene was the cause of the absence of zzso but in others the zzso gene was present without resulting in a zzso gene zzso Many of these zzso were studied in detail in previous international zzso One of them was zzso from our zzso She is a zzso zzso individual of zzso origin with a clearly zzso zzso zzso when typed by molecular zzso To unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for the zzso in zzso zzso and DNA zzso the defective zzso zzso were zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso 2 showed no differences from the sequence of zzso However, when zzso 3 was examined a difference in length was noticed due to a deletion of 19 zzso between zzso 161 and zzso The deletion caused a zzso and a premature zzso resulting in a zzso zzso The same zzso could be demonstrated in 6 other unrelated individuals of zzso origin as well as in 5 individuals from South zzso The absence of the zzso protein was explained by the presence of an zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso The zzso has been officially named zzso This is the first description of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
