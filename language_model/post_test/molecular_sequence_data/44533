To zzso the role of zzso inhibitor zzso in human zzso zzso cell zzso we examined its expression zzso using surgically zzso zzso from 25 patients, and have analyzed the relationship with zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso frequency of zzso (in zzso DNA zzso end zzso and degree of zzso zzso expression was observed in 11 cases zzso with a percentage of positive cells ranging between zzso and zzso Of the 25 cases, 4 cases showed zzso zzso of positive zzso As for the relationship with zzso zzso all 7 zzso positive cases were negative for zzso zzso whereas 11 out of 18 zzso negative cases showed positive for zzso zzso As for the relationship with degree of zzso zzso 6 out of 8 well differentiated type cases showed positive for zzso zzso By contrast, all 8 cases of poorly differentiated type were negative for zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was significantly higher in zzso positive cases than negative cases although zzso zzso index was almost the same regardless of the expression of zzso zzso expressing cells were distributed mainly in the middle layers of the invading zzso especially around the zzso which was almost similar to the distribution of zzso zzso Our results suggest that expression of zzso in human zzso zzso cell zzso is induced by a zzso zzso and affects zzso and differentiation of zzso zzso
