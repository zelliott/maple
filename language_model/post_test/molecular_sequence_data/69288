In the anterior segment of the zzso eye, the zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso humor, a fluid that zzso and protects the avascular zzso from zzso zzso This report details the results of a study of molecular zzso sequencing, and expression of plasma zzso zzso zzso from the bovine zzso zzso zzso The bovine zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of 226 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The corresponding zzso acid sequence showed an overall identity of zzso with the human zzso zzso with the rat zzso and zzso with the cellular bovine zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso zzso were analyzed and the zzso zzso was found to express the highest levels of zzso transcripts in human and bovine eyes, whereas the cornea of calf eyes expressed the highest levels of zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso on which zzso have profound effects leading to cataract formation, expressed the lowest levels of zzso and zzso transcripts in human donor zzso These results provide new evidence of differential gene expression of the zzso and zzso forms in the zzso eye and stresses the functional role of the zzso zzso zzso in protecting the anterior segment of the eye from zzso zzso
