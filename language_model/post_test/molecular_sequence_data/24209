zzso activity of zzso zzso genes zzso in zzso hybrids is known as zzso dominance zzso To see if difference in zzso zzso zzso zzso might be correlated with zzso we have used artificial zzso zzso and zzso zzso Combining zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of the level of the zzso precursor by real-time zzso we demonstrated that an expression hierarchy exists: In leaves, roots, and petals of the respective zzso zzso of S zzso zzso dominates over zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso dominates over that of the wild species zzso zzso zzso Also in a zzso addition line carrying only one zzso zzso of tomato in a potato background the dominance effect was zzso These results demonstrate that there is possible correlation between zzso dominance and number of conservative elements downstream of the zzso start in the zzso zzso In zzso and callus zzso zzso zzso was slightly zzso zzso zzso or strongly zzso zzso zzso expressed indicating zzso zzso of zzso In leaves and zzso repression of the respective parental zzso correlated with zzso zzso at certain sites zzso in the zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and callus zzso was not accompanied by considerable changes of the zzso zzso
