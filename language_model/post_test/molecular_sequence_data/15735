zzso fusion depends on zzso zzso factors such as the zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we link the identified zzso zzso site to zzso function at the zzso fusion zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates together with other zzso zzso on zzso structures zzso to the zzso that expand in a class E zzso background and that zzso to in zzso fusion zzso zzso analysis of this zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso structures close to the zzso In contrast, zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and leads to zzso zzso indicative of a fusion zzso These two zzso can be rescued by overproduction of the zzso zzso zzso revealing that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso the organization of zzso fusion sites and provide evidence for a fusion zzso zzso on the zzso limiting zzso
