Previous studies from acutely zzso zzso cells have identified an zzso zzso in the Type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a putative novel nuclear zzso sequence zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, some zzso in cellular zzso was always observed, and other published aspects of zzso zzso physiology are more consistent with an zzso zzso As a means of resolving whether the zzso zzso zzso is zzso we have used the high zzso zzso frequency of zzso cells to knock an zzso tag zzso et zzso Nat zzso zzso 12, zzso zzso into one of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso is expressed as a zzso zzso is active as revealed by zzso and zzso zzso and that cellular zzso reveals that it is indeed zzso zzso tagging of zzso proteins in zzso cells is a technique that offers unique advantages in studying zzso zzso zzso
