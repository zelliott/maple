zzso diversity among 86 zzso zzso zzso was investigated by comparative sequence analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The strains included 79 field zzso recovered from birds zzso zzso cattle zzso pigs zzso and sheep (10) within England and Wales, four Asian zzso associated with bovine zzso zzso and the type strains of the three subspecies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns were also determined to establish correlations between subspecies status and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso types were identified, but these were clustered into two distinct zzso zzso A and zzso zzso within lineages A and B had a mean number of zzso differences of zzso zzso within lineage A were associated with birds, zzso pigs and zzso whereas those belonging to lineage B were recovered from birds and a zzso zzso per cent of the zzso were classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso patterns, but these have diverse zzso zzso gene sequences that were represented in both lineages A and zzso Avian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated exclusively with lineage B, but bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in lineage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso bovine and zzso origin represent a homogeneous group within lineage A, but they have the same zzso zzso type as certain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings provide strong support for the view that zzso and zzso zzso patterns are inaccurate indicators of genetic zzso among zzso zzso zzso Avian zzso type B zzso and zzso type B and E zzso associated with zzso zzso of cattle and water zzso are closely related and form a distinct cluster within lineage zzso The current subspecies nomenclature of zzso zzso neither accurately reflects the zzso zzso zzso relationships among zzso nor does it adequately zzso the full range of diversity within the zzso The study provides a zzso zzso evolutionary framework that will form the basis of further studies into the genetic diversity of zzso zzso and will also help in the zzso of the zzso
