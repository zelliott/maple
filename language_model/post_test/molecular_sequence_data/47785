Although the high level of competence for natural transformation of zzso zzso strain zzso has been the subject of numerous studies, only two competence zzso zzso and zzso have been identified to zzso By zzso walking analysis we found two overlapping open reading zzso designated zzso and zzso starting 61 zzso downstream of zzso zzso and zzso are expressed as stable proteins in zzso coli, thus proving that they are indeed coding regions, but expression was successful only with zzso zzso zzso and zzso are similar to zzso and zzso zzso Both genes were zzso and the zzso of the zzso were zzso Natural transformation in zzso zzso is zzso reduced, whereas zzso zzso exhibit zzso transformation zzso This is clear evidence that zzso and zzso are involved in natural zzso However, zzso and zzso are specific for DNA zzso since zzso and zzso defects affected neither zzso nor zzso zzso These results suggest that the type IV zzso the general protein zzso pathway, and the DNA zzso machinery in zzso zzso strain zzso are evolutionary related but functionally distinct zzso
