zzso zzso and zzso reduction can be detected following addition of zzso to many cell types, including rat zzso zzso zzso Although many reports suggest that such a phenomenon is due to zzso oxygen species production, other zzso as zzso and zzso are capable of detecting zzso oxygen zzso do not produce a zzso signal in this model zzso Our aim was to purify and identify the zzso catalyzing the zzso zzso and zzso reduction from rat zzso zzso zzso Here, we show the identity of this zzso as zzso zzso In support of this, a zzso preparation of this protein was capable of reducing zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso Moreover, zzso cells zzso zzso zzso displayed a zzso increase in the aforementioned activity compared with zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso analysis suggest that the majority of the zzso activity is localized to the zzso cells present within the zzso These results emphasize the importance of the direct zzso reduction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso even though this zzso does not, on its own zzso produce zzso oxygen zzso
