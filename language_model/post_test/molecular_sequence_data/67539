zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in final zzso maturation and steroid hormone zzso It has structural and functional similarities to zzso zzso zzso that are involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso and zzso zzso To understand the zzso regulation of zzso here we report the cloning of zzso promoter from two fish species, rainbow trout and zzso zzso Analysis of the promoter zzso in zzso identified the presence of several sites for zzso factor binding including zzso zzso and steroid hormone responsive zzso zzso reporter zzso with progressive deletion zzso demonstrated that zzso type B of trout has no promoter activity while zzso type A of trout and zzso zzso promoters showed zzso promoter zzso A zzso box flanked by a zzso box is important for zzso zzso zzso of zzso responsive element in the promoter decreased zzso promoter activity zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso drugs that increase zzso zzso induced the promoter activity over the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso promoter activity and is further evidenced by the induction of zzso expression in the zzso of zzso in zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that zzso expression is not only modulated by zzso but also by zzso and further studies may provide significance to the ubiquitous distribution and broad zzso specificity of this zzso
