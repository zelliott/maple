zzso zzso is the zzso agent of bovine zzso a disease which can be protected by vaccination with the less zzso zzso species, zzso zzso Currently, there is no zzso chain reaction zzso zzso available which zzso between different species of zzso or which can differentiate zzso of zzso zzso within outbreaks and between different zzso A molecular test specific for zzso zzso would be ideal for the identification of zzso species in wild zzso as possible reservoirs of zzso and to differentiate between zzso zzso from zzso zzso A zzso zzso was designed to amplify the major surface protein zzso gene of the zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso both as an zzso and zzso zzso The test did not amplify zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by amplifying repeat regions within the zzso gene which vary in number between many zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso varied in size from 630 to zzso representing one to eight internal zzso All 22 Australian zzso tested amplified a zzso product (one zzso in contrast to all 19 zzso zzso zzso Eight sequences from Australian zzso from different geographical regions confirmed the zzso nature of the Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso The Australian zzso zzso zzso deduced zzso acid sequence has been designated as Australian type zzso The zzso zzso method developed here enabled the amplification and comparison of zzso zzso zzso originating from North and South America, Africa, Israel and zzso The method is sensitive and specific for zzso zzso Although additional zzso products were amplified from at least two Australian zzso the results suggest limited introduction of zzso zzso into zzso
