The zzso is a zzso acid module which mediates critical zzso and zzso interactions for a large family of regulatory zzso We have used zzso design to analyze the ability of the zzso zzso to zzso an zzso zzso The zzso protein regulates zzso zzso virus zzso gene expression by participating in the formation of a zzso complex zzso zzso which regulates alpha zzso zzso zzso We recently described the design of zzso a zzso zzso factor containing zinc fingers 1 and 2 of zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso factor and C1 factor, zzso efficiently zzso formation of the C1 complex in zzso and specifically activates gene expression in zzso The sequence specificity of zzso recruits C1 complex formation to an zzso element which is not efficiently recognized by zzso zzso function depends on the recognition of the zzso zzso zzso These results prove that the zzso zzso mediates all the zzso interactions that are required to efficiently recruit zzso factor and C1 factor into a C1 zzso The zzso design of zzso factors should provide valuable tools for zzso the interactions of zzso zzso in other regulatory zzso
