zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso are zzso zzso that are involved in the zzso phase transition of the cell cycle in zzso Although they also play critical roles in the regulation of zzso and zzso their characterization in zzso has not been zzso fully, particularly in zzso zzso To investigate the evolutionary significance of zzso zzso in the zzso system of fish, we cloned the zzso of zzso and zzso from a Nile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 582 zzso acids that shares zzso zzso with human zzso while zzso zzso encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso acids that shares zzso zzso with human zzso zzso of tissue distribution by zzso and Southern zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are strongly expressed in the zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed two zzso transcripts in the zzso and zzso with different expression patterns, which indicates the presence of two structural zzso for zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was determined by in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso were expressed predominantly in zzso In the zzso on the other hand, zzso was expressed in primary zzso while zzso was generally expressed in primary and secondary zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are key factors in the progression of zzso in zzso
