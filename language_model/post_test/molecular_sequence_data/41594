zzso acid is a unique zzso zzso specifically attached to a limited number of zzso Among them is synaptic cell zzso zzso 1 zzso 1), a member of the zzso zzso zzso composed of three zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 is cell zzso and was exclusively found in zzso cells, a class of zzso zzso cells that form specialized zzso with zzso Here, we studied the molecular requirements for zzso 1 zzso Analysis of mice lacking one of the two zzso zzso or zzso revealed that zzso of zzso 1 is exclusively zzso by zzso throughout zzso brain zzso Alternative zzso of the three variable zzso zzso zzso and zzso can theoretically give rise to eight zzso zzso of zzso zzso We detected seven transcript zzso in the developing mouse brain, including three zzso containing zzso zzso which was so far regarded as a cryptic zzso in zzso zzso of zzso 1 was restricted to four zzso in zzso zzso However, cell culture experiments demonstrated that all zzso zzso of zzso 1 can be zzso by zzso Moreover, analysis of domain deletion zzso revealed that zzso which harbors the zzso site, is not sufficient as an zzso for zzso The minimal zzso required for zzso contained zzso and zzso suggesting an important role for zzso as a zzso site for zzso
