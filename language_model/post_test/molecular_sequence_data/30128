zzso zzso zzso dietary zzso to zzso and fatty zzso In the presence of zzso zzso the activity of pancreatic zzso is markedly zzso The activity can be restored by the addition of zzso a low molecular weight protein zzso by the zzso The action of pancreatic zzso in the gut zzso is dependent upon its interaction with zzso As a first step in zzso the molecular events governing the interaction of zzso and zzso with each other and with fatty zzso a zzso zzso human zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library with a rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length 525 zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso 112 zzso zzso including a 17 zzso acid signal zzso The predicted protein sequence contains zzso of the published protein sequence for human zzso determined by chemical methods, but predicts the presence of five additional zzso zzso acids and four additional zzso zzso zzso zzso of the predicted protein sequence with the known sequences of zzso from other species reveals regions of extensive zzso In zzso translation of zzso transcribed from the zzso gave a protein of the expected molecular size that was processed by pancreatic zzso zzso zzso analysis of the in zzso translation product after processing demonstrated signal zzso zzso and the presence of a human zzso as exists in the pig and horse zzso DNA zzso analysis was consistent with the presence of a single gene for zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso expression of zzso zzso in the zzso Thus, we report, for the first time, a zzso for zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
