zzso generated from zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells was used to amplify and clone type I and type II zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso using zzso derived from zzso regions between human and mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3' terminal sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were amplified by zzso and 3' rapid amplification of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso demonstrated 77, 64 and zzso similarity with human, mouse and rat zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso demonstrated 70, 60 and zzso similarity with human, mouse and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso and zzso produced in insect cells bound zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, both receptors suppressed the growth zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso toward zzso cells in a zzso manner, indicating that the present zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes biologically active zzso
