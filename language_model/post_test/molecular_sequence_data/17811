An amplification of a zzso zzso was found on the zzso zzso isolated from a subculture of the zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations contained a mixture of molecules with copy numbers of the amplified unit in the range of 2 to zzso The amplification on zzso was zzso propagation of cells for many generations did not change the pattern of the amplified zzso zzso of the plasmids containing the zzso unit of DNA zzso and the amplified DNA sequence zzso were zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso terminal regions and the junction between zzso units showed that the zzso unit of DNA was flanked by zzso direct zzso The DNA segments adjacent to the zzso sequence common to the left and right zzso terminal regions also showed significant zzso In addition, the left zzso terminal region zzso the zzso repeat exhibited considerable sequence similarity to zzso zzso attachment sites, particularly to the zzso 100 zzso zzso
