The human zzso zzso locus is subject to zzso repression by zzso in some cultured cell zzso To gain insight into the mechanism underlying this regulation, zzso zzso zzso zzso under the zzso control of the human zzso zzso promoter were constructed and tested for zzso When the zzso were introduced into zzso zzso cells, a human cell line that shows zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso three- to fivefold when zzso was present in the culture zzso A zzso containing only 149 base pairs of zzso sequence was expressed at similar levels and regulated to the same degree as one having approximately 3 zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequences required for the zzso repression are likely to be located within the region of the zzso initiation zzso The zzso repression of the zzso zzso was not observed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells, and therefore they showed the appropriate zzso zzso zzso cells having zzso levels of zzso zzso can be selected by growth in medium containing the zzso analog zzso It was previously demonstrated that the increased expression of zzso zzso in zzso human zzso was due to a zzso zzso To gain further support for a zzso zzso we tested our zzso zzso for the trans induction in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso of this cell line yielded no difference in transient zzso zzso Furthermore, cloned zzso zzso cells having integrated copies of the zzso zzso expressed zzso at similar levels as compared to the parental cell zzso Since these cell lines do exhibit zzso repression of zzso but not trans zzso these data indicate that the zzso repression is a regulatory event that occurs independently of the trans zzso
