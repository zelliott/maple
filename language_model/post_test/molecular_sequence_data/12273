zzso zzso is used to probe the zzso change induced in the calcium regulatory protein zzso upon binding to a target zzso The zzso lifetime for zzso measured by frequency domain zzso increases from zzso zzso for the zzso complex to zzso zzso for the complex of zzso and zzso a zzso derived from the zzso target protein zzso light chain zzso The intensity of the zzso zzso increases over the solution value by a factor of 726 and zzso when bound to zzso and to the complex of zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso rate to zzso zzso was also measured and is consistent with a single water zzso bound to the metal in both the zzso and zzso zzso The most dramatic change induced by zzso is the zzso reduction in the zzso of the zzso lifetime distribution, which is interpreted to be a zzso zzso of the previously flexible zzso zzso
