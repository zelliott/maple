T cell zzso has long been associated with the zzso of zzso receptors and associated molecules to zzso zzso We now show that zzso cells zzso also accomplish the selective recruitment to zzso zzso of molecules critical for zzso zzso Using mouse bone zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso class II molecules become substantially localized to zzso upon DC zzso Even more striking is the fact that zzso is recruited to zzso upon T zzso zzso zzso is zzso dependent and requires zzso on T zzso Despite the regulated recruitment of zzso class II and zzso to zzso unlike the zzso in T cells, zzso do not zzso these molecules to sites of zzso cell zzso This difference may reflect the necessity for zzso to interact with multiple T cells simultaneously and emphasizes that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso are not necessarily zzso
