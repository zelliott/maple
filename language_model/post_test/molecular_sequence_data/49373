Several studies suggest that a zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso exists in zzso Researchers have attempted to verify its presence using two zzso zzso determination of zzso functional activity and zzso probing with zzso zzso zzso However, up to now, neither a zzso gene nor a protein has been found in zzso While there is still some controversy over whether the zzso functional activity seen is due to nitrate zzso using the zzso zzso zzso in western zzso analysis, several groups have reported the presence of zzso protein bands in plant zzso Based on these results, zzso studies using these zzso have also been used to zzso zzso in plant zzso However, plant zzso has never been positively identified or zzso Thus, we used a zzso approach to verify the identities of plant proteins that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic axes were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and subjected to western zzso analysis with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Twenty zzso protein spots recognized on a corresponding zzso zzso two-dimensional gel were subjected to zzso zzso followed by identification using zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso Fifteen proteins were successfully identified and they have described functions that are unrelated to NO zzso The remaining five proteins could not be zzso The zzso acid sequences of these identified proteins and those used to raise the zzso were zzso However, no zzso region could be zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso recognize many zzso plant zzso zzso it is inappropriate to zzso the presence of plant zzso using this zzso zzso
