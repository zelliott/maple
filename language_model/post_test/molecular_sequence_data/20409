zzso zzso an zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso group, harbors numerous zzso DNA molecules whose sizes range from 2 to 250 zzso In this study, we used a zzso capture system zzso to clone three small plasmids from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were not found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the six putative open reading frames zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed approximately zzso zzso identity with the zzso of zzso and zzso which are rolling circle replicating group zzso zzso group zzso plasmids from zzso zzso In addition, a putative origin of transfer zzso showed zzso identity with those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed relatively low zzso identity zzso with the zzso protein coded by zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso origin of replication zzso and zzso origin of replication zzso of zzso exhibited approximately zzso and zzso identities with those of zzso and zzso zzso and 7 showed greater than 50% similarities with alkaline zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso The other 2 zzso were identified as hypothetical zzso To determine the zzso of zzso seven zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso into a zzso cured zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region that included the putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited replication zzso These findings identified zzso as a new zzso group zzso zzso and determined its replication zzso
