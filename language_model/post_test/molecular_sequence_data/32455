Leading edge zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is driven by the localized assembly of the major zzso protein zzso zzso in the same way that zzso assembly powers zzso in other types of crawling zzso zzso of this process in zzso led to the identification of two accessory proteins required for MSP zzso an integral membrane zzso MSP zzso protein zzso and a zzso zzso MSP fiber protein 2 zzso Here, we identify and characterize a zzso zzso zzso MSP zzso zzso zzso that links the activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso extracts showed that zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso 1 family of zzso protein zzso is required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso by native gel zzso zzso and zzso by zzso indicating that zzso binds to and recruits zzso to the membrane zzso zzso in turn, zzso zzso on zzso zzso resulting in incorporation of zzso into the zzso zzso coated with zzso assembled a surrounding cloud of MSP filaments when incubated in zzso zzso zzso but only when supplemented with zzso zzso Our results suggest that interactions involving zzso zzso and zzso focus MSP zzso to the plasma membrane at the leading edge of the cell thereby generating zzso and minimizing zzso filament formation zzso
