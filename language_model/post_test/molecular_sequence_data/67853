The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated as zzso was isolated from the soil of a zzso field of zzso in Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso The growth of strain zzso occurred at zzso and pH zzso with zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso activity that was responsible for its ability to transform zzso zzso (one of the dominant zzso of zzso to compound zzso via zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was shown to belong to the zzso zzso and was related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The zzso zzso values between strain zzso and its zzso closest neighbors were below zzso zzso and zzso data, especially analysis of cellular fatty acid, supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests showed strain zzso to be differentiated zzso and zzso from the recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso the novel isolate represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
