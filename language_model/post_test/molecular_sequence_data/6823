We have zzso the potential capacity of hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso to present foreign zzso to the immune zzso Foreign sequences were introduced into the N and C zzso of zzso zzso which was previously shown to assemble spontaneously into zzso zzso The integrity of the C zzso was shown to be essential for preserving the structure of the zzso and therefore could not be used for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of sequences corresponding to T and B cell zzso zzso in the N zzso did not alter the formation of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso were able to induce a T cell response in zzso However, hybrid particles containing the zzso zzso fused to the N zzso did not induce any zzso zzso response, suggesting that the inserted B cell zzso was not exposed at the surface of the zzso These results show that the N zzso in zzso empty zzso is not an adequate site for zzso of B cell zzso but may be useful for T cell zzso presentation and suggest that the N zzso is located in an internal zzso
