zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso for the Ras zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity therefore has important implications for cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso when expressed in insect zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is sensitive to the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso GAP activity is inhibited even at low zzso of zzso However, zzso zzso of GAP activity is only approximately zzso suggesting that the zzso complex retains residual GAP zzso This decreased activity is reflected by a zzso decrease in its affinity for zzso A truncated zzso of zzso with reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso some zzso zzso to an 80 zzso segment immediately zzso to the zzso zzso Since zzso is an abundant protein in zzso cells, the zzso interaction may regulate the Ras zzso zzso
