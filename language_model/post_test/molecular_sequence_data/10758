zzso tests were performed employing 12 zzso belonging to a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso Two pairs of incompatible plasmids were found, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso The zzso of plasmids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso were made of the zzso origins zzso and putative replication proteins zzso of these and 11 related zzso zzso zzso of the alignments with the zzso data indicated that the zzso zzso could be contained within the zzso tandem repeats zzso and/or the zzso repeat zzso in zzso In support, the zzso zzso of zzso was localized to a zzso zzso encompassing zzso A stretch of 13 zzso acids of zzso was proposed to be responsible for the zzso initiation of zzso This stretch is part of a domain containing features that are highly zzso within the proposed DNA binding regions of the initiation proteins from several zzso plasmids from zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso and zzso
