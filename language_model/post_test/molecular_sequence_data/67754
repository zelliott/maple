The dark black zzso zzso zzso zzso is an economically important zzso zzso zzso zzso and traps are being developed as a key kind of alternative control measures for this zzso and studies to reveal the mechanisms for zzso in this zzso are zzso Two full-length zzso zzso different zzso proteins zzso were zzso The predicted proteins were found to have the functional zzso characteristic of typical zzso and share a high degree of sequence similarity with zzso and zzso from other insects and were therefore designated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These two zzso were specifically expressed in zzso The binding affinity of two zzso proteins indicated that zzso and zzso could selectively interact with various zzso zzso from host plants and zzso zzso Among the 10 chemicals tested, zzso could bind to six of the tested compounds with a zzso concentration zzso less than 20, and zzso could bind to three of the zzso The two zzso are probably involved in zzso of the dark black zzso This discovery should accelerate research on chemical communications of this zzso which could potentially lead to the improvement of control measures based on zzso and zzso
