The zzso binding site on zzso brain zzso was zzso labeled, in the presence or absence of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 33, zzso After zzso reduction and zzso the zzso zzso samples were treated with zzso and the zzso of peptides were first zzso by gel zzso over zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso of the radioactive areas zzso for one area, three major radioactive signals which were further analyzed by reversed phase zzso zzso leading to zzso radioactive zzso zzso of these different zzso gave a complete sequence of a zzso zzso on zzso zzso and two partial zzso sequences of a zzso zzso on zzso zzso in addition to sequences of mixture of zzso The radioactive signals were lost while concentrating the samples for zzso preventing the identification of the modified zzso zzso These results identify the first zzso on zzso which binds to the zzso and confirm the involvement of both zzso and zzso in the zzso binding zzso
