The zzso family includes a number of zzso such as wingless ( zzso which zzso zzso zzso that function in numerous zzso patterning zzso In order to gain a better understanding of zzso pattern formation, a zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the expression pattern of this gene was compared with that of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is expressed in many developing zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is detected within only a subset of these zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso part of each developing segment and within the developing eye, but not within the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso is required for heart and muscle development, and conservation of this zzso zzso pattern suggests that zzso function to pattern these zzso in zzso zzso with this, expression of zzso zzso protein in heart precursor and muscle cells, which is dependent on zzso signaling in zzso is also zzso in zzso Within the developing zzso eye, zzso is expressed in a pattern that is similar to the expression pattern of zzso zzso in the fly eye zzso In zzso zzso neural differentiation at the anterior margin of the eye disc and patterns the zzso axis of the zzso These data indicate that zzso may function similarly during zzso eye zzso Analysis of zzso provides molecular evidence suggesting that the processes of heart, muscle, and eye patterning are likely to be zzso among insects and zzso
