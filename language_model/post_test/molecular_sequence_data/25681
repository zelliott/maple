zzso zzso regulates the levels of outer membrane protein F zzso in zzso coli in response to temperature increase and other stress conditions by decreasing the levels of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso directly from zzso chain reaction generated DNA which was designed to contain a functional zzso zzso zzso promoter upstream of the zzso zzso gene and an appropriate restriction site for zzso zzso A transcript zzso zzso containing the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso from the zzso gene cloned into a zzso expression zzso A stable duplex was formed between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso transcript of zzso zzso after incubation at 37 degrees C in a zzso zzso The melting curve of the duplex formed by zzso zzso and zzso transcript revealed a zzso of 56 degrees C and a delta zzso that spans about 20 degrees zzso both are consistent with the proposed structure for the zzso zzso In addition, as determined by competition studies and zzso zzso zzso an zzso coli protein was found to bind specifically to zzso zzso The protein also bound zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The data are the first to demonstrate the complex between zzso zzso and the zzso end of zzso zzso and suggest that in zzso a zzso zzso zzso particle may participate in the zzso zzso zzso during zzso of zzso zzso
