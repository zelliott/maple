zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso the formation of zzso acid and ammonium zzso from zzso This zzso functions in cellular metabolism of every zzso by zzso nitrogen required for the zzso of a variety of zzso zzso while zzso acid plays a role in both sensory and nutritional properties of zzso So far there have been only a few reports on zzso expression and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso with emerging potential in both the food and the pharmaceutical zzso In this research a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, under the control of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso with zzso tag at its zzso and could be zzso zzso by zzso immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso to apparent zzso The zzso could be induced for efficient expression with zzso yielding approximately 26,000 units from zzso shake flask zzso The zzso was stable at zzso and pH zzso for up to zzso and could be used efficiently to increase zzso acid content when protein zzso from soy and zzso were used as zzso The study demonstrates an efficient expression system for the production and zzso of bacterial zzso In addition, its potential application for zzso of zzso to zzso zzso acid has been zzso
