An essential step leading to zzso is the binding of a zzso to the egg plasma zzso zzso zzso a membrane bound protein on the zzso surface of zzso partially mediates this binding via the zzso zzso zzso beta is a member of the still expanding family of zzso proteins (a zzso and zzso that are implicated in many cellular functions ranging from zzso to zzso fusion and zzso zzso zzso beta contains a highly zzso motif zzso in the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso could be the consensus sequence for recognition of zzso by zzso zzso Previously, it has been demonstrated that small peptides containing different zzso of this consensus sequence are zzso of in zzso zzso In the present study, we sought to determine whether a four zzso acid zzso sequence with two adjacent zzso zzso improved zzso and investigated the importance for zzso of a zzso versus a zzso A series of linear and zzso peptides were zzso in which either one or both adjacent zzso zzso in the sequence zzso were zzso to their corresponding zzso (N or zzso To explore the required zzso state of the zzso in the zzso zzso it was protected as a mixed zzso Our results indicate that only one zzso zzso is required for zzso of zzso and a reduced C is zzso
