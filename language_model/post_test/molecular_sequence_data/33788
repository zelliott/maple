In zzso zzso there is still a lack of a highly efficient gene disruption zzso To help address this issue, we presented a simple and efficient method for both single and multiple gene disruptions in zzso zzso The knockout system combined a variation of zzso zzso chain reaction method zzso split marker deletion method, zzso of zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso Using a slightly modified zzso zzso the zzso zzso split marker zzso together with zzso split marker zzso resulted in at least zzso zzso zzso events when the zzso zzso DNA zzso had a size of approximately zzso Our evidence suggested that zzso DNA may be responsible for the increased gene disruption zzso We demonstrated the effectiveness of the method for gene disruption by constructing both single and double gene disruptions at the zzso and zzso zzso in the same genetic zzso The method described here presents an improved strategy for gene disruption and a potential application for investigation of biological processes in other zzso zzso
