zzso of zzso membrane proteins zzso is a zzso process that requires not only recognition of zzso in the zzso but also their zzso into the zzso zzso As a consequence, targeting signals of zzso zzso are rather zzso A candidate protein for the zzso recognition event is zzso which interacts with most zzso However, the respective zzso sites are zzso and it is currently disputed whether these sites are contained within zzso By using synthetic zzso scans and zzso zzso zzso we determined and characterized zzso sites in zzso and zzso two zzso from zzso zzso The sites turned out to be composed of a short zzso motif with a minimal length of 11 zzso zzso With the acquired data, it proved possible to predict and zzso verify zzso sites in several other zzso by applying a pattern search and a prediction zzso A zzso targeted zzso zzso became zzso to the zzso zzso in the absence of its zzso zzso By adding the zzso binding site of zzso zzso targeting of the zzso zzso was zzso We conclude that zzso sites are zzso entities that represent an essential part of the zzso
