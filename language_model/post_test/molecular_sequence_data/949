The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A and B, are processed from separate zzso precursor zzso According to their zzso each precursor zzso appears to contain additional zzso zzso all of which share a structural motif of six zzso zzso zzso within their zzso acid zzso To identify the putative zzso peptides at the protein level, zzso extracts were screened for small zzso zzso by zzso labeling their zzso zzso Three novel zzso zzso derived from the precursor zzso of zzso B were zzso Two of the zzso were zzso to zzso and tested for their biological zzso The zzso activity of the novel peptides was remarkably lower than that of the originally isolated zzso but both peptides killed bacteria by zzso their zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso activity are zzso released from the same precursor zzso presumably to generate a zzso ancient complementary zzso zzso
