zzso infections produce severe respiratory morbidity in children with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are more susceptible to virus in part because of impaired airway zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso As zzso is a fundamental regulator of zzso defenses, we hypothesized that there may be multiple zzso in the zzso defense of zzso zzso compared with normal zzso To obtain a comprehensive view of zzso host responses to influenza and characterize the difference between zzso and NL responses to zzso gene expression profiles of primary human airway zzso cells zzso were evaluated using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso following influenza A zzso Gene expression was significantly modified by influenza in NL zzso zzso and zzso (101 zzso with a similar pattern of gene response but with overall less numbers of responsive genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells had less zzso zzso gene induction at 24 h but greater inflammatory zzso gene induction at 1 h after zzso Taken together, the lesser zzso and greater early inflammatory response likely contribute to the severe respiratory illness of zzso patients with viral zzso
