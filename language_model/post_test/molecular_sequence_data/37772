The zzso region of a short arm of zzso zzso is frequently deleted in many human zzso including zzso zzso in which it has been narrowed down to the smallest region of overlap between zzso and zzso zzso 7 zzso During the search for the candidate tumor zzso genes mapped within the region, we found the zzso gene which zzso a new human zzso protein with a zzso to human zzso zzso of synaptic zzso zzso The zzso is an zzso motor protein and often associated with zzso differentiation and zzso Here we identified a complete open reading frame of the zzso gene by screening a zzso library derived from human zzso zzso The zzso protein contains a possible zzso zzso zzso domain at its zzso However, it did not possess a zzso motor domain which is well zzso among zzso zzso members zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso was zzso expressed in both adult and fetal zzso zzso skeletal muscle and zzso zzso was expressed in favorable zzso at higher levels than in zzso zzso although zzso zzso analysis showed no zzso within the coding region of the zzso zzso when 8 zzso zzso and 15 zzso cell lines were zzso Thus, the full-length zzso gene may be a novel member of human zzso zzso which lacks motor domain and might function as a tumor zzso in an zzso but not a classic zzso zzso
