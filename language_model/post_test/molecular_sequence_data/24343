A novel gene zzso from zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso which was zzso to the zzso gene from zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA and was zzso The open reading frame zzso of zzso was zzso zzso long and zzso an approximately 40 zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso shares zzso and zzso identity of zzso and zzso acid zzso respectively, to the zzso zzso The identity in promoters of both genes was as high as zzso It was found that there were two zzso and zzso boxes, three zzso motifs for initiation of early gene zzso and one typical zzso core sequence for initiation of late gene zzso at both zzso zzso end, and two zzso tail signals at 3' zzso The zzso started to express 2 hours after being zzso into the zzso cells to produce an approximately 40 zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene might also inhibit the zzso of the zzso cells induced by removing zzso The expression of zzso in zzso cells delayed the zzso of the zzso cells induced by zzso zzso The zzso gene rescued zzso (a kind of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells resulting in zzso of the zzso and production of zzso All these data suggested that the zzso gene was a zzso and functional gene similar to zzso zzso zzso
