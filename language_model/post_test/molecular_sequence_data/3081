zzso sampling of zzso data contained within the zzso human sequences collection is being used to establish a catalog of novel genes that are expressed exclusively or predominantly in the human zzso This provides a valuable source for candidate genes possibly involved in retinal zzso In this report we present the characterization of the zzso gene locus zzso zzso peptides zzso and its evaluation in dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso library screening were used to isolate the full-length zzso sequence and to determine the zzso organization of zzso zzso profiling was done by zzso and Northern zzso zzso zzso was evaluated as a candidate gene for zzso by DNA sequencing and Southern zzso analysis in two affected individuals from an extended Dutch zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso transcript consists of zzso zzso and is organized into 3 zzso on the short arm of zzso 7 within the critical region for zzso The transcript is specifically expressed in the zzso but not in a large range of other human zzso No zzso zzso or larger gene zzso were zzso 

We provide the zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a precursor protein for at least two small zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and show that it is abundantly expressed in the human zzso zzso of our comprehensive zzso analysis suggests that zzso is not the zzso zzso
