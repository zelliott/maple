zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso agent that has been found to be zzso in a wide variety of organisms from viruses to zzso germ zzso To zzso the zzso of zzso at the zzso locus of mouse zzso cells and to confirm the ability of the mouse zzso zzso zzso to detect both point zzso and large DNA zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to different doses of zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso resulted in a linear dose response with zzso zzso of up to zzso over zzso zzso of zzso clone size showed that zzso of the 100 zzso zzso clones zzso in zzso were small colony zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were large colony zzso DNA isolated from zzso in the control culture and the 100 zzso zzso treatment group was analyzed for loss of zzso zzso using zzso zzso The majority of the small colony zzso both zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso lost the zzso zzso The percentage of zzso loss in zzso large colony zzso was distinctly different from that of the zzso zzso percent of zzso large colony zzso lost their zzso zzso whereas zzso of the large colony zzso from the control culture lost the zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, 50% of the zzso zzso from the 100 zzso zzso cultures zzso in zzso showed zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a potent zzso in mouse zzso cells and that 100 zzso zzso zzso equal numbers of point zzso and zzso zzso This study serves to verify that the zzso detects both point zzso and zzso zzso
