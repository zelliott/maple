zzso zzso of zzso sulfur with an zzso serving as the electron zzso is of interest because this may play an important role in the recovery of electrons from zzso zzso and for current production in marine zzso microbial fuel zzso zzso initiated with a marine zzso zzso with zzso sulfur as the electron donor and a positively poised zzso zzso versus zzso zzso as the electron zzso yielded an zzso zzso with a diversity of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further enrichment of the zzso zzso zzso in medium with zzso sulfur as the electron donor and zzso oxide as the electron zzso followed by isolation in solidified zzso medium yielded a strain of zzso designated strain zzso zzso zzso effectively oxidized zzso sulfur to zzso with an zzso serving as the sole electron zzso at rates faster than zzso zzso the only other zzso in pure culture previously shown to zzso zzso with current zzso The abundance of zzso species enriched on the zzso of marine zzso fuel cells has previously been interpreted as zzso zzso driving current production, but the results presented here suggest that zzso current production is a likely zzso
