Na channel zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso produce slowly zzso and rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso current recovers from zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment identified the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso as zzso To determine whether zzso zzso Na channels with slow zzso and/or rapid zzso we analyzed the transient Na current produced by a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso dependence of zzso and zzso was zzso However, zzso was twice as fast as in the wild type at zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may contribute to the rapid zzso of zzso Na zzso
