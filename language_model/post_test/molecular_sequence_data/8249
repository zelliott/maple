The preferred zzso sites in zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso available as zzso were identified by limited zzso of zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso were zzso by using either zzso or fluorescent dye labeled zzso zzso of identical sequence to one of the fluorescent dye labeled duplex strands was prepared by affinity zzso zzso experiments carried out under single hit conditions demonstrate that the zzso shows preferences for zzso regions in zzso in particular zzso and avoids zzso of zzso There is a correlation between zzso at a given position in one strand with zzso at the same position in the other strand of the zzso zzso zzso occurs at somewhat different preferred sites than observed in zzso On zzso the zzso zzso produces a very different zzso pattern compared to bovine pancreatic zzso I, with the notable exception that both zzso avoid zzso In general, the zzso zzso compared to zzso I is a slightly more zzso zzso that attacks a particular zzso more evenly under standard reaction zzso At high zzso strength or in the presence of zzso it becomes more zzso zzso of zzso however, makes the zzso more selective than observed under standard zzso From these results which were confirmed by the results of zzso experiments with synthetic zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso like zzso I is sensitive to global features of the DNA, for example, the zzso of the minor zzso In addition, localized zzso interactions between zzso and zzso determine whether a site is zzso zzso Some of these interactions seem to be the same for zzso and zzso
