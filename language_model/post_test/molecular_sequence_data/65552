zzso and behavioral studies indicate that binding of cocaine and the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso protein is principally responsible for initiating the euphoria and addiction associated with these zzso The lack of an X-ray crystal structure for the zzso or any other member of the zzso zzso zzso family has hindered understanding of zzso recognition at the atomic zzso structural information has been obtained largely from zzso and zzso zzso The recent publication of a crystal structure for the bacterial zzso zzso zzso a zzso related zzso family zzso provides for the first time a template for three-dimensional comparative modeling of zzso zzso A novel zzso modeling approach using the capabilities of the zzso zzso Environment program zzso zzso in conjunction with other comparative modeling servers generated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding sites were identified within the zzso model using multiple zzso zzso zzso sites for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso overlapped substantially with the analogous region of the zzso crystal structure for the zzso zzso The zzso predictions implicated zzso side chains known to be critical for high affinity zzso binding and suggest novel zzso targets in zzso discrete zzso and inhibitor binding zzso The zzso model may guide zzso zzso zzso studies, and rational design of novel zzso zzso
