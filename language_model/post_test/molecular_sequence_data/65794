DNA zzso I zzso zzso the relaxation of zzso DNA via a concerted mechanism of DNA strand zzso and zzso zzso is the cellular target of the zzso drug zzso zzso which zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso around duplex DNA, wherein the core and zzso zzso are connected by extended zzso zzso zzso which position the active site zzso of the zzso domain within the zzso zzso The physical connection of the zzso with the zzso clamp as well as zzso flexibility affect zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso data reveal that a zzso zzso zzso zzso at the juncture between the zzso and zzso zzso is at one end of a short zzso which extends to the active site zzso zzso linked to the zzso In the presence of drug, the zzso is rigid and this zzso extends to include zzso and the preceding zzso We report that zzso of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso alters zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or Ala enhanced zzso zzso sensitivity, with the zzso zzso inducing the greatest increase in drug sensitivity in zzso and in zzso By contrast, Val or zzso zzso rendered the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso architecture preceding the active site zzso suggest these structural transitions zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso while enhancing the rate of DNA zzso We zzso that this zzso zzso zzso provides a flexible hinge within the zzso zzso pocket to facilitate zzso dynamics and the structural zzso that accompany drug binding of the zzso zzso zzso
