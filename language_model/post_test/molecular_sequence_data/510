To evaluate the variation of some zzso related to the level of zzso activity dependent on the different zzso 

We studied 27 zzso workers and 37 controls using different zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso were determined using zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso length zzso chain reaction zzso the subjects were assigned to a specific group based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity predicted by their zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The studied zzso were not able to discriminate between exposed and control individuals, but sister zzso exchange zzso and high frequency cells were influenced by smoking zzso Smokers having fast zzso zzso zzso activity showed higher zzso frequency zzso respect to those presenting intermediate zzso or slow zzso zzso zzso 

On the basis of these results, can we suppose the existence of an zzso zzso advantage (at least for induction of zzso
