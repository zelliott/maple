The synthesis of zzso proteins via zzso of zzso genes occurs in response to heat and various physical or chemical stressing zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes requires a zzso regulatory element in their promoter, to which a zzso specific zzso factor zzso In zzso cells, the zzso factor already exists in zzso cells in an inactive form and acquires the capacity to bind to the zzso element following zzso The mechanism of this zzso is not zzso neither is it known whether the different stressing agents induce the zzso response through a common zzso We previously proposed that many agents known to induce the zzso response zzso interfering with respiratory zzso agents reacting with zzso groups, metals, recovery from zzso and zzso might act via zzso of zzso oxygen species, zzso zzso zzso or zzso We show here that zzso introduced either in zzso cell cultures or in cell zzso was able to activate zzso zzso zzso was rapid and zzso concentration dependent, with a threshold of 1 zzso These results were confirmed with mouse zzso zzso This very rapid zzso in zzso or in zzso suggests a direct effect of zzso either on the zzso factor itself or on its zzso
