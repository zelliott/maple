Cell zzso plays an essential role in arthritis by recruiting and retaining zzso in the zzso zzso a major zzso zzso component in zzso plays a central role in zzso and zzso interactions through zzso of cell surface zzso The present study was designed to determine the effects of gene transfer of a zzso acid zzso derived from the zzso zzso cell and zzso domain of zzso zzso on established arthritis in zzso 

zzso DNA zzso a zzso zzso under control of the zzso promoter was injected zzso into mice with established zzso arthritis, and the effects on zzso zzso and recruitment to the zzso was zzso 

Following injection, circulating zzso could be detected for at least 5 zzso zzso mice demonstrated a marked reduction in progression of zzso Not only was disease progression zzso but a significant improvement in joint swelling was observed within 2 days of zzso zzso zzso and recruitment were inhibited by zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso evaluation revealed a marked reduction in zzso of both zzso and zzso into zzso zzso for at least 10 zzso 

These results suggest that antagonism of cell zzso by soluble zzso peptides may provide an approach to attenuating chronic zzso
