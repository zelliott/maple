zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of genes were reported to be involved in the regulation of gene expression by zzso pathways of zzso zzso processing and zzso zzso However, direct biological evidence zzso zzso zzso is zzso This report intends to correlate the first reported zzso within the zzso of the C1 inhibitor zzso gene with clinical presentation of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing of zzso DNA revealed in all affected members of a family suffering from zzso a zzso 155 zzso deletion 100 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso A substantial reduction of both zzso as well as zzso protein expression was revealed by zzso and zzso zzso 

We suppose that the zzso within the zzso interferes with integral pathways of gene expression leading to zzso zzso in this zzso
