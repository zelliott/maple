Recently, five members of the zzso zzso family have been zzso However, little is known about their cellular and zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso Using specific zzso zzso we observed zzso zzso zzso zzso in many brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, zzso zzso zzso and zzso In all of these regions (except for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selectively targeted to zzso zzso profiles which did not zzso with zzso or zzso zzso One zzso profile was always associated with one zzso cell zzso This zzso pattern was resistant to zzso treatment and showed a closely overlapping distribution with zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso protein is not transported over long zzso zzso microscopic analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized to the plasma membrane of zzso zzso which extended into an zzso pocket and showed a zzso filament pattern in their zzso body and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso 3 demonstrates a unique example of a zzso zzso not localized to zzso zzso or zzso sites, but selectively targeted to zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso 3 zzso on zzso zzso suggests that these presumably zzso zzso may not merely represent zzso zzso but rather function as chemical sensors of the immediate zzso
