A zzso zzso zzso previously isolated from zzso zzso was shown to bind in a zzso manner to the early zzso zzso gene promoter from zzso zzso Here, the functional importance of the zzso binding sites on the zzso promoter has been studied in zzso A zzso fusion in which a zzso was introduced at the putative target zzso zzso was inactive in zzso of transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso does not bind to the zzso promoter segment, suggesting that zzso activates the zzso expression in zzso through its interaction with its target zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso an zzso zzso construct gave expression in root vascular tissue in addition to the root zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic zzso zzso roots reduced the leaky expression in root vascular tissue in contrast to zzso in which a small increase in zzso expression was zzso The results indicate that zzso acts as a zzso of zzso expression in root zzso
