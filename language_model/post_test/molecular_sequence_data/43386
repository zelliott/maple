zzso of zzso active zzso zzso is dependent on a number of zzso steps, including metal attachment to a precursor of the zzso zzso zzso of a small zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso of the zzso Two zzso acid replacements were introduced by zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso site of zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Replacement of zzso the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by Pro yielded a form of zzso that was blocked in zzso zzso This zzso zzso although capable of binding zzso was blocked in formation of a stable zzso zzso In the second zzso the zzso extension of zzso was eliminated by substituting the Ala zzso for a zzso stop zzso Although this zzso zzso was able to form the zzso zzso it was devoid of zzso Both zzso proteins contained only traces of zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso and zzso and zzso activity were almost completely zzso while the zzso zzso activity, zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso These results allow the following zzso the zzso extension of zzso is zzso to direct specific Ni zzso into the zzso zzso assembly to the zzso is not dependent on Ni zzso and a precursor with the zzso zzso is not competent for zzso
