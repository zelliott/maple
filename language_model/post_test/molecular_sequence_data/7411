Members of the recently inserted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso elements were zzso A number of these zzso elements share greater than zzso sequence identity with the zzso consensus zzso and they are flanked by perfect zzso and 3' direct repeats ranging in size from 6 to 15 zzso zzso Based on the low number of random zzso the estimated average age of these elements was calculated to be zzso million years zzso All the young zzso zzso members were restricted to the human zzso as judged by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of human and zzso zzso DNA samples using the unique zzso sequences specific for each zzso zzso The zzso locations of several zzso elements belonging to the young zzso designated as zzso and zzso were determined by zzso amplification of DNA samples from zzso zzso cell hybrid zzso A statistical analysis of the zzso distribution pattern showed that the recently inserted zzso elements appear to integrate randomly in the human zzso
