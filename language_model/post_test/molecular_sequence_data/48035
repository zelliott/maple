A panel of zzso was zzso against zzso membrane zzso from rat zzso One of the zzso reacted with a zzso protein that zzso primarily to the zzso complex or the zzso zzso zzso depending on cell zzso The corresponding zzso was cloned and zzso and found to zzso a protein of zzso zzso that we call zzso zzso zzso protein 95 zzso The protein zzso with zzso zzso but does not contain zzso regions that could function as signal peptides or zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso is a zzso exposed peripheral membrane protein that exists in a zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of highly zzso proteins in zzso and zzso zzso It has recently been determined that plant and zzso zzso of zzso are important for controlling the differentiation of stem cells zzso et zzso zzso Cox et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In zzso zzso there are at least 20 members of this protein zzso To this end, we have used zzso interference to show that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is important for maturation of zzso stem cells in the zzso zzso and related proteins are an emerging new family of proteins that have important roles in zzso zzso The present study suggests that these proteins may exert their effects on cell differentiation from the level of zzso zzso
