zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso as zzso acid zzso has been described earlier and suggested to participate in regulation of zzso activity toward cellular zzso The mechanism of this zzso is poorly zzso zzso binding of zzso acid to zzso zzso could be demonstrated by measuring the extent of zzso binding in a zzso zzso by measuring the extent of binding of zzso to zzso zzso plates or zzso beads zzso and by zzso zzso employing zzso labeled PA zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to bind to zzso albeit to a lesser zzso A zzso binding site for PA and zzso was mapped to the 41 zzso zzso acids of zzso This site was absent from the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by PA toward two different zzso at low zzso zzso A zzso zzso missing this binding site could, however, still be activated toward zzso zzso basic protein as a zzso at high PA zzso This zzso is likely to be zzso by a second, zzso binding site for PA in the zzso part of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso of zzso may present a specific mechanism of regulating activity and/or cellular zzso
