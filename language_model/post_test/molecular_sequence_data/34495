The microbial community in which a pathogen zzso is fundamental to disease zzso Species interacting with a pathogen on the host surface shape the distribution, density, and genetic diversity of the zzso but the role of these species is rarely zzso The screening method developed here can be used to characterize zzso species affecting zzso This strategy involves three steps: zzso constitution of the microbial community, using the pathogen as a zzso zzso community selection, using extracts from the pathogen as the sole zzso zzso and zzso molecular identification and the screening of zzso focusing on their effects on the growth of the pathogen in zzso and host zzso This approach was applied to a zzso plant zzso zzso zzso structured in a zzso for screening the microbial community from the zzso of zzso zzso (the zzso Two of the characterized zzso zzso with the zzso cycle and may affect the host zzso A zzso species acted through a zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso material by leaving the zzso A zzso species established an zzso interaction with zzso zzso strongly suppressing disease by zzso zzso zzso zzso This screening method is appropriate for all zzso zzso It allows the definition of microbial species as promoters or zzso of a disease for a given zzso It should also help to identify important microbial relationships for ecology and evolution of zzso
