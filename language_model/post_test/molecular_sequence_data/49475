We describe the main zzso changes in small zzso affected by AA zzso together with the partial sequence of the protein zzso zzso sheep and one goat were selected for presenting zzso kidney zzso compatible with systemic zzso Available tissue samples were studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Renal zzso were characterized zzso by pale cortical surfaces with scattered, zzso zzso zzso and on cut cortical surfaces by straight, zzso zzso zzso pneumonia was observed in 16 out of 21 affected sheep zzso although other chronic zzso were also zzso zzso was detected in all zzso affected zzso using zzso red zzso zzso being most remarkable in zzso affecting zzso of animals zzso zzso deposits were also observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso animals presented zzso convoluted zzso zzso mostly characterized by an increase in diameter and by zzso zzso zzso that were responsible for the zzso appearance of the zzso zzso zzso was also seen in blood vessels, zzso liver, zzso zzso gastrointestinal zzso and adrenal zzso All zzso deposits demonstrated zzso zzso with polarized light, and the zzso prepared against goat zzso extracts specifically reacted with zzso zzso deposits of both sheep and zzso zzso these deposits were formed by masses of straight, zzso zzso located predominantly in the basement zzso of zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso sequence of the protein in sheep and zzso indicated a high degree of zzso with the previously reported sequence of sheep zzso zzso zzso
