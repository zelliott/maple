zzso modifications of zzso zzso zzso by zzso play key roles in the regulation of zzso structure and zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso zzso that mark repressive states of zzso and are absent in some lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso are considered as active marks of zzso and are highly zzso in all zzso from zzso zzso zzso to Homo zzso Paradoxically, protein complexes catalyzing zzso and zzso zzso are zzso characterized in higher zzso particularly in zzso zzso zzso zzso contains 12 zzso zzso GROUP zzso proteins zzso classified to zzso Group zzso and thus potentially involved in zzso and zzso zzso So far only some genes of this family had been functionally zzso Here we report on the genetic and molecular characterization of zzso a previously zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso has an early flowering zzso associated with suppression of zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins could zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso plants showed zzso reduced levels of zzso zzso at zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso shared a highly significant number of zzso expressed genes with that of zzso a previously characterized zzso exhibiting zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso Taken together, our results zzso to our knowledge, the first demonstration for a biological function of zzso and reveal additional layers of complexity of overlap and zzso functions of the zzso family genes in zzso
