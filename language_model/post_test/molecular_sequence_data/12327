zzso of zzso in the thick ascending limb of zzso loop in the kidney and in the surface cells in the zzso colon involves the integrated function of several membrane transport systems including zzso channels, the zzso system and the zzso To determine if their properties are consistent with a role in regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso channels from the zzso membrane of the zzso cells and from the zzso membrane of the zzso colon cells have been characterized by flux studies in plasma membrane zzso preparations and by single channel zzso in zzso zzso The channels are found to be activated by zzso in the zzso range of concentration with a strong dependence on zzso pH and the membrane zzso The zzso of the zzso channels is modulated by zzso and zzso and the zzso channel protein must be in a zzso state to respond to zzso zzso of zzso As a step towards zzso of the zzso channel zzso procedures for zzso and zzso of the zzso channels have been zzso The observation that the zzso zzso zzso channels bind zzso in the presence of zzso have allowed for partial zzso of the zzso channel proteins by zzso affinity zzso In the sequences for the two cloned zzso zzso channels, the zzso channel and the zzso channel, putative zzso binding regions can be zzso
