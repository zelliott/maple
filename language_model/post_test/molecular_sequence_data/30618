When used in an in zzso zzso zzso the promoter of a cloned alpha zzso zzso gene is much more active in liver than in zzso nuclear zzso zzso deletion experiments suggest that both positive and negative regulatory mechanisms may be involved in the differential in zzso zzso from the alpha zzso zzso promoter in these two nuclear zzso Interestingly, removal of promoter elements upstream from position zzso results in a significant increase of in zzso zzso in zzso but not in liver nuclear zzso and thus reduces the difference in zzso observed with longer alpha zzso promoters in these two zzso zzso of additional zzso to position zzso strongly reduces the in zzso zzso efficiency of the promoter in extracts from both zzso None of the examined promoters containing between zzso and 22 zzso of zzso zzso regions are zzso transcribed in liver nuclear extracts from either male or female zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso could not be observed in our in zzso zzso zzso zzso I protection experiments with crude nuclear extracts and partially or highly zzso nuclear proteins suggests the presence of six recognition sites for zzso factors between the zzso element and position zzso Some of these factors could be identified as proteins that also bind to elements within the zzso gene zzso
