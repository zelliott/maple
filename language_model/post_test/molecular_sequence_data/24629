The zzso gene of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed as a zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of a zzso display zzso The variable heavy and light chain genes of zzso were found to be derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the heavy chain zzso determining region zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso from crude bacterial zzso by zzso zzso in a yield of zzso zzso from 100 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the cell surface of zzso cells irrespective of zzso of origin, but not with zzso zzso The recognition site of the zzso zzso was identical to that of zzso since the binding of zzso zzso to zzso cells was completely inhibited by zzso with an excess of zzso The relative affinity values of zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower affinity of zzso zzso may be due to the difference of zzso of the zzso zzso Cell growth zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso with zzso suggests that the zzso zzso produced by cloned zzso zzso coli was identical to the zzso part of zzso zzso These results show that a small zzso with zzso binding activity similar to that of the parent zzso can easily be prepared by using a zzso display zzso To our knowledge, this is a first report of the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso
