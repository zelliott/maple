We study the problem of mapping proteins between two protein families in the presence of zzso This problem occurs as a difficult zzso in zzso zzso approaches for zzso interaction zzso 

Similar to prior approaches, our method is based on the idea that zzso implies equal rates of sequence evolution among the interacting zzso and we provide a first attempt to zzso this notion in a formal statistical zzso We call the units that are central to this zzso scheme the units of zzso A unit consists of two mapped protein pairs and its score zzso the zzso of the zzso This zzso allows us to provide a maximum likelihood zzso of the zzso mapping problem and to cast it into a zzso zzso programming zzso 

zzso our software tool based on a zzso relaxation of this zzso makes it, for the first time, possible to zzso state-of-the-art quality pairings in a few minutes of zzso In zzso we suggest a novel alternative to the earlier available approaches, which is statistically sound and zzso zzso
