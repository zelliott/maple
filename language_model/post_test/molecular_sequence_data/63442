The zzso zzso is a zzso modification of nuclear proteins widespread among several zzso zzso is the main protein involved in this process and it is zzso zzso to a diverse assortment of nuclear protein zzso To date, 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso have been characterized in zzso and zzso In this work we characterized two zzso related zzso named zzso and zzso throughout zzso zzso life zzso The zzso encodes for proteins sharing significant zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso analyses revealed that both zzso are distinct zzso Additionally, zzso and C are expressed in zzso adult zzso eggs and zzso however zzso gene showed an expression level 7 to 9 fold higher than zzso in eggs, zzso and adult zzso The comparison between the zzso zzso and zzso sequences established that the zzso sequence is interrupted by 3 zzso of 70, 37 and 36 zzso Western zzso has shown zzso zzso are present in nuclear and total protein zzso of adults and zzso Therefore our results suggest a functional zzso pathway, and the presence of two zzso also suggests the specificity of zzso for zzso in zzso zzso
