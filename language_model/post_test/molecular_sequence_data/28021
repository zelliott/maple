Three zzso zzso are located in the pro region of the transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso 1) precursor at zzso acid positions 33, zzso and zzso Previous studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso with zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 1) precursor produced by Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso can form a zzso bond with at least 1 zzso zzso in mature zzso 1, contributing to the formation of a zzso zzso We now show that zzso and zzso form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to change these zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso into zzso zzso Analysis of zzso proteins by zzso showed that by substituting zzso the zzso protein is not formed, and thus, more mature zzso (24 zzso is zzso corresponding to a 3- to zzso increase in biological zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso resulted in near zzso levels of mature zzso zzso Furthermore, cells zzso with zzso coding for zzso at positions 223 and 225 expressed only zzso precursor proteins and released zzso zzso 1 that did not require acid zzso suggesting that zzso of the precursor pro region may be necessary for zzso
