zzso zzso is a zzso flagellate that attacks fishes, causing disease problems in freshwater zzso zzso of similar zzso in strictly marine zzso have indicated that zzso may be caused by more than 1 flagellate zzso We obtained partial small zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of 14 zzso zzso originating from zzso in Norway, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and Brazil, and identified 8 strains or species, including 2 species infecting cultured salmon in zzso An zzso species isolated from the skin of Atlantic salmon zzso in freshwater is suggested to represent zzso zzso zzso zzso while another species, showing particular affinity for the zzso zzso salmon in both zzso and zzso Atlantic cod is infected with a marine zzso species unrelated to those infecting zzso 2 zzso originating from different parts of the world had related zzso zzso and 2 zzso from unrelated North and South American zzso were also closely zzso The zzso relationships of the zzso zzso is zzso and the implications of the molecular findings on past and future zzso studies of zzso zzso are zzso
