The zzso repeat zzso proteins form one of the largest families in higher plants and are believed to be involved in the zzso processes of gene expression in plant zzso It has been shown by using a genetic approach focusing on zzso zzso zzso activity that a zzso protein zzso is essential for a specific zzso editing event in zzso Here, we discovered zzso zzso zzso that are specifically impaired in the zzso editing of the site 2 of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a member of the zzso protein zzso The zzso editing of zzso converts the zzso of zzso to zzso In zzso the activity of the zzso complex is specifically impaired, suggesting that the zzso change has important consequences for the function of the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that is characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso region (the zzso zzso This zzso domain is highly zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso although it is not essential for the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso domain has a common function in zzso editing rather than of recognizing specific zzso zzso
