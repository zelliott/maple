zzso is a major zzso of human vascular zzso As observed with zzso zzso zzso the distribution of zzso is restricted to zzso cells in all zzso except bone zzso zzso clones were isolated from an zzso cell zzso zzso zzso library using a rabbit zzso prepared against zzso zzso from zzso Eleven zzso and zzso clones were zzso zzso with zzso cell zzso zzso transcript was zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso was determined and found within the deduced protein zzso thus confirming the identity of the zzso and revealing a partial signal zzso zzso is a type I integral membrane protein of Mr zzso zzso with an zzso region of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso There are four potential zzso zzso sites in the zzso domain and a probable zzso domain rich in zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Data base searches revealed that zzso is a novel zzso The sequence contains an zzso zzso zzso the first identified on a surface protein of zzso The presence of zzso a key recognition structure in cellular zzso suggests a critical role for zzso in the binding of zzso cells to zzso and/or other zzso zzso
