The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are potent zzso of the protein zzso type 1 and type zzso Their potency of zzso resembles zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso These zzso increase the overall level of protein zzso in zzso Evidence is presented to indicate that in zzso the zzso changes and effects on the zzso are due to zzso zzso The potency of these compounds in inducing zzso deformation is similar to their potency in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of these peptides is related to zzso of zzso and further indicate the importance of the protein zzso in maintenance of structural and zzso integrity in these zzso
