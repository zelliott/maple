The effect of type zzso von zzso factor zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured by means of the probe zzso 2, was zzso Seven patients with type zzso von zzso disease zzso were zzso zzso of type zzso zzso plasma to zzso suspensions induced a zzso calcium increase accompanied by zzso zzso Both processes were completely abolished by addition of the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocking the zzso binding site on zzso zzso or the zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the protein zzso zzso zzso partially inhibited the rate of the zzso calcium zzso No direct correlation between the extent of zzso rise and the zzso expression of zzso zzso such as the degree of spontaneous zzso zzso or zzso was zzso It is suggested that zzso and zzso zzso increase in zzso exposed to plasma from type zzso zzso patients is zzso by a zzso mechanism involving both zzso and zzso receptors as well as the zzso zzso zzso
