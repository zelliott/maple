zzso degradation under zzso conditions has long been zzso but the zzso responsible for the degradation reaction are still largely zzso An zzso designated strain zzso was isolated in a pure zzso zzso This isolate is the first tangible, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso in association with an zzso zzso zzso Besides zzso it could metabolize zzso zzso zzso and zzso During the degradation of zzso a small amount of zzso (a maximum of 4 zzso and zzso (a maximum of 11 zzso were formed as transient zzso When zzso was used as the zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and zzso zzso 92 zzso were detected as zzso which were then further zzso to zzso and methane by the zzso No zzso were found to support the zzso growth of strain zzso in pure culture, although 88 different zzso were tested for zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso belongs to an zzso clone cluster zzso zzso at the family (or zzso level in the class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for strain zzso and the novel family zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences in the databases indicated that the proposed new family zzso is largely represented by abundant bacteria within zzso zzso mainly zzso aromatic zzso
