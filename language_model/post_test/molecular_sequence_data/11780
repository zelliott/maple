zzso studies have demonstrated the existence of two major zzso of human T cell leukemia virus type II: zzso and zzso In attempts to further zzso this family of viruses we have carried out zzso sequence and restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the long terminal repeat zzso a region that has been shown in previous studies to have the greatest zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences suggested the existence of distinct zzso groups in each zzso and, on the basis of predicted differences in restriction zzso sites, zzso analysis allowed the identification of four groups within the zzso zzso zzso and six within the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis also suggested the possible existence of zzso zzso However, this appeared not to be zzso and preliminary studies suggest that these would not be expected to influence the results of zzso analysis zzso The zzso of the zzso method was demonstrated in an analysis of 36 randomly chosen samples from zzso zzso blood donors from the New York City Blood Center, where it could be shown that all could be successfully zzso Moreover, the zzso analysis correctly matched the viruses in donors and recipients of contaminated blood in four situations in which zzso was inadvertently transmitted by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso appears to be a rapid and reliable method by which to identify zzso zzso This should prove useful in studies of the epidemiology and the characterization of viruses present both in zzso and indigenous zzso
