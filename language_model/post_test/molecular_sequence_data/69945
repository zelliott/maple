As part of a retrospective study into the prevalence of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso we assessed the suitability of the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify the zzso major zzso region zzso in frozen and zzso zzso Considering Southern zzso as a standard, the sensitivity of zzso was zzso Of the various procedures used to extract DNA from zzso tissue zzso zzso K zzso in the presence of zzso zzso gave the highest yield and quality of DNA and the most efficient amplification zzso Using this method, excellent amplification rates zzso were obtained for both the zzso control sequence and the zzso zzso for fixed zzso zzso specimens collected in the previous 2 to 6 years zzso zzso zzso Of nine older zzso zzso on six gave inconsistent results, probably because of the zzso zzso used for zzso zzso exposed to zzso zzso or zzso zzso were as suitable for amplification as zzso fixed in zzso zzso The overall zzso of the zzso zzso in all zzso zzso specimens as detected by both Southern zzso and zzso was 59% zzso of zzso
