The zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and West, zzso zzso zzso 93, zzso has a zzso leading to gross zzso of zzso small zzso zzso Here, we have cloned the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso library, using the zzso selection procedure zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 5, zzso The zzso clone contains a short split gene zzso a basic protein of 107 zzso acid zzso This protein shows strong zzso to zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and de zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso gene encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The expression of the zzso gene is regulated such that the level of the putative zzso zzso is increased about zzso when zzso protein synthesis is zzso We suggest that this reflects part of a general mechanism for zzso zzso zzso nuclear genes that zzso zzso constituents in response to impaired zzso zzso This is the first report of the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso protein gene from zzso zzso
