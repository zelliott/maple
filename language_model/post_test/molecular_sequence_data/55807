A zzso study was carried out to evaluate the relative performance and reliability of the zzso zzso compared to conventional zzso typing in identifying zzso zzso A total of 268 consecutive samples were entered into the zzso In 14 zzso of the cases, zzso zzso could not be performed due to poor cell zzso while in seven zzso of the cases, zzso typing could not be performed due to poor amplification or to contamination with zzso zzso Among samples that were successfully typed by both methods, zzso typing correctly identified zzso zzso DR zzso while zzso correctly identified zzso zzso DR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of discrepancies in zzso typing resulted from a lack of zzso zzso to identify zzso or zzso For the overall sample set (N zzso zzso zzso provided accurate results in zzso zzso cases, while zzso provided accurate results in 260 zzso cases zzso zzso zzso The results of this study demonstrate that zzso typing for zzso zzso provides results that are equal to or surpass zzso typing for zzso zzso In addition, the zzso approach offers the advantages of better zzso zzso lower cost, more rapid zzso time, and greater zzso all of which would warrant its use as an zzso typing method of zzso
