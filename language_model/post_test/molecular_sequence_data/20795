Two pathways are used by higher plants for the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the last step in the zzso zzso In order to understand the contribution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso a full-length zzso corresponding to zzso from the flower zzso of zzso zzso Ramsey was zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequence contains a zzso signal zzso at the zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso in zzso flowering plants revealed ubiquitous expression in zzso and zzso with preferential expression in the floral zzso zzso analysis revealed evolutionary conservation of the zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso in zzso is similar to that in zzso zzso and rice in zzso zzso zzso by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso confirmed its zzso zzso tobacco carrying the zzso zzso gene fusion showed expression in most zzso as well as in zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso Light induced strong zzso expression driven by the zzso promoter in transgenic tobacco zzso Taken together, our data suggest a role for zzso as a zzso zzso
