zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso is known to zzso a number of highly zzso proteins that are thought to zzso zzso in part, by zzso binding to host zzso Among these zzso proteins are the zzso zzso 85 zzso complex and the related zzso zzso also known as zzso While the zzso function of zzso a zzso required for the zzso of the cell wall component zzso zzso (or zzso zzso has been identified recently, the function of the closely related zzso zzso zzso identity with the zzso zzso remains to be zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso determined to zzso A resolution, shows that zzso like the zzso components zzso and zzso folds as an zzso zzso but it does not contain any of the zzso elements required for zzso zzso Moreover, the absence of a recognizable zzso zzso site and the failure to detect an active site suggest that the function of zzso is of a zzso nature and that zzso may in fact represent a new family of zzso zzso zzso Previous experimental evidence and the structural similarity to some zzso and zzso proteins led to the hypothesis that zzso might have a role in host tissue attachment, zzso zzso may include the serum protein zzso and small zzso
