The viral zzso zzso and the viral zzso complex determine the replication fitness of a highly virulent zzso of influenza A virus strain zzso zzso zzso and its high zzso in zzso We report here that the zzso of the zzso differs from the zzso of a low virulent strain zzso by the efficiency of zzso binding and membrane zzso zzso bound to zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso bound exclusively to zzso zzso acids with high zzso zzso zzso infected its target cells faster than zzso and tolerated an elevated pH for efficient membrane zzso In spite of these differences, both viruses targeted type II but not type I zzso in the lung of infected zzso The zzso of zzso differs from that of zzso by 16 zzso zzso and one zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso acid at zzso position 190 zzso zzso primarily determined the specificity of zzso zzso while the zzso at position 133 influenced the zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso acid positions also strongly influenced viral zzso Furthermore, zzso at position 78 and zzso at position 354 were critical zzso of increased fusion activity and zzso of zzso Our data suggest that the zzso of zzso enhances zzso by zzso optimal zzso binding and membrane fusion thereby promoting rapid and efficient viral entry into host zzso
