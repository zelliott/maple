The zzso activity of the zzso genes is regulated by a complex genetic element, the locus control region zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binding sites for the zzso zzso factor zzso are important for the zzso zzso function of the zzso We discovered that zzso strongly stimulates the DNA binding activity of zzso in crude and zzso nuclear zzso The other zzso zzso and zzso do not affect zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA binding experiments indicated that zzso stimulates zzso DNA binding by increasing the number of zzso molecules that are competent to bind to DNA, rather than influencing the affinity of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a similar zzso radius for zzso in the absence or presence of zzso inconsistent with a role for zzso in stabilizing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms, which were either zzso or strongly induced by zzso were resolved by zzso and zzso exchange zzso A model is proposed in which two zzso of zzso share an identical zzso zzso but differ in DNA binding zzso zzso may interact directly with one of the zzso to generate the zzso DNA binding zzso The presence of a zzso binding pool of zzso suggests that the formation of an active zzso zzso may be a regulated step in the zzso
