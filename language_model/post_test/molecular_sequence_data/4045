In this communication, we have demonstrated that molecular dynamics simulations using a zzso implicit zzso model with the zzso based force field zzso can describe the spontaneous folding of small peptides in zzso zzso The native structures of peptides with various structural motifs zzso zzso and zzso were successfully predicted within reasonable time scales by MD simulations at moderately elevated zzso It is expected that the present simulations provide further insight into zzso of the zzso zzso
