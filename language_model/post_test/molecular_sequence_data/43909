zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso are being developed as zzso safe zzso and stabilizing zzso zzso are a mixture of zzso and regional zzso containing from one to as many as twelve zzso zzso zzso groups per zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso resolves these zzso based on the zzso degree of zzso substitution zzso and the zzso shows an almost symmetrical distribution of zzso incorporation centered around the band which represents the apparent average degree of substitution for the zzso The objectives of this study were to isolate the different substitution bands for their characterization and to evaluate their mass contribution to the zzso zzso of zzso containing from zzso up to zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso with salt concentration zzso zzso The bands for each zzso were well resolved as characterized by zzso analysis with indirect zzso zzso The isolated materials were zzso and zzso to obtain white zzso which were then characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso The zzso zzso response factor of each zzso was then determined, and the actual percent mass composition of a zzso mixture was zzso
