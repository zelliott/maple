zzso one of the zzso like zzso which have been isolated from zzso has been shown to be a zzso zzso that zzso with anti zzso alpha specific zzso suggesting a possible relationship between the two proteins zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to support the zzso data also by zzso and zzso experiments the availability of a zzso zzso alpha from zzso was a zzso A zzso zzso clone of zzso zzso alpha was expressed in the bacterial strain zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso its molecular mass on one-dimensional zzso PAGE was estimated to be zzso zzso The calculated molecular mass according to the zzso acid composition is zzso Da zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso exhibited mostly the same properties as the zzso human zzso alpha zzso zzso In several respects it behaved differently from zzso thus supporting the notion that either zzso is zzso by another gene or it zzso extensive zzso and/or zzso zzso Three observations in particular disprove any close zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso is dramatically zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso rather than stimulating the zzso of zzso by zzso alpha (and by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta has no significant influence on the stimulation of the zzso zzso by zzso whereas in the case of zzso alpha and zzso alpha addition of zzso beta is required for optimal stimulation by zzso zzso zzso does not zzso with zzso beta to form a high molecular mass complex as it is demonstrated for zzso zzso
