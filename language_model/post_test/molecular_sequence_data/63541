The emergence of resistant strains of human pathogens to current zzso along with the demonstrated ability of zzso as zzso agents, provides strong motivation for understanding how zzso antibiotics have evolved and diversified in zzso zzso into how bacterial zzso zzso zzso acquire new zzso capabilities can guide future laboratory efforts in generating the next generation of zzso zzso Here, we examine zzso and structural evidence to glean answers to two general questions regarding zzso zzso How did the exceptionally diverse chemistry of zzso zzso zzso And what are the take-home messages for the zzso zzso
