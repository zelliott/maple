zzso zzso zzso one of the most abundant nuclear proteins in zzso zzso is a key component of the zzso structure mainly due to its role in the formation and maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso It has a zzso zzso a central zzso domain flanked by a short zzso domain and a long, highly basic zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that the binding abilities of zzso are at large determined by the properties of the zzso zzso much less attention has been paid to role of the zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso can be zzso via zzso zzso injection in zzso zzso cells that lack zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso proteins are incorporated into in zzso assembled zzso at specific sites and the binding event is monitored as an increase in zzso repeat length zzso Using this setup we have here compared the binding properties of zzso and zzso devoid of its zzso domain zzso The zzso displays a drastically lower affinity for zzso binding as compared to the wild type zzso Our data also indicates that zzso is more prone to unspecific zzso binding than the wild zzso We conclude that the zzso domain of zzso is an important zzso of affinity and specificity of zzso zzso
