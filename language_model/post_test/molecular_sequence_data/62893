The known zzso sequence of zzso zzso an agent of zzso zzso was used to study the genetic content and gene expression in zzso zzso another zzso pathogen and a cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso of a DNA array representing zzso open reading frames zzso of zzso zzso with zzso DNA of zzso zzso indicated that the latter zzso has at least zzso of the zzso genes and zzso of the zzso genes of zzso zzso We then carried out quantitative zzso of the zzso with multiple replicates of zzso produced from zzso zzso cells growing in the blood of infected mice or in culture medium that was adjusted to the same zzso temperature and a zzso density as infected zzso Of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by all replicates under both conditions, 12 zzso demonstrated differential expression by a zzso zzso and stringent zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso with the greatest measurable difference in expression between in zzso and in zzso conditions, zzso zzso proteins of unknown zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso were identified, and increased expression in infected mice was demonstrated by quantitative zzso zzso chain zzso
