A large number of zzso zzso have been used to zzso and thus help explain, the metabolism zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A summary of the zzso and resulting models is zzso This shows that investigations so far have focused on just a few of the many zzso mainly those that are involved in drug zzso The models have evolved from simple comparisons of known zzso to more elaborate models requiring considerable computer zzso These help to explain and, more importantly, predict the involvement of zzso in the metabolism of specific zzso
