A new zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated from an African oil-producing zzso Based on the presence of an outer sheath zzso and zzso zzso sequence analysis data, this zzso was identified as a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed lateral zzso had a G + C content of 50 zzso produced traces of ethanol from zzso but no zzso and grew zzso in the presence of 0 to zzso zzso at 70 degrees zzso Its zzso and zzso characteristics clearly differed from those reported for the five previously zzso described zzso zzso zzso we propose that strain zzso zzso is a member of a new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
