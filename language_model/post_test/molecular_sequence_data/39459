A zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional separation method is introduced for zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out by first exploiting the differences in their respective zzso points zzso in a Teflon zzso using zzso focusing zzso followed by a molecular weight zzso separation in a hollow fiber by flow zzso zzso zzso The method developed here zzso may be a powerful alternative to two-dimensional zzso gel zzso which is currently used for the separation and zzso of zzso In zzso proteins can be collected as a fraction of a certain zzso and zzso zzso without being zzso Additionally, the zzso solution is simultaneously removed during separation in the hollow zzso and the overall process time is significantly zzso This method was applied to a human urinary zzso sample, leading to the identification of 114 proteins with the subsequent zzso use of zzso liquid zzso mass zzso after the zzso zzso of each collected protein zzso
