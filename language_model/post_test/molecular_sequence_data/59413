Using an in zzso system for differentiation of embryonic stem zzso cells into cardiac zzso we analyzed the expression of zzso zzso genes by zzso to learn what changes in the expression of multiple zzso genes occur during the early stage of heart zzso We also examined gap zzso zzso communication by using zzso Yellow dye zzso transfer, studied zzso zzso zzso by zzso laser image analysis using zzso 3, and determined zzso of zzso by zzso during in zzso differentiation of zzso cells into cardiac zzso The transcripts for zzso and zzso were detected in zzso zzso cells and in zzso bodies before and after the appearance of beating zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts were not observed in zzso zzso cells and were barely zzso in 3- and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts significantly increased with the appearance of beating cells similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso was present among zzso zzso cells, zzso cells of zzso body outgrowth and zzso zzso beating zzso When dye was injected into a beating cell, dye spread was restricted to neighboring beating zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso protein was localized not only in beating cells but also in surrounding zzso cells, whereas zzso heavy chain zzso was exclusively positive in the beating zzso These data suggest that the expression of multiple zzso is zzso regulated during the zzso differentiation of zzso cells in zzso and that zzso expression may be linked to early stages in zzso zzso
