zzso zzso growth factors zzso and their receptors zzso are key drivers of blood and zzso vessel formation in development, but also in several pathological zzso zzso signaling through zzso promotes zzso which is a clinically relevant target for treating zzso zzso and for blocking tumor zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso consists of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso 1-3 zzso are responsible for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in structural zzso essential for zzso zzso and zzso Here we analyzed the crystal structures of zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso The structures revealed a zzso zzso interface in zzso and a unique mechanism for zzso zzso and zzso with zzso interactions in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso interaction zzso and zzso and the D7 interaction zzso compromised zzso induced zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso deletion zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso all contribute to zzso zzso A structural model of the zzso zzso complex derived from zzso X-ray scattering data is consistent with the zzso interactions in zzso and zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso zzso interactions in zzso and D7 are essential for zzso zzso opening promising possibilities for the design of zzso zzso
