Various mechanisms such as geographic barriers and glacial episodes have been proposed as zzso of zzso and zzso differentiation of zzso and the distribution of their genetic zzso More recently, habitat and climate differences, and corresponding adaptations have been shown to be forces influencing the zzso evolution of some zzso In this study, we examined the contribution of these various factors on the genetic differentiation of the zzso bat, zzso zzso in zzso Europe and zzso 

Our results showed differentiation in zzso DNA coupled with weaker nuclear zzso We found evidence for restriction of lineages to geographical areas for hundreds of zzso The results showed that the most likely ancestral zzso was restricted to the same geographic area (the zzso for at least 6,000 zzso We were able to delineate the migration routes during the population expansion process, which followed the coasts and the inland for different zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to describe a scenario showing how multiple zzso and zzso events including glacial zzso climate and historical zzso patterns zzso each other in causing regional and local differentiation within a zzso
