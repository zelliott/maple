zzso a zzso zzso zzso has an apparent zzso effect on zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of bee zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso and on zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as on zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso increase in the rate of pig pancreatic zzso is seen only on zzso zzso zzso kinetic protocols and zzso methods show that the zzso is due to enhanced zzso zzso resulting from zzso exchange of zzso or zzso zzso through zzso contacts established by zzso It is shown that as the zzso on zzso zzso progresses, due to a high propensity of bee zzso for binding to the product containing zzso zzso most of the zzso in the reaction mixture is trapped on few zzso that are initially zzso and thus reaction zzso Under these conditions, zzso promotes zzso zzso by direct exchange of the products of zzso from the zzso zzso with the zzso present in excess zzso which have not been zzso Pig zzso has poor affinity for zzso zzso and the affinity is only modestly higher in the presence of low mole zzso of the products of zzso therefore, the zzso is not trapped on those zzso zzso studies confirm that the zzso exchange occurs through stable zzso contacts formed by low mole zzso of zzso without zzso movement of zzso or fusion of zzso At high mole fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso leakage in zzso zzso and does not form additional zzso In zzso zzso the contacts are formed even at high mole zzso of zzso Changes in intrinsic zzso zzso of zzso indicate that bound zzso exists in at least two different functional forms depending on the zzso composition and on the zzso zzso A model is proposed to accommodate zzso zzso as a zzso channel or an zzso zzso
