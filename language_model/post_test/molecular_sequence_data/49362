We describe the isolation and characterization of zzso from the rice blast fungus zzso zzso a gene that encodes zzso zzso one of the principal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso shows elevated expression during development of infection structures and zzso zzso and a targeted gene replacement showed that the gene is required for full zzso by zzso zzso In particular, we found that the zzso stage of development, before entry into plant zzso is affected by loss of the zzso zzso There is a delay in zzso zzso development and zzso penetration in Delta zzso zzso Recent reports have shown the importance of the zzso cycle in the zzso of the human zzso fungus zzso zzso and the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso cycle is also important in this plant zzso zzso demonstrating the widespread utility of the zzso in microbial zzso
