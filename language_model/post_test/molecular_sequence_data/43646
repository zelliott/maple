The gene zzso in zzso Collins syndrome, an zzso dominant disorder of facial development, has recently been zzso While the function of the predicted zzso zzso is unknown, it has been shown to share a number of features with the highly zzso zzso zzso which play a role in zzso zzso In the current study, the zzso zzso of the zzso Collins syndrome gene has been isolated and shown to zzso a low complexity, zzso protein of 133 zzso zzso comparison indicates that the proteins display zzso identity, with the level of conservation being greatest in the regions of zzso zzso acid repeats and nuclear zzso zzso These features are shared with the zzso zzso Confirmation that the gene isolated in the current study is zzso with the zzso Collins syndrome gene was provided by the demonstration that it mapped to central mouse zzso 18 in a zzso zzso region with human zzso zzso zzso analysis in the mouse indicated that the gene was expressed in a wide variety of embryonic and adult zzso Peak levels of expression in the developing zzso were observed at the edges of the neural folds immediately prior to fusion, and also in the developing zzso arches at the times of critical zzso zzso These observations support a role for the gene in the development of the zzso complex and provide further evidence that the gene encodes a protein which may be involved in zzso zzso
