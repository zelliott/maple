zzso zzso isolated from the membrane of zzso zzso zzso was found to consist of four zzso zzso B, C, and zzso that were predicted by the sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The preparation contained 7 zzso zzso zzso per g zzso which zzso to 2 zzso zzso A per zzso zzso of 144 zzso molecular zzso zzso with zzso zzso by the zzso was ten times faster than that with zzso zzso with more zzso zzso were zzso The activity of the zzso was inhibited by zzso amounts of zzso while zzso zzso and zzso were more than tenfold less zzso When cells of both strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were grown with zzso zzso zzso was an order of magnitude more active than zzso with zzso plus zzso Surprisingly, the same result was obtained with zzso strains lacking zzso As zzso a and d were virtually zzso a second zzso zzso possibly of the zzso zzso was apparently formed by the zzso
