zzso zzso such as drought and zzso lead to crop growth damage and a decrease in crop zzso zzso control zzso zzso and zzso water use efficiency, thereby playing crucial roles in zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important signal zzso that zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular zzso that regulates the zzso level in guard cells remains largely zzso Here, we clone and characterize zzso zzso and salt zzso previously unknown zinc finger zzso factor that zzso regulates zzso closure by direct zzso of genes related to zzso zzso identify a novel zzso for the signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso function increases zzso closure and reduces zzso density, consequently resulting in enhanced drought and salt tolerance in zzso These findings provide an interesting insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso stress zzso and an important genetic engineering approach for improving zzso stress tolerance in zzso
