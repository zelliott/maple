Data from completely zzso zzso are likely to open the way for novel studies of the zzso of zzso organisms, in particular when it comes to the identification and analysis of genes responsible for traits that are under selection in natural zzso Here we use the draft sequence of the chicken zzso as a starting point for linkage mapping in a wild bird species, the collared zzso - one of the most well-studied avian species in ecological and evolutionary zzso A pedigree of 365 zzso was established and zzso for single zzso zzso in 23 genes selected from (and spread over most zzso the chicken Z zzso All genes were also found to be located on the Z zzso in the collared zzso confirming zzso zzso at the level of gene content across zzso related avian zzso This high degree of conservation mimics the situation seen for the zzso X zzso and may thus be a general feature in sex zzso evolution, irrespective of whether there is male or female zzso zzso such unprecedented zzso conservation may be characteristic of most zzso in avian zzso zzso However, several internal zzso were observed, meaning that the transfer of map information from chicken to zzso bird species cannot always assume zzso gene zzso Interestingly, the rate of zzso on the Z zzso of collared zzso was only approximately 50% that of chicken, challenging the widely held view that birds generally have high zzso zzso
