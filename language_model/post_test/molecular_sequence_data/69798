zzso by restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA duplexes, in which the internal zzso in one of the strands of the recognition site is zzso for zzso has been zzso It has been found that the modified strands of these duplexes are zzso by zzso zzso with a greater efficiency than the intact zzso zzso zzso does not practically cleave such zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the 14-member zzso with modification in the middle of the strand have been zzso A hypothesis has been put forward about the structural features of zzso DNA zzso
