The zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso that possess a zzso domain and zzso sequence complementary to a target zzso can cleave in trans at a putative zzso site within the target zzso We have investigated the potential of zzso zzso to zzso the product of the zzso gene zzso zzso is a 347 zzso zzso that is a major constituent of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene are responsible for zzso syndrome zzso a common systemic disorder of the zzso zzso Many zzso zzso responsible for MFS appear to act in a zzso fashion, raising the possibility that reduction of the amount of product from the zzso zzso zzso might be a valid therapeutic approach for zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted to the zzso end of the human zzso zzso has been designed and zzso and shown to cleave its target efficiently in zzso zzso zzso is zzso dependent and efficient at both 37 and 50 degrees zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into cultured zzso zzso by zzso zzso of a zzso complex, specifically reduces both cellular zzso zzso and the deposition of zzso in the zzso zzso These results suggest that the use of zzso zzso is a valid approach to the study of zzso gene expression and possibly to the development of a therapeutic approach to zzso
