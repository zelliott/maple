zzso zzso zzso the most abundant protein in zzso zzso has been implicated in defending the urinary tract against infections by type zzso zzso zzso Recent experimental evidence indicates that the defensive capability of zzso relies on its single high zzso chain, which binds to zzso coli zzso zzso and competes with zzso zzso receptors on the zzso zzso Here we describe several major differences, on both structural and functional levels, between human zzso zzso and pig zzso zzso zzso contains a much higher proportion zzso of zzso than does zzso zzso zzso zzso coli adhere to zzso zzso at an approximately zzso higher level than to zzso zzso This suggests that the shorter high zzso chain zzso is a much better zzso for zzso than the longer chains zzso and that zzso is a more potent urinary defense factor than zzso In addition, unlike zzso whose zzso zzso are exclusively capped by zzso acid and zzso groups, those of zzso are also terminated by zzso zzso This is consistent with the fact that the outer zzso of pig kidney expresses the zzso which is completely absent in human zzso Finally, zzso is more resistant to zzso zzso zzso than zzso thus explaining why zzso is much less prone to urinary degradation than zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that the species variations of the zzso of zzso can lead to the differential binding of zzso to type zzso zzso coli and that the differences in high zzso processing may reflect zzso adaptation of urinary defenses against zzso coli zzso
