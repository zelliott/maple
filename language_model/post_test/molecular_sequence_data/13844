The identification of the human zzso zzso has prompted considerable interest in the development of zzso zzso that can inhibit the effects of zzso on cells without affecting zzso zzso zzso information about the biology of the zzso highlights some of the potential pitfalls in the development and application of such zzso However, it also provides additional insights into the potential mechanisms by which an zzso might work beyond the original approach of developing competitive zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors have proved to be present on a variety of cells other than zzso including other vascular cells and cells within the central nervous zzso Although most of the recent emphasis in thinking about the need for zzso zzso agents has focused on their use as zzso agents, it is worth considering that the best clinical uses of such drugs may ultimately prove to have little to do with zzso
