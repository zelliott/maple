The human zzso zzso zzso is assumed to result from illegitimate zzso between zzso and zzso gene segments during zzso zzso in early B zzso De zzso zzso are found inserted in most zzso and have been thus far interpreted as zzso N region zzso In this report, we have analyzed both direct zzso and zzso zzso zzso derived from 40 patients with zzso zzso with zzso Surprisingly, we found that more than zzso of the zzso junctions contain a novel type of zzso zzso zzso consisting of short copies of the surrounding zzso zzso and zzso zzso The features of these zzso zzso including zzso of copies for 1 template and the occurrence of zzso in the copies, suggest the presence of a zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso In addition, our analysis clearly shows that zzso occurs during a very restricted window of zzso differentiation and involves 2 distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso the breaks on zzso 14 during an attempted secondary zzso to zzso zzso and an additional unidentified mechanism creating the initial breaks on zzso zzso Altogether, these data suggest that the zzso zzso is a more complex process than previously thought, involving the interaction and/or zzso of zzso zzso with multiple zzso zzso
