A new water channel zzso gene symbol zzso was isolated from rat zzso and liver by zzso zzso zzso protection zzso showed intense expression of the gene in zzso and liver, less intense in colon and zzso zzso and negligible in other zzso The full-length zzso was obtained by zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso isolated from the rat liver zzso library to approximately zzso zzso of the zzso zzso obtained by the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso A major transcript of approximately zzso zzso was demonstrated in liver and colon by Northern zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso markedly enhanced zzso water zzso in a zzso manner, indicating a water channel function of this zzso The open reading frame zzso a zzso acid protein with a predicted molecular size of 28 zzso zzso analysis represented six zzso zzso and five connecting zzso containing two sites of zzso motif as preserved in other zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso has an unusual structure with a long N zzso and a short C zzso which are found in plant zzso zzso intrinsic zzso By in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was assumed in zzso zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso remain to be zzso
