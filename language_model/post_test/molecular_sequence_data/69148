zzso and zzso regulate many cellular functions by zzso the ubiquitous zzso protein zzso (A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules bind to regulatory zzso zzso in A zzso zzso causing them to release their zzso zzso zzso These free C zzso then zzso proteins until the zzso level falls, zzso the R zzso regain their affinity for free C zzso and thus form inactive zzso zzso However if zzso levels remain persistently zzso many cells change their A zzso zzso Some cells alter the rate of degradation of zzso and some cells change the level or stability of the messages zzso zzso Cellular behavior often changes if zzso levels remain zzso many cells zzso some cells zzso and some cells die, depending on the stage of the cell zzso The two forms of A zzso zzso zzso I and type zzso contain identical C zzso but contain either an zzso zzso or an zzso zzso In some zzso type II zzso is zzso to zzso zzso via specific zzso zzso whereas type I zzso is generally zzso Free zzso zzso turn over more rapidly than free zzso zzso in most cells, but all free zzso are zzso more rapidly than when they are associated together in zzso Free C zzso can zzso a broad spectrum of proteins in both the zzso and nucleus, depending on the type of cell, its state of zzso and the hormonal zzso If free C zzso is zzso into the zzso of some intact cells, it zzso to the nucleus, whereas if free R zzso is zzso it remains in the zzso If both zzso are zzso R zzso blocks the nuclear migration of the C zzso A major nuclear target for free C zzso is the zzso family of nuclear zzso which bind to zzso response elements zzso in the promoter regions of zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins alters their ability to form zzso and to interact with zzso Many zzso proteins can be zzso by other zzso as well, indicating this is one means by which cells coordinate zzso and zzso gene zzso However, interactions between zzso and a number of other nuclear proteins with which they can zzso especially proteins whose levels are rapidly altered in response to hormones, provide an even higher degree of complexity of gene regulation than is possible from various zzso zzso the different sites in zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
