zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cause zzso typhoid and zzso disease in avian species, respectively, and have been of considerable economic importance to the poultry industry in parts of the zzso The definitive diagnosis of these diseases can be made only by isolation and identification of the zzso zzso However, rapid identification of zzso zzso and zzso is not easily feasible due to their common zzso structure and zzso sequence zzso We developed a duplex zzso chain reaction zzso zzso to identify and discriminate between strains of zzso zzso and zzso Duplex zzso zzso were designed to target zzso regions of zzso and zzso genes showing multiple zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were applied to the specific identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 131 reference and field strains of zzso and other related zzso bacteria were tested to validate the duplex zzso zzso All strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tested were correctly identified based on this zzso zzso zzso while the other strains zzso were zzso negative zzso zzso These results demonstrate that a highly accurate zzso duplex zzso zzso can be performed for the rapid identification and discrimination of zzso zzso and zzso from field zzso
