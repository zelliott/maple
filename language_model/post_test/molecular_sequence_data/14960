When diagnosed by standard light zzso zzso malaria prevalence can vary significantly between sites, even at local scale, and mixed species infections are consistently less common than expect in areas zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The development of a zzso molecular species diagnostic zzso now enables routine zzso surveillance of malaria infections in large field and intervention studies, and improves resolution of species distribution within and between zzso 

This study reports differences in the prevalence of infections with all four human zzso species and of mixed infections as diagnosed by zzso and zzso zzso detection zzso zzso zzso zzso in 15 villages in the central zzso area of zzso New zzso 

zzso higher rates of infection by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in zzso compared to zzso diagnosis zzso zzso zzso zzso were particularly pronounced for zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso In contrast to zzso diagnosis, which suggested a significant deficit of mixed species infections, a significant excess of mixed infections over expectation was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso Age of peak prevalence shifted to older age groups in zzso diagnosed infections for zzso zzso zzso 7-9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 4-6 zzso zzso zzso 7-9 zzso zzso but not zzso zzso infections zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso geographical variation in prevalence was found for all species (except for zzso zzso zzso with the extent of this variation greater in zzso than zzso diagnosed infections zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coverage was also the dominant factor linked to geographical differences in zzso species infection prevalence explaining between zzso - zzso of this variation for zzso and zzso - zzso for zzso (except zzso zzso zzso 

The present study demonstrates that application of molecular diagnosis reveals patterns of malaria risk that are significantly different from those obtained by standard zzso zzso provide insight relevant to design of malaria control and zzso zzso
