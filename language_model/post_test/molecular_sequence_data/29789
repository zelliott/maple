The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso from a common zzso but catalyze different zzso The zzso zzso reaction zzso by zzso avoids the formation of a vinyl zzso zzso the zzso zzso reaction zzso by zzso involves the formation of an zzso zzso zzso Based on the available structures of zzso a sequence alignment allows the predictions that zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso with the active sites located at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso share an zzso zzso at the end of the first zzso and an zzso motif at the end of the third zzso with zzso but zzso zzso has a zzso instead of a zzso at the end of the second zzso The structure of zzso has been determined in the presence of zzso and the zzso analogue zzso zzso and confirms these zzso The zzso functional groups at the ends of the first, second, and third zzso in zzso are zzso of the zzso in zzso the zzso of these zzso participate in a zzso network that zzso the zzso zzso The zzso group of the zzso analogue is coordinated to the zzso supporting the hypothesis that the mechanism of the zzso zzso by zzso involves stabilization of an zzso zzso zzso These structural studies establish the existence of the zzso zzso in which members catalyze reactions that occur in different zzso pathways and share no zzso zzso The existence of this zzso demonstrates that divergent evolution can be zzso zzso active site features of a zzso to catalyze unrelated zzso zzso sequence or structure zzso alone cannot be used to zzso the functions of new proteins discovered in zzso zzso
