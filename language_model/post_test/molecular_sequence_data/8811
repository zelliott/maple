zzso regulation by zzso zzso is thought to be zzso by a direct interaction between these proteins and zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso factors, although occasionally zzso or adapters are zzso For zzso zzso by the zzso acid zzso X zzso zzso zzso the zzso beta 2 promoter is dependent on the presence of zzso or zzso activity, since this promoter is activated by zzso acid only in cells expressing such zzso The mechanism underlying this zzso requirement is largely zzso We now show that direct interaction between zzso and zzso is a requirement for zzso zzso zzso beta 2 zzso The activity of the zzso zzso function 2 zzso of zzso beta is zzso by zzso and an interaction between this region and zzso was observed, but not with zzso or zzso of zzso zzso This interaction is dependent on zzso region III zzso the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso analysis within this region indicated that the complete zzso is needed for zzso The putative zinc finger region is zzso probably as a consequence of interaction with zzso Furthermore, the region surrounding zzso acid zzso partially overlapping with the zzso binding region, is involved in both binding to and zzso by zzso We propose that zzso functions as a zzso by interacting with both zzso and zzso thereby stabilizing the zzso zzso
