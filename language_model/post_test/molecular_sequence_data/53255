zzso binding zzso a member of the zzso family, was previously shown to be zzso mainly zzso from zzso cells in an zzso independent manner zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso Apart from zzso zzso are not known to carry any other zzso zzso suggesting the presence of a zzso zzso sorting zzso In the present study we have expressed four other members of the zzso family: zzso C1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Tight zzso of zzso cells were grown on filters and the amounts of zzso expressed zzso in the zzso and the zzso media were zzso zzso and C1 inhibitor were found mainly in the zzso medium whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in roughly equal amounts in the zzso and zzso zzso Control experiments showed that all four zzso are transported along the zzso zzso in an uncomplicated way that does not involve zzso or differences in stability on the two sides of the zzso We conclude that some members of the zzso family including zzso binding zzso zzso and C1 inhibitor are zzso mainly zzso from zzso cells whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in a zzso zzso
