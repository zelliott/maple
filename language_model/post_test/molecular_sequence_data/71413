zzso zzso was first identified as a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso from lung zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso from zzso zzso we isolated a protein that zzso with zzso and zzso and that was later found by protein sequencing to be zzso We have shown that soluble zzso binds zzso in a zzso manner independent of the zzso activity of zzso To examine the functional significance of this interaction, we tested the ability of soluble zzso to block zzso binding to and stimulation of the zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso does not affect the binding of zzso to zzso zzso over a wide range of zzso zzso nor does it inhibit the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso We also found that zzso alone stimulates the random migration zzso of zzso zzso in a manner independent of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is not a zzso zzso necessary for zzso stimulation of zzso and show that zzso can directly affect zzso zzso
