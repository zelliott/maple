zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was achieved by transformation with DNA pools from an zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso Transformation of zzso cells with zzso DNA from two zzso plates in the library produced colonies that grew zzso at atmospheric CO2 zzso zzso with zzso DNA from each of the rows and files of the two plates zzso one well in each plate with a zzso bearing the targeted zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed a gene zzso a recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso combining different portions of the zzso and zzso genes indicated the presence of a zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene sequences in this region revealed a zzso substitution in the zzso zzso which produced a nonsense zzso The data presented demonstrate that the zzso zzso produced from the zzso gene is essential to the zzso zzso mechanism in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso can be a facile and efficient means for zzso genes associated with defects affecting photosynthesis and other zzso processes in this zzso green zzso
