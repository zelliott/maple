Selective lineage differentiation depends upon the combined action of several zzso zzso Here we describe 3 human zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid proteins generated by zzso of the relevant zzso The expression zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso gene was used for the expression of the hybrid genes in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid proteins from zzso zzso cultures induced proliferation of both EPO and zzso dependent cell zzso The zzso test, performed on zzso human zzso precursor cells, indicates that the hybrid proteins are more efficient at inducing zzso differentiation compared with the zzso mixture of zzso and zzso
