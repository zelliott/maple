The interplay between zzso and zzso represents a fundamental regulatory mechanism in biological zzso Being less numerous than zzso zzso increase their diversity by the acquisition of a variety of binding partners, thereby forming a large number of zzso zzso interacting with protein zzso 1 zzso often bind via a so-called zzso motif to regulate its zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we systematically determined structural elements that mediate the binding specificity of zzso interacting zzso and propose a refined consensus sequence for zzso zzso zzso zzso this pattern to database searches, we predicted and zzso confirmed several previously unknown zzso zzso Thus, the suggested zzso zzso motif enables a highly specific prediction of zzso binding partners, thereby zzso the zzso identification of zzso zzso
