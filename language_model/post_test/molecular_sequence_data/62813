zzso zzso zzso is a dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso synthesis in the developing zzso The zzso kernels have an zzso starchy zzso zzso zzso protein bodies, and highly increased levels of binding protein and other zzso proteins in the zzso zzso revealed a novel zzso protein in zzso that zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso maps in a cluster of zzso zzso zzso we characterized zzso clones zzso these proteins from a developing zzso zzso This led to the identification of a zzso zzso zzso in which zzso replaces zzso at the 15th position of the signal zzso Although the corresponding gene does not appear to be highly expressed in zzso it was found to be tightly linked with the zzso zzso in a segregating zzso zzso Furthermore, when the protein was zzso in zzso cells, the signal zzso appeared to be less efficiently processed than when zzso replaced zzso To test whether this gene is responsible for the zzso zzso transgenic zzso plants expressing this sequence were zzso zzso seeds originating from the zzso zzso an opaque kernel zzso with enhanced levels of binding protein in the zzso similar to zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso causes a defective signal zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
