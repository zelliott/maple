The zzso sequence of the complete zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined in this zzso The zzso is zzso base pairs zzso in zzso and codes for 22 zzso 13 zzso zzso 2 zzso as well as a control region zzso as is characteristic for zzso zzso of other zzso The gene order zzso to that of other zzso zzso but the arrangement of some zzso genes differs from other zzso It shows that the gene order of zzso is remarkably zzso In this study, the relationships among zzso were examined in the zzso analysis based on the control zzso regions of 17 zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso joins the false zzso zzso zzso on a common branch, and then constitutes a sister group to traditional zzso Thus, the result supports that zzso zzso belongs to zzso The analyses also suggest that the African zzso zzso zzso zzso can be treated as an isolated zzso and constitutes a sister group to zzso
