The zzso gene from the model zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated both in response to zzso zzso zzso factors and throughout infection of root zzso by the zzso zzso To identify the regulatory sequences involved in zzso zzso zzso a series of promoter deletions driving the zzso reporter gene were analyzed in transgenic zzso zzso zzso These studies have revealed that distinct regulatory regions are involved in zzso zzso expression compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, the zzso promoter sequence immediately upstream from the start zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso but is unable to drive gene zzso in response to the zzso factor zzso This truncated promoter is also sufficient to zzso zzso expression during both the zzso zzso zzso association and the zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso further showed that a previously identified zzso zzso motif is required for high-level zzso expression during zzso zzso infection as well as during AM zzso However, zzso of this motif does not affect gene expression associated with zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest a close link between regulatory mechanisms controlling zzso early zzso gene zzso during both zzso and AM root zzso
