A strategy of zzso zzso a major agent of dental zzso to survive and colonize the host consists of the production of a protein that suppresses the specific zzso zzso We have cloned the gene coding for a protein with zzso zzso It contains an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso with 434 zzso acid zzso and a molecular mass of zzso zzso The gene product is zzso to zzso from several zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso protein and zzso in a zzso zzso active zzso zzso of mice with the zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses a primary immune response against zzso dependent zzso This zzso effect is specific to the zzso used in the zzso as it is not observed when the immune response against other zzso is zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates an early production of zzso an zzso zzso and not the zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso acts in the suppression of the specific host immune response against zzso zzso zzso
