In spite of its short zzso chain, the pancreatic zzso zzso consists of a zzso II type zzso and zzso To understand the stability and formation of the zzso region, we prepared some zzso fragments including the zzso segment of chicken pancreatic zzso and studied their zzso by circular zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of chicken pancreatic zzso showed a CD spectrum characteristic of the zzso at pH zzso and at zzso zzso as low as 1 zzso zzso was able to form a zzso zzso only at high zzso zzso and not at zzso lower than 10 zzso However, zzso zzso (in which the zzso group is zzso so that no positive charge exists at the N zzso was able to form the zzso zzso at pH zzso and at the zzso zzso where zzso could zzso zzso zzso (in which the zzso group is zzso to introduce a negative zzso was also able to form the zzso zzso The CD zzso of zzso and zzso were not characteristic of the zzso zzso at all the pH values and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has no charge at the N zzso did not form the zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso which has a negative charge at the zzso end, did form the zzso at pH zzso These findings indicate that the presence of the negative charge of zzso at the zzso region of a zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
