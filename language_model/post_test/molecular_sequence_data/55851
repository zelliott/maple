We propose a multiple alignment of the sequence of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso regions are predicted for those sequences corresponding to important regions of the zzso and the zzso binding zzso defined from the known three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso namely the zzso binding site zzso D to beta zzso and the beta zzso B region containing the typical zzso pattern of the zzso binding site, the zzso zzso acid pair and an zzso probably involved in the interaction with the zzso group of the zzso
