There exist about zzso internal zzso sequences per zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso All these zzso repeats are contained in a very zzso zzso This element consists of two 2 zzso direct repeats zzso a zzso zzso zzso Immediately adjacent to one of the repeats a zzso zzso zzso sequence is zzso zzso zzso to zzso DNA follow 180 zzso downstream of the zzso These zzso zzso sequences are flanked by the second direct zzso The possible origin and function of these zzso containing elements is zzso
