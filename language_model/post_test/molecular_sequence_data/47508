zzso the zzso zzso zzso of human mast cells, have recently been implicated as zzso in the zzso of allergic and inflammatory conditions, most notably zzso Their distinguishing features, their activity as a zzso zzso and resistance to most zzso zzso are perfectly explained by the zzso crystal structure of human zzso in complex with zzso zzso The zzso consists of four zzso zzso arranged in a flat zzso zzso The active centers are directed toward a central pore whose narrow openings of approximately 40 A zzso 15 A govern the interaction with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso exhibits the overall fold of zzso zzso zzso but differs considerably in the zzso of six surface zzso arranged around the active zzso These zzso border and shape the active site zzso to a large extent and form all contacts with neighboring zzso via two distinct zzso The smaller of these zzso which is exclusively zzso can be stabilized by the binding of zzso chains to zzso patches of positively charged zzso on adjacent zzso or, zzso by high salt zzso in zzso On zzso zzso the zzso are likely to undergo transformation into a zzso zzso that is favored and stabilized by zzso zzso The structure thus provides an improved understanding of the unique properties of the biologically active zzso zzso in solution and will be an incentive for the rational design of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
