zzso zzso zzso belong to a large gene zzso The zzso role of zzso proteins has been zzso investigated in higher plants, whereas that of zzso proteins is so far zzso All three known zzso zzso from potato zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and their zzso levels not only follow a zzso rhythm, but also zzso in constant zzso Here, we examined the zzso effects of transgenic potato plants on zzso interference zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso plants includes early zzso higher zzso production, and reduced sensitivity toward light enriched in zzso wavelength zzso in canopy zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso production of the strict zzso potato zzso zzso even under zzso zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso and zzso zzso from leaves of transgenic plants are modified in zzso plants, leading to modified zzso levels in sink zzso zzso expression of zzso plants is induced by zzso and zzso and external supply of zzso acid leads to even more pronounced differences between zzso and zzso plants regarding zzso yield and zzso zzso indicating a zzso regulation of zzso and zzso
