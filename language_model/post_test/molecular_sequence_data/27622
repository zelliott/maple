zzso coli zzso zzso labeled with zzso at zzso of the zzso was isolated from the S zzso zzso zzso grown on a minimal medium supplemented with zzso zzso multiple quantum filtered and zzso chemical shift correlated zzso gave zzso for the zzso zzso zzso units whose zzso were exchanging slowly with zzso zzso with zzso shifts at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assigned to zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso typical of zzso pairs in a zzso environment at the end of a zzso were zzso zzso zzso signals were also found at zzso and zzso zzso where zzso units in normal zzso pairs zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso were too weak, presumably because of exchange with water, to give zzso in chemical shift correlated zzso zzso chemical shifts suggest that the resonance at zzso zzso represents a zzso zzso pair, while the resonance at zzso zzso is typical of a zzso interaction between U and a tightly bound water or a zzso zzso The zzso data are consistent with proposed secondary structures for zzso zzso
