Two fundamental approaches for the zzso of zzso devices to zzso mass zzso zzso have been developed and zzso The zzso designed for zzso zzso were constructed from glass by standard zzso chemical zzso zzso Both approaches integrated sample inlet ports, zzso sample zzso the separation channel, and a port for zzso zzso In one design, a zzso reusable zzso was coupled to an external zzso zzso interface using a liquid junction and a fused zzso transfer zzso The transfer zzso allowed the use of an independent zzso interface as well as fiber zzso zzso zzso In the second design, a zzso zzso zzso was zzso as an integral part of the zzso resulting in a very simple zzso The zzso zzso zzso provided control of the flow of the zzso liquid and minimized the dead volume associated with zzso formation at the zzso exit zzso Thus, the zzso zzso for a zzso zzso instrument and an zzso zzso two independent zzso This type of zzso is simple to zzso and may thus be developed either as a part of a reusable system or as a zzso zzso Both devices were tested on zzso zzso of zzso peptides and a zzso c zzso zzso Several zzso systems including a transient zzso zzso step were tested for separation and analysis by an zzso trap mass zzso
