A synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the 32 zzso acid zzso transit sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso required for zzso through the envelope of the zzso has been characterized structurally using CD and zzso under the same experimental conditions as used previously for the 32 zzso acid zzso of zzso from the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is found to undergo a zzso transition in zzso zzso characterized by three turns of zzso zzso in the zzso region preceded by a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Compared with the zzso transit zzso the zzso and coiled zzso are arranged in the reverse order along the zzso zzso but the positively charged groups are distributed zzso as well as the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso It is proposed that such zzso or zzso zzso occasionally zzso could be an intrinsic structural feature of zzso transit zzso adapted to the proper zzso and possibly to each zzso zzso zzso This feature may distinguish zzso transit sequences from the other zzso peptides in the zzso green zzso zzso zzso particularly the zzso transit zzso
