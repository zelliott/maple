zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso The ability of zzso zzso a structural analog of the major zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso was tested in the zzso zzso of zzso carried on an zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced at position zzso of duplex zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso into a zzso containing an zzso gap in the zzso between the zzso and zzso restriction sites and zzso in place of zzso in the zzso zzso proceeded with zzso efficiency, and closed circular duplex DNA molecules were isolated in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso by zzso but resistant to zzso by zzso Transformation of zzso coli strain zzso with zzso zzso led to zzso reduced survival relative to zzso zzso and produced zzso zzso in zzso of the progeny zzso All of the zzso were zzso and zzso occurred by deletion of zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso lower zzso frequency, and all the zzso were zzso deletions at the sites of zzso of the zzso These results illustrate that zzso a structural analog of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and that zzso nicks are efficient zzso zzso in this zzso zzso
