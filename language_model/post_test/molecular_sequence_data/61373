The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family in human is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and a variety of regulatory phenomena associated with development, zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the zzso sequence for a sixth member of this family, zzso The zzso sequence predicts a zzso protein that includes the characteristic active site motif of a zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the other zzso previously identified as crucial for zzso binding and zzso The zzso protein sequence is only zzso identical to the five previously reported human zzso zzso and is similarly related to zzso and primitive zzso zzso zzso Compared to typical proteins of this family such as zzso and zzso zzso has three additional zzso located in the zzso loop, and a zzso extension at the zzso Using radiation hybrid zzso the zzso gene was localized to zzso zzso The zzso transcript of zzso is expressed at a moderately low level in many human zzso and is most abundant in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also cloned and zzso for rat and zzso The sequence of the first zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso is zzso identical to the deduced human zzso zzso
