zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso factors, are key components in zzso A signaling and the zzso zzso Here, we use zzso zzso sequencing zzso to identify zzso and zzso zzso direct target genes in darkness zzso and zzso zzso light conditions, respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to promoters through the zzso binding motif zzso Interestingly, zzso also binds to two motifs in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso data indicates that zzso quickly regulates the expression of 197 and 86 genes in D and zzso zzso zzso also zzso a number of common target genes with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we uncover a role for zzso in controlling zzso development by directly zzso the expression of zzso AND zzso OF zzso whose product is a structural component of the latter stages of zzso division in zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso regulates multiple zzso of plant development, thus providing insights into its functions beyond light and zzso zzso
