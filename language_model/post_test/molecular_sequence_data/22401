zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso protein that functions as a negative regulator in zzso A zzso light zzso zzso proteins are components of zzso zzso zzso complexes that target proteins for degradation in the zzso Here we present further characterization of zzso at the expression level, and show that it regulates zzso in zzso zzso leaf development and zzso Data on transcript expression patterns indicate that zzso is expressed during all stages of zzso development and exhibits no light zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is localized to the nucleus, where it can form zzso under continuous zzso light that resemble zzso To characterize the composition and formation of zzso complexes further, we used zzso and bridge zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso interacts specifically with several zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso to form stable zzso and zzso zzso Our results support a zzso association process in which the zzso protein binds first to the ASK zzso forming a unit which then associates with the zzso core of the zzso zzso Finally, our data indicate that the zzso target interaction domain is composed of two independent zzso
