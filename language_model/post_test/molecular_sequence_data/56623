Using zzso zzso sequences containing the zzso locus involved in zzso zzso zzso were cloned form the library of human genes in the zzso 4A zzso The zzso clone zzso zzso zzso obtained contained zzso zzso but the 3' region of the zzso locus in zzso zzso zzso clone was strongly zzso zzso of a zzso of the altered region and zzso zzso analysis using it as a DNA probe revealed zzso in the 3' region of the zzso locus in clone zzso zzso zzso which resulted in zzso of unknown sequences into the zzso A modified system is suggested for zzso 22 zzso identification using restriction analysis of zzso DNA with four restriction zzso and one zzso zzso
