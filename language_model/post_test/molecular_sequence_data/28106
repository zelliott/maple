zzso is a small zzso protein normally found only in zzso zzso such as the zzso but whose presence in a variety of tumors has been zzso We have isolated the zzso gene from a Buffalo rat zzso zzso The rat gene is approximately zzso bases in length and consists of five zzso and four zzso The zzso interrupt the coding sequence of zzso in positions identical with those previously reported for the zzso zzso indicating that the two genes are derived from a common zzso Analysis of the promoter sequence of the zzso gene revealed that the gene is under the control of a solo long terminal repeat element related to zzso zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso This represents a unique example of a zzso gene transcribed in normal and tumor cells, from a promoter of viral zzso
