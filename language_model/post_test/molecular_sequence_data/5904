zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso It zzso zzso zzso a commonly used dairy starter zzso zzso sequence data analysis indicated that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains 54 open reading frames zzso of 30 or more zzso zzso with three large zzso zzso The zzso sequence of several of the zzso zzso demonstrated significant levels of identity to genes (many zzso proteins of unknown zzso in other zzso zzso of both small zzso and zzso zzso Based on this identity and predicted zzso structures, zzso genes for the zzso major structural protein and DNA zzso have been zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso and zzso were also identified, zzso into an zzso coli expression zzso and their function demonstrated in zzso The zzso origin of replication was located by identifying zzso DNA fragments able to support the maintenance in zzso zzso of a zzso lacking a functional zzso zzso The minimal zzso zzso replication origin function contained a number of direct repeats and 179 zzso of zzso Although no similarity between zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso or zzso acid sequence level was observed, an alignment of the zzso late region zzso with the zzso structural and packaging genes revealed a striking correspondence in both zzso length and zzso point of the zzso zzso It is proposed that this correspondence is indicative of a strong conservation in gene order within these otherwise unrelated zzso zzso that can be used to predict the functions of the zzso gene zzso
