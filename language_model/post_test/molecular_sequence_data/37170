zzso rescue, the restoration of gene function by replacement of a defective gene with a normal one by zzso has been zzso to produce novel zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso clones containing zzso terminal repeats, an intact rep zzso and a zzso cap zzso served as the template for marker zzso When zzso alone in zzso cells, these zzso zzso plasmids produced zzso zzso zzso that could not bind zzso zzso after infection with zzso zzso helper zzso However, the zzso in the cap gene was corrected after zzso with zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso DNA fragments, resulting in the production of zzso zzso zzso The cap genes from several independent marker rescue experiments were zzso zzso zzso and then zzso zzso results confirmed not only that zzso zzso occurred but, more importantly, that a mixed population of zzso zzso carrying 16 to 2,200 zzso throughout different regions of the type 3 cap gene were generated in a single marker rescue zzso A zzso correlation was observed between zzso and the ability of the zzso virus to bind zzso zzso In addition, many of the zzso zzso examined exhibited differences at both the zzso and zzso acid levels, suggesting that these zzso may also exhibit unique infectious zzso Furthermore, zzso helper plasmids containing these zzso cap genes were able to function in the triple zzso method to generate zzso zzso Together, the results suggest that DNA from other zzso zzso can rescue zzso zzso zzso and that marker rescue may be a powerful, yet simple, technique to map, as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso that display different zzso zzso
