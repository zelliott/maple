An zzso zzso membrane protein was identified by a zzso zzso zzso raised against an zzso zzso of human zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was found to be zzso in both innate and acquired zzso tumor zzso A complementary DNA zzso clone coding for the zzso zzso protein was isolated by mixed zzso zzso chain reaction and further screening of a zzso library from zzso zzso acid and zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso protein revealed that this protein is identical with zzso a cell surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso We constructed an expression zzso utilizing two different zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso for the zzso zzso protein that have different zzso DNA zzso experiments were carried out by the calcium zzso method with a zzso marker using zzso human tumor lines zzso and zzso as recipient zzso We obtained zzso clones expressing the zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso but found no resistance against zzso or zzso zzso selection with zzso or zzso or tumor cells zzso with the zzso zzso expression zzso also failed to yield drug-resistant zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso cannot zzso drug resistance by itself, even though the protein can be an effective marker for zzso zzso
