The major zzso complex B zzso zzso region in a standard zzso of zzso chickens contains two closely linked class I zzso zzso and zzso Few sequences of zzso zzso are available, and therefore zzso of the two zzso have not been compared with regard to sequence diversity or locus zzso Here, we report eight new zzso alpha zzso zzso sequences from broiler chicken zzso B zzso and a unique zzso between the two zzso zzso The new sequences were combined with existing zzso sequences from zzso and broiler zzso for zzso On the basis of zzso analysis and zzso sequence zzso zzso sequences separated into two groups zzso A and B), corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Every broiler zzso had one zzso sequence in Group A and the second zzso zzso if it existed, clustered in Group zzso Group B zzso zzso zzso sequences identified in broiler zzso resembled the human zzso class I zzso locus in their distinctive pattern of zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso were less zzso and possessed a zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso but nevertheless demonstrated evidence of diversifying zzso One zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso sequence was completely zzso in four different broiler zzso but each zzso differed in the zzso zzso the alpha 3 zzso
