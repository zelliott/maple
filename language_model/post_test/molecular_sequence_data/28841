zzso T cells escape deletion in the zzso and are found in the peripheral zzso Because zzso zzso cells zzso are potent zzso of zzso T cells, these cells could theoretically activate zzso T cells leading to zzso We investigated whether zzso could induce the zzso disease experimental zzso zzso zzso Our results show that transfer of zzso presenting a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso mice induced zzso zzso days zzso zzso T cells of the zzso zzso were present in the zzso zzso and zzso of mice that received live zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso presenting zzso could induce neither clinical signs of zzso nor a measurable zzso response in zzso These data show that live zzso presenting a zzso can induce the zzso zzso disorder zzso in a zzso zzso zzso this new zzso model could be used as a more clinically relevant model for the human disease multiple zzso These findings could also have implications for the use of DC zzso in a clinical zzso
