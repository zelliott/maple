The insulin zzso plays a critical role in the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso of this key function must be under stringent zzso In order to study the regulation of insulin zzso gene zzso we have zzso zzso and characterized its zzso The first zzso of the insulin zzso gene is embedded in an unusual segment of DNA composed of zzso zzso The promoter has the characteristics typical of a zzso zzso It is zzso and has multiple start sites of zzso A zzso base pair zzso immediately upstream of the translation initiation site contains promoter activity when zzso into zzso cell zzso zzso analysis was performed to study promoter zzso These studies showed that only 150 base pairs of promoter sequence were necessary for promoter zzso This region contains three potential binding sites for the zzso factor, zzso and a zzso box zzso Furthermore, the zzso functions equally well in either zzso We have defined an element in this region with zzso function for both its zzso and a zzso zzso In addition, this region seems to contribute some degree of tissue specificity to insulin zzso gene zzso
