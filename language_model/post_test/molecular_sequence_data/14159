We developed and characterized nuclear zzso markers for zzso zzso a tropical tree species widely distributed in South zzso 

Leaf samples of mature zzso zzso trees, popularly called zzso were collected from an area that is greatly impacted by agricultural practices in the region of zzso zzso in zzso Paulo State in zzso zzso Twenty simple sequence repeat zzso markers were developed, 14 of which had zzso zzso A total of 96 zzso were detected with an average of zzso zzso per zzso zzso The expected zzso calculated at zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso Finally, we demonstrated that 18 zzso were zzso in zzso zzso 

A total of 14 zzso markers suggest a high potential for genetic diversity, gene flow, and mating system analyses in zzso zzso
