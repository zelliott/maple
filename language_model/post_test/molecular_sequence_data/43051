A reverse zzso zzso was employed to amplify an internal portion of zzso growth factor I zzso I) and zzso II zzso from the zzso of juvenile rainbow trout zzso zzso in an effort to detect zzso to the multiple size forms of zzso zzso known to exist in zzso After cloning and sequencing the zzso products, 4 zzso size forms of trout zzso I zzso and 1 form of zzso II zzso were zzso The full zzso zzso sequence of 1 form of zzso I zzso and zzso II zzso have been previously zzso the full zzso zzso sequence of a second form of zzso I zzso and zzso zzso sequences of the 2 additional zzso I zzso forms are reported zzso We define the 4 forms of zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as having zzso zzso lengths of 35, 47, 62, and 74 predicted zzso acid zzso zzso zzso protection zzso were used to zzso the zzso levels of each of the 5 zzso in 8 zzso of both juvenile and adult trout, as well as in zzso and zzso of adult zzso The zzso zzso levels, zzso with zzso zzso levels, suggest zzso at least 1 form of zzso I and zzso II zzso are present at both zzso stages in all zzso zzso zzso all 5 zzso zzso forms are present at their highest levels in the liver zzso zzso zzso and zzso adults have significantly higher zzso zzso levels than juveniles in the liver zzso zzso zzso
