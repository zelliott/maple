The product of the Toll gene is a membrane protein required for the formation of zzso polarity during early zzso in zzso zzso It acts together with the other zzso group gene products to specify a nuclear zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso stage zzso Here we report the presence in Toll protein of additional sequences held in common with the human membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that these sequences in Toll form zzso linked zzso zzso that are important for the binding of zzso in the zzso space of the zzso In addition, we show that expression of Toll protein induced in a zzso cell line promotes cellular zzso a property held in common with the related zzso zzso zzso Toll protein in such zzso accumulates at sites of zzso interaction, a characteristic displayed by other cellular zzso zzso Taken together these findings suggest that the zzso function of Toll protein is more closely analogous to that of zzso than previously zzso
