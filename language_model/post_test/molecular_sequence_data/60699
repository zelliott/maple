zzso and zzso are integral membrane proteins and are essential for the rotation of the zzso polar zzso motor of zzso zzso On the basis of their similarity to zzso and zzso which are the zzso components of the zzso zzso they are thought to form the zzso complex and to be essential for zzso zzso in the zzso To investigate zzso function, random zzso of the zzso gene by using zzso was carried zzso We isolated 37 zzso zzso zzso independent zzso and most of the zzso were zzso these zzso zzso are able to inhibit the zzso of zzso cells when greatly zzso The zzso zzso proteins could be detected by zzso except for those with deletions or zzso Many of the dominant zzso were mapped to the putative third or fourth zzso zzso which are the most zzso zzso Some zzso that showed strong dominance were in highly zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of a polar zzso located in a zzso segment that might be involved in zzso zzso zzso occurred in a zzso that is thought to mediate zzso changes essential for zzso generation in zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso have very similar structures and roles, and the basic mechanism for zzso generation will be similar in the zzso and sodium zzso
