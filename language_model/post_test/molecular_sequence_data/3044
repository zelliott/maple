An zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso For determination of the zzso sequence zzso with highest affinity by zzso zzso a zzso approach was applied using the zzso technique excluding zzso zzso binding of libraries was most profound when zzso was at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso library was conducted by zzso acid analysis and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso zzso Control libraries were prepared by mixing 19 individual peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso of 6, 10 and 19 zzso were zzso and compared with the zzso zzso zzso was able to detect only partially the components in the 6- and zzso zzso but failed to zzso a more complex zzso zzso In contrast, zzso resolved all zzso of higher complexity and provided direct identification at zzso resolution, such as for a zzso library containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso m zzso zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso is a powerful tool for zzso of zzso zzso libraries of higher zzso
