zzso of gene expression through zzso control is common in many zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso resulting in zzso changes in zzso acid zzso The zzso leader of the zzso zzso harbors several upstream open reading frames zzso of which the second zzso is well zzso among zzso zzso zzso The zzso element encodes a zzso control zzso zzso of 28 zzso that is sufficient for imposing zzso repression of translation zzso on a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso suggests that it functions as an zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso zzso translation in response to high zzso levels by zzso the zzso on the zzso The zzso zzso zzso contexts of zzso zzso allow inefficient zzso initiation of the zzso resulting in translation initiation of the scanning zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso main zzso The results presented show that zzso signaling mediates differential translation of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso
