Using zzso DNA methods, seven zzso zzso were produced by cassette zzso of a chicken egg white zzso zzso which already contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Met zzso When characterized by structural and functional studies, they were all found to zzso zzso in the first hairpin loop, the so-called zzso region, which is highly zzso within the zzso zzso and thought to be important for its zzso activity towards zzso zzso They were zzso to more than zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and zzso zzso model building of the zzso and their complexes with zzso was performed using computer graphics based on the zzso coordinates of chicken egg white zzso and the zzso zzso Only minor zzso changes were required for zzso the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and rate zzso of complex formation of the zzso with zzso zzso as well as zzso B and L were determined by kinetic zzso using zzso zzso The single exchanges zzso zzso zzso zzso and the double exchanges zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso B significantly by zzso With the exception of the zzso zzso the differences in the Ki values are mainly due to larger k off values, whereas the zzso values seem to be more or less unaffected by the selected zzso The effect on the zzso of zzso is generally smaller than the effects on zzso and zzso B zzso zzso L zzso is zzso insensitive to all zzso These distinct effects of the inhibitor zzso indicate differences in zzso interactions between closely related zzso zzso In addition, the results verify the zzso made earlier from sequence alignment studies and from a zzso model of the chicken zzso complex, that the first hairpin loop of zzso is essential for effective zzso
