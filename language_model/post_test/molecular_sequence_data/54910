zzso zzso is required for zzso induction of zzso zzso junction zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously hypothesized that zzso is zzso from the zzso terminal to reside in the synaptic zzso where it binds zzso to organize the heavily zzso zzso zzso required for zzso signaling between zzso and zzso In this study, we test this hypothesis with zzso zzso analyses of predicted signal zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso by introducing deletion and zzso transgenic zzso into zzso zzso zzso We show that the SP is required for zzso zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso We further show that the zzso is required to restrict zzso diffusion in the zzso zzso and for zzso zzso However, zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso during zzso not the zzso zzso zzso zzso of reduced zzso as predicted by our hypothesis, suggesting that proper synaptic zzso of zzso limits zzso zzso In further testing zzso requirements, we show that zzso binds zzso zzso in a zzso manner, and thereby binds zzso zzso but that these zzso interactions do not require the zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso has both positive and negative binding interactions with zzso in the zzso synaptic domain, which both facilitate and limit zzso zzso during zzso embryonic zzso
