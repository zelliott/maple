zzso proteins are members of a family of small proteins that are widespread in zzso and found associated with zzso zzso To date, to our knowledge, only zzso zzso gene has been studied functionally in zzso In this study, 42 zzso genes are identified through comprehensive analysis in zzso And a complete overview of this gene family is zzso including the gene structures, zzso zzso locations, selection pressure and zzso The results reveal that gene zzso contributes to the expansion of the zzso gene family in zzso zzso diverse expression patterns suggest their functional differentiation and divergence analysis indicates zzso selection as a key role in zzso Our comparative zzso analysis of zzso genes will provide the first step towards the future experimental research on determining the functions of these zzso
