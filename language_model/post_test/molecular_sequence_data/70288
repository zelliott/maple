zzso receptors have been characterized in a cell line recently isolated from a chicken zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso cells or zzso displayed the expected criteria for insulin zzso zzso temperature dependency, zzso of zzso plot, rank order of potency for insulin zzso and insulin induced zzso The zzso of zzso cell insulin receptors exhibited a normal size of 135 zzso Following zzso zzso zzso receptors revealed a 95 zzso zzso and a 72 zzso protein zzso Both proteins were zzso in a zzso zzso (and zzso growth factor 1; zzso and zzso manner, and were zzso by zzso and two zzso zzso zzso The 72 zzso protein was not present under zzso condition PAGE or in normal chicken zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is either a truncated form of the insulin zzso zzso specific to zzso cells or a degradation zzso zzso insulin receptors from zzso cells or chicken liver zzso exhibited similar zzso zzso activity, using artificial zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso acid zzso by zzso cells was insulin zzso
