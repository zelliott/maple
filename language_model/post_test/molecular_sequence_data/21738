zzso genetic engineering of human zzso cells is a prerequisite for exploiting their full zzso Such genetic zzso can be achieved using zzso zzso Here we engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for five distinct zzso zzso At all zzso tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell zzso and induced zzso stem cell zzso clones carrying transgenic zzso solely at the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso employing the specific zzso described here mediate zzso zzso modification in human zzso cells with similar efficiency and precision as do zzso zzso zzso
