Members of the zzso family of zzso related to zzso zzso converting zzso zzso play important roles in regulating a number of zzso zzso As more zzso zzso are zzso there is increasing evidence of a variety of zzso zzso zzso even within a single zzso The function of these zzso proteins is largely zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has revealed a number of zzso genes but probable errors in the zzso zzso have left the number of zzso zzso and their structure, zzso 

zzso and sequence analysis of zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso contains nine genes zzso zzso which code for proteins with similarity to zzso zzso Eight of these genes code for putative single domain zzso similar to other insect zzso described so zzso zzso however, has several features in common with zzso zzso zzso such as a two domain structure and a zzso C zzso Four of the zzso genes zzso 3, 7 and 9) were shown to be expressed at a variety of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is induced by a blood zzso with zzso showing the largest zzso zzso zzso 

Genes coding for zzso zzso have arisen several times during the course of evolution suggesting a common selective advantage to having an zzso with two zzso in tandem in a single zzso zzso belongs to a zzso of insect zzso which are likely to be zzso and which have an unusual, zzso gene zzso
