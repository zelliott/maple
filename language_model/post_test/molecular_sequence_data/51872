We report the isolation and characterization of a zzso set of zzso zzso distributed throughout the single zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso were systematically targeted to the surface of the protein by identifying clusters of 2 or more charged zzso in the primary zzso every charged zzso in a cluster was replaced with zzso zzso were recovered in high yield zzso of 36 zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined in zzso zzso 11 were zzso zzso 16 zzso (including zzso and zzso and 7 had no discernible zzso zzso analysis suggested that the two zzso constructed but not recovered in zzso may have a dominant defective zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on the three-dimensional structure of the rabbit muscle zzso zzso confirmed that most zzso of the charged zzso we altered lie at or near the surface of the zzso confirming a key assumption of the zzso Many of the new zzso zzso have properties readily interpreted in light of the zzso structure and should prove useful in both genetic and zzso studies of zzso zzso
