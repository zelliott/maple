Wood is the most abundant biological resource on earth and it is also an important raw material for a major global industry with rapidly increasing zzso The zzso zzso includes the most widely used tree species for industrial zzso mainly for making pulp and zzso With the aim of identifying major genes involved in wood formation in zzso , we have developed a targeted approach of functional zzso based on the isolation of zzso zzso expressed genes by zzso zzso zzso profiling using zzso zzso and analysis of zzso zzso were used to identify zzso expressed zzso between secondary zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed to confirm the differential expression of representative zzso Of 224 independent zzso sequences zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso One-third of the zzso exhibiting zzso with proteins of known function fell into two main classes highlighting the importance of the zzso zzso through zzso zzso on one hand, and of the zzso involved in cell wall zzso and zzso on the zzso The functions of the genes represented by the remaining zzso of zzso should be of great interest for future zzso This systematic analysis of genes involved in wood formation in zzso provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in secondary zzso differentiation as well as new zzso for wood quality zzso
