zzso zzso recognizes zzso gamma and zzso chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso but does not require the zzso zzso sequence zzso for binding to zzso We have localized the zzso binding sites in zzso using zzso synthetic zzso We found that two peptides zzso and zzso block the zzso binding to zzso or zzso block the zzso zzso zzso and induce the zzso binding site 2 zzso zzso in zzso Neither zzso affects zzso binding to zzso zzso or zzso peptides were not zzso These results suggest that the two zzso peptides directly interact with zzso and specifically block zzso or zzso zzso The two sequences are located next to each other in the zzso crystal structure, although they are separate in the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are exposed to the zzso This suggests that the two sequences are part of zzso binding sites in zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso C zzso zzso domain specifically binds to zzso zzso a zzso zzso from this domain that includes the sequence corresponding to zzso zzso specifically binds to zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso C zzso zzso interact with zzso in a similar zzso
