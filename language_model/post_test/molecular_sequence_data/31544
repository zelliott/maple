zzso zzso zzso zzso provide an alternative approach to gene zzso zzso combine the simplicity and favorable zzso of zzso zzso with robust zzso through zzso interference zzso Previous studies reported potent and zzso zzso of human zzso expression by zzso that target the expanded zzso repeats within the zzso zzso zzso zzso the genetic cause of zzso zzso also contains an expanded zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso are zzso zzso of zzso expression and then redesign zzso to zzso their zzso We find that both zzso and zzso mechanisms affect gene expression by either blocking translation or affecting alternative zzso These results have four broad zzso zzso zzso will not always behave similarly to analogous zzso zzso zzso the sequences surrounding zzso repeats affect zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso can function through multiple mechanisms zzso and zzso it is possible to use chemical modification to zzso zzso properties and improve their potential for drug zzso
