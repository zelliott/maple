It has been suggested that ethanol metabolism in the strict zzso zzso zzso occurs within a zzso a zzso zzso bacterial zzso Two bacterial zzso shell proteins zzso zzso zzso shell protein zzso and zzso are found zzso on the zzso clustered with the genes for ethanol zzso The function of the bacterial zzso is to facilitate zzso by zzso the zzso zzso and zzso Recent structural studies of bacterial zzso proteins have revealed both zzso and zzso that assemble to generate the zzso bacterial zzso zzso Some of these shell proteins have pores on their symmetry zzso Here we report the structure of the zzso bacterial zzso protein zzso which has a tandem structural repeat within the zzso and zzso zzso The pores in the zzso zzso are within the zzso rather than between symmetry related zzso We suggest that the evolutionary advantage of this is that it releases the pore from the zzso symmetry constraint allowing more precise control of the zzso of zzso zzso such as ethanol, across the zzso We also model zzso and demonstrate that the two proteins have the potential to interact to generate the zzso for a zzso
