Human T cell protein zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso the first of the protein zzso zzso family to be zzso Alternative zzso zzso results in variation in the sequence at the extreme C zzso of zzso and generates a zzso form zzso that is targeted to the nucleus and a zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso of the zzso zzso In this report, we assessed the role of the zzso zzso segment of zzso in regulating activity, concentrating primarily on the zzso zzso We have demonstrated that limited zzso zzso of zzso releases first a zzso fragment, then a zzso zzso zzso Using reduced zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso the zzso domain displays zzso more activity than the full-length zzso Analysis of the time course of limited zzso revealed that zzso zzso occurred following zzso of a zzso region zzso zzso located at the C zzso of zzso The activity of zzso zzso illustrated that removal of 20 zzso zzso was sufficient to activate the zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain, but not the full-length zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner by addition of the zzso zzso segment of zzso A zzso zzso to zzso zzso which recognizes an zzso located between zzso 350 and zzso was capable of fully zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso segment of zzso contains an zzso site that zzso activity via a zzso zzso interaction with the zzso zzso These studies suggest that the zzso zzso segment of zzso and possibly zzso may not only direct the zzso to different zzso locations but may also zzso activity in response to the binding of regulatory proteins and/or zzso zzso
