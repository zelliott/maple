zzso comprise the largest species composition in the entire animal kingdom and possess a vast undiscovered genetic diversity and gene pool that can be better explored using molecular marker zzso Current trends of application of DNA marker techniques in diverse zzso of insect ecological studies show that zzso DNA zzso zzso random amplified zzso DNA zzso expressed sequence tags zzso and amplified zzso length zzso zzso markers have contributed significantly for zzso towards understanding genetic basis of insect diversity and for mapping medically and zzso important genes and quantitative trait zzso in insect zzso Apart from these popular marker systems, other novel approaches including zzso display, zzso amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso markers have been identified as alternate marker systems in insect zzso Besides, whole zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso are becoming more popular to screen zzso zzso in fast and cost effective zzso However, use of such zzso has not gained widespread popularity in entomological zzso The current study highlights the recent trends of applications of molecular markers in insect studies and explores the technological zzso in molecular marker tools and modern high zzso zzso zzso that may be applied in entomological researches for better understanding of insect ecology at molecular zzso
