Central to the zzso selection theory is the zzso that a single B cell expresses a single zzso with a single zzso Previously, based on our work in zzso transgenic mouse models, we suggested that B cells escaped zzso deletion by zzso of more than one zzso on their cell zzso We argued that zzso zzso was necessary zzso zzso the expressed zzso zzso is essential for immune protection against pathogens and zzso this protective zzso is zzso and would be zzso deleted, leaving a hole in the B cell zzso Here, we demonstrate that dual zzso expressing B cells arise during the normal zzso of B cells in the bone zzso and populate both the zzso and zzso cavity of zzso zzso Furthermore, single cell analysis of the expressed zzso light chains suggests that zzso editing may play a role in the generation of a significant fraction of dual zzso expressing B zzso
