zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso zzso of all major lineages of land zzso The ubiquity of these cryptic zzso is clear, but the scale of their diversity, host range, and geographic zzso are zzso To explore the putative zzso of tropical leaf zzso we compared zzso communities along a broad zzso zzso from the Canadian arctic to the zzso tropical forest of central zzso Here, we use molecular sequence data from zzso zzso strains to show that zzso increase in zzso diversity, and host breadth from arctic to tropical zzso zzso communities from higher latitudes are characterized by relatively few species from many different classes of zzso whereas tropical zzso zzso are dominated by a small number of classes with a very large number of zzso zzso The most easily cultivated zzso from tropical plants have wide host zzso but communities are dominated by a large number of rare species whose host range is zzso Even when only the most easily cultured species are considered, leaves of tropical trees represent hotspots of zzso species diversity, containing numerous species not yet recovered from other zzso The challenge remains to recover and identify those elusive and rarely cultured zzso with zzso host zzso and to zzso the ecological roles of these little-known zzso in tropical zzso
