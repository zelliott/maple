Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso zzso present zzso in all normal zzso but often deleted in many types of zzso The gene for this zzso maps to zzso 9 at band zzso where the zzso zzso inhibitor genes for zzso and zzso also zzso During our efforts to clone this gene we also isolated a zzso clone containing a processed zzso of zzso The sequence is zzso zzso to the zzso zzso is flanked at its 3' end by a repetitive element, but does not possess a zzso zzso We localized this processed zzso to band 28 on the long arm of zzso 3 by zzso in zzso zzso All 22 zzso cell lines with deletions at zzso screened possessed the zzso
