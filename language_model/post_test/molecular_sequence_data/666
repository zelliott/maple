We explored zzso zzso requirements in addition to the motif zzso using synthetic fluorescent resonance energy transfer zzso zzso These zzso were derived from zzso zzso sites in viral coat zzso and human and bacterial protein zzso The zzso by zzso of most zzso was activated by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of the zzso series were zzso The analysis of zzso zzso activity showed that its efficiency is highly dependent on the particular combinations of zzso acids at different zzso zzso There is a clear zzso of zzso zzso that must be taken in account in determining its specificity and also for the design of zzso However, clear preferences were detected for zzso with S at zzso and V at zzso at zzso the zzso acids D, zzso L and A are almost equally zzso In the zzso zzso the best zzso presented S and H at zzso basic zzso acids at zzso and no clear tendency at zzso Interestingly, two zzso acid zzso on the prime side of the zzso derived from H5N1 influenza zzso zzso processing site highly improved its zzso These modifications are possible by single point zzso suggesting a potential yield of a more infectious zzso
