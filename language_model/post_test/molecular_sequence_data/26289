In zzso the zzso zzso is a single zzso which contains a large zzso domain that is situated zzso attached to a region that spans the plasma membrane seven times, the zzso region being zzso This zzso was predicted by the zzso acid sequence and has been confirmed by our zzso zzso The zzso domain, which is related to a family of zzso zzso is presumably involved in binding the large zzso hormones zzso and zzso The zzso half of the zzso which is related to the family of zzso zzso is (by zzso with these zzso presumably involved in the zzso of the zzso to the G zzso Our zzso studies confirm that this single zzso is capable of binding hormone and zzso zzso zzso zzso not only is the structure of the zzso zzso unique compared to other cell surface receptors characterized to date, but also its structure suggests that the mechanism of the translation of hormone binding to G protein zzso in this zzso is different from other G zzso receptors whose zzso are much smaller and zzso among the zzso zzso We predict that, due to the zzso among the zzso hormones, the structures of the zzso and zzso receptors share extensive zzso acid and structural zzso with the zzso zzso zzso our newly acquired knowledge about the structure of the zzso zzso and the development of a zzso and zzso for this zzso should enable more detailed studies on the function and regulation of the zzso zzso not previously zzso
