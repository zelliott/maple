The zzso network, a zzso protein complex, mediates the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and recruits zzso assembly checkpoint zzso constituents to halt cells in zzso until zzso of sister zzso zzso Two types of motifs in the zzso zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found in zzso interact with the zzso motifs of zzso and zzso zzso zzso repeats, ubiquitous in evolution, recruit the zzso complex in a zzso zzso The exact contributions of zzso and zzso motifs to zzso signaling and zzso alignment are zzso 

We report here that zzso motifs cooperate strongly with the neighboring single zzso motif in the zzso 250 zzso zzso of human zzso to seed a comprehensive assembly of zzso zzso In cells depleted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to restore zzso and zzso zzso Individual zzso repeats outside of zzso which lack zzso zzso zzso establish zzso similar sets of zzso but less zzso 

zzso sequences on zzso emerge from our analysis as the platforms on which zzso complexes become zzso Our results show that zzso motifs are enhancers of zzso function in assembling zzso signaling complexes, and that they might have evolved to limit the expansion of zzso motifs by providing a more robust mechanism of zzso signaling around a single zzso We shed light on the mechanism of zzso and zzso recruitment and identify crucial questions for future zzso
