To study zzso regulation by distant zzso we devised a system of easily modified reporter plasmids for integration into zzso targeting zzso in clones of zzso a human zzso zzso The zzso zzso tested zzso function of a zzso region that contained the rat zzso gene and its upstream zzso zzso zzso of zzso was analyzed in two zzso and compared to transient expression of zzso zzso zzso were studied in their natural positions relative to the promoter and localized by zzso All zzso were also analyzed by transient zzso zzso In addition to the known zzso gene zzso zzso at zzso zzso we demonstrated two new zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso zzso All three enhancers functioned in both transient zzso and integrated zzso However, zzso integration demonstrated several differences from transient zzso For example, analysis of zzso showed that zzso function within the zzso required a larger gene region than in transient zzso Another zzso region, zzso at zzso zzso functioned as an zzso in transient zzso but inhibited the function of E1 and zzso when zzso zzso The enhancers did not show additive or synergistic zzso effect consistent with competition for the promoter or zzso interactions among zzso Growth arrest by serum zzso strongly zzso the function of some integrated zzso consistent with the expected disruption of zzso looping during the cell zzso
