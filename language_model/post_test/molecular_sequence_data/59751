zzso junctions present a formidable challenge for the zzso delivery of zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso which are responsible for the formation and regulation of these zzso zzso zzso zzso can bind to zzso zzso and inhibit zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso The objective of this study was to zzso this zzso zzso zzso to map the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso This was accomplished by using two different zzso zzso zzso zzso a regular indirect zzso and an zzso zzso Two peptides from each zzso domain were recognized by this zzso zzso By mapping the zzso zzso of zzso peptides that have discrete roles in zzso zzso can be zzso This will aid in the design of synthetic peptides that can zzso zzso junctions to improve drug zzso
