We report the three-dimensional structure of zzso from zzso zzso determined by solution nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso from protein labeled with zzso and zzso produced by zzso coli zzso The protein has a zzso fold that is unique to zzso and one of its zzso a protein from zzso zzso with zzso sequence identity whose X-ray structure zzso Data Bank zzso zzso was determined by a structural zzso zzso The zzso structure, which revealed that the zzso region of zzso is zzso zzso explains why electron density from the corresponding region was missing in the X-ray structure of the zzso zzso Because it has been hypothesized that zzso has a role in iron trafficking, we investigated the influence of zzso on the zzso zzso fingerprint region of zzso zzso Several signals shifted or broadened upon the addition of excess zzso under zzso conditions, with zzso showing the largest zzso These results indicate that zzso binds zzso to this protein at a region of the sequence zzso only in the subset of the zzso proteins from organisms similar to zzso The finding that iron binds only zzso to zzso and not to a highly zzso region of the structure, suggests that the role of this protein in iron zzso is more complex than previously zzso
