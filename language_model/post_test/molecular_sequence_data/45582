zzso virus V protein is a zzso zzso that is zzso for virus propagation in continuous cell lines, but necessary for efficient viral replication in zzso Those functions modulating virus propagation in zzso are not understood completely, although V protein is known to interfere with the host zzso response and control of viral gene zzso The ability to zzso gene expression was investigated further with a zzso transient expression system in which V protein was found to repress reporter zzso Two regions of the zzso contributed to this repressive effect including the zzso and a region zzso in zzso V proteins located between zzso acids zzso whereas zzso known to mediate the interaction between V and the zzso zzso protein were not zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by V protein suggesting that it acted as a zzso of zzso replication thereby limiting availability of template for reporter gene zzso zzso
