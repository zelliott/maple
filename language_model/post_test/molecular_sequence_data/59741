A novel zzso derived zzso zzso has been isolated from the peripheral blood zzso of one zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso patient using DNA transfer and a mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso was activated by a zzso in the zzso zzso It predicts for two open reading frames zzso zzso consists of 240 zzso that would zzso 80 zzso zzso while the major zzso consists of zzso zzso capable of coding for 216 zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso contained a zinc finger domain which showed significant zzso to zzso box binding proteins zzso and zzso zzso of an expression zzso containing zzso but not full length zzso was able to transform zzso cells and induce tumors in nude zzso zzso zzso transcripts of zzso or zzso zzso zzso were selectively expressed in zzso and zzso of healthy zzso Within the zzso zzso gene expression was restricted to zzso zzso and absent from zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts were detected in all normal zzso samples tested but not in several zzso human zzso lines and not in 50% of zzso from zzso zzso However, stimulation of zzso from zzso patients under conditions which induced differentiation into plasma cells was associated with induction of zzso gene zzso The zzso gene may therefore play an important role in zzso growth and zzso
