zzso treatment of zzso of zzso zzso caused loss of the zzso activity in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso of the native and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the zzso form of zzso The zzso acid sequence was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso showed a low yield of zzso of position zzso zzso less than zzso of that of zzso and instead a high yield of zzso This indicated that zzso zzso zzso under the experimental conditions zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to smaller zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or Ala, significantly changed the zzso activity of the zzso All of the zzso contained zzso and exhibited the same zzso properties as those of the wild type zzso The zzso values for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso changed to large zzso The most drastic change was observed for zzso The zzso values for zzso of the zzso zzso changed to zzso larger values than that of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activities like those of the zzso zzso but the zzso efficiencies of zzso and zzso drastically decreased to zzso zzso of that of the zzso zzso The present results indicate that zzso plays an important role in the zzso function, and that zzso and zzso act on binding of the zzso zzso
