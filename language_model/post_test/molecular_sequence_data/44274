High resolution chemical zzso and zzso experiments have provided a basis for zzso the overall architecture of the complex between the core DNA binding domain of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and the zzso DNA response element implicated in the zzso phase cell cycle zzso These studies complement both a crystal structure and earlier zzso studies and provide the first direct experimental evidence that four zzso of zzso bind to the response element in a regular staggered array having zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the highly zzso zzso parts of the consensus zzso are critical to the zzso zzso zzso modeling of the complex using the observed zzso contacts shows that when four zzso of zzso bind the response element, the DNA has to bend approximately 50 degrees to relieve zzso clashes among different zzso consistent with recent DNA zzso zzso The overall lateral arrangement of the four zzso zzso with respect to the DNA loop comprises a novel zzso assembly that has not been reported previously in other zzso We suggest that this kind of zzso superstructure may be important for zzso binding to response elements packed in zzso and for subsequent zzso of zzso zzso
