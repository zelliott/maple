The hypersensitive reaction zzso is an zzso plant response that is associated with disease zzso It is characterized by zzso localized cell death at the site of infection and is believed to inhibit the spread of invading zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso designated zzso (for hypersensitive reaction zzso corresponding to an zzso transcript that accumulates in bean during an zzso The predicted protein product of the zzso zzso is an approximately 17 zzso protein of 161 zzso zzso with four putative zzso zzso zzso The zzso pattern of zzso transcript zzso correlated closely with the onset of the zzso in bean after zzso with incompatible zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tomato and with tobacco necrosis zzso zzso transcript also accumulated in bean in response to compatible zzso zzso zzso zzso and was correlated with zzso cell death associated with disease zzso zzso A more transient pattern of zzso transcript zzso occurred in bean in response to general stimuli that did not result in the zzso or host cell zzso These treatments included zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso or zzso and in response to zzso Thus, there was differential zzso of the zzso transcript in response to specific stimuli resulting in the HR, compared with general stimuli that did not result in cell zzso We zzso that the zzso product may be a component of the zzso that leads to hypersensitive cell zzso
