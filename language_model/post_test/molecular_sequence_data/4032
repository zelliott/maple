zzso DNA is packaged into zzso made up of 146 zzso of DNA wrapped around a core of zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to explore DNA charge transport within these zzso Although zzso proteins inhibit zzso of the zzso complex within the core zzso they do not prevent zzso zzso the signature of zzso charge transport through zzso Moreover, using zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the DNA, we found that zzso bases within the zzso can be oxidized from a distance of 24 zzso zzso binding did not affect the pattern and extent of this zzso zzso although the structure of the zzso core particle generally protects DNA from damage by zzso zzso packaging within the zzso does not protect DNA from charge transfer damage through the base pair zzso
