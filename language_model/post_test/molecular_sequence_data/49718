zzso The results of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso crystal structure are zzso It exhibits improved sequence zzso relative to that of zzso zzso It was demonstrated that many selective zzso for zzso could fit within the putative active site of the zzso and in zzso which agree with documented evidence for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a number of zzso acid zzso lining the zzso pocket have been zzso via zzso zzso to have an influence on zzso zzso and these experimental findings from the literature are consistent with the zzso interactions for selective zzso zzso The binding affinities of several zzso zzso have also been calculated from the zzso active site interactions and they agree closely with experimental zzso
