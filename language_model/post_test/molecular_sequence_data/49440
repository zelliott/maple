zzso requirements for function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso regulator of G protein signaling zzso zzso of zzso and zzso exchange factors differ from those of the classical zzso zzso An extensive zzso analysis of the zzso zzso domain was undertaken to determine its functional interface with the zzso zzso zzso indicate that there is global resemblance between the interaction surface of the zzso domain with zzso and the interactions of zzso and zzso with their zzso zzso However, there are distinct differences in the distribution of functionally critical zzso between these structurally similar surfaces and an additional essential requirement for a cluster of zzso charged zzso at the N zzso of zzso Lack of sequence conservation within the N zzso may also explain the lack of zzso protein zzso activity in a subset of the zzso zzso For all zzso loss of functional GAP activity is paralleled by decreases in binding to zzso The same zzso when placed in the context of the zzso zzso produce deficiencies in GAP activity as observed with the zzso domain alone but show no zzso of the regulation of zzso exchange activity by zzso This suggests that the zzso domain may serve a structural or zzso role in the regulation of the zzso exchange activity of zzso on zzso by zzso
