zzso zzso is an integral part of the zzso signal recognition particle zzso a zzso zzso complex which associates with zzso and serves to zzso zzso and transport proteins destined for the membrane or zzso The zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso and the signal zzso as the nascent protein emerges from the zzso A focal point of this critical cellular function is the detailed understanding of how different zzso signal peptides are recognized efficiently and transported specifically, despite considerable variation in zzso We have solved the crystal structure of a zzso functional zzso of the human zzso protein zzso at zzso A resolution showing a predominantly alpha zzso protein with a large fraction of the structure available for zzso zzso binding is predicted to occur in the vicinity of zzso 4 to zzso The zzso zzso extends significantly from the core of the structure into a large but zzso zzso groove of an adjacent zzso thus revealing molecular details of possible interactions between alpha zzso signal peptides and human zzso
