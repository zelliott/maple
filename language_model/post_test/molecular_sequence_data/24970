In zzso skin, zzso stimulate zzso transport by interaction with zzso zzso The structural requirements of the zzso are the presence of the zzso sequence zzso and at least one Pro zzso in the zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso acid must be zzso but it can be different from Met, and that the sequence cannot be longer or shorter than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no Pro zzso increased the short circuit current value by 48 zzso zzso On the basis of considerable experimental evidence, we suggest that zzso interacts with a zzso different from those of other zzso
