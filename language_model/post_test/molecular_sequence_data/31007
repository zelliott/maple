zzso plasma zzso zzso like alpha zzso zzso zzso is a large protein with zzso molecular zzso Each zzso has Mr 205 zzso Total zzso content of zzso zzso exceeded that of alpha zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained zzso acid zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso differed most significantly from alpha zzso in the content of zzso zzso and zzso Although the zzso core of both proteins were of similar size, the difference in size, of native molecules was due to the zzso zzso Whereas alpha zzso zzso was zzso zzso into two smaller zzso zzso (Mr 128 and 65 zzso no such breakdown products were observed with zzso Unlike alpha zzso zzso is not a broad spectrum zzso zzso Both proteins inhibited human zzso zzso zzso in a dose dependent relationship, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being a more potent inhibitor than alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso lacked internal zzso groups, the mechanism of zzso zzso was unlikely to be zzso as defined for alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso were zzso Thus, these findings do not support the zzso of a common ancestral protein for zzso and alpha zzso
