zzso and zzso methods are presented for the identification of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in particular those containing zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso zzso The zzso zzso spectrum of zzso contains a single zzso resonance with a chemical shift position zzso zzso consistent with zzso metal zzso The zzso chemical shifts of the four zzso zzso were obtained from one-dimensional zzso zzso multiple quantum zzso zzso and total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, sequential assignments were made for two short zzso stretches of the zzso chain using a combination of zzso zzso correlated zzso zzso and nuclear zzso effect zzso experiments, enabling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for each zzso to be zzso The magnitude of these zzso zzso zzso follows a zzso dependence with respect to the H zzso zzso zzso zzso angles, zzso from the crystal structure of the native zzso The difference zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso reveals three distinct transitions with zzso zzso located at zzso zzso and 245 zzso which are paralleled by zzso features in the corresponding difference CD and magnetic CD zzso Based on the optical zzso theory of zzso the lowest energy transition has been attributed to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26,000 zzso zzso with a zzso extinction zzso per zzso of 6,500 zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
