zzso cancer clusters provide a unique opportunity to zzso the molecular mechanisms central to the development of zzso We have identified four families in which 11 members developed zzso zzso zzso The clinical course of disease in these individuals with familial zzso cancer appears to be very different from that of patients with zzso zzso zzso In order to compare these disease states, 34 cases matched for age at diagnosis zzso zzso tumor zzso (all zzso and a preponderance of advanced grade and zzso stage of disease were zzso Patients with familial zzso cancer exhibited a zzso zzso survival in comparison with a zzso zzso survival in the zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso studies indicate a lack of zzso of the zzso zzso in the familial cancer members' zzso This may correlate with the zzso character of their zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso gene expression was noted in four of six zzso zzso We also found germ line zzso zzso in three of the four families, but neither the germ line or tumor zzso prevalence was zzso This is the first report of germ line zzso zzso associated with familial zzso cancer and indicates that this gene may play a role in the development of some familial zzso zzso
