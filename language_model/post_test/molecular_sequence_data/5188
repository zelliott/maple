zzso P zzso elements can be separated into two distinct zzso mobile zzso which present the zzso structure, with zzso and zzso functions, and immobile P sequences truncated in zzso and 3' by loss of the terminal zzso repeats and zzso 3, which retain only the zzso zzso This second class was first described in some species of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a new truncated immobile P sequence cloned from one species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that produces a zzso zzso with a coding capacity for a zzso zzso zzso The results from a number of different comparisons between zzso sequences concerning both coding and zzso regions strongly suggest that the zzso and zzso immobile P sequences as well as the zzso P zzso derive from the same ancestral mobile P element zzso Study of the zzso regions of these immobile P sequences shows that the two zzso were produced by two independent zzso Our results provide evidence that the molecular zzso of a zzso element family may recur in a species zzso
