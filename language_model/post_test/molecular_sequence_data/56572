A zzso zzso zzso including the zzso gene and the 3' end of the zzso gene has been cloned and zzso in zzso zzso zzso maps at region 62 on the tip of zzso II of this zzso Both the coding and zzso regions have been aligned and compared with those of zzso zzso There is no evidence for zzso in the rate of silent substitution between the zzso coding region and the rate of zzso in zzso regions, the overall silent divergence per site being zzso zzso regions also differ between both species by different zzso some of which are related to repeated zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso shows a strong zzso bias similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the rates of silent zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene and other genes completely zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirms previous results indicating that zzso is evolving slowly both at silent and zzso zzso According to the data for the zzso region, zzso zzso and zzso zzso lineages would have zzso some 9 zzso ago, if one assumes a divergence time of 30 zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso
