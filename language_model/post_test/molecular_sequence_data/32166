The zzso zzso of zzso zzso encodes products required for the production of zzso zzso zzso Previous work has shown that one regulatory zzso zzso zzso is involved in the repression of this zzso The work reported here confirms the role of Rex in the negative regulation of the zzso zzso Two additional regulatory proteins for the zzso zzso were identified, zzso zzso a response regulator involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso the carbon zzso regulator zzso zzso but not zzso was required for full expression of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso binding to the zzso promoter between positions zzso and zzso a region which includes zzso consensus binding zzso was not enhanced by zzso A zzso zzso had increased expression from the full-length zzso promoter during stationary growth compared to the zzso zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso was observed from a zzso zzso promoter fusion that lacked the Rex binding region, suggesting that the effect of the two zzso Rex and zzso was zzso zzso binds directly to the zzso promoter, protecting the region from positions zzso to zzso which contains sequences similar to the zzso consensus binding zzso the zzso zzso zzso binding was enhanced upon addition of zzso a putative zzso for zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso box reduced zzso binding zzso in zzso and increased zzso expression in zzso Thus, zzso and zzso along with the previously identified zzso regulator Rex zzso affect the expression of the zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso promoter was observed in zzso in the absence of its regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso This complex regulation suggests that the zzso promoter is tightly regulated to allow its expression only at the appropriate time and under the appropriate zzso
