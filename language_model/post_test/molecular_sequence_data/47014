The zzso zzso protein zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso has been of some interest because of its role in certain human zzso diseases, such as zzso zzso A substantial amount of evidence, including zzso pathology in zzso and transgenic animals, suggests the gene also has functions unrelated to zzso structure, but the products of the gene responsible for these putative functions have not yet been zzso Here we report the identification of a new zzso of the zzso gene and at least two new products of the gene that contain this zzso The new zzso located between zzso 1 and 2, is spliced into zzso and zzso zzso creating a new translation initiation site that generates zzso and zzso proteins with a 12 zzso acid leader zzso This leader sequence appears to target these proteins to a different cellular compartment within the cell bodies of zzso and away from the zzso zzso Furthermore, these new products are also expressed in a number of zzso populations within the zzso mouse brain, including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We term these products zzso zzso and zzso proteins to distinguish them from the classic zzso and zzso zzso They represent putative candidates for some of the zzso functions of the zzso zzso
