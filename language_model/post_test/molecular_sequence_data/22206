The zzso zzso represents a prime target zzso for cancer zzso because it is abundantly expressed and zzso zzso in zzso Attempts to generate strong zzso immunity to zzso by zzso with peptides have generally failed partly because of zzso In this study, we have developed zzso synthesis of extended zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso using a panel of zzso human zzso zzso zzso with different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso were used as zzso to evaluate an optimal vaccine zzso zzso with complete zzso occupancy (five sites per zzso zzso the strongest zzso response reacting with zzso expressed in breast cancer cell lines in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso immune response showed remarkable specificity for cancer cells suggesting that the zzso design holds promise as a cancer zzso The zzso immune responses were directed to combined zzso zzso and both zzso sequence and zzso structures were important for the zzso A zzso zzso with similar specificity as the zzso immune response was generated and shown to have the same remarkable cancer zzso This zzso may hold promise in diagnostic and zzso zzso
