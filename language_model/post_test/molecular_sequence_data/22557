Despite limited data supporting the superiority of dominant over zzso responses, zzso zzso represent the preferred vaccine zzso To address the function of zzso responses in human zzso virus infection, we analyzed zzso T zzso responses restricted by zzso a rare zzso in a cohort infected with zzso B, although common in one infected with zzso zzso zzso was associated with reduced viral loads in the zzso B cohort but not the zzso C zzso although both shared the zzso zzso zzso B viral control was associated with responses to several zzso zzso T zzso zzso whereas their zzso C zzso were less well zzso These data suggest that zzso responses can contribute to in zzso viral control and that high zzso zzso zzso may drive the elimination of zzso yet effective zzso from circulating viral zzso
