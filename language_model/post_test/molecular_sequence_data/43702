We have previously identified three zzso zzso zzso zzso and gamma of the highly selective zzso Na channel from the zzso zzso kidney A6 cell line, which forms a tight zzso in zzso We report here two novel zzso termed zzso and zzso which share 90 and zzso sequence identity with the previously characterized beta and gamma zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were detected in zzso zzso and A6 cells grown on porous zzso The zzso and pharmacological profile of the Na channel expressed after zzso zzso zzso injection in zzso zzso did not differ from zzso zzso By contrast, the channel expressed after zzso injection zzso zzso a lower zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso a higher apparent affinity for external sodium and zzso of the sodium current by high sodium zzso and zzso a lower apparent affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso binding and the sensing of the zzso sodium zzso The close zzso between gamma and zzso will help to define the zzso involved in sensing external sodium and in the structure of this important drug zzso
