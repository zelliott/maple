In this study, we investigated the cardiovascular effects of four zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were compared of the zzso peptides zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso substance zzso all of which interact zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso B, which is found in both zzso and zzso was also zzso All zzso produced zzso decreases in zzso blood zzso zzso caused significantly greater falls in blood pressure than substance zzso and the response was of longer zzso Both zzso and zzso were significantly more potent at decreasing blood pressure than zzso zzso The zzso zzso selective zzso zzso caused no change in blood zzso No zzso at doses up to 10 zzso produced effects on baseline heart rate or affected the ability of the zzso nerves to slow the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (in the dose range zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso action of zzso or substance zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso cause zzso effects via an zzso zzso which differs substantially from its zzso zzso
