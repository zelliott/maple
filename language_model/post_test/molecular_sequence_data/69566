zzso evolutionary relationships within the zzso order zzso were deduced from comparisons of the nuclear small and large zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These studies show that relationships among the zzso zzso differ from those previously proposed from studies of zzso characteristics or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a closely related group, which shows progressively more distant relationships to zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The rooting of the zzso tree was accomplished by using zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso a status confirmed by molecular comparisons with other zzso The nuclear zzso tree agrees well with data obtained from comparisons of other nuclear zzso zzso with the proposed zzso zzso tree probably reflect the lack of a suitable zzso for this tree, as the zzso are otherwise zzso Small zzso zzso zzso within the zzso are large, approaching those among plants and animals, which underscores the evolutionary zzso of the zzso Analysis of the distribution of different zzso zzso of these species in conjunction with a probable timing of evolutionary zzso suggests that zzso zzso arose multiple times in the zzso
