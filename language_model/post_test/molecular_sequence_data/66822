zzso labeling coupled with zzso separation and zzso analysis is a powerful technique for comparative zzso We developed a zzso labeling strategy zzso zzso 2003, 75, zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2005, 4, zzso to label zzso zzso and zzso groups of zzso with zzso zzso via reductive zzso and an zzso pair of zzso is used for zzso labeling on two sets of zzso In this study, this approach is extended to a four sample labeling by combining the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso reducing zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso To ensure sufficient mass difference, this zzso labeling is coupled with zzso zzso instead of zzso for zzso resulting in at least two labeling sites with a mass difference of 4 Da for each pair of zzso zzso Moreover, multiplex zzso labeling was proved to have no significant zzso effect during zzso zzso zzso This method was further applied for monitoring zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso labeled zzso derived from seven time points zzso zzso were grouped into two sets of sample zzso separated by zzso to reduce the complexity, and then analyzed by zzso The zzso study reveals that zzso zzso was completed in zzso h for all detected zzso The multiplex zzso method has not only provided a simultaneous detection mean for four sample sets but has also zzso all the advantages associated with the original zzso zzso
