zzso immune response to zzso zzso expressing foreign zzso has not been zzso zzso In order to investigate the potential use of zzso as a zzso vaccine zzso we constructed zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the junction between the zzso and zzso regions, designated zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso viruses zzso efficiently in zzso cells and showed a similar infection profile to that of the zzso zzso strain in zzso growth zzso zzso stability analysis showed that zzso retained the foreign insert over twelve successive passages zzso whereas zzso lost part of the foreign insert after four zzso Our results indicated that the stability of the inserted foreign sequences was rather affected by their zzso sequence than by their length when located between the zzso and zzso zzso The junction between these zzso zzso regions is a novel site for the construction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso mice zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, zzso significant zzso zzso responses to zzso but not to zzso
