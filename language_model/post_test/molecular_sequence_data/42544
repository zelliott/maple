Models of the zzso zzso of the human and zzso zzso receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso were built on the basis of sequence similarity with rat zzso zzso the structure of which is zzso The sites on zzso zzso zzso that are possibly involved in the interaction with zzso and with another zzso zzso are zzso The models may assist the design of protein engineering experiments for the study of the zzso of these zzso
