The zzso community of the forest floor was examined as the cause of previously reported increases in soil organic matter due to experimental N deposition in zzso producing predominantly zzso litter, and the opposite response in zzso producing zzso zzso The mechanism proposed to explain this phenomenon was that zzso zzso are more important in the degradation of zzso litter than of zzso litter, and that their activity is suppressed by N zzso We found that forest floor mass in the zzso zzso dominated system decreased in October due to experimental N deposition, whereas forest floor mass of zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by N zzso Increased relative abundance of zzso in zzso forest floor was confirmed by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso used by zzso zzso in the degradation of zzso was zzso times greater in zzso forest floor than in zzso forest zzso While the differences between the zzso communities in different zzso were consistent with the proposed zzso no significant effects of N deposition were detected on zzso profiles, zzso gene zzso zzso length zzso profiles, or zzso zzso zzso Our observations indicate that the previously detected zzso of soil organic matter in the zzso system may be driven by effects of N deposition on organisms in the mineral soil, rather than on organisms residing in the forest zzso However, studies of in zzso gene expression and zzso and spatial zzso within forest floor communities will be necessary to further relate the zzso dynamics of organic carbon to microbial communities and atmospheric N zzso
