zzso of zzso coli is an zzso protein that globally regulates gene expression by zzso translation and/or altering the stability of target zzso Here we explored mechanisms that control zzso zzso Four zzso binding sites were predicted upstream of the zzso initiation zzso one of which overlapped its zzso zzso zzso from gel shift, zzso zzso and in zzso translation experiments indicate that zzso binds to these four sites and zzso its own translation by directly competing with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also performed to examine zzso of zzso zzso extension, in zzso zzso and in zzso expression studies identified two zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoters that drive zzso of zzso Additional primer extension studies identified a fifth zzso promoter zzso zzso from zzso which is indirectly activated by zzso is primarily responsible for increased zzso expression as cells transition from exponential to zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that regulation of zzso expression occurs by a variety of mechanisms, including zzso from multiple promoters by two zzso factors, indirect zzso of its own transcription, as well as direct repression of its own zzso
