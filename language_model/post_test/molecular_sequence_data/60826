The 3' untranslated region zzso zzso between the 3' end of zzso and the long terminal repeat is well zzso among avian zzso and is essential for efficient zzso zzso of the zzso element within the 3' zzso has been reported to have various effects, including reduced levels of zzso zzso in the zzso decreased stability of zzso zzso decreased particle production, and decreased zzso zzso zzso To probe the role of specific sequences within zzso in virus zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso parts of the predicted secondary structure of zzso Seven of thirteen zzso had no significant zzso the others resulted in an approximately zzso to zzso reduction in zzso These zzso were further characterized and found to impair zzso zzso of zzso zzso only zzso Furthermore, no decreases were observed in the stability of the zzso zzso or in the production of virus zzso zzso zzso packaging, however, was reduced by about zzso Similar amounts of particles were produced by cells containing the zzso and zzso DNA, and all particles contained similar levels of reverse zzso zzso The results suggest that the region of the zzso disrupted by the zzso plays a role in zzso zzso packaging, although that packaging may not be the only role for zzso
