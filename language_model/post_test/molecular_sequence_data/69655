The zzso sequence of the zzso base pair zzso O zzso located in an evolutionary variable region adjacent to the right end of the zzso of zzso virus zzso was zzso The sequence contains two long open reading frames coding for putative proteins of 559 zzso acid zzso zzso and 344 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid database searches showed that zzso is closely related to zzso virus zzso strain zzso zzso gene product zzso gene product of strain zzso which belongs to the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the overall high zzso differences were observed in the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso in the site known to interact with zzso in other zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso and two strains of zzso may all inhibit zzso with different zzso The gene coding for the zzso of zzso is lacking in the Copenhagen strain of zzso zzso the WR strain contains a truncated zzso of this gene zzso potentially coding for a small protein zzso corresponding to the zzso region of zzso zzso is a new member of the family of zzso proteins including zzso virus proteins zzso zzso and zzso and a group of related proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso viruses zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins are zzso to the zzso protein zzso involved in egg zzso Both zzso protein and the related zzso proteins contain two distinct zzso The zzso domain is related to the similarly located zzso of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso protein involved in early development in zzso The zzso domain consists of an array of four to five imperfect repeats and is related to human zzso protein zzso zzso analysis of the family of zzso proteins showed that their genes have undergone a complex succession of zzso and complete or partial zzso
