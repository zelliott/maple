zzso editing in zzso and zzso of flowering plants changes hundreds of selected zzso to zzso mostly in coding regions of zzso zzso sequences around the editing sites are presumably recognized by up to 200 zzso repeat zzso zzso The here identified family of multiple zzso zzso editing factor zzso proteins provides additional components of the zzso editing machinery in both plant zzso Two zzso proteins are required for editing in zzso at least two are essential for editing in zzso The loss of a zzso protein zzso or lowers editing at multiple sites, many of which are addressed individually by zzso zzso In zzso both zzso proteins are required for complete editing at almost all sites, suggesting a zzso zzso In zzso zzso and pull-down zzso zzso proteins can connect to form zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso proteins interact selectively with zzso zzso establishing a more complex zzso in plant zzso than previously zzso
