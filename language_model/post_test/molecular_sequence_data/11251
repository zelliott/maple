zzso II is part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to its role in the zzso of zzso zzso specifically zzso it has been suggested that the zzso system may also play a role in controlling cell differentiation and zzso During the analysis of a zzso zzso of zzso we identified the gene for a zzso II zzso zzso that appears to be zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso II zzso zzso zzso was also isolated and zzso Southern zzso and sequence analyses indicate that zzso II proteins are zzso by at least two zzso families in zzso zzso coli cells expressing either zzso or zzso exhibit increased zzso II activity, confirming that they do, in fact, zzso zzso II zzso Northern analysis shows that the two genes are zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso are most abundant in roots, while those for the zzso zzso are highest in flower zzso The identification of zzso II zzso that are zzso expressed suggests that they may play different roles in the zzso
