zzso growth factor beta zzso activates zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso gene through a major zzso region zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso This process requires the zzso family of signaling zzso Upon zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso to the nucleus and activate zzso of zzso responsive zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to bind to various sites in the zzso zzso To determine the number of zzso sites within the zzso pair major zzso region and the mechanism of zzso zzso we systematically mapped the zzso sites and show that zzso and zzso bind zzso to two adjacent DNA elements in this zzso Both elements were required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to previous reports, zzso of the zzso promoter was zzso by the zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso markedly enhanced its binding to the two binding zzso Finally, a zzso zzso identified in a human pancreatic zzso that zzso zzso signaling abolished zzso DNA binding activity, hence preventing zzso of zzso zzso These results underscore the importance of the zzso DNA binding activity in controlling cell growth and zzso
