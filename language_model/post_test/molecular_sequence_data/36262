These data collect the advance made in the last few years in our laboratory in defining one zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing Experimental zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We achieved the characterization of one zzso zzso zzso by combining zzso zzso zzso and zzso approaches and zzso zzso zzso Since T cells recognize zzso forms of the zzso and since zzso zzso zzso activate class zzso T cells, we hypothesized that one zzso T cell zzso named zzso which prevents further EAT induction in mice injected with zzso would be specific for one EAT zzso zzso In order to identify one zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso treatment of the protein by zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis were zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to pulse zzso zzso and tested for their ability to be recognized by zzso zzso Lastly, when zzso were recognized by zzso cells their capacity to induce EAT in zzso mice was zzso To further assess the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso one synthetic zzso was made and its capacity to induce EAT zzso By this procedure we identified for the first time one 40 zzso zzso from human zzso inducing EAT in zzso zzso
