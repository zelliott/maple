Using DNA zzso we have isolated and characterized zzso clones zzso a mouse zzso zzso beta zzso Two forms of zzso were zzso The first form encodes a zzso protein that has an overall structure very similar to that of the known human zzso zzso beta with zzso zzso acid identity, whereas in the second type of mouse zzso the equivalent of the zzso region has been zzso This presumed alternative zzso event also gives rise to a frame shift that results in a zzso with an identical zzso domain but a different zzso zzso Whether this alternative C zzso is capable of signaling is not yet zzso Both types of receptors when expressed in zzso cells are membrane associated and bind zzso with an affinity of 1 zzso similar to the affinity of zzso beta for zzso The zzso size of both zzso beta proteins is about 100 zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso beta is expressed at the surface of zzso and zzso cells as a zzso whose formation is independent of zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso beta binds zzso with two affinities of 50 and 470 zzso corresponding to the medium and high affinity zzso binding sites previously identified on mouse Con A zzso Despite the higher affinity displayed by the zzso beta in zzso cells, this zzso alone is not sufficient to zzso a zzso suggesting that another zzso is probably required to generate a functional zzso zzso
