The zzso zzso 19 zzso protein provides a cell survival function during zzso infection and zzso efficient virus replication by preventing premature cell zzso These functions resemble those performed by the protein coded by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso which provides a survival function in cells exposed to a number of cell zzso zzso can substitute for the 19 zzso protein during zzso zzso Although these two zzso promoting proteins are not overtly related by primary zzso acid zzso they appear to share short zzso zzso In order to determine if these sequence motifs constitute common functional zzso we carried out domain exchanges between the 19 zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that a seven zzso acid region of the zzso protein zzso can efficiently substitute for the corresponding 19 zzso domain zzso zzso this domain in zzso zzso the survival promoting activity of zzso zzso of the zzso sequences into zzso restores the survival promoting activity, albeit at reduced zzso Our results suggest that this domain zzso zzso may constitute a common functional domain for the 19 zzso protein and survival promoting members of the zzso family of zzso
