Many genes expressed in the human zzso have not been identified despite intensive zzso We observed that the presence of long zzso sequences in the 3' end of zzso templates contributes significantly to this problem, because the hybrids formed randomly between zzso and zzso sequences of unrelated zzso templates lead to loss of many templates in the zzso zzso The low abundant copies, which account for the majority of the expressed zzso are affected in particular by this zzso We have developed a strategy called screening zzso zzso for gene identification to overcome this zzso zzso this strategy can significantly enhance the efficiency of zzso gene identification and should have an impact on many functional zzso studies in the zzso zzso
