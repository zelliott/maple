zzso is characterized by the development of new zzso from pre-existing vessels and plays a central role in zzso processes such as zzso wound healing and female zzso function, as well as zzso events including cancer, zzso arthritis and diabetic zzso The growth and zzso of tumors is critically dependent upon zzso Although targeting zzso as a therapeutic strategy has to date met with limited success in the clinic, the recent zzso approval of the zzso zzso zzso has validated the use of zzso therapeutic strategies for cancer zzso We have recently identified several plasma proteins having zzso properties, including zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso Both of these proteins are able to induce zzso in zzso cells in zzso and can inhibit zzso in zzso Recent studies from our laboratories have also identified a novel zzso binding protein for zzso that mediates its zzso zzso This zzso zzso is normally found inside the cell and is associated with the zzso zzso where it plays a critical role in stabilizing zzso filaments in a variety of cell zzso However, in zzso zzso cells, zzso appears to have zzso zzso Previous studies have also suggested the involvement of zzso in the zzso activity of zzso and our recent work indicates that zzso may mediate the zzso activity of zzso as zzso In this review, we zzso data describing zzso zzso as a novel zzso for multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso may therefore represent a previously zzso central target for the development of zzso zzso
