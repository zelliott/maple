A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of the zzso Aedes zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of Aedes zzso contains a putative signal zzso of 18 zzso acid zzso and a zzso acid zzso zzso Within the zzso are zzso one copy each of the Aedes zzso 1, 2, and 3 isolated previously from this species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 202, zzso All three Aedes zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso of less than zzso M and increase the frequency of zzso zzso at zzso above zzso zzso At higher zzso the Aedes zzso 1 and 3 but not Aedes zzso 2 are also able to increase the rate of fluid zzso by the zzso zzso The differences of the three Aedes zzso in their zzso to induce fluid zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso suggest that there may be more than one type of zzso zzso in this zzso
