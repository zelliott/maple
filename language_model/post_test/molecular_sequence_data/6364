It has been reported that the zzso 3 protein of zzso can exert an zzso effect on the cellular zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso of this zzso is thought to be a general mechanism zzso a cellular zzso zzso This zzso can also be activated upon zzso resulting in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 has an affinity for zzso zzso to be responsible for zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso was performed on two basic regions previously suggested as zzso motifs and the zzso zzso 3 proteins were then expressed in zzso zzso These experiments revealed that both motifs are involved in zzso 3 attachment to zzso zzso of the zzso lacking zzso capability is zzso by zzso of another zzso zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso These results support a model in which the attachment to zzso is directly responsible for the zzso effect of zzso 3 on expression of zzso zzso
