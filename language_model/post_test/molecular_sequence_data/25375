A human zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein of predicted molecular mass 34 zzso has sequence identity with two different zzso protein zzso C zzso at the zzso and zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso involved in Philadelphia zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso Ahmed, zzso zzso & Lim zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence identity of zzso with zzso includes the zzso motif zzso and zzso acids upstream of the first zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso This region of zzso has been implicated in the binding of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Part of this zzso motif zzso has the potential of forming a zzso zzso zzso zzso cause a variety of zzso changes and are among the most potent zzso promoters that have been zzso zzso is the only known protein target for these zzso We now report that zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso region being responsible for this zzso This finding has wide implications for previous studies zzso zzso zzso binding with the presence of zzso in the zzso
