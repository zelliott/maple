We measured the frequency of zzso zzso in 14 zzso and 16 zzso membrane protein structures and found that the membrane environment considerably zzso the zzso zzso compared to soluble zzso Although there are limited experimental data, we found statistically significant changes in zzso preferences depending on the zzso zzso zzso zzso were influenced by whether the zzso were zzso or protein zzso and whether the zzso were found near the zzso or zzso zzso interactions with the zzso backbone zzso the zzso populations of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso favor zzso zzso that allow their side chains to extend their polar atoms out of the membrane core, thereby aligning the zzso polarity zzso with the polarity zzso of the zzso Our results demonstrate how the membrane environment influences protein structures, providing information that will be useful in the structure prediction and design of zzso zzso
