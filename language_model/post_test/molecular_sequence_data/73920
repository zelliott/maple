The protein zzso C zzso sites on bovine zzso were identified using zzso zzso acid, mass zzso and zzso sequencing zzso zzso removal of the 9 zzso zzso of zzso revealed that a major fraction of the zzso incorporated by protein zzso C are in a region containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid analysis of the zzso product established that zzso accounts for approximately zzso of the zzso in this zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by mass zzso and zzso sequencing revealed that zzso is also a primary zzso site, with minor zzso of zzso zzso of high pressure liquid zzso zzso taken together with zzso acid analysis of the zzso product, revealed that zzso and zzso were zzso equally and each accounted for approximately zzso of the total zzso zzso accounted for just under zzso of the zzso and zzso accounted for zzso Thus, the primary protein zzso C sites are zzso and zzso with minor zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso have recently been identified as the primary sites of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of these sites, only zzso is a significant zzso for zzso zzso in zzso Identification of zzso as a primary protein zzso C target in zzso is consistent with protein zzso C modulating the zzso of this site in zzso
