The zzso requirements of zzso promoters of zzso plants were studied in detail in a pea in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regions of three different zzso initiation sites from zzso zzso and zzso identified a crucial zzso sequence element zzso zzso zzso positions zzso to -9 relative to the first transcribed zzso zzso of the zzso sequence to zzso zzso zzso identities results in an almost complete loss of promoter activity, suggesting that primary structure rather than a simple zzso of zzso and zzso in this region is essential for promoter zzso This promoter segment thus appears to be involved in sequence specific binding of a respective protein zzso rather than merely loosening and melting the DNA zzso during or for an initiation zzso zzso of zzso identities in the 3' portion of the pea zzso promoter and the respective zzso region revealed that essential sequences extend to positions zzso beyond this zzso start zzso zzso zzso initiation at an zzso pair promoter sequence ranging from zzso positions zzso to zzso integrated into different sequence contexts shows this element to be sufficient for autonomous promoter function independent of surrounding zzso
