The zzso zzso of the spinach zzso zzso encodes the genes for the zzso zzso a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso both associated with zzso II, as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso IV zzso of the zzso zzso complex in the order zzso These genes are not expressed zzso The zzso pattern of this DNA region is complex and resolves into zzso major zzso zzso Using northern and zzso protection analysis we demonstrate zzso that all zzso species derive from one DNA strand and zzso in an overlapping zzso and zzso that they arise by processing rather than by multiple zzso zzso zzso The zzso is bordered by a single zzso zzso in front of zzso and by a putative zzso zzso with characteristic sequence elements following zzso The zzso appears to function zzso zzso At least four distinct modification activities operate on the putative primary transcript of zzso zzso and on the processing zzso including a novel zzso activity zzso within a characteristic zzso zzso zzso activity at discrete zzso ends, zzso shortage of zzso zzso and zzso of class II intervening sequences zzso and zzso zzso zzso maturation of the primary transcript is largely a zzso zzso zzso zzso results ultimately in the formation of zzso zzso for each of the two zzso II zzso and a zzso zzso zzso both zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We zzso that these zzso species represent the zzso active components in the zzso zzso expression of these zzso zzso Light is without any noticeable effect on zzso zzso Under our conditions it appears to operate at a zzso rather than a zzso or zzso level indicating that the zzso of zzso zzso is regulated at various zzso
