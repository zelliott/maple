zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso was performed to investigate the role of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso region VI and zzso acid 352 in zzso region zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies were performed with the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso receptors zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso resulted in decreased affinities of all zzso zzso The most prominent changes in affinity were observed for the zzso zzso and the zzso drug zzso which were reduced approximately zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, the affinity of zzso remained the zzso Replacement of the zzso acid 352 by zzso reduced zzso binding of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso had minor effects on zzso zzso Some of these results agree with the results from zzso studies of the corresponding zzso acids in other zzso However, some notable differences also emerge showing that functional roles of individual zzso acid zzso must be tested zzso in each zzso zzso
