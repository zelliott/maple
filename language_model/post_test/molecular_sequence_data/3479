We examined levels and patterns of the zzso zzso of the zzso genes with a head-to-head zzso in zzso zzso The levels of variation in zzso zzso were comparable to those in zzso zzso zzso test, zzso and zzso test, zzso test, and zzso test did not show significant departure from zzso We found an excess of replacement changes in the zzso class, representing zzso in one of the duplicated zzso compared with the zzso class, representing zzso shared between the duplicated zzso Most replacement changes in the zzso class were zzso These results suggest that most replacement changes are zzso A contrasting evolutionary pattern, involving concerted evolution in the coding regions but differential evolution in the zzso regions, was zzso However, unlike the duplicated Amy genes of zzso zzso the coding regions of the duplicated genes in zzso zzso tended to zzso Using zzso model of the small zzso family, we found that zzso zzso equal zzso rate was one order higher than gene conversion zzso zzso rate, resulting in a considerable but incomplete homogenization of the duplicated coding zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso as well as within and around the regulatory zzso sequences of one of the duplicated genes zzso The possible causes of these linkage zzso were zzso
