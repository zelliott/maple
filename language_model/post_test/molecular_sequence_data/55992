In fetal zzso there is a zzso zzso rise in cortisol and zzso zzso zzso that maintains a low free plasma cortisol level and allows for a low negative feedback effect of cortisol on the zzso of zzso from the fetal zzso However, the stimulus for the zzso increase in zzso and the zzso of this effect are not zzso It has been proposed that zzso increase zzso zzso and therefore, we infused fetal sheep with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso over 15 zzso every 2 h for 96 zzso zzso zzso 5) or saline zzso zzso zzso The plasma zzso capacity increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 48 and 96 zzso respectively, of zzso zzso To examine possible mechanisms of increasing fetal plasma zzso we first cloned and zzso a sheep zzso zzso and zzso the zzso This allowed us to deduce the primary structure of zzso zzso and to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso abundance zzso transcript of zzso zzso rose from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units after 96 h of zzso zzso Fetal zzso treatment produced a significant increase zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso forms of zzso that predominate in adult sheep zzso There was negligible transfer of zzso zzso from the zzso to fetal zzso zzso or zzso zzso We also injected adult sheep with zzso (10 zzso for 4 zzso and demonstrated a significant decrease in plasma zzso capacity by 24 zzso which remained suppressed for the duration of the zzso After 96 h of zzso treatment, there was also a significant decrease in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso increase fetal plasma zzso in part by increased zzso zzso It may also be zzso by a change in the zzso of zzso but cannot be attributed to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment exerts opposite effects on zzso zzso in fetal and adult zzso
