The zzso zzso zzso promoter is B cell specific and contains essential zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences inhibit zzso promoter activity, suggesting this region contains zzso zzso Two adjacent zzso DNA segments repress zzso by the zzso zzso promoter in a zzso and zzso manner, analogous to known zzso Both these zzso segments also inhibit zzso by several zzso promoters in B cells, including zzso zzso and human zzso These zzso segments also inhibit zzso by the zzso promoter in T cells suggesting they are not B zzso zzso zzso I footprint analyses show an approximately zzso protected region overlapping the boundary between the two negative regulatory DNA segments and corresponding to binding sites for at least two different zzso zzso Within this zzso two unrelated zzso zzso DNA motifs zzso zzso and zzso function as zzso and zzso zzso when located directly zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These two zzso motifs act zzso to restrict the zzso activity of the zzso zzso Neither of these motifs resembles any known zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso motifs in their respective zzso DNA segments eliminates the zzso activity of these upstream regions, indicating these two motifs as the principal zzso zzso elements within these zzso
