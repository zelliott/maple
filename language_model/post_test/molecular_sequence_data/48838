A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso was affiliated to the zzso zzso zzso zzso shared zzso % zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to the type strain of the type species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso besides showing a similarity of zzso % with other recognized species of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso value between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso % zzso zzso % zzso value, zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso The polar zzso profile constituted zzso zzso zzso zzso three unidentified zzso and three unidentified zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the major zzso acid in the zzso zzso Based on the polar zzso and fatty acid profiles, which were in line with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with additional distinguishing zzso zzso and zzso features, strain zzso is proposed to represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
