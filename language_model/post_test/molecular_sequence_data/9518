The structure of zzso zzso changes from a zzso form to a compact zzso one in response to zzso In a zzso zzso two portions of the zzso core are linked with the stem and are located in close proximity in order to exert zzso In this study, the stem was replaced by zzso (or zzso which lacks the terminal A zzso with or without zzso zzso One of the newly constructed zzso exhibited enhanced activity in response to zzso and we suggest that zzso formation restored the active zzso zzso Other zzso exhibited zzso activity in response to zzso suggesting that formation of the active core was zzso Thus, we have succeeded in developing zzso zzso whose activity is either zzso or enhanced in response to zzso This switching capability may have therapeutic applications because of the differences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
