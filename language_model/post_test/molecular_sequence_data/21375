zzso is a truncated zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso It has been derived from the wild type zzso gene via a reading frame shift, following a tandem zzso of the zzso zzso associated to an zzso base zzso zzso was composed of zzso zzso zzso 240 zzso acid zzso out of zzso of the wild zzso The zzso protein was zzso of the three zzso zzso but still retains zzso zzso It is zzso zzso producing zzso zzso active at pH 6 and zzso under zzso or zzso zzso zzso is the smallest functional truncated TIM zzso It contains the zzso unit as the minimal zzso associated to an zzso zzso The zzso activity can, until now, be attributed to the presence of the whole domain B, in the structure of zzso This zzso revealed, for the first time, the zzso of a zzso site after its zzso This fact may be considered as the restoration of a primitive active site, which was lost in the course of evolution toward more stable zzso
