We have used zzso modified with zzso in the zzso as zzso in the zzso chain reaction zzso This results in the synthesis of zzso DNA zzso which are detected by zzso to a zzso probe in zzso The formed hybrids are collected on an zzso by mediation of the zzso zzso of the target zzso The zzso hybrid collection method is quantitative and makes it possible to measure the amount of DNA produced in the zzso At low zzso of template the efficiency of the process is close to zzso making it possible to detect the presence of a few molecules of target DNA in 25 zzso With high template zzso the efficiency of the process is zzso
