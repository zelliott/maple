zzso screening of a zzso library constructed from human zzso vein zzso cells exposed for 1 h to zzso beta zzso zzso has led to the identification of a novel gene zzso related to zzso zzso protein and serum zzso P component in zzso a zzso of acute phase zzso zzso of the full-length zzso clone and zzso mapping revealed that the zzso transcript is zzso base pairs long and has a unique zzso start zzso The predicted protein sequence of zzso zzso acids is highly similar to zzso in its zzso half where it also contains a typical zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The zzso half of zzso shows no similarity to any known protein sequence and zzso with a putative signal zzso indicating that zzso is zzso The zzso of zzso is organized into three zzso Interestingly, the region of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso to the third zzso zzso The zzso gene has been localized on human zzso 3 band zzso by Southern blots of zzso cell hybrids and by in zzso zzso The zzso zzso is induced in zzso zzso and zzso cells by zzso beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha but not by zzso and zzso zzso may represent a novel marker of inflammatory zzso particularly those involving the vessel zzso
