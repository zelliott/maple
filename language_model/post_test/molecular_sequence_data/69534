zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso can be used to zzso zzso sequences from short DNA templates which contain the 18 base pair promoter zzso Use of zzso zzso extends the range of possible zzso sequences of zzso products, since the preferred zzso start site (of the zzso zzso is zzso while zzso zzso prefers zzso The zzso start site can be advantageous in large-scale zzso where high zzso of zzso can lead to zzso Using the limited number of DNA templates described here, there appears to be a significant difference between the two zzso zzso zzso requires a complete duplex DNA zzso for efficient zzso unlike the zzso zzso which works efficiently when only the 18 base promoter region is zzso zzso zzso consistently produces higher yields of zzso than does zzso zzso and the reactions can be easily scaled up to produce zzso quantities of zzso
