zzso zzso are commonly found in zzso from kidney dialysis patients, where they interfere with interpretation of the zzso zzso We have produced a zzso zzso zzso by zzso transformation of zzso from a dialysis patient, followed by fusion of the transformed cells with a zzso The zzso zzso called zzso was zzso zzso class and its pattern of zzso against T and B zzso cells from patients with chronic zzso leukemia and zzso was similar to that described for zzso zzso found in zzso It was absorbed by fetal but not adult human zzso suggesting the zzso zzso might be the blood group zzso zzso zzso zzso the variable domain of zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction, cloned into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The variable region of the zzso light chain zzso zzso was zzso identical over a zzso stretch with a known germ line sequence and the zzso zzso zzso region was identical over 16 zzso with the germ line sequence J zzso zzso The variable region of the heavy chain zzso was zzso identical over a zzso overlap with the germ line gene zzso a member of the zzso family, and the zzso region of the heavy chain zzso was identical with the germ line zzso gene zzso over 46 zzso with a truncated zzso zzso The diversity region was not zzso These data suggest that the genes required to produce human zzso zzso are zzso within the germ line and, therefore, that all dialysis patients may be able to produce them under certain zzso
