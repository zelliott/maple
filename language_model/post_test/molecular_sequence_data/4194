The aim of this work was to characterize a zzso zzso randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso described as a marker for a zzso group of zzso zzso strains significantly associated with zzso zzso This zzso was zzso by cloning and sequencing, and showed that two types of zzso gene cluster flank the 3' end of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both types of zzso gene cluster act as markers for zzso zzso of strains within the zzso One type could be used to distinguish two of the three virulent zzso zzso to which most of the zzso zzso strains able to invade the central nervous system of zzso zzso This raises the possibility that there is a link between these zzso genes and the zzso of the zzso Based on this analysis, zzso zzso were designed to determine whether zzso zzso strains are likely to belong to lineages of organisms in which most of the highly virulent strains isolated from zzso fluid zzso In addition, this work demonstrated that zzso can be used to detect novel zzso within zzso zzso of zzso
