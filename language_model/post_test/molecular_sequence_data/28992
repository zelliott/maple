The zzso sodium channel zzso constitutes the zzso step for sodium zzso across airway zzso which in turn regulates airway surface liquid zzso volume and the efficiency of zzso zzso This role in zzso volume regulation suggests that zzso activity is influenced by local factors rather than systemic signals indicative of total body volume zzso Based on reports that zzso may be regulated by zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso and mouse zzso zzso we sought to identify zzso that serve similar functions in human airway zzso zzso screening of a human airway zzso zzso library identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that, as revealed by in zzso zzso are expressed in airway zzso zzso studies in the zzso zzso expression system demonstrated that zzso increased zzso currents zzso whereas zzso markedly decreased zzso currents and protein zzso Studies of primary zzso zzso cultures in zzso chambers revealed that zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso markedly decreased zzso currents and zzso the zzso to subsequent channel zzso by zzso zzso These data, therefore, suggest that zzso regulation of sodium zzso is a function of human airway zzso and zzso is a likely candidate for this zzso
