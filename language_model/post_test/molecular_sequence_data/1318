Human zzso 6 zzso zzso was originally identified based on its zzso expression in tumor cells and is considered a zzso for zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso zzso and tissue expression of three novel transcript zzso of the zzso gene that zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso to the classical form, transcript zzso contain one untranslated zzso exploit zzso zzso and are likely products of alternative zzso In addition, we cloned zzso zzso 2 and 3 produced by zzso out zzso 3 and 4, zzso Given the potential diagnostic applications of zzso 6 at both the zzso and protein levels, we developed a duplex zzso in order to zzso detect and zzso zzso species corresponding to zzso zzso We show that in normal zzso zzso cells and zzso tumor cell lines that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso account for approximately zzso of all zzso zzso
