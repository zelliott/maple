A majority of zzso genes are expressed in the S phase during the cell zzso Using the gene expression system of transformed sunflower cells into which wheat zzso zzso gene was introduced by the zzso gene transfer technique, we determined three zzso control sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso which seemed to zzso the zzso zzso of wheat zzso zzso Furthermore, as candidates for regulatory zzso factors, three nuclear zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso that interact with the zzso and zzso motifs were zzso The structural analysis of the zzso of zzso revealed that a nuclear protein has the zzso structure and a zzso zzso The zzso motif in the zzso gene was also seen in cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso promoter and shown to function as a regulatory element of this zzso The wheat zzso can interact with the zzso motif of the zzso zzso zzso Much attention has been paid to the significance of the zzso sequences within the zzso and zzso zzso promoters and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso
