The zzso of an insect are subdivided into distinct segments or zzso Many genes responsible for the zzso of the growing limb into zzso have been isolated from zzso So far, only one gene is known in the leg that is solely required for specifying the zzso pattern zzso zzso zzso In zzso the gene zzso is expressed in the zzso of the zzso and leg zzso disc that represents the most zzso position of zzso and in a zzso zzso When zzso zzso function is impaired, antennae and legs develop without their zzso zzso zzso and the zzso We describe here the analysis of zzso in the zzso zzso insect that shows a different, more ancestral mode of zzso formation than zzso In zzso zzso grow out continuously during zzso and no zzso discs are zzso zzso zzso zzso expression starts midway during zzso zzso and is seen in a zzso and a zzso position of head and trunk zzso At the end of zzso zzso is seen in four expression zzso in the leg, in the zzso zzso and zzso in every segment in lateral groups of cells, presumably the zzso Like in the zzso adult, zzso is required in the zzso for the formation of the most zzso structures of the leg and the antenna as revealed by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is zzso zzso meaning that it has retained its zzso and functional zzso although a zzso change of the process of zzso zzso took place towards the evolution of the highly derived zzso
