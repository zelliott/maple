The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces three different proteins zzso zzso and zzso that assemble into at least two zzso zzso zzso This work reports the cloning and sequencing of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso The deduced zzso proteins were zzso identical with Walker A and B motifs and a second region of zzso typical of AAA zzso The most significant region of divergence was the N zzso predicted to adopt a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Of the five zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso proteins were the most zzso zzso regulation of all five genes was observed, with a zzso to zzso increase in zzso levels as cells entered stationary zzso In parallel with this zzso increase, the protein levels of zzso and zzso increased zzso during the transition from exponential growth to stationary phase, suggesting that these protein levels are regulated at least in part by mechanisms that control transcript zzso In contrast, the beta and zzso protein levels remained relatively constant, while the zzso protein levels exhibited only a modest zzso This lack of correlation between the zzso and protein levels for zzso zzso and zzso suggests zzso mechanisms are involved in regulating the levels of these major zzso zzso Together these results support a model in which the cell regulates the ratio of the different zzso zzso and zzso proteins to zzso the structure and ultimately the function of this central zzso zzso zzso
