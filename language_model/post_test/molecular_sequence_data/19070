The zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in affecting the process of nitrogen zzso Here we report the existence and characterization of a functional zzso sensing signal zzso in zzso zzso One gene zzso playing a role in generating a protein with high levels of similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein families was zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were detected using an AHL zzso and liquid zzso zzso zzso when zzso producing a zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso However, by zzso zzso zzso culture zzso with zzso zzso zzso no AHL product was obtained that was capable of zzso the zzso or being detected by zzso According to reverse zzso the zzso gene is transcribed in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in this zzso strain showed great sensitivity to zzso AHL signals by zzso zzso A degradation experiment demonstrated that the absence of AHL signals might be attributed to the possible zzso activities of this zzso To zzso an AHL zzso gene zzso acting as a zzso AHL producer has been found in a zzso zzso zzso and the results provide an opportunity to complete the knowledge of the regulatory networks in zzso zzso
