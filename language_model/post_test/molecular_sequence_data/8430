zzso penetration by zzso viruses might be accomplished by either local breakdown of the zzso membrane zzso zzso or formation of a zzso pore by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso virus human zzso zzso 2 zzso has been shown to occur from late zzso and to be entirely dependent on the zzso pH in this compartment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate further the mechanism of zzso of zzso an in zzso zzso was established to test viruses or zzso peptides for their capacity to release zzso zzso of different molecular mass (10 and 70 zzso from isolated zzso The suitability of the zzso was demonstrated by use of a zzso zzso derived from influenza virus zzso zzso Whereas zzso induced a low zzso release of up to zzso of the zzso zzso and did not show any significant size selectivity (as expected for zzso zzso zzso zzso release of zzso of the 10 zzso zzso and only traces of the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso release of zzso was also size zzso The potential role of the zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso in zzso was also substantiated in our in zzso system using an zzso zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these data favor the model of a specific zzso mechanism for zzso zzso which is in contrast to the zzso mechanism of zzso
