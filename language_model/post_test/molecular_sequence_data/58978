According to the present model for assembly of zzso zzso zzso Forest virus zzso the viral zzso is first zzso into a zzso zzso in zzso and this is then used for budding at plasma membrane zzso The zzso NC is thought to act as a template on which the viral envelope can be zzso In the present work we have characterized two zzso deletion zzso which did not assemble zzso in the zzso but which instead appeared to form zzso at the PM simultaneously with virus zzso The deletions were introduced in a zzso 14 zzso long zzso zzso that joins the zzso zzso domain with the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso Despite the deletions and the change in zzso zzso zzso particles were produced with almost zzso zzso It is suggested that the NC assembly zzso of the zzso is rescued through zzso interactions at zzso The results show that the zzso of zzso in the zzso is not a prerequisite for zzso zzso The apparent similarities of the zzso pathways of zzso and zzso zzso with those of type D and type C zzso are zzso
