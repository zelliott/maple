The zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso was modified to introduce the zzso zzso system of zzso coli, in which the promoters were engineered to be under the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene promoter of zzso zzso was taken to zzso express the zzso zzso zzso of the reporter gene zzso was driven by either zzso zzso or a modified version of the zzso gene promoter in which one or two zzso sites and/or zzso zzso between the zzso binding site and the zzso start zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso activity was evaluated by measuring zzso zzso zzso is a tightly regulated expression system suitable for the analysis of genes with low-level zzso while zzso is well adapted for the controlled expression of genes zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso To exemplify the usefulness of these tools, we constructed conditional zzso of the putative essential zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso proteins 1 and 3 of zzso zzso zzso Both genes were cloned into zzso and introduced in the parental zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were then zzso by replacing them with a zzso zzso zzso zzso was strictly dependent upon addition of zzso zzso we were able to construct the first conditional zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that following in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso these could be introduced into a large variety of zzso zzso zzso with different genetic zzso
