A modified protocol for DNA amplification by zzso chain reaction zzso coupled with laser zzso determination of the amount of zzso products, which allowed zzso of target sequence numbers in soil zzso was zzso The method was applied to monitor target loss during incubation of zzso zzso DNA in natural zzso zzso It revealed zzso zzso of target zzso After 60 days, zzso zzso and zzso of the initially added zzso genes on plasmids were zzso by zzso in a zzso sand soil, a clay soil, and a zzso clay soil, zzso zzso of zzso coli was used in parallel to zzso zzso molecules in soil extracts by their transforming zzso It was found that transformation by zzso was about 20 times more efficient and much less inhibited by constituents of soil extracts than transformation of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Lorenz, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso greater than zzso zzso loss was monitored in zzso zzso zzso activity was found up to 60 days after zzso of the zzso The studies indicate that zzso and zzso are sensitive methods for monitoring the persistence of zzso zzso DNA in zzso It is proposed that zzso transformation by zzso can be used for the monitoring in soil and other environments of genetically engineered organisms with zzso zzso The data suggest that genetic material may persist in soil for weeks and even for months after its release from zzso
