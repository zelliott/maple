zzso encodes the zzso zzso factor in zzso A zzso 900 zzso transcript originates from a single zzso and encompasses the putative zzso coding zzso We show that in human adult zzso zzso zzso involves multiple start zzso In addition to a previously defined major initiation site, transcripts originating at least 410 zzso upstream of this site were zzso Using a zzso specific zzso zzso embryonic and adult human zzso were screened for zzso zzso In humans, zzso zzso is not restricted to the zzso and the mature zzso zzso in the zzso and the adult respectively but can be detected in a range of other zzso Two human cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified which express zzso at similar levels to adult zzso The zzso zzso transcripts appear to have the same structure as those in adult zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells results in a diminution of zzso zzso while zzso of zzso in zzso acid differentiated zzso is zzso
