Two genes from zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso and zzso genes of soybean have been zzso These genes belong to a small zzso family and are similar to the soybean zzso gene family in the sequence of the predicted zzso zzso locations, and zzso expression of their zzso Application of zzso to zzso old zzso plants, zzso old zzso zzso and suspension culture cells all resulted in enhanced zzso transcript zzso zzso of the promoter sequences from the soybean and zzso genes yielded no significant sequence zzso however, three regions of near sequence identity are present between the two zzso zzso zzso
