zzso zzso is zzso zzso protein that interacts with the zzso zzso precursor zzso and regulates its zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with the zzso region of zzso We found that zzso interaction is enhanced in zzso stressed cells and zzso modification is required for the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso are required for the enhanced association with zzso in zzso stressed zzso this motif is 118 zzso acids closer to the zzso end of the protein than the zzso domain zzso acids zzso We identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso substitution of either zzso zzso diminished the enhanced association with zzso In brain zzso was found to be zzso and zzso of zzso was required for the interaction of zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso in zzso are zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso a zzso zzso family member that did not exhibit enhanced zzso association in zzso stressed zzso These findings indicate that the region of zzso that regulates association with zzso is located outside of, and zzso to, the zzso zzso zzso of this regulatory region may alter the zzso of the zzso domain to zzso zzso zzso
