Human zzso type 1 zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso from zzso warts were tested in zzso proliferation zzso using normal zzso Both zzso were found to be capable of zzso good zzso zzso Several zzso clones specific for zzso zzso protein were obtained from a donor who had consistently responded very well to zzso in these initial zzso They were maintained in culture by repeated stimulation with zzso and zzso using an zzso zzso zzso cell line as a source of zzso zzso Two of these clones zzso and zzso which behaved zzso have been studied in more zzso A series of overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire E1 zzso protein sequence was used to identify a single zzso zzso which maps to a strongly zzso region spanning zzso acid zzso 38 to zzso We have also tested the ability of a panel of major zzso complex class zzso and zzso zzso cell lines to present this zzso to the zzso clones in proliferation zzso The study reports that the zzso is restricted through zzso and that it can be recognized by T cells with different zzso zzso gene zzso
