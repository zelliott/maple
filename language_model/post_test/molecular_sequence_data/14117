In enteric bacteria three discrete families of type I restriction and modification systems zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for each of the three families were used to monitor the distribution of related systems in 37 of the 72 zzso zzso coli strains zzso the zzso zzso All 25 members of group A in this collection were zzso 12 were zzso nine have zzso genes in the zzso family, two in the zzso and one in the zzso Twelve zzso representing all groups other than A, were zzso five were zzso one has zzso genes in the zzso family, one in the zzso and three in the zzso The type ID genes are the first representatives of this family in zzso coli, the zzso strains could have alternative families of zzso zzso The type zzso and zzso systems added at least five new zzso to the five already identified in natural zzso of zzso zzso The distribution of zzso is inconsistent with the zzso of the bacterial strains derived from other zzso This zzso and the dissimilar coding sequences of zzso zzso genes both imply lateral transfer of zzso zzso
