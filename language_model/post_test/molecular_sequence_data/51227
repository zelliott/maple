In order to zzso the zzso gene family in zzso a zzso library was screened either with zzso zzso zzso or by differential screening and zzso We could identify six partial zzso clones belonging to two different groups of zzso genes which do not zzso and probably three distinct zzso One of these classes zzso to the previously described zzso from zzso and zzso A gene corresponding to the second group, as well as its border zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library and zzso in more zzso The zzso gene zzso contains three zzso and encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso initiation site was zzso The expression of the different group of genes was studied by northern zzso analysis: genes of both classes are expressed simultaneously and roughly at the same level between 25 and 35 days after zzso zzso gene copy number was estimated by Southern zzso zzso There appear to be seven or eight genes in one class and three in the other, located at different zzso
