zzso of zzso strategies in mouse models of zzso is hampered by the limited number of known zzso tumor zzso zzso Although tumor zzso can be identified based on zzso zzso zzso this approach is not readily accomplished for many tumor zzso We applied an alternative strategy based on a zzso immune response, zzso to the identification of tumor zzso in the zzso colon zzso cell line zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice with zzso cells by three different methods induced a protective immune response with zzso production of zzso zzso zzso of an zzso expression library resulted in the identification of the zzso zzso leukemia virus envelope zzso protein and the zzso zzso protein as candidate tumor zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated high levels of expression of the zzso transcript in zzso cells and in several other zzso tumor cell lines, whereas expression in normal zzso zzso was zzso zzso was found to be zzso expressed in tumor cell lines and in normal zzso Further analysis of the expressed zzso sequence indicated that it represents a zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso with DNA zzso the zzso zzso resulted in strong and specific zzso responses to this self zzso in all zzso zzso Thus, zzso offers a rapid means of identifying tumor zzso in zzso cancer zzso
