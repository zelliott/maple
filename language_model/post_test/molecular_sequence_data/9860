A zzso was zzso to zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso The zzso protein existed as a zzso with a molecular weight of 44 zzso It was zzso in an oxidized form and exhibited the zzso zzso at zzso 540 and zzso zzso in its resting form, and at 434 and 555 zzso upon reduction with zzso zzso The protein contained zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When the resting zzso was zzso incubated with zzso it was converted to a spectral species that is zzso very similar to zzso These properties are characteristics of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso coli, and zzso zzso Further the zzso terminal zzso acid sequence of the protein of zzso zzso was similar to those of these zzso These results suggest that the isolated zzso of zzso zzso would be a counterpart of the proteins in the zzso zzso
