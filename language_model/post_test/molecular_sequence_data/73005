A chemical zzso procedure has been developed for the synthesis of zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso linkage in place of a single zzso Good yields of zzso were obtained when a single zzso zzso to the zzso was used in the zzso zzso A zzso linkage was found to be reasonably stable to zzso but zzso by treatment with zzso or zzso to give zzso zzso A model human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso duplex containing an activated zzso was able to bind to zzso zzso protein with only zzso reduced affinity and to a zzso zzso zzso zzso with identical affinity compared to that of an unmodified zzso zzso incorporated at sites previously identified as being in close proximity to zzso protein were able to zzso to zzso zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso laser zzso zzso time of zzso mass zzso analysis provided strong evidence that a zzso duplex containing a zzso replacing the zzso at zzso had reacted specifically with zzso in the basic region of zzso zzso zzso The new chemical zzso method may be generally useful for identifying zzso in close proximity to zzso in basic zzso zzso of zzso
