The timed destruction of cell cycle regulatory proteins is of key importance in controlling cell cycle progression in zzso Recently, zzso from zzso zzso zzso was shown to play an important role in the zzso zzso of these proteins via the zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the fortuitous cloning of zzso for two zzso zzso from the plant zzso zzso on account of their ability to activate reporter gene expression in zzso directed by the zzso element from the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is essential for expression of the gene in zzso This element is zzso similar in sequence to the binding site for the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of genes involved in the zzso of carbohydrates other than zzso We report that zzso protein binds to the zzso element with similar specificity as a previously described plant nuclear protein factor, and that the zzso element is a target for an unknown zzso zzso zzso when zzso itself is zzso Interestingly, our data further indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso which is required for zzso degradation and is thus involved in control of the cell cycle, and for zzso gene zzso Our results suggest that the plant counterpart of zzso zzso is probably also instrumental in zzso zzso of specific proteins via an zzso zzso
