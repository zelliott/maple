We examined the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso associated zzso protein zzso using two different zzso The first approach, zzso detected spliced transcripts in a wide range of embryonic and adult zzso in a pattern overlapping substantially with the expression of zzso A second approach, the generation of transgenic mice expressing the zzso reporter gene from a zzso zzso promoter fragment, also demonstrated expression in a range of zzso with potential links to the zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso has a similar pattern of expression to human zzso and will serve as a useful model for functional studies of this zzso although species differences, such as the reduced zzso island zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso must be carefully zzso
