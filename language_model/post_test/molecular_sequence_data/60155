Cellular systems for handling transition metal zzso have been identified, but little is known about the structure and function of the specific trafficking zzso The zzso A resolution structure of the zzso copper zzso for zzso zzso zzso reveals a protein composed of two zzso The zzso domain is very similar to the zzso protein zzso and is likely to play a role in copper delivery and/or zzso The second domain resembles the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso I zzso in overall fold, but lacks all of the structural elements involved in zzso In the zzso two zzso zzso interact to form a zzso The zzso interface is remarkably similar to that in zzso suggesting a structural basis for target recognition by this zzso
