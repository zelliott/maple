zzso that neutralize zzso are directed at the zzso zzso major outer membrane protein zzso of zzso zzso A vaccine for zzso will need to include T cell zzso that elicit T helper zzso cells which provide help to zzso B zzso A limited number of zzso on zzso are able to elicit zzso cells and sequence diversity in the zzso zzso may alter T cell recognition of these zzso We investigated whether two sequence zzso proteins of zzso zzso that are both abundant and zzso could elicit T cell help for the production of zzso to zzso We found that outer membrane protein 2 zzso but not outer membrane protein 3 zzso was able to prime zzso mice for an zzso zzso response following boost with the intact zzso This demonstration of an zzso mechanism of T cell help in a bacterial system has important implications for the development of a zzso vaccine as well as the design of vaccines for other zzso zzso zzso zzso
