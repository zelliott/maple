zzso of many small heat shock genes in zzso and zzso is controlled by the ROSE zzso Of heat zzso gene zzso element, a zzso zzso structure in the zzso zzso zzso regulates translation of the zzso coli zzso gene coding for an inclusion zzso zzso We present first structural insights into a full-length ROSE element by examining the zzso zzso changes of zzso using detailed zzso and lead probing experiments between 20 and 50 degrees zzso The initial two zzso are stable at all temperatures tested and might assist in proper folding of the third zzso zzso structure, which restricts access to the zzso sequence at temperatures below 35 degrees zzso zzso zzso extension zzso experiments show that binding of the zzso zzso to zzso is enhanced at high zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso the final hairpin is rather zzso Single point zzso result in alternative structures with positive or negative effects on translation zzso Our study demonstrates how the combination of stable and unstable zzso controls translation efficiency in a complete zzso zzso
