Human cardiac zzso are protected from zzso stress triggered by inflammation after zzso injury zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and von zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso by expressing potent zzso defenses such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recently the zzso factor zzso has been shown to increase resistance to zzso stress by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2002) Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso and Finkel, zzso (2002) Science zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso also regulates the expression of zzso III, the zzso zzso in human cardiac zzso We found that depletion of zzso leads to a dramatic reduction of zzso III zzso and protein in zzso human cardiac zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is necessary for zzso expression of zzso zzso Next, we identified two putative zzso DNA binding sites in zzso III promoter at zzso and zzso zzso relative to the start zzso We demonstrated that both sequences are required for binding of zzso zzso to the zzso III promoter by performing zzso shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by insulin growth factor 1 prevented binding of zzso to zzso III zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso increased zzso III promoter zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso III was associated with enhanced zzso and zzso stress after serum zzso We conclude that zzso mediates zzso III zzso and this may play a critical role in the resistance to zzso stress in cardiac zzso
