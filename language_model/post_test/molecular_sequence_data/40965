Two families of bacterial zzso zzso zzso have been zzso the type I zzso are comprised of zzso toxin zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli, and several related zzso the type II zzso are comprised of zzso and zzso zzso we report zzso a new type II zzso zzso from an zzso zzso coli zzso strain isolated from an avian zzso Using a mouse zzso adrenal cell zzso zzso was shown to be less zzso than CT, zzso or zzso zzso of zzso was partially neutralized by zzso recognizing zzso or zzso but not by zzso zzso Genes zzso putative A zzso and B zzso of zzso were arranged in an zzso which was flanked by potential zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences demonstrated that the A zzso of zzso has moderate zzso to the A zzso of CT and zzso and high zzso to the A zzso of zzso and zzso The B zzso of zzso exhibited no significant zzso to the B zzso of CT and zzso and only moderate zzso to the B zzso of zzso and zzso The binding pattern of zzso for zzso was distinctive from that of either zzso or zzso The data suggest that other types of the type II zzso zzso are circulating in the environment and that host specificity of type II zzso is likely governed by changes in the B zzso which mediate binding to zzso
