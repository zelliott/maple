We describe a novel plant transformation technique, termed zzso that combines the advantages of the zzso transformation system with the high efficiency of zzso DNA zzso zzso transformation allows integration of the gene of interest without zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes zzso and zzso from zzso zzso that are required in bacteria for zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso were placed under the control of the zzso promoter and zzso with a target zzso containing border sequences zzso the gene of zzso zzso expression zzso in tobacco and in zzso cells indicated that zzso gene products caused zzso zzso in zzso at the right border zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso transformed tobacco zzso were obtained after zzso of zzso and zzso genes together with a zzso marker flanked by border zzso Some zzso exhibited right junctions with plant DNA that corresponded precisely to the sequence expected for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that is transferred to plant zzso zzso zzso We designate these as zzso zzso as distinguished from zzso zzso Both types of zzso were found in some transformed zzso The frequency of zzso zzso was zzso that of zzso zzso
