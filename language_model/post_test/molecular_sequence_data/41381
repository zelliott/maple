zzso zzso zzso systems segregate plasmids into each daughter zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso system, adapter protein zzso binds to zzso zzso forming a zzso around which the DNA is zzso zzso This complex zzso the growth of a filament of zzso zzso zzso which pushes the plasmids to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso system consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a DNA zzso zzso which perform analogous roles to those in zzso despite being unrelated in sequence and zzso We have dissected in detail the binding sites that comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex by electron zzso and determined a crystal structure of zzso bound to the zzso zzso We show that the zzso complex takes the form of a flexible zzso filament, formed by lateral coating along the zzso from zzso the full length of which is required for the successful in zzso stabilization of zzso zzso We also show that zzso from zzso zzso forms a zzso superstructure resembling that of zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso filament may bind to, and zzso the zzso filament by forming such a zzso structure around zzso The zzso superstructure of this zzso may indicate zzso evolution between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
