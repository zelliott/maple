A distinct zzso strain zzso was isolated in cell cultures from a stool sample obtained from a zzso 3-year-old female zzso zzso zzso zzso that was born at the breeding colony of the University of Washington in zzso Unlike other known zzso zzso strains including zzso monkey zzso zzso which bears zzso or zzso zzso zzso monkey zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso specificity and zzso monkey zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso strain was shown to bear zzso specificity as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as gene sequence zzso The virus in the original zzso stool was also shown to bear zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso strain exhibited a zzso zzso zzso I specificity and zzso zzso A zzso The zzso probe formed zzso zzso hybrid bands with zzso zzso of various bovine zzso strains and zzso only 2-3 hybrid bands with zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso suggesting a possible bovine origin of the zzso zzso analysis of serum samples obtained from selected zzso zzso in the colony suggested that a zzso bearing zzso specificity was endemic among zzso for at least 8 years zzso This is the first report describing an isolation of a zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso and possibly a zzso zzso Because of its unique zzso zzso this virus may prove to be valuable in challenge studies in a zzso zzso model in studies of zzso zzso
