During zzso class II molecules of the major zzso complex exist as complexes of the zzso alpha and beta chains in association with zzso of the zzso chain zzso The zzso zzso contains sequences necessary for proper targeting of class II to zzso zzso where zzso is zzso zzso also prevents the premature association of zzso peptides with class II zzso It is not known whether the effect of zzso on zzso binding extends to other zzso of class II, specifically zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso at the cell surface were tested for their ability to interact with zzso zzso Most toxins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to bind to cells expressing this alpha beta zzso complex with levels comparable to cells expressing only alpha beta chains at the cell zzso zzso expressing surface alpha beta zzso complexes zzso zzso populations of peripheral blood T cells in association with these zzso zzso of toxic shock syndrome toxin zzso and subsequent stimulation of T cells were reduced by the presence of the zzso This reduction was not due to an zzso in the repertoire of T cells responding to zzso in the presence of zzso Data from experiments with a zzso clone suggest that interactions between class II molecules and zzso zzso receptors occur during zzso zzso stimulation and that surface zzso does not interfere with such zzso
