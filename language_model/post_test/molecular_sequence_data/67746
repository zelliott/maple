A method has been established to zzso delete combinations of genes from the zzso zzso to test the effect on virus replication and host responses to zzso zzso the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a truncated zzso zzso gene were deleted from the zzso of the zzso adapted zzso strain zzso and replaced with zzso zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso marker gene to create zzso virus zzso zzso the zzso gene was removed by zzso zzso between the two zzso sites involving expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to create zzso virus zzso The zzso and zzso genes were subsequently deleted from the zzso of zzso using the same zzso marker zzso to construct virus zzso These sequential deletions of zzso genes were shown not to alter virus replication zzso
