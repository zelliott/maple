The zzso gene zzso functions as the anterior body pattern organizer of zzso zzso lacking zzso expressed zzso fail to develop anterior segments including head and zzso In zzso eggs, zzso zzso is localized in the anterior pole region and the zzso protein forms an zzso concentration zzso zzso activity is required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes and the zzso suppression of zzso distributed maternal zzso zzso in the anterior region of the zzso zzso genes as well as other zzso genes or members of the zzso zzso gene cascade have been found to be zzso in animal zzso In contrast, zzso zzso have been identified only in close relatives of the zzso fly zzso This poses the question of how the zzso gene evolved and adopted its unique function in organizing zzso zzso We have cloned zzso from a zzso zzso fly, zzso zzso zzso zzso and show that the gene originated from a recent zzso of the direct zzso of the zzso gene zzso termed zzso which specifies zzso zzso in zzso
