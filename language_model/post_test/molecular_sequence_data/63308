The molecular diversity of the zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso in 71 zzso from 26 zzso of zzso was zzso The zzso based on zzso zzso zzso indicated that there were 6 unit classes, named according to the zzso zzso they zzso zzso namely the long zzso long zzso long zzso short zzso short zzso and short zzso unit zzso The long and short zzso unit classes were found in the zzso zzso zzso the only perennial zzso The long zzso unit class was closely related to the short C1 unit class, while the short zzso unit class was closely related to the long A1 and long B1 unit zzso However, the short D1 unit class was more divergent from the other unit zzso There was only one unit class per zzso in zzso whereas zzso in the zzso often have zzso Most of the sequences captured belonged to the long A1 unit zzso zzso identified as the long B1 unit class were found in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The short C1 unit class was found in the zzso species carrying the C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and all the zzso zzso The short D1 unit class was found in all the zzso species and two clones of zzso zzso It is noteworthy that in previous studies the B zzso was found only in zzso species and the D zzso only in zzso zzso zzso we found that various zzso zzso species contained the B1 and D1 zzso The long B1 unit class was found in 3 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso collected in Morocco and in 2 zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso collected in Algeria and Libya, respectively, whereas only 1 clone of zzso zzso zzso had the short D1 zzso Thus there might be a clue as to where to search for zzso carrying the B and D zzso zzso zzso was found to be the most diverse species, possibly harboring the A, B, and C zzso The long zzso and short zzso are the unit classes typical of zzso zzso These results could explain the roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the evolution of the zzso zzso Furthermore, one clone of the zzso zzso zzso was found to have sequences belonging to the short D1 unit class, which could indicate that zzso zzso might have been the zzso of zzso zzso and not, as zzso earlier, zzso zzso The evolution of zzso did not follow the molecular zzso The path zzso is that the C zzso is more ancient than the A and B zzso and closer to the zzso of zzso zzso the only existing zzso which is presumed to be the most ancestral species in the zzso
