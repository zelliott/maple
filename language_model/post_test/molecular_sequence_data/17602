The zzso zzso zzso can inhibit zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso of zzso The results indicate that this phenomenon is specific with respect to both the zzso and the zzso whose zzso is affected, strongly suggesting that this involves an interaction between the zzso and its zzso The effect of the zzso on zzso is zzso With different zzso zzso the clearest difference is observed between type A and type S zzso the former exert a strong zzso of zzso whereas the latter exhibit a weak effect or no effect at zzso Type A zzso have been previously shown to cause a zzso change in various zzso zzso zzso species in zzso were localized either to the zzso space or bound to the outer surface of the zzso membrane and thus exposed to zzso The results are consistent with the hypothesis that binding of zzso to zzso zzso a zzso on the protein that is zzso for its release from the zzso
