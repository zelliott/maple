The majority of all genes have so far been identified and zzso systematically through in zzso gene zzso Here we report the finding of zzso zzso zzso active regions zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso by the use of zzso zzso We have measured the zzso expression during zzso growth on rich zzso and minimal zzso zzso The identified zzso account for zzso of the genes as they are currently zzso and additionally we find 84 putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso is predicted to act as a zzso control on zzso and an zzso transcript was observed opposite the zzso zzso factor zzso Through this work we have discovered a long zzso 3' untranslated region zzso in a group of zzso genes that is predicted to fold into a large and highly stable secondary zzso One of the genes having this tail is zzso which encodes a target of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso
