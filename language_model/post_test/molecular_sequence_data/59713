zzso zzso is the principal zzso responsible for the process of gastric acid zzso This zzso is expressed in a zzso manner in gastric zzso zzso To explore the mechanisms regulating its zzso we zzso differentiated canine zzso cells in primary culture with zzso reporter genes and assessed zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of this gene demonstrated a remarkable zzso in zzso activity associated with a segment between bases zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso initiation zzso zzso shift zzso with competition and zzso analysis demonstrated that this segment is specifically bound by the zzso factor zzso A point zzso eliminating zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso activity by zzso indicating that this zzso binding site is important for zzso zzso zzso Although these studies indicate that zzso is required to maintain a high concentration of the zzso gene in the zzso cell, its zzso expression must rely on other elements because zzso is a zzso expressed zzso zzso
