We describe a high-resolution radiation hybrid zzso map of the zzso short arm of human zzso 11 containing the zzso gene and the associated zzso tumor disease zzso Thirteen human zzso genes and 17 new anonymous zzso were mapped by a statistical analysis of the zzso of markers in 102 zzso radiation hybrids retaining fragments of human zzso zzso The 17 anonymous zzso were generated from zzso zzso containing human zzso zzso by using zzso A comprehensive map of all 30 zzso and a framework map of nine clusters of zzso ordered at odds of zzso were constructed by a zzso zzso approach by using the computer program zzso This zzso map zzso one new gene to zzso zzso zzso provides more precise order information for several zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirms previous map orders for other zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and maps 17 new anonymous zzso within the zzso zzso This zzso map should prove useful in better defining the positions of the zzso and associated zzso tumor zzso zzso
