Thirty zzso zzso zzso isolated from rabbit zzso DNA libraries, were restriction mapped and shown to contain approximately 100 zzso genes in zzso of zzso Twenty-two of the zzso clones were grouped into seven distinct zzso The zzso genes were separated by an average of 8 zzso although some were separated by less than 3 zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of two of these zzso genes with the sequences of another 11 zzso genes showed that they were all generally more than zzso zzso suggesting that rabbit zzso genes are members of one highly zzso gene zzso Most rabbit zzso molecules have the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and are designated zzso A small number (less than zzso of zzso molecules lack these zzso zzso zzso and are designated zzso The zzso containing zzso clones were zzso with synthetic zzso zzso designed to be specific for genes zzso zzso or zzso zzso At least 50% of the zzso zzso genes zzso with the zzso zzso and thus presumably zzso zzso zzso as few as zzso of the genes could be identified as zzso zzso molecules based on zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso genes did not zzso with either zzso and could not be classified as zzso or zzso We propose that the predominance of serum zzso zzso in contrast to the predominance of zzso zzso zzso zzso may reflect preferential usage of a few zzso zzso zzso The implications of this idea toward explaining the zzso inheritance of zzso zzso are zzso
