We have established a method to estimate the number of clones in peripheral blood, using rearranged T cell zzso gamma genes as zzso zzso selecting cells at random, and establishing the sizes of the clones to which they zzso zzso sizes were zzso by a zzso zzso test based on the zzso zzso zzso which typically detects 1-2 copies of its target zzso All clones chosen for study were subsequently zzso in blood, and sizes ranged from 3 zzso zzso (1 cell in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso permitting numbers of clones to be estimated from the harmonic mean of clone zzso Two independent estimates from a healthy young adult zzso years old) gave zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Two other healthy young adults gave zzso of 40,000 and 55,000 zzso zzso in four healthy active older zzso years old) adults were more variable but generally lower, being zzso zzso 14,000 and zzso zzso despite enlarged clones making up zzso of the compartment in the last zzso Overall, young adults had smaller clones zzso zzso zzso zzso If the human body contains 5 zzso of blood, clones have 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso These results confirm a diverse repertoire of rearranged T cell zzso gamma zzso The number of clones thus defined are broadly consistent with other estimates of repertoire, despite differences in marker genes used and zzso of cells zzso
