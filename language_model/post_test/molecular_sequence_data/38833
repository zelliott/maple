zzso zzso is a critical step for the growth and zzso of solid zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a specific and potent zzso factor and contributes to the development of solid tumors by promoting tumor zzso zzso it is a prime therapeutic target for the development of zzso for treatment of zzso We identified from zzso libraries zzso zzso that inhibit the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 2-4 zzso They have no effect on binding of basic zzso growth factor to cellular zzso The zzso inhibit the proliferation of human zzso vein zzso cells induced by zzso without zzso The peptides bind to zzso and inhibit binding of both zzso and zzso suggesting that the peptides interact with the main body of zzso but not the zzso domain that is absent in zzso The identified peptides block the zzso induced by zzso in zzso in the chick zzso membrane and the rabbit zzso Furthermore, one of the zzso zzso blocks the growth and zzso of zzso zzso human colon zzso cells in nude zzso Based on our results, the zzso zzso may be effective for the treatment of various human tumors and other zzso diseases that are related to the action of zzso and could also serve as leads for development of more effective zzso
