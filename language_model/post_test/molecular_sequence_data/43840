zzso zzso were isolated by means of random zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso which could not support the growth of a zzso zzso zzso delta zzso on plates containing zzso M zzso zzso zzso or zzso M zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso were sensitive to both zzso and zzso or to zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed that twelve of the zzso had single zzso acid zzso All the zzso except for zzso were of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and located in the putative zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso activities of the zzso zzso were measured with zzso membrane zzso eight of the zzso lost both zzso activities completely under all pH conditions zzso Although both zzso and zzso retained low zzso zzso activity, zzso lost zzso zzso activity, while zzso retained normal zzso zzso activity at pH zzso and zzso Interestingly, at pH zzso zzso no longer showed any zzso zzso zzso zzso retained relatively high zzso activities, although their pH dependence was zzso These observations supported the previous indication that zzso is part of the pH sensor zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 90, zzso zzso exhibited about zzso each of the activities only at pH zzso and showed a similar pH dependence to zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso and/or its vicinity may also contribute to the pH zzso
