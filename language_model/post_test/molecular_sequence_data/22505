The interaction of the zzso protein zzso also zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso was studied using zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso interacts with a 40 zzso region in the zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso expression systems, deletion of the zzso domain enhanced surface expression of zzso zzso of the zzso domain to the zzso tail of the reporter protein zzso caused zzso of the construct in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the last 36 zzso acids of zzso to zzso also caused zzso zzso which was abolished by removal or zzso of a putative retention motif zzso at the zzso end of zzso Imaging of zzso zzso channels in zzso cells suggested that zzso zzso was largely retained in the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso enhanced trafficking of zzso to the surface zzso Our results suggest that binding of zzso to zzso zzso the surface expression of the channel, most likely by virtue of a zzso retention signal at the zzso of zzso Thus, the zzso protein zzso may represent a zzso zzso that causes zzso of the channel to the zzso
