zzso are targeted for zzso by the zzso zzso by the addition of a zzso chain before being zzso by the 26 S zzso Previously, a zzso of the zzso zzso was identified that was able to bind to zzso in zzso and thus proposed to act as a zzso recognition zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso rendered cells viable indicating that other zzso zzso receptors must zzso In this study, we describe zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso This gene is also not required for cell zzso however, the zzso zzso is zzso lethal with zzso in other zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is able to rescue zzso at 32 degrees C but zzso of a zzso zzso a version of zzso that does not bind to zzso cannot and leads to greatly reduced viability when used to rescue the zzso double zzso The zzso protein was unable to bind to zzso in zzso but the zzso and zzso proteins were found to bind to one another in zzso which taken together with the genetic data suggests that they are also closely associated in zzso
