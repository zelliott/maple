zzso acid and its zzso zzso have been widely used in the treatment of zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that they exert the beneficial effect through the zzso of a zzso zzso on zzso which has remained elusive to zzso Here we show that a novel zzso designated zzso because of its high similarity to zzso is a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in human, zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cells and activate zzso gamma S binding in a zzso zzso zzso acid specifically binds to zzso membrane and its binding is replaced by zzso This finding will open a new phase of research on the zzso role of zzso acid and will be a clue to develop novel zzso zzso
