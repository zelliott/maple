The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is necessary for processing of zzso and assembly of 60 S zzso zzso zzso is unusual in that it contains four zzso recognition motifs zzso including one zzso zzso as well as several auxiliary zzso two zzso regions between the zzso and a zzso domain rich in zzso and zzso To examine the functional importance of these zzso we isolated random and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso function in zzso Our results indicate that each zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso in zzso aromatic zzso of zzso cause a zzso lethal zzso and diminished 60 S zzso zzso zzso The zzso 68 zzso acids are important but apparently not zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes slow growth, decreased zzso production, and zzso of zzso zzso of both zzso motifs is lethal but replacement of most of the zzso zzso with zzso has no apparent zzso These zzso zzso may serve as zzso or zzso to separate the zzso
