The zzso element, an zzso DNA zzso is known to be involved in the zzso regulation of genes for heat shock proteins in a variety of zzso The zzso element was identified as the target for the zzso zzso which zzso zzso of heat shock genes under normal growth zzso Our data reveal that the zzso element is not involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso genes in zzso zzso Apparently, zzso does not zzso an zzso zzso The mechanisms of heat shock regulation of the zzso genes in zzso therefore diverge significantly from the regulatory zzso identified in other zzso A structural analysis of the zzso zzso element revealed a stem of 11 zzso pairs and a loop of only 5 zzso This folding differs from a structure with a 9 zzso loop suggested previously on the basis of computer zzso The zzso structure leads to a slight stabilization of the zzso zzso that is more pronounced at normal growth temperature than under heat shock zzso
