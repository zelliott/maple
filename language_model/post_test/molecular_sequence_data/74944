We have characterized the functional attributes of a zzso pair region containing the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing a series of zzso that alter the orientation, location, or extent of the zzso zzso sequences with respect to the zzso zzso In each instance, the extent of the zzso response was monitored in zzso by zzso expression into a zzso zzso gene and was compared with the results of zzso zzso in zzso As expected, zzso termination in zzso is dependent on the proper orientation of the zzso and a tandem repeat of the zzso increases termination zzso zzso the zzso zzso only 14 zzso from the promoter does not affect termination significantly, supporting the belief that sequences outside of the zzso pair zzso itself are zzso One zzso which lacks 116 base pairs, including the region zzso the normal zzso end points, still reduces zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Our results indicate that the zzso response depends primarily on sequences in this zzso pair segment, causing zzso zzso to terminate zzso in a region zzso zzso further zzso
