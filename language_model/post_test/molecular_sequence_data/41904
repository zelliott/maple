The complete sequence zzso zzso of the zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso species A is zzso This zzso is compact and very zzso rich zzso zzso It contains genes for 2 zzso zzso zzso 22 transfer zzso zzso and 13 zzso of the zzso inner membrane respiratory zzso The gene arrangement is the same as in zzso zzso except that the positions of two zzso zzso are reversed and a third zzso is transcribed from the complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso and most zzso were similar to zzso zzso Two zzso had zzso secondary structures comparable with those of zzso zzso zzso The very small putative control region zzso zzso contains no sequence motifs similar to those used in zzso and other insects for initiation of zzso and zzso
