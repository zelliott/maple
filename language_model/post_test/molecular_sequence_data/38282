zzso manipulation has been used for several decades with the purpose of inducing breast cancer zzso On the one hand, hormone zzso and zzso administration were used on the rationale that zzso induce proliferation of their target zzso Before the advent of the zzso zzso on the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain clinical zzso The rationale for the use of zzso zzso was totally zzso In fact, the efficacy of both treatments was zzso A zzso explanation for zzso zzso is urgently needed in order to provide a rationale for its use in therapeutic fields, and to develop markers to identify this zzso in order to recognize responsive zzso In this report, we use zzso cells (a zzso zzso as a model to study zzso zzso The proliferation rate of zzso cells is decreased by zzso In order to isolate zzso sequences induced by zzso a zzso library was prepared from zzso cells grown in the presence and absence of zzso Twenty nine zzso expressed unique sequences were zzso Seven of them were zzso to known zzso 12 of them were zzso to expressed sequence tags zzso and 10 sequences had no zzso in the zzso The two sequences showing the highest induction by zzso zzso and zzso were chosen for further zzso The sequence of the zzso coding region has zzso zzso to the bovine zzso gene and zzso identity to bovine zzso zzso and it is zzso to the human zzso protein 3 zzso It has been suggested that zzso is involved in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells is clearly affected by zzso zzso It is likely that zzso may be involved in these zzso zzso The E9 zzso is a putative zzso protein of the zzso family of zzso zzso A member of this family, zzso is involved in zzso The E9 zzso is highly expressed in zzso cells treated with zzso a treatment which results in decreased proliferation rate and increased DNA zzso This correlation suggests that E9 may be a zzso of zzso zzso of breast zzso
