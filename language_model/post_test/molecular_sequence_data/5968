The construction and screening of a small zzso library consisting of 2 zzso zzso clones in the zzso expression zzso system are zzso This library consists of zzso heavy chain sequences isolated from the zzso of a mouse zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso A portion of this library was used to produce a pool of zzso zzso which were screened for production of zzso fragments zzso to zzso zzso without prior expression in zzso zzso The pool of 30 clones was found to contain at least 6 different populations of zzso indicating that diversity existed within the zzso Positive clones were isolated from the zzso system and confirmed as being capable of producing a zzso zzso zzso by expression as a zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso One of these clones was returned to the zzso system using a different transfer zzso and zzso binding zzso The results presented here show that the concept of the construction and screening of a zzso expression library is feasible even with zzso zzso such as zzso heavy chain fragments, and that the zzso expression zzso system has the potential to produce zzso expression libraries which can be screened directly for the desired zzso
