zzso zzso is currently the only zzso of which the zzso genes occur on a linear zzso To get insight into the origin of this zzso and into the zzso strategy of this zzso zzso the sequence of the linear zzso of strain zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed four zzso regions with linear plasmids of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a common origin of these zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso similar to zzso and type IV zzso respectively, showed that zzso region zzso was involved in zzso zzso and pointed toward a novel function for zzso zzso in zzso Additionally, zzso had three regions that were unique for zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso of regions U2 and zzso respectively, indicated that their role in symptom development was limited compared with that of the previously identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso situated in region zzso Thus, zzso is a typical zzso linear zzso with a composite structure that encodes core functions involved in zzso maintenance and accessory functions, some possibly acquired through horizontal gene transfer, implicated in zzso and the interaction with the zzso
