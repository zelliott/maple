The primary structures of zzso A to G of all zzso zzso retinal proteins identified in newly isolated zzso have been determined from the zzso sequence of the zzso protein zzso Using zzso methods, gene fragments zzso the A- to zzso region of zzso proteins were directly amplified from the total zzso DNA of the seven new zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to highly zzso regions in the zzso A to G were designed from the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and some zzso were effective for the amplification of the gene zzso zzso to zzso region of all new zzso zzso The primer corresponding to zzso region was designed either from the zzso sequence of bop and zzso or from the zzso zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso Three new zzso proteins were identified from the zzso acid zzso which was deduced from the zzso sequence of the genes zzso A- to zzso region of the zzso zzso It was found that not only the zzso acid zzso but also the zzso sequence of the gene zzso the zzso and zzso region, in which a number of important zzso for zzso zzso are located, is highly zzso in three new zzso zzso Analysis of the primary structures of the A- to zzso region of new zzso proteins revealed that one has about zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and the rest have about zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
