zzso protein zzso is crucial for the assembly of the large zzso zzso and zzso the translation of its own zzso zzso zzso carries two zzso sites, the first folding into a zzso and the second into an imperfect stem and zzso These two sites and the zzso site on zzso zzso zzso are recognized similarly using a single zzso site located on one face of zzso In this work, using gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, we first exclude the possibility that zzso forms a zzso which would allow each zzso to bind one site of the zzso zzso we show, using affinity zzso and zzso experiments, that only one zzso of zzso binds to the zzso zzso despite the presence of two potential binding zzso zzso using zzso chemical zzso we show that the two zzso sites are in zzso This interaction provides an explanation for the single occupancy of the zzso The two interacting sites could form a single hybrid site or the binding of zzso to a first site may inhibit binding to the zzso Models of regulation compatible with our data are zzso
