zzso zzso elicits its behavioral effects by acting on the zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso into the synaptic zzso We previously demonstrated that a human zzso construct in which the first 22 zzso acids were truncated was not zzso by zzso of protein zzso C, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso which was zzso Nonetheless, in all functions tested to date, which include zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso away from the cell surface in response to protein zzso C zzso the truncated zzso was indistinguishable from the full-length zzso zzso Here, however, we show that in zzso cells zzso expressing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced by approximately zzso whether measured by zzso of a population of cells or by zzso combined with the zzso technique in the whole cell zzso We further demonstrate in a full-length zzso construct that simultaneous zzso of the five zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso produces the same zzso as zzso zzso but dramatically impaired zzso In contrast, simultaneous zzso of these same five zzso to zzso zzso to simulate zzso results in normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso background, the single zzso to zzso of zzso 7 or zzso 12 restored a significant fraction of zzso zzso whereas zzso to zzso of zzso 2, 4, or 13 was without significant effect on zzso We propose that zzso of one or more zzso in the zzso of human zzso most likely zzso or zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso Quite surprisingly, zzso zzso shifts zzso from a zzso state to a zzso state for zzso zzso zzso without affecting inward zzso These data raise the therapeutic possibility of interfering selectively with zzso zzso zzso without altering zzso zzso zzso
