The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso cloned in zzso coli, has shown that it contains the five highly zzso sequences of the zzso domain found in other zzso zzso belongs to the zzso motif of such a domain and is involved in hydrogen bonding with the zzso ring of the zzso zzso of zzso by 11 other zzso acids resulted in a decrease in zzso resistance, indicating that zzso resistance zzso by zzso is related to zzso zzso The effect of the zzso on the zzso domain is discussed with the zzso complex as a zzso
