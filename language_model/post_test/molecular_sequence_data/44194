The mouse zzso zzso zzso gene has been zzso zzso and zzso This nuclear gene encodes a zzso protein that is shared among several zzso acid zzso complexes and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is contained within an approximately zzso region and consists of 14 zzso ranging in size from 69 to 521 zzso The open reading frame codes for a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted mature protein of zzso zzso acids that is highly zzso among zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analyses have shown the gene to have zzso initiation sites with zzso differences in relative zzso The zzso zzso region is zzso rich and lacks a zzso box, but does contain zzso element and multiple zzso zzso consensus zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that the zzso zzso in various zzso is approximately zzso zzso in zzso The zzso gene has been localized to the zzso region of zzso 12, approximately 21 zzso from the zzso
