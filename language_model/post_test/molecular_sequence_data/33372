The tightly regulated production of distinct zzso protein zzso zzso involves differential zzso of 3 mutually exclusive first zzso zzso zzso zzso to the alternative 3' zzso sites zzso of zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso 1 and zzso zzso diversity is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso We also zzso distinctive regulatory elements that promote the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso 3' zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso 3' zzso in zzso zzso zzso A hybrid zzso driven by zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso patterns but differed from zzso zzso patterns, suggesting that promoter identity affects zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso factor zzso ultraviolet zzso zzso to the zzso zzso junction zzso a sequence that zzso the zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso depletion of zzso allowed zzso zzso to zzso to the zzso 3' zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso These findings identify for the first time that an zzso binding site also can serve as a 3' zzso in a zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso gene expression involves zzso regulation coupled with a complex zzso regulatory zzso
