The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the production of zzso zzso the building blocks for DNA synthesis and zzso The levels of the cellular zzso are tightly controlled, in large part through zzso control of zzso One important reason for controlling the zzso relates to their ability to affect the zzso of DNA replication and, zzso the cellular zzso zzso We have previously isolated a set of zzso of zzso coli zzso that are characterized by altered zzso pools and increased zzso rates zzso zzso Here, we show that one particular set of zzso zzso carrying zzso at the zzso zzso specificity site, is characterized by relatively modest zzso pool zzso but exceptionally strong zzso zzso when measured in a zzso forward zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence indicating that this high zzso is due to a zzso of the DNA mismatch repair system, leading to zzso and error zzso The results indicate that, surprisingly, even modest zzso of the cellular zzso pools, particularly when the pool zzso promote particular types of replication zzso can have dramatic consequences for zzso zzso
