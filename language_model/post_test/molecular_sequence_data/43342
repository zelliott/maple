The zzso and zzso proteins of zzso virus zzso are replication zzso proteins that bind the viral zzso origin of zzso zzso the origin in a zzso and zzso fashion, and mediate zzso unwinding of the DNA duplex via an zzso zzso activity, thus initiating a strand displacement mechanism of viral DNA zzso zzso and zzso studies have identified zzso zzso that demonstrate a zzso negative zzso in zzso and in zzso suggesting the possibility that zzso of zzso is essential for certain zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the ability of the largest of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was demonstrated through the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein interaction was confirmed in zzso through zzso experiments with a zzso expressed zzso zzso fusion protein in combination with zzso zzso zzso in a coupled in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso and zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso indicate that zzso acid sequences required for zzso zzso occur between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified two essential motifs within this zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso bearing a zzso zzso repeat reminiscent of those found in zzso zzso and zzso a previously recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso of either of these regions from the full-length zzso resulted in severe impairment of zzso zzso In addition, gel zzso zzso and protein zzso experiments indicated that zzso forms a zzso complex in the presence of zzso zzso zzso
