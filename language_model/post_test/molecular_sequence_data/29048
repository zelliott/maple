Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with reduced expression in ineffective zzso on the pea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso They zzso small zzso containing a putative signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso and show zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso For each zzso multiple bands were detected by zzso Southern zzso Northern analysis showed that all five genes were expressed exclusively in zzso and that their zzso expression patterns were similar to that of the zzso zzso gene during zzso zzso Their transcripts were localized predominantly from the zzso zzso to the zzso part of zzso zone III in effective zzso resembling the zzso zzso However, transcripts in ineffective zzso zzso were localized in zzso regions than those in the effective zzso These results indicate that these zzso are abundant in pea zzso and that their successive expression during zzso development is associated with zzso zzso
