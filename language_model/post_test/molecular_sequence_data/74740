A zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from seawater off zzso Island in Korea, and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso at 30 degrees C and in the presence of approximately 2 % zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso joins zzso zzso zzso with which it exhibited a zzso zzso gene sequence similarity value of zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as the major fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso There were no distinct zzso and, particularly, zzso properties to differentiate strain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso data and differential zzso properties, together with the zzso zzso demonstrated that strain zzso is distinguishable from the type strain of zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and genetic data, therefore, strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
