We have previously identified a novel protein zzso zzso in the brain of zzso In the present study, we cloned the zzso protein zzso gene zzso a protein of 385 zzso acid zzso from zzso The overall zzso acid sequence and the zzso domain of zzso zzso shows zzso and zzso identity to that of rat zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso By zzso in zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso was mainly in the zzso To explore the in zzso function of zzso during zzso development, we used zzso zzso approach and found that zzso zzso displayed enlarged zzso zzso and smaller zzso zzso in zzso zzso was further performed to analyze the brain defects in zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso was found normal in zzso zzso at zzso while expression of zzso exerted changes in zzso boundary and zzso in zzso zzso at zzso These data suggest that zzso may play an important role in later zzso expansion in zzso brain zzso Although the zzso zzso protein produced in insect cells was active and could zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in the embryonic brain of zzso is not clear at the present time and needs further zzso
