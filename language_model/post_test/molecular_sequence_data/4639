zzso and zzso are members of a newly discovered family of proteins that regulate translation zzso zzso is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, but it is highest in zzso where protein synthesis is markedly increased by zzso zzso is highest in liver and zzso where very little zzso is zzso zzso proteins bind to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and inhibit translation of capped zzso in zzso and in zzso In rat zzso zzso is zzso in at least five sites, all of which conform to the consensus, zzso Both zzso proteins are zzso in response to insulin or growth factors, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the appropriate zzso promotes zzso of zzso zzso This allows zzso to bind to zzso zzso thereby increasing the amount of the zzso complex and the rate of translation zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso and increases binding to zzso Unlike zzso zzso is readily zzso by zzso in zzso suggesting that regulation of the two proteins zzso However, increasing zzso in cells also promotes zzso of zzso Thus, zzso proteins appear to be key zzso not only of the zzso effects of insulin and growth factors on protein zzso but also of the zzso effects of zzso Moreover, by controlling zzso zzso proteins may be involved in the control of cell zzso as increasing zzso is zzso and can even cause zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso readily zzso both zzso and zzso in zzso but zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not zzso the effects of insulin on increasing zzso of the zzso proteins in zzso or skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso neither zzso nor zzso at a significant rate when the proteins are bound to zzso zzso the role of zzso zzso in promoting the zzso of zzso complexes is not zzso Of several protein zzso tested, only zzso zzso zzso zzso when it was bound zzso Indeed, the bound form of zzso was zzso more rapidly than the free zzso However, it is unlikely that zzso zzso II regulates either zzso zzso as the major site zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso II in zzso is not zzso in zzso and zzso is not a zzso for zzso zzso zzso and genetic evidence indicates that the zzso zzso is involved in the control of zzso and zzso Thus, zzso proteins may be zzso of the effects of this zzso on protein synthesis and cell zzso
