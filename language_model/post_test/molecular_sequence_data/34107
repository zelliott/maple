A putative zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso responsible for causing African Sleeping zzso The zzso zzso has greater sequence similarity to bacterial sources of soluble zzso than to zzso Type I zzso found in higher zzso The zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso DNA and active, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to approximate zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso conversion of zzso to zzso In the direction of zzso formation, zzso has a zzso value of zzso zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso In the direction of zzso formation, zzso has a zzso value of zzso zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso zzso preference was examined and zzso zzso both zzso and zzso almost zzso distinguishing the zzso zzso from other characterized zzso Furthermore, zzso binds zzso in a cooperative fashion, another unique characteristic of zzso zzso The apparent native molecular weight of zzso zzso is 112 zzso corresponding to zzso as determined through size exclusion zzso zzso interference studies in zzso zzso were carried out to evaluate the importance of zzso in zzso Upon zzso of zzso a small reduction in zzso growth was observed suggesting zzso has an important zzso role in zzso zzso
