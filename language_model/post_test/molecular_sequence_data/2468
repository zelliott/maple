The long control region zzso of human zzso zzso encompasses zzso of the viral zzso and contains an intricate network of zzso responsive zzso In the zzso of seven unrelated zzso namely zzso 6, 8, 11, 16, 18 and 33, we have identified clusters of 4 to 7 zzso motifs suggesting nuclear factor I zzso binding zzso We randomly selected 20 (out of a total of zzso of these motifs and showed that pure zzso from zzso liver protects virtually the same zzso as a factor present in crude zzso nuclear zzso The zzso obtained with zzso extracts in the zzso of zzso are eliminated in competition experiments by an zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso fragments from the zzso of zzso 16 and 18, which contain this cluster of zzso binding sites associated with binding sites of unrelated zzso factors, function as zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso from zzso exhibiting exclusively zzso binding sites, or zzso zzso sites from zzso are functionally zzso zzso seems to be necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso
