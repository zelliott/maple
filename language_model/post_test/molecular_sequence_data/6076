We have isolated zzso clones zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by screening zzso expression libraries with a probe derived from the zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso however, did not recognize the full length zzso protein under zzso zzso In agreement with previous studies (see D Morrison, Science zzso zzso zzso these zzso proteins bound very efficiently to zzso The interaction between zzso zzso and zzso involves the central region of zzso zzso which includes a motif related to zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso independently of Ras and forms stable zzso complexes with these two zzso In contrast to published reports, we have observed that the zzso activity of zzso was not activated in zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso preparations of zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso activity of zzso zzso In addition, Ras activated zzso regardless of whether it was bound or not to zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso zzso clones in zzso cells did not result in zzso zzso transformation even when zzso with plasmids zzso zzso and/or Ras zzso These observations argue against a critical regulatory role of the zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso
