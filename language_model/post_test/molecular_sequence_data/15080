Maintenance of the integrity of the cell wall in zzso is zzso One mechanism that cells use to maintain cell wall integrity in response to cell wall damage is to zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso cell wall integrity, zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways zzso regulate zzso synthesis in response to cell wall zzso The zzso factors downstream of these pathways and their DNA binding sites within the promoters of target genes are well zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso The promoters of the zzso zzso class I zzso genes zzso and zzso were functionally dissected with the aim of identifying and zzso the zzso factors and promoter elements that mediate the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in response to cell wall zzso This analysis provided evidence that the zzso cell wall integrity zzso may operate through zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso but that promoter sequences that respond to the zzso and zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso did not directly regulate zzso zzso 2 and 8 gene zzso in zzso zzso
