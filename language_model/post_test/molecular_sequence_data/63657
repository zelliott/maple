Plant seed development and zzso are under strict zzso and spatial regulation, and zzso factors play important roles in this zzso In the present study we identified an zzso expressed specifically in the developing soybean zzso The full length of the gene was obtained through further zzso analysis and the gene was named zzso zzso analysis revealed that this gene belonged to the zzso zzso factor zzso Its zzso domain had the highest similarity with that of the zzso member zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso family in zzso zzso did not exhibit zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and the zzso rates of the transgenic seeds were significantly higher than that of the wild type seeds under higher zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso rates of the transgenic seeds were lower than that of control under salt zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was higher in the zzso of the transgenic plants than that in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may zzso reduced zzso sensitivity and enhanced salt sensitivity to the transgenic seeds through regulating the expression of zzso and zzso zzso
