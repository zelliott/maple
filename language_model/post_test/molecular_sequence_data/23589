We have cloned and characterized the zzso C ( zzso gene from zzso zzso The zzso gene is composed of a zzso zzso leader zzso a zzso coding region, and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains three long zzso within the coding region at zzso locations as in most zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso contains a single copy of zzso zzso zzso shares zzso zzso and 57% deduced zzso acid identities with rice, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso is located in the zzso branch, but is divergent from zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso expressed in different plant zzso though the level of zzso gene transcript in roots is slightly higher than in flowers, leaves, and zzso When zzso old zzso grown in the dark were exposed to constant white light, zzso zzso quickly accumulates within zzso zzso When plants grown in darkness for 7 days were exposed to different zzso light zzso ratios, the levels of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso are much lower than under zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso are higher than under zzso zzso zzso Plants under zzso conditions do not zzso and are only about zzso zzso tall at 19 zzso In contrast, plants under zzso conditions zzso with an average height of zzso zzso at 19 zzso The plants do not flower under zzso conditions, but do so at zzso days under zzso zzso These results indicate that under zzso conditions the high level of zzso zzso may inhibit stem zzso and flower zzso In contrast, under zzso conditions the high level of zzso zzso may promote stem zzso and zzso
