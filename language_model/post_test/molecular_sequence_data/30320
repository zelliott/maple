Three different zzso and a gene zzso human skin mast cell zzso have been cloned and zzso in their zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences reveal a zzso acid zzso followed by a zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the human zzso is identical in dog zzso and appears to be part of a zzso unique among zzso zzso The differences among the three human zzso zzso zzso include the loss of a consensus zzso site in one zzso which may explain some of the zzso in size and zzso to zzso seen in zzso zzso All three zzso zzso are distinct from a recently reported zzso obtained from a human lung mast cell zzso A skin zzso zzso was used to isolate a human zzso zzso the zzso of which match one of the zzso zzso The organization of the approximately zzso zzso gene is unique and is not closely related to that of any other mast cell or zzso zzso zzso The zzso regulatory regions of the gene share features with those of other zzso zzso including mast cell zzso but are unusual in being separated from the zzso sequence by an zzso zzso zzso of a human zzso DNA zzso with a zzso of the zzso gene confirms the presence of multiple zzso zzso These findings provide genetic evidence that human mast cell zzso are the products of a zzso zzso
