To further characterize the zzso within the zzso gene responsible for causing zzso zzso zzso in a cohort of affected patients from the United zzso 

Experimental zzso 

zzso DNA was extracted from zzso zzso of 16 affected patients zzso zzso 17 unaffected relatives, and zzso controls, followed by zzso chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of the zzso coding zzso zzso of affected patients into type I and II zzso zzso zzso was performed by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso analysis was performed in families that demonstrated common zzso 

zzso coding region analysis in 10 patients identified as having type I zzso zzso zzso revealed 10 sequence zzso eight zzso zzso four of which are novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four of which have been reported previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso one novel zzso nonsense zzso in two patients from a single family zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso in a zzso state in a single patient zzso zzso analysis in the four patients identified as having type II zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were not obtained from two affected zzso revealed three patients zzso for either the zzso zzso or zzso sequence zzso The fourth patient was compound zzso for zzso and zzso None of these changes was observed in zzso control zzso zzso analysis using zzso markers zzso the zzso gene did not reveal a common founder for the zzso zzso zzso zzso present in five families, identifying this position as a zzso zzso 

A variety of previously zzso zzso in the coding region of the zzso gene are associated with type I zzso zzso zzso in a cohort of patients from the United zzso
