zzso protein alpha zzso is an essential zzso factor, regulating the differentiation of zzso We cloned the complete open reading frame of zzso gene of zzso cattle and analyzed its protein structures and expression profile in 15 zzso via DNA zzso sequencing and zzso Analysis of the putative protein sequences revealed that zzso consists of alpha zzso random coils and a few extended zzso A significant zzso structure was observed in zzso acid region 233 to zzso A basic zzso zzso domain was also found in zzso acid region 277 to zzso which is characteristic of zzso zzso comparison with various species indicated that the zzso gene of zzso cattle shares 97, 95, 94, 94, and zzso similarity in zzso acid sequences with zzso zzso Homo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso strong sequence conservation of zzso during zzso zzso revealed that the zzso expression level of bovine zzso gene in subcutaneous fat is much higher than that in the other 14 zzso and the relative quantity in fat tissue increases with cattle zzso
