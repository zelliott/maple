zzso sodium channels are dynamic membrane proteins characterized by rapid zzso changes that switch the zzso between closed resting, zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels are specifically blocked by the zzso drug zzso which zzso binds to the channel pore in the zzso open zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that causes zzso zzso and binds in the inner pore of the sodium channel with overlapping but distinct molecular zzso from those of zzso Using circular zzso zzso on zzso zzso sodium channels from zzso zzso the secondary structures associated with the mixture of states present at equilibrium in the absence of these zzso were compared with specific stabilized states in their zzso As the channel shifts to open states, there appears to be a significant change in secondary structure to a more zzso zzso The observed changes are consistent with increased order involving the zzso segments that form the zzso the domain zzso zzso and the zzso that form the outer pore and selectivity zzso A molecular model has been constructed for the sodium channel based on its zzso with the zzso regions of bacterial zzso channels, and automated zzso of the crystal structure of zzso with this model produces a structure in which the close contacts of the drug are with the zzso previously identified by zzso studies as forming the binding site for this zzso
