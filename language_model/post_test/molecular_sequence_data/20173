zzso zzso zzso at the zzso terminal during zzso formation via mechanisms that are poorly zzso Here we have investigated the role of the putative calcium sensor zzso I in zzso zzso during the formation of zzso zzso between identified partner cells using a simple in zzso zzso model in the zzso zzso zzso zzso optical imaging and zzso recording techniques were used to monitor zzso formation and zzso zzso Within 6 zzso contact between appropriate synaptic partner cells zzso global zzso I zzso and induced a localized zzso of zzso I at the contact zzso Cell contacts between zzso partner cells did not affect zzso I zzso Application of an human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to loop 3 of the zzso I zzso domain prevented synaptic zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, a zzso zzso containing the zzso motif of the zzso domain did not affect synaptic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso demonstrated that zzso peptides did not alter either zzso or evoked zzso calcium zzso These results demonstrate that contact with an appropriate target cell is necessary to initiate synaptic zzso zzso during nascent zzso formation and that the initial zzso of synaptic zzso is dependent on loop 3 of the zzso domain of zzso zzso
