The effect of DNA zzso zzso on promoter activity was assessed using a transient expression system employing zzso This zzso zzso zzso gene promoter region is enriched with 84 zzso zzso six functional zzso boxes, and is zzso of many genes possessing zzso islands in their promoter zzso zzso modification zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone or in combination with a human zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso sites in a generalized manner, including zzso elements such as zzso box zzso were used to zzso at different types of sites in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso sites reduced zzso expression by approximately zzso whereas zzso at generalized zzso sites with zzso zzso zzso the promoter by greater than zzso The zzso of zzso promoter activity was not attributable to zzso differences in DNA zzso or stability in the cell, zzso form of the zzso or zzso effects in zzso zzso
