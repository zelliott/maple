The zzso complex is a peripheral zzso supplied by dense sensory nerve zzso zzso zzso a representative zzso widely distributed in the dental zzso has been reported to play roles in pain transmission and the amplification of zzso We analyzed here the expression of the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso activated by substance zzso using zzso in rat dental pulp at both the light and electron microscopic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso were present at their plasma membrane and zzso structures, especially in their zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso were also zzso in a part of the nerve terminals associated with the zzso processes of the zzso Furthermore, the zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso were labeled with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso cells and nerve fibers are targets for substance P that mediate multiple functions, including a zzso function and the regulation of vascular zzso as well as the zzso of pain zzso
