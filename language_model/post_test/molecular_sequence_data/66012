Among the zzso of zzso skin are bacteria that produce zzso zzso We isolated zzso bacteria from the skins of three populations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently tested the bacterial zzso against two different zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso that were obtained from dead zzso zzso The zzso zzso bacteria were zzso characterized based on zzso zzso zzso and belonged to four zzso zzso 14 bacterial families, 16 zzso and 48 zzso We found that about half of the zzso bacterial zzso and families were shared with a related zzso species, but there was virtually no overlap at the species zzso The proportion of zzso zzso bacterial zzso shared between two large populations of zzso zzso was the same as the proportion of zzso shared between zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that populations within a species have unique zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso of individuals from both zzso species carried zzso zzso zzso bacteria and almost zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso carried zzso zzso zzso zzso A culture independent method zzso revealed a shared resident bacterial community of about zzso of the entire resident bacterial community within and among populations of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso was far more variable on zzso skins than was the bacterial zzso detected by zzso The resident zzso zzso bacteria may play an important role in zzso innate defense against zzso including the lethal zzso fungus zzso zzso
