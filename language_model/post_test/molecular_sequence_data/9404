A zzso L zzso treating an zzso stream supplemented with methanol under two different situations was studied in terms of zzso removal efficiency, microbial ecology and odor zzso During Period 1 zzso the reactor was packed with wood bark chips with no pH control, treating an zzso resulting from the zzso chamber of a membrane biological reactor treating sewage and located zzso whereas during Period 2 zzso a compressed air stream fed with zzso was treated using zzso rings and maintaining pH at neutral zzso Both systems operated at 96 g zzso zzso zzso achieving removal efficiencies of around zzso during zzso and zzso during zzso The relative activity of biomass developed in both systems was assessed using zzso analysis with samples obtained from both zzso Higher biomass activity was obtained during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained in the case of zzso The application of molecular and microscopic techniques showed that the zzso were zzso during zzso being the zzso zzso zzso the most abundant zzso A specific Fluorescence in zzso zzso probe was designed for zzso zzso and tested zzso As a result of the neutral zzso a clear predominance of zzso was detected during zzso Interestingly, some zzso bacteria were detected such as zzso zzso species and also some zzso such as zzso
