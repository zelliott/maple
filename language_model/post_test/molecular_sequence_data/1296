zzso calcium zzso a protein of calcium sensor family, is known to have four structural zzso We have zzso peptides corresponding to all the four zzso and studied their zzso and zzso Our data confirm that the first putative site, a zzso one zzso does not bind zzso We have investigated if this lack of binding is due to the presence of zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso We have zzso these zzso and found that after modification the peptides bound zzso However, these zzso peptides zzso and its functional zzso do not show any zzso induced changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides bind zzso zzso being the strongest zzso followed by zzso Our data of zzso to individual zzso peptides show that there are three active zzso sites in zzso We have also studied the binding of a zzso drug, zzso with the protein as well as with its zzso zzso binds zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso manner, with dynamic interaction to zzso zzso zzso does not bind to zzso but binds to functional zzso peptides and zzso changes in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso could be a target of such antipsychotic and zzso zzso
