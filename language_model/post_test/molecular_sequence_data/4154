zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso in the zzso metabolism of zzso zzso converting zzso acid to zzso The zzso gene is predominantly expressed in the mature zzso zzso zzso we physically and functionally characterized the zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso initiation site was mapped 121 zzso upstream of the zzso gene translation start zzso A 1909 zzso zzso upstream sequence was isolated and found to be zzso active thus zzso a functional zzso zzso zzso of this promoter identified a 44 zzso zzso zzso located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso essential for efficient zzso zzso This 44 zzso sequence binds specifically to nuclear factors from zzso stage zzso We further showed that a 24 zzso element, lying within the 44 zzso zzso mediates the specific binding to nuclear proteins and shows no significant zzso to known zzso DNA consensus sequence elements that bind zzso zzso The deletion of the 24 zzso element zzso promoter activity, indicating that this zzso sequence element is essential for efficient zzso of the zzso zzso
