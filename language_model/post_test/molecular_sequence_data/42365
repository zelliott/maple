This paper examines the distribution of fibers and cell bodies containing zzso in the cat brain stem by using an indirect zzso zzso A high or moderate density of zzso cell bodies was found in the superior central nucleus, nucleus zzso zzso zzso nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body, and in the zzso spinal zzso nucleus, whereas a low density of such zzso was observed in the inferior zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso nucleus of the zzso of the inferior zzso and in the nucleus of the solitary zzso The highest density of zzso fibers was found in the zzso zzso zzso motor nucleus of the zzso nucleus zzso lateral zzso field, marginal nucleus of the zzso zzso and in the inferior and zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is widely distributed in the cat brain stem and suggest that the zzso could play an important role in several zzso functions, zzso those involved in zzso zzso zzso and motor zzso
