zzso regulators of G protein signaling zzso zzso were discovered as negative regulators of zzso G zzso signal zzso in zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso proteins in zzso have established that zzso proteins accelerate the zzso activity of certain G protein alpha zzso (the reaction responsible for their zzso they can also act as zzso zzso We demonstrate zzso that either of two such zzso zzso zzso or zzso attenuated signal zzso zzso by zzso zzso G zzso and zzso when zzso expressed as zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso The pattern of selectivity observed in zzso was similar to that seen in zzso zzso and zzso both attenuated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was more effective than zzso in blocking zzso zzso of zzso zzso
