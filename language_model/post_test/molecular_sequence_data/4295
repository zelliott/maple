It has been reported previously that zzso with zzso protein containing the two zzso growth factor zzso zzso from zzso surface protein 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protects mice against a lethal zzso challenge with the same zzso zzso Since zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso and on the surface of zzso we evaluated the effectiveness of zzso with zzso proteins containing either the individual or the two combined zzso zzso in producing a protective response against a zzso zzso The zzso protein expressing the combined zzso zzso of the zzso strain protected mice against a zzso zzso challenge, and sterile protection, as defined by the absence of zzso zzso zzso was observed in the majority of the zzso In contrast, mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not protected against a zzso challenge with zzso from strain 265 BY of zzso zzso The lack of protection may be explained by differences identified in the zzso acid sequences of zzso for the two zzso A zzso protein containing the two zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso 265 BY was produced and used to zzso zzso These mice were protected against a zzso challenge with zzso of zzso zzso 265 zzso The results suggest that a zzso zzso has potential as a vaccine against malaria, but its efficacy may be limited by sequence zzso and selection of zzso
