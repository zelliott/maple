The hypothesis that zzso behavior on a clinical zzso can be explained by the complement and arrangement of the long- zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes was zzso It was predicted that zzso is associated with an zzso zzso gene array capable of producing only a single functional zzso zzso The simplest case of this is when deletion has left only a single zzso zzso zzso The production of a single L or M zzso type can also result from zzso in which multiple genes zzso Often, only the two genes at the zzso end of the array are zzso thus, zzso is also predicted to occur if one of these is defective or encodes a defective zzso or if both of them zzso zzso with identical spectral zzso zzso were 128 males who accepted the full range of zzso of the two primary lights as matching the comparison light on a zzso or Nagel zzso zzso examination of the L and M zzso genes revealed a potential cause for a zzso zzso in all 128 zzso This indicates that the major component of zzso zzso could be attributed to zzso of the zzso genes or their regulatory regions in all cases, and the variety of gene arrangements associated with zzso is zzso zzso However, a fraction of the zzso (17 out of zzso zzso had genes predicted to zzso zzso that would result in two populations of cones with different spectral zzso Nine of the 17 were predicted to have two zzso with slightly different spectral zzso (usually zzso or zzso zzso zzso and eight had genes which specified zzso identical in peak zzso but different in zzso acid positions previously associated with optical density zzso In other subjects, reported zzso the same small spectral differences were associated with anomalous zzso rather than zzso It appears that when the spectral difference specified by the genes is very small, the amount of residual zzso color vision measured zzso some individuals test as zzso others test as anomalous zzso The zzso is probably partly attributable to testing method differences and partly to a difference in performance not perception, but it seems there must also be cases in which other factors, for example, cone ratio, contribute to a person's ability to extract a color signal from a small spectral zzso
