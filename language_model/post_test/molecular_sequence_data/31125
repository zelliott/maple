A zzso zzso zzso was constructed to allow the direct selection in zzso coli of a zzso fusion gene capable of zzso zzso zzso resistance on mouse L zzso zzso was derived from zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso within the zzso region of the zzso zzso This created a zzso zzso zzso resulting in a zzso termination within the zzso region of the zzso The zzso activity was restored by zzso into the modified zzso gene of a piece of coding sequence derived from human zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso was zzso into mouse A9 cells and shown to zzso resistance to zzso
