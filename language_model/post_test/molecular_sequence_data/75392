zzso has been used extensively for approximately 40 years in the treatment of zzso The intense selective pressures resulting from the continual exposure of zzso zzso to zzso have resulted in the emergence of resistant strains that produce altered forms of zzso proteins zzso with decreased affinity for the zzso A comparison of the sequences of the zzso genes from zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso forms of zzso 2 may have arisen both by zzso zzso and zzso and by the exchange of a region zzso part of the zzso zzso domain with the zzso region from a closely related zzso
