zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has strict zzso specificity toward the zzso side of zzso zzso and is possibly involved in the zzso processing of zzso In this report one full-length zzso zzso was isolated from zzso leaves of sweet potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the open reading frame, and exhibited high zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso probably zzso a putative precursor zzso Via zzso of the zzso and zzso it produced a mature protein containing 325 zzso acids (from the 51st to the zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso zzso (the zzso His and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and the putative zzso site (the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and western zzso zzso showed that zzso gene expression was enhanced significantly in natural zzso leaves and in zzso and zzso zzso leaves, but was much less in mature green leaves, zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso displayed close association with zzso processing zzso zzso zzso which function via zzso for zzso maturation in the protein bodies during seed maturation and zzso In conclusion, sweet potato zzso is probably a functional, zzso gene and its zzso and protein levels were significantly enhanced in natural and induced zzso zzso The possible role and function of zzso associated with bulk protein degradation and zzso during leaf zzso were also zzso
