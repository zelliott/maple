The zzso domain of the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso regulates zzso by interacting with many kinds of proteins and promoter upstream zzso elements consisting of zzso zzso However, it is unclear how this system is common in all zzso We investigate the structure and properties of zzso from an extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The solution structure of zzso zzso (85 zzso zzso was determined by zzso and the interaction between zzso zzso and DNA with different sequences was investigated by means of chemical shift zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso zzso is almost identical with that of zzso zzso despite zzso sequence zzso However, zzso zzso interacts with the upstream region sequence of the promoter in the zzso 16 S zzso protein zzso rather than the zzso UP element zzso The upstream region sequence of zzso is composed of 25 base pairs with zzso zzso unlike the zzso UP element with zzso zzso The DNA binding site in zzso zzso is located on the surface composed of zzso 4 and the loop preceding zzso zzso The electric charges on this surface are not remarkably localized like those of zzso zzso
