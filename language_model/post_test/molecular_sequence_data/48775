zzso small nuclear interference zzso has recently been described as a novel gene zzso zzso zzso employs short zzso so-called zzso zzso for specific gene zzso expanding the field of current zzso strategies that are primarily based on zzso interference zzso or zzso Despite the potential of zzso zzso as therapeutic agents, their in zzso application has not yet been zzso Here we explore zzso by analyzing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We have generated zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, locked zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso and demonstrate their ability to induce a zzso zzso leading to zzso and zzso zzso For the therapeutic in zzso application of zzso zzso we establish their zzso with zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso Upon injection of zzso zzso complexes into subcutaneous zzso zzso in mice, we observed the zzso of zzso that resulted in the suppression of tumor zzso The absence of zzso and immune stimulation also demonstrates the zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso represents an alternative to zzso for the therapeutic zzso of zzso zzso genes and demonstrate the functional relevance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso We zzso introduce zzso zzso complexes as efficient and safe for in zzso application, thus offering novel therapeutic approaches based on zzso gene zzso
