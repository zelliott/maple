Many zzso zzso structures are stable in the presence of zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the degree to which zzso at or near the surfaces of such zzso contribute to stability, the zzso stability of a variety of zzso structures was measured with each of the five group I zzso The stability of hairpin secondary structures and a zzso zzso structure are insensitive to the zzso identity, but the zzso structures of two other zzso an zzso zzso and a kissing loop complex, become more stable by 2-3 zzso as zzso size zzso This zzso trend is attributed to the ability of smaller zzso to approach the zzso surface more zzso The degree of zzso zzso around the kissing loop complex was also zzso zzso to zzso zzso perhaps because of the presence of zzso restricted pockets that can be zzso only by smaller zzso An zzso containing the zzso motif shows a strong (up to approximately 3 zzso preference for zzso or zzso over other group I zzso consistent with the zzso of zzso by this motif in some crystal zzso This zzso reverts to the default dependence on zzso size when a base forming part of the zzso site is zzso Lastly, an zzso zzso for zzso which was originally selected in the presence of high zzso of zzso binds zzso more strongly in the presence of zzso than other zzso zzso On the basis of these trends in zzso stability with group I zzso size, it is argued that two features of zzso zzso structures may promote strong interactions with zzso at or near the zzso surface: negative charge zzso that are higher than that in secondary structures, and the occasional presence of zzso sites, which are zzso pockets that selectively bind zzso of an optimum zzso
