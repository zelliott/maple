This study evaluated the nitrogen removal performance of zzso zzso zzso gel carriers containing zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso reactor was operated for treatment of synthetic nitrate zzso The nitrogen removal activity gradually increased in continuous feed experiments, reaching zzso zzso N zzso zzso on day 16 (30 zzso A maximum nitrogen removal rate of zzso zzso N zzso zzso was zzso A high nitrogen removal efficiency of zzso on average was observed at a high loading zzso In batch experiments, the zzso gel carriers were characterized by zzso zzso and total nitrogen removal activities both increased with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum at 37 and 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso energies for nitrate and zzso reduction were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library analysis performed on the basis of the zzso zzso gene revealed that zzso was mainly involved in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
