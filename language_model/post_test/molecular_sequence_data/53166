zzso zzso include fatal diseases of the central nervous system of men and animals characterized by nerve cell loss, zzso proliferation and deposition of zzso zzso into the zzso During these diseases a cellular zzso (the prion zzso zzso is zzso through a not yet completely clear zzso in an altered zzso (the prion zzso zzso that accumulates within the brain tissue by virtue of its resistance to the zzso zzso zzso is believed to be responsible for the zzso loss that is observed in the prion zzso The zzso zzso a synthetic zzso that has been obtained from the zzso portion of the prion zzso represents a suitable model for studying the zzso role of the zzso zzso in zzso some characteristics of the entire zzso such as the capability to zzso in zzso and the zzso In this work we present the results we have recently obtained regarding the action of the zzso zzso in different cellular zzso We report that the zzso zzso zzso proliferation of cortical zzso as well as zzso of primary cultures of cortical zzso or of zzso stable cell lines zzso zzso In particular, these two opposite effects are zzso by the same attitude of the zzso to interact with the zzso calcium zzso in the zzso the activity of these channels seems to be activated by zzso zzso while, in the cortical zzso and in the zzso cells, the same treatment causes a blockade of these channels causing a toxic zzso
