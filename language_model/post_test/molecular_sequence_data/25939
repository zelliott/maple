The major zzso protein of transformed mouse zzso zzso has recently been identified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The synthesis and zzso trafficking of this protein in mouse zzso are regulated by growth factors and zzso zzso To further define the basis for this regulation, a zzso zzso zzso L was isolated from a mouse liver zzso library and used to compare zzso L of normal and Kirsten zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso L message levels were elevated zzso in the transformed zzso normal and transformed cells displayed similar zzso L zzso DNA digest patterns and gene copy numbers, and zzso L zzso sequences appeared identical by zzso protection zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso L is zzso from the same gene in normal and transformed cells and zzso zzso L zzso made by these cells are translated with the same primary zzso zzso L zzso zzso by zzso growing, and transformed cells displayed similar zzso focusing patterns, suggesting similar zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mouse liver zzso and expression in zzso monkey cells was used to examine the zzso of mouse zzso zzso The results indicated that only one of the two potential zzso zzso sites (the one at zzso is zzso Analysis by zzso exchange zzso on zzso and affinity zzso on zzso zzso zzso 10, indicated that the zzso L zzso was zzso similarly in normal and transformed zzso Although several zzso zzso species were observed, the major species contained two zzso zzso and bound efficiently to the zzso These findings suggest that zzso L made by normal and transformed mouse zzso are identical and substantiate the hypothesis that trafficking of zzso L in these cells is regulated by zzso changes in the zzso protein transport zzso
