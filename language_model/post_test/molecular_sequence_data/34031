zzso use of zzso leads to environmental problems and poses a great threat to beneficial zzso The aim of the present work was to study zzso degradation by a rice field zzso zzso zzso strain zzso 64 so that the zzso is able to reduce zzso pollution in zzso 

The zzso zzso isolated and zzso from a rice field was identified by partial zzso zzso gene sequence as zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso limit of the zzso was determined by studying its growth in graded zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso removal was studied by its depletion from the zzso supplemented growth zzso and its zzso products were identified in the cell zzso biomass zzso and growth zzso 

The zzso tolerated zzso up to 15 zzso Major fraction of zzso was removed by the zzso during the first day followed by slow zzso zzso zzso and temperature influenced the zzso removal and the zzso exhibited maximum zzso removal at 100 zzso zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso producing a number of degradation products as evidenced by zzso zzso One of the degradation products was identified as zzso 

Present study reports the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by the zzso is significant as it can be biologically removed from the zzso The zzso may be used for zzso of zzso zzso
