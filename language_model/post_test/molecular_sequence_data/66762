The zzso network of the zzso zzso is a dominant structural feature of this class of protein zzso An attractive way to view the protein zzso events that lead to the formation of zzso and other zzso is to consider how native protein secondary structure zzso to yield the zzso relationships within the zzso zzso We describe here the application of zzso exchange mass zzso zzso methods to probe the secondary structure of protein zzso This includes exploration of the structures of zzso zzso and zzso the structural relationships among these states, the energetic contribution of zzso to zzso stability, and the plasticity of the zzso zzso
