In order to design and produce effective vaccines based upon the zzso network hypothesis of zzso a thorough understanding of the biological and structural aspects underlying the stimulating activities of zzso zzso is zzso Here we determined the zzso sequence of the variable heavy and light chain regions of two zzso zzso zzso which induce different zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the variable zzso of two zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by the primer extension and zzso zzso The zzso sequence data show that zzso and zzso have zzso zzso segments and zzso zzso but different D zzso The zzso segments of both clones belongs to the zzso zzso zzso Most of the differences among the zzso segments are located in zzso The zzso segments of zzso and zzso are zzso to the zzso gene group 4 and group 8, zzso zzso of the sequences of zzso and zzso with other published zzso zzso shows that there is no preferential zzso of zzso zzso An analysis of the distribution of charged zzso and zzso comparison studies were used to interpret the sequence of zzso in terms of the biological mimicry of zzso zzso
