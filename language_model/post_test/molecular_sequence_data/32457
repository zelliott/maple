High zzso Group A zzso is a family of architectural nuclear factors which play an important role in zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso factors that associate both with DNA and nuclear proteins that have been involved in several nuclear processes including zzso zzso zzso is exclusively nuclear but, to date, the mechanism of nuclear import for these proteins remains zzso Here, we report the identification and characterization of a nuclear zzso signal zzso for zzso a member of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso with the second of the three zzso the zzso zzso characteristic for this group of zzso The functionality of this zzso was demonstrated by its ability to target a zzso zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein to the zzso zzso to zzso of basic zzso within the second zzso resulted in zzso of zzso nuclear zzso and impairment of its function in zzso the zzso A zzso In addition, zzso was shown to directly interact with the nuclear import zzso zzso via the second zzso zzso proteins are zzso and rearranged in a variety of zzso our findings can thus help zzso their role in zzso zzso
