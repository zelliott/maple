We have cloned and functionally characterized an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This zzso shows significant sequence zzso to zzso Indy and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (now known as zzso When zzso expressed in a zzso cell line or in zzso zzso the cloned zzso mediates the zzso transport of various zzso of the zzso acid zzso However, it zzso the zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso such as zzso a feature different from that of zzso (formerly known as zzso and zzso (formerly known as zzso The transport process is zzso as evidenced from the zzso inward currents in zzso expressing the zzso under zzso zzso zzso studies using a zzso fusion method in transgenic zzso zzso show that the gene is expressed in the zzso zzso the organ responsible for not only the zzso and zzso of nutrients but also for the storage of energy in this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso not only leads to a significant increase in life span, but also causes a significant decrease in body size and fat zzso The zzso of zzso play a critical role in zzso energy production and in the zzso of cholesterol and fatty zzso The present studies suggest that the zzso of these zzso functions by zzso is linked to an extension of life span and a decrease in fat content and body zzso
