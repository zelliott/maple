zzso is a member of the zzso zzso gene zzso This zzso is zzso as a zzso with a predicted size of zzso Da including a 17 zzso acid signal zzso zzso is zzso from normal and transformed cells in two forms with apparent molecular masses on zzso gels of 60 and zzso The minor zzso species contains zzso zzso zzso consists of three zzso the zzso terminal zzso domain contains the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso which is important in the zzso zzso of this zzso by zzso zzso zzso The second domain consists of the zzso domain which contains the zinc binding zzso The zzso zzso domain has no known function and can be removed without a loss of zzso zzso zzso has a broad range of zzso specificity including zzso zzso zzso zzso native type IV and IX collagen and gelatin but not type I zzso In the presence of zzso or zzso zzso amounts of this zzso can also fully activate zzso zzso zzso We have developed a panel of zzso zzso against zzso which will be useful for the tissue zzso of the various species of this zzso in zzso In addition, we have demonstrated that either human zzso zzso or zzso zzso can stimulate the expression of this zzso in cultured bovine zzso cartilage at least zzso Based on western zzso analysis, the zzso form of the zzso was the major zzso species detected in either the media or cartilage zzso compartments of zzso treated zzso
