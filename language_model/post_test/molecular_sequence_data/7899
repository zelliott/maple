Type I zzso zzso zzso is a severe human zzso disease resulting from loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption of the gene zzso zzso in mice causes zzso zzso seriously limiting use of this animal as a zzso We report here that zzso the gene zzso zzso in the fungus zzso zzso encodes a zzso showing zzso identity to its human zzso zzso disruption results in zzso of zzso (a diagnostic compound for human type I zzso and zzso zzso We have isolated spontaneous zzso zzso preventing this zzso presumably representing zzso zzso in genes acting upstream of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of a class of these zzso demonstrates that loss of zzso zzso (leading to zzso in zzso prevents the effects of a zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest human zzso zzso as a target for zzso therapy and illustrate the usefulness of this fungus as an alternative to animal models for certain aspects of human zzso zzso
