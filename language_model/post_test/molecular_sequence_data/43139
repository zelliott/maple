Previous studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso is divided into seven zzso units which are transcribed from highly zzso zzso start sites zzso into zzso containing a common leader zzso at the zzso end and a zzso 3' zzso In this zzso we provide evidence that an additional zzso unit is zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso and is transcribed from a perfect zzso region into a zzso approximately 800 zzso zzso This zzso could potentially zzso a small zzso zzso protein which is identical to the zzso third of the zzso zzso
