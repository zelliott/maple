We have identified a new human zzso zzso which maps to zzso zzso and encodes the zzso zzso zzso an intermediate metabolism zzso that links zzso zzso to folate zzso The major zzso encodes a protein containing zzso zzso acid zzso and shows zzso identity with zzso zzso Several other zzso have been isolated, which may result from alternative zzso events and have the potential to code for three different protein zzso The gene is highly expressed in human fetal and adult zzso The two zzso protein zzso show high sequence similarity to two distinct open reading frames from zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso appeared through a gene fusion zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and the zzso is presumed to be inherited as an zzso zzso zzso The sequence reported here may be helpful in identifying the primary zzso in zzso zzso zzso and establishing a molecular zzso
