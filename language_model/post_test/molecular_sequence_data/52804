Id genes zzso zzso proteins that function to mediate processes important for normal development including cellular zzso proliferation and zzso Id proteins act as negative regulators of other zzso factors, which are essential for cell determination and differentiation in diverse cell types, and interact with proteins important for cell cycle zzso Studies of Id gene expression in the nervous system and in neural cells in culture indicate that Id proteins contribute to the regulation of zzso nervous system zzso Also, recognition of a wide variety of proteins with which Id zzso factors are capable of interacting suggests that it will be possible to understand more precisely their specific functions and zzso how these are zzso
