The human zzso zzso gene is zzso and the zzso zzso produced, primarily in the zzso zzso of the zzso The molecular elements important for the zzso expression and regulation of the zzso gene are not well established at this time; therefore, we have used a transgenic mouse model to isolate zzso elements important for directing gene expression to zzso zzso in the zzso Gene zzso consisting of various promoter deletion fragments of the zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene have been used to create transgenic mouse zzso zzso zzso with the criterion being zzso expression directed to zzso zzso of the zzso was observed when zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter were zzso zzso expression was also observed when a deletion construct containing the region from zzso to zzso was fused to a minimal zzso promoter zzso fused to zzso These data indicate that the region between zzso and zzso contains elements both essential and sufficient for targeting gene expression to zzso zzso This promoter region was found to contain two zzso sites for the zzso class of zzso factors, each of which specifically zzso with the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso increased promoter activity of the human and mouse zzso zzso
