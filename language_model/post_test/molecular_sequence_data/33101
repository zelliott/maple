To identify the new targets for hypertension, we analyzed the protein expression profiles of zzso smooth muscle in spontaneously zzso rats zzso of various ages during the development of hypertension, as well as in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, using a zzso zzso The expressions of seven proteins were altered in zzso compared with zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso were zzso in zzso compared with zzso zzso On the other hand, the expression of zzso and Ran protein decreased in zzso The diminution of zzso zzso an zzso located in the zzso pathways of zzso zzso was also prominent in zzso The results from a zzso analysis revealed that the expression of zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso and zzso zzso - decreased and increased, respectively, in zzso compared with zzso zzso The level of zzso was less in zzso strips from zzso than from zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso inhibited zzso smooth muscle contraction induced by zzso These results suggest that the zzso in zzso zzso produced by diminished zzso zzso expression is involved in vascular disorders in zzso zzso
