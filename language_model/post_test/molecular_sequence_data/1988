To study spontaneous base zzso in human zzso DNA zzso we reconstructed the zzso zzso of the zzso segments I and II zzso I and zzso using published data on zzso from various human zzso zzso analysis revealed numerous zzso hotspots in zzso I and II zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that strand dislocation zzso operating in zzso runs of zzso plays an important role in generating base zzso in the zzso control zzso The frequency of zzso compatible with the primer strand dislocation in the zzso I region was almost twice as high as that for template strand zzso zzso of zzso compatible with the primer and template strand dislocation models are almost equal in the zzso II zzso Further analysis of strand dislocation models suggested that an excess of zzso transitions in zzso zzso reconstructed on the basis of the zzso zzso is caused by an excess of both zzso zzso transitions and zzso zzso zzso In general, no significant bias toward parent zzso dislocation zzso was found in the zzso I and II zzso
