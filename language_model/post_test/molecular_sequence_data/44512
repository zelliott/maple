The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and is a member of a family of zzso sugar zzso each of which are proposed to adopt a secondary structure containing 12 zzso zzso In an effort to understand zzso relationships within such zzso we have employed zzso zzso to examine the functional importance of each zzso within putative zzso zzso VIII of the human zzso zzso Each zzso in this zzso was replaced individually with zzso and the functional properties of the zzso were examined by zzso of in zzso transcribed zzso into zzso zzso We show that substitution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso had minimal effect on the functional activity of the zzso as determined by measurement of the zzso for zzso transport and the Ki for zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significant increase in the zzso for zzso independently of any effect on the Ki for zzso This data suggests that, despite the strong sequence conservation in this zzso among the zzso family, no individual zzso is absolutely required for transport zzso by this zzso We have also examined the role of zzso zzso in transport zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loop between zzso VI and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso X), zzso zzso loop between zzso X and zzso or zzso (in the zzso zzso close to the end of zzso zzso with zzso did not change the zzso for zzso transport for any zzso However, both zzso and zzso when zzso to zzso exhibited a reduction in the Ki for zzso zzso In addition, the Ki for zzso zzso of zzso transport was increased for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results will be discussed in terms of proposed structural models for the zzso
