To contribute to the development of the zzso map of human zzso 21 zzso we have used zzso zzso from pools of zzso zzso Using selected trapped zzso we have identified a novel gene (named zzso that encodes a zzso protein with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is expressed strongly in small zzso and zzso in several other zzso The full-length zzso encodes a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids that contains the following zzso zzso A zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of the zzso family that probably zzso at zzso or zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of group A (6 zzso zzso This type of domain is involved in the binding to other cell surface or zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso class zzso domain zzso zzso This type of domain forms a binding site for zzso zzso A predicted zzso domain zzso zzso No typical signal zzso was zzso The gene was mapped to zzso between markers zzso and zzso in the same zzso as zzso The zzso role of zzso and its involvement in zzso 21 zzso or zzso disorders that map to zzso are zzso
