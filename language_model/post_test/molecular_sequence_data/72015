The zzso gene cluster for the zzso ring of the zzso zzso zzso extends for about 110 zzso pairs of zzso DNA in the zzso of zzso zzso Two sets of zzso zzso zzso genes are separated by a group of small zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been fully zzso and disrupted proving the involvement of each of these genes in zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a relatively small zzso zzso zzso 193 zzso that appears to work as a loading protein which zzso the starter unit to the second zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a giant zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring 15 activities responsible for the first four cycles of chain zzso in zzso zzso resulting in formation of the zzso zzso
