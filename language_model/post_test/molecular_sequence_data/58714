To examine zzso zzso structure and vulnerability to cellular zzso zzso were incubated with soluble extracts from zzso coli, and zzso sites were identified by primer extension zzso zzso of zzso sites revealed that the most sensitive were in the zzso region of the zzso The zzso domain was much less zzso although some zzso preference was seen at two positions known to be twisted out of parallel stacking in a zzso analogue zzso Changes in zzso domain zzso sequence had no effect on zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso in solution and free from zzso appear to have structurally independent, zzso arranged zzso
