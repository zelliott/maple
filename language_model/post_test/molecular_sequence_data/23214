Prior to folding to a native functional structure, many large zzso form zzso collapsed zzso zzso of the zzso collapsed state for the zzso group I zzso zzso plays an obligatory role in zzso assembly with its zzso protein zzso by preventing formation of stable, zzso zzso We show that the collapsed state is essential because zzso assembles zzso with the zzso zzso in any folding state to form zzso zzso The most stable protein interaction site in the expanded zzso complex zzso but is not identical to, the native zzso zzso to the collapsed state zzso two distinct zzso events: zzso binding by multiple zzso of zzso and formation of bridged complexes in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sites in the expanded state zzso complex are almost the inverse of native zzso and zzso zzso indicating that folding to the collapsed state significantly reduces the fraction of zzso surfaces accessible for zzso The zzso function for the zzso collapsed state is likely to be zzso in other zzso where a protein zzso binds tightly at a simple zzso zzso or has an zzso binding surface composed of multiple functional zzso
