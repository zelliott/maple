The zzso genes zzso and zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso display zzso and zzso sequence identity, respectively, with their zzso from algae, land plants and zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso as members of the zzso zzso zzso unit into zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to the entire unit and to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso were disrupted with a zzso zzso marker zzso zzso lacking zzso or zzso were unable to grow zzso and were deficient in zzso I zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the zzso I zzso complex does not accumulate zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso zzso and zzso were localized on zzso zzso but not zzso associated with the zzso complex and accumulated to zzso levels in zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso accumulate normally in these zzso and use of zzso reporter genes revealed that zzso is not required for initiation of translation of zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso are required for stable zzso of the zzso zzso
