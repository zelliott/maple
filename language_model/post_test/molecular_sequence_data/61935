A member of the zzso family of human zzso zzso zzso had previously been demonstrated to zzso a functional envelope which can form zzso with human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso zzso on the resulting zzso zzso Here we show that a second envelope protein sorted out by a systematic search for zzso proteins that we made among all the zzso coding envelope genes and belonging to the zzso family can also make zzso and zzso zzso We further show that the zzso envelope genes that were isolated from zzso New World monkeys to zzso also functional in the zzso zzso with one singular exception for the zzso zzso zzso which is found to be zzso in a zzso fusion zzso as observed for the other zzso envelopes, but which is not zzso zzso comparison of the zzso envelopes revealed a limited number of zzso among zzso and one point zzso in the TM zzso shown to be responsible for the loss of zzso of the zzso zzso The functional characterization of the identified envelopes is strongly indicative of an ancestral zzso infection and zzso with some of the envelope functions subsequently retained in zzso
