zzso toxin producing zzso coli zzso are a group of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin is the main zzso zzso It is composed of an A zzso which mediates zzso and a B zzso zzso which is a nontoxic zzso protein responsible for toxin binding and zzso into target cells by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso are a group of zzso coli with zzso adherence to zzso cells, which play an important role in its zzso zzso are the cause of zzso in developing countries and in the developed zzso zzso adherence zzso zzso of zzso represents the zzso that zzso the presence of zzso adherence zzso zzso on zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso B zzso of zzso toxin zzso was coupled to zzso adherence zzso zzso of the zzso structural zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso were designed to elicit immune response in zzso mice with zzso zzso The zzso hence zzso inhibited the adherence of zzso zzso strains to zzso cells and, on the other hand, protected the zzso mice against a lethal dose of zzso zzso zzso this promising data could indicate that this kind of zzso strategy is a good candidate for any probable vaccine design against zzso zzso
