The zzso untranslated region zzso plays a central role in the regulation of zzso translation zzso Key components include zzso structure, upstream zzso zzso upstream open reading frames zzso and internal zzso entry site elements that can interact to zzso the zzso We previously reported the characterization of two alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso Both contain two zzso and a stable zzso zzso but the long form zzso zzso was more repressive than the short form zzso zzso for initiation at the zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso expression arises by a combination of leaky scanning and zzso with the latter zzso by the small zzso zzso in both spliced zzso In zzso cells, a considerable fraction of zzso scans beyond the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These are zzso by a series of zzso zzso zzso that serve to prevent access to a second zzso zzso start site used to express short zzso zzso an zzso truncated form of zzso that has been observed only in zzso zzso We present evidence that all these events are fine-tuned by the nature of the zzso zzso and the activity of the zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor 2 and provide insights into the zzso specificity of zzso zzso
