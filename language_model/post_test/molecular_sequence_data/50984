The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso was examined by linking together the coding sequences of zzso zzso channel zzso in a single open reading frame and tagging the expression of individual zzso with a zzso zzso or zzso that altered the sensitivity of the channel to block by external zzso zzso Two lines of evidence argue that these zzso lead to zzso channel expression only through the formation of functional zzso First, currents expressed by zzso zzso containing a single zzso zzso have a sensitivity to zzso that is well fitted by a single site binding zzso Second, a zzso zzso zzso that expresses only as part of a zzso contributes to the expression of functional channels when zzso with a zzso construct but not a zzso zzso
