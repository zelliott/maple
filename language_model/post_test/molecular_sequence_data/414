zzso zzso and zzso zzso have a small subset of tandem repeat zzso protein zzso including zzso which elicit strong zzso zzso The zzso regions of these protein zzso are zzso but the molecular characteristics of the zzso zzso have not been zzso In this study, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso zzso Major zzso zzso regions of both zzso and zzso were localized to the zzso regions, which reacted strongly by Western zzso with zzso in zzso from zzso zzso dogs or patients and zzso zzso dogs, zzso Single continuous zzso major zzso within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were mapped to zzso zzso zzso regions (19 to 22 zzso zzso In addition, minor zzso zzso were localized to zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso and zzso Furthermore, although the native and zzso zzso and zzso proteins exhibited zzso molecular masses, zzso modifications were not present on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins as determined by zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso
