The marine zzso zzso zzso causes zzso in humans and encodes the type III zzso protein zzso which contributes to host cell death caused by zzso cell zzso and cell zzso We found that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso from the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted zzso binding sites on the inner surface of zzso of human cells and caused plasma membrane zzso which compromised membrane integrity and probably contributed to cell death by zzso zzso Thus, bacterial pathogens can disrupt zzso zzso sites required for proper membrane and zzso dynamics by altering the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
