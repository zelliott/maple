zzso zzso are a family of low molecular weight zzso rich in zzso and zzso with the ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso They show a high degree of specificity in that they do not inhibit the action of zzso II in the adrenal zzso Four zzso have been isolated from rabbit lung extracts and zzso zzso extracts and one from human zzso Among them zzso I, zzso is the most potent with an zzso of 25 zzso zzso activity is different from other published zzso factors such as zzso and zzso which inhibit zzso and zzso II zzso zzso Other factors such as zzso zzso products, and septic shock plasma factors which have not been fully characterized also have zzso activity on zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso It is not yet clear whether there is any relationship between zzso and these zzso products and shock plasma zzso zzso do not inhibit zzso induced zzso however they do inhibit the zzso of zzso in response to zzso in rat adrenal cell zzso zzso studies show that zzso is a competitive inhibitor of zzso probably acting by zzso the address recognition site of the zzso There is wide variation in the potency of the zzso ranging from an zzso of 100 zzso for zzso to a completely inactive zzso zzso In this paper we will describe the zzso of the zzso and some recent results obtained on their mechanism of zzso
