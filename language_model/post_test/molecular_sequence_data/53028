zzso a curated protein sequence data bank, contains not only sequence data but also zzso relevant to a particular zzso The zzso added to each entry is done by a team of biologists and comes, primarily, from articles in journals reporting the actual sequencing and sometimes zzso Review articles and collaboration with external experts also play a role along with the use of secondary databases like zzso and zzso in addition to a variety of feature prediction zzso zzso added by these methods is checked for relevance and likelihood to a particular zzso The onset of zzso sequencing has led to a dramatic increase in sequence data to be included in zzso This has led to the production of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso consists of entries in a zzso format that are derived from the translation of all coding sequences in the zzso zzso sequence database, that are not in zzso Unlike zzso entries those in zzso are awaiting manual zzso However, rather than just representing basic sequence and source information, steps have been taken to add features and zzso zzso In taking these steps it is hoped that zzso entries are enhanced with some indication as to what a protein is, could or may zzso
