zzso zzso zzso zzso structures stabilized by zzso zzso were in the present study zzso bound and immobilized onto sensors for zzso crystal zzso with dissipation monitoring zzso zzso It is shown that the modified sensors can be used to characterize the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso peptides with an accuracy similar to that obtained with well established zzso zzso The method presented has the great advantage that it can be used with peptides in their native form even if no fluorescent zzso are zzso The potential of the method is illustrated by determining the parameters describing the association of zzso zzso X, and zzso with immobilized zzso Both zzso and kinetic analyses are zzso The presented method constitutes a useful tool for fundamental studies of zzso interactions and can also be applied to zzso the design of zzso for example, for sustained release of zzso peptides in therapeutic zzso
