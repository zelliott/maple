The purpose of this study was to identify the zzso and genetic zzso in zzso zzso a zzso disorder characterized by the presence of elevated zzso of zzso acid in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Evidence is provided for the existence in rat zzso of a zzso zzso catalyzing specifically the zzso of zzso to zzso This zzso is mainly expressed in liver and kidney but also at lower levels in heart, brain, and other zzso zzso zzso indicates that the liver zzso is present in zzso where it is bound to zzso Based on this information, a database search led to the identification of a gene zzso a human hypothetical protein zzso to bacterial zzso zzso zzso and targeted to zzso The gene zzso this zzso present on zzso zzso was found to be in a region zzso in patients with zzso zzso from two zzso zzso Three zzso that replaced a highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso or removed zzso 9 were identified in zzso state in patients from three distinct families and were found to zzso with the zzso It is concluded that zzso is normally zzso to zzso in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the gene that most likely encodes zzso zzso The pathological findings observed in this zzso disorder must therefore be due to a toxic effect of zzso on the central nervous zzso
