zzso storage proteins are zzso on rough zzso zzso zzso in a precursor form and then are transported to protein storage zzso zzso where they are converted to their mature zzso To understand the mechanisms by which storage proteins are zzso we screened zzso zzso zzso to identify those that zzso accumulate storage protein zzso Here we describe a new zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso that zzso accumulates the precursors of two major storage zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in dry zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso seed cells zzso develop a large number of novel structures that exhibit a highly zzso zzso Some of these structures were surrounded by zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso core is an zzso of zzso zzso precursors and that zzso zzso are localized around the zzso The zzso gene was identified as zzso and the zzso protein has zzso zzso to those found in bovine zzso transport factor zzso zzso molecules were concentrated at zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso functions in the transport of storage protein precursors from the zzso to the zzso complex in zzso In addition, the zzso zzso exhibits a dwarf zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in both the transport of storage proteins and in plant growth and zzso
