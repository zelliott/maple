We report the cloning and characterization of two zzso receptors zzso from the zzso dogfish zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that these shark receptors are zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso sharing zzso and zzso overall zzso acid identity with the human counterparts, zzso The zzso was expressed and zzso characterized in zzso zzso The zzso binding results show that this zzso has high affinity for zzso hormone zzso peptides while it has comparable affinity for zzso and zzso stimulating hormone zzso and slightly lower affinity for zzso when compared with the human zzso zzso has high potency in a zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso had slightly lower potency in cells expressing the zzso We used zzso green zzso protein zzso fusion to show the presence of zzso in plasma membrane of Chinese zzso zzso and zzso cells but the zzso was retained in zzso compartments of these cells hindering pharmacological zzso The anatomical distribution of the receptors were determined using reverse zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso is expressed in the zzso brain stem and zzso zzso zzso and zzso bulbs, but not in the zzso of the zzso dogfish while the zzso was found only in the same central zzso This report describes the first molecular characterization of a zzso in zzso The study indicates that many of the important elements of the zzso system existed before radiation of zzso early in zzso evolution, at least 450 million years zzso
