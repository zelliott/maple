zzso zzso zzso zzso are convenient tools for zzso engineering at specific zzso zzso However, their use is constrained because most zzso binding sites are preceded by a highly zzso zzso terminal T zzso zzso To remove the zzso zzso we zzso zzso 232 in the zzso loop region of the zzso zzso domain for other zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso four zzso acid zzso of the hairpin loop region of zzso Although point zzso was insufficient to remove the zzso zzso directed evolution from the zzso library yielded zzso zzso with unbiased targeting sites for zzso Our result indicates that the zzso loop region of zzso is important for zzso accommodation, and that molecular evolution of zzso of zzso is an efficient strategy to remove the zzso constraint and thus allow targeting of any DNA zzso
