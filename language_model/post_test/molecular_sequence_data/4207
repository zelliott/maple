Higher order zzso structure presents a barrier to the recognition and repair of DNA zzso zzso breaks zzso induce zzso zzso zzso which is associated with the recruitment of repair factors to damaged zzso To help clarify the zzso role of zzso we targeted zzso in zzso Although zzso is not essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were radiation sensitive, growth zzso and immune zzso and zzso males were zzso These zzso zzso were associated with zzso instability, repair zzso and impaired recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso to zzso zzso Thus, zzso is critical for zzso the assembly of specific zzso complexes on damaged zzso
