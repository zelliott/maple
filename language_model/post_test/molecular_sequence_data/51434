In an effort to study the molecular basis of kidney development and zzso we isolated complementary DNA clones of the rat zzso of the human zzso tumor zzso zzso When compared to the predicted sequence of the human zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso acid sequence is highly zzso zzso zzso except for the loss of one zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso experiments localized zzso expression to the zzso cells in the kidney during zzso and the zzso cells of the zzso Similar to expression in humans and mice, zzso zzso expression in the rat kidney and zzso is zzso zzso In addition, two novel sites of specific high level zzso zzso expression were zzso One is an area in the spinal zzso where high level expression occurs throughout embryonic zzso The second is the area zzso in the brain where localized expression continues through adulthood, suggesting a functional role for zzso in rat zzso
