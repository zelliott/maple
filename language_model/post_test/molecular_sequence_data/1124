We here zzso a minimal zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso cannot use zzso DNA zzso as template for DNA zzso Similarly, the zzso DNA zzso is unable to unwind longer stretches of zzso In zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso replication machinery, which can use zzso as template to zzso zzso DNA zzso molecules of about 2 zzso The addition of the zzso zzso protein stimulates the reaction further, generating DNA products of about 16 zzso the size of the zzso zzso zzso The observed DNA synthesis rate is 180 base pairs zzso corresponding closely to the previously calculated value of zzso zzso for in zzso DNA zzso Our findings provide the first zzso evidence that zzso is the zzso at the zzso DNA replication zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso and zzso cause zzso dominant progressive external zzso zzso a disorder associated with deletions in zzso zzso The functional interactions between zzso and zzso thus explain why zzso in these two proteins cause an identical zzso
