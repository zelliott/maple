zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso is highly expressed in human zzso and involved in the protection of cellular components against zzso compounds or zzso zzso We have recently found that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso and nucleus in some cancer cells, and that the nuclear expression of zzso appears to correlate with resistance to zzso zzso Although the zzso targeting signal of zzso was previously identified in the zzso region, the mechanism of nuclear zzso remains completely zzso In this study, we find that the region of zzso is critical for nuclear zzso which is zzso by a novel and zzso nuclear zzso zzso In addition, using an in zzso transport zzso we demonstrate that the nuclear zzso of zzso depends on the zzso extract and zzso Although further experiments are needed to understand in depth the precise mechanism of nuclear zzso of zzso our results may help to establish more efficient zzso therapy, especially with respect to resistance to zzso zzso
