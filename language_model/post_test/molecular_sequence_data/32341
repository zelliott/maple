zzso are useful tools to study the extent of divergence between two zzso groups that show high sequence zzso We have compared zzso distribution to illustrate genetic variation between the two rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution proved to be non random as certain regions of very high zzso density have been zzso zzso density in the subspecies zzso was zzso marginally higher than in the subspecies zzso in the zzso regions compared between the two zzso Unexpectedly high zzso zzso were observed in zzso regions of zzso These regions also displayed a clear motif zzso Some of the longest zzso repeats were found in zzso zzso zzso as well as motif bias was also noted with respect to the association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso values were zzso estimated for 90 zzso by aligning the zzso containing regions between the two zzso Poor rates of finding an zzso corresponded with high zzso zzso in zzso These insights are likely to play a significant role in selecting zzso zzso to be used in molecular breeding and studying evolutionary dynamics of the two zzso
