We have developed a method for determination of the similarity of pairs of zzso complexes, which we refer to as zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The key element in the zzso method is the description of the zzso interface in terms of motifs zzso bridges, aromatic stacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in addition to single hydrogen bonds and van der zzso zzso Based on a zzso scoring function combining motif alignment with identity of the protein and zzso zzso we define a zzso score for any pair of zzso zzso A positive score indicates similarity between the zzso We used the zzso method to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes out of zzso such complexes in 382 zzso zzso structure files obtained from the zzso zzso zzso allows rapid and quantitative comparison of zzso zzso and may be useful for interface zzso with potential functional and evolutionary zzso
