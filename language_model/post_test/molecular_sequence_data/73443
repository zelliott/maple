The zzso DNA of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso originally obtained from a captive colony of pygmy chimpanzees zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the DNA of the chronically infected human zzso line zzso The entire zzso DNA sequence was obtained and compared with sequences of the known zzso of zzso and human zzso virus types 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is an early divergence within the type 2 lineage and should be referred to as zzso Since zzso has been found in African nonhuman zzso we investigated its zzso and zzso in Asian zzso zzso zzso were zzso with human cells harboring zzso and infection was assessed by virus isolation, zzso analysis of peripheral blood zzso cells, and zzso against viral zzso in zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso became persistently infected by zzso and the virus could be transferred by blood zzso from an infected zzso zzso to a zzso zzso In addition, like zzso and zzso zzso was infectious in zzso In zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso related to zzso and displays a host range similar to that demonstrated for other zzso and zzso zzso
