zzso is a unique restriction zzso which binds specifically to the zzso recognition sequence zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso the DNA and zzso both strands at multiple positions within the two zzso zzso It is known that zzso is composed of two zzso zzso which binds and zzso zzso and specifically interacts with DNA and zzso whose function is not clear but which has been suspected to harbor the zzso center for DNA zzso A zzso alignment of the zzso acid sequence of zzso coli zzso and of six presumably zzso open reading frames from various bacterial species shows that a sequence motif found in many restriction zzso but also in other zzso the zzso zzso is zzso among these zzso A zzso analysis, in which the zzso zzso acid in zzso of this motif were zzso with zzso or zzso and zzso was zzso with zzso or zzso strongly suggests that zzso zzso and zzso represent the zzso center of zzso coli zzso Whereas the zzso zzso (or zzso zzso (or zzso and zzso are inactive in DNA zzso zzso has residual DNA zzso zzso they interact with zzso like zzso zzso as can be deduced from the finding that they stimulate the zzso zzso zzso to the same extent as zzso zzso Thus, whereas zzso zzso defective in DNA zzso can stimulate the zzso activity of zzso the zzso activity of zzso is not supported by zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso
