zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the control of food intake through functional studies in zzso and zzso To investigate whether genetic zzso within this gene result in abnormal weight in humans, we zzso its coding zzso and zzso sites in a large cohort of extremely obese zzso zzso zzso average body mass index zzso zzso zzso and lean zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso zzso zzso In total, three rare zzso zzso were identified, only one of which, zzso zzso exhibited familial segregation with body zzso Through serendipity, previous studies based on cell culture revealed this precise zzso to have altered zzso selectivity in zzso We further show, using mouse zzso injection experiments, that while the zzso zzso zzso reduces food zzso the zzso zzso zzso had an insignificant effect in reducing food intake in zzso Taken together, these results are the first to support that rare sequence zzso within zzso can influence human zzso to zzso
