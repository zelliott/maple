We describe two methods for the analysis of zzso chains in zzso by zzso liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso linked zzso released from zzso can be identified as their zzso forms by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso linked zzso can also be analyzed as zzso derivatives by zzso in direct zone zzso mode in an zzso zzso buffer and zone zzso mode as zzso complexes in an alkaline zzso We also present a convenient procedure for the analysis of the constituent zzso of these zzso chains by zzso based on zzso partition mode as zzso zzso
