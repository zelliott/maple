zzso and zzso zzso channels are used in zzso organisms for the purpose of zzso zzso There are zzso zzso to major zzso channels of these sorts, including zzso zzso zzso and calcium channels, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso have been less well characterized functionally than their zzso zzso In this study we identify likely zzso functional counterparts of zzso zzso zzso channels by comprehensive analysis of the zzso sequences in the context of known functional zzso present in the zzso members of this zzso In particular, we searched the zzso protein database for all proteins containing the following zzso the two sections of the zzso zzso binding domain zzso two zzso zzso We discovered 100 zzso sequences containing this zzso with a wide variety of functional zzso Two groups within this family have the same zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso Group 1 has a zzso selectivity zzso Group 2 is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso We present analysis of the functional domain architecture for the group of 100, a putative zzso tree, comparison of the protein zzso with the corresponding species zzso consideration of the distribution of these proteins among classes of zzso and zzso relationships between zzso and human zzso zzso zzso We introduce a construct called the zzso zzso Network, which represents a putative zzso of domain zzso underlying the domain composition of present zzso We believe that scientists interested in zzso channels in general, and zzso zzso channels in particular, will be interested in this zzso The work should also be of interest to zzso researchers who are interested in the use of functional zzso analysis in evolutionary and functional zzso
