We sought to determine the spectrum of zzso producing zzso in Egypt using zzso zzso and a variety of zzso zzso Thirty-four zzso and three zzso zzso patients originating from different regions of Egypt were zzso and the zzso zzso was found in 69 of 71 zzso zzso zzso Four zzso accounted for zzso of zzso genes in this population; zzso zzso 110 zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter zzso a zzso zzso at the third zzso of an zzso site consensus zzso has been described previously only in one zzso one zzso one zzso and one Black American zzso Nine other zzso each accounted for zzso of zzso zzso Among these was one zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso previously seen only in a Black American, and a rarely observed zzso in the zzso promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that from a molecular genetic standpoint a zzso prevention program based on carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis can be implemented in zzso In couples at risk for zzso the zzso zzso should be identifiable in both members in zzso and in one member in the remaining zzso
