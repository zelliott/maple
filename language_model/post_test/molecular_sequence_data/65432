The human zzso gene was found as a candidate tumor zzso for zzso cell zzso and encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report a new family of proteins consisting of three zzso zzso members, zzso zzso and zzso which were found by domain and zzso zzso Besides the zzso zzso and zzso zzso there was a zzso motif at the zzso zzso zzso containing potential motifs for nuclear zzso and export zzso Gene expression of these genes was examined by zzso at the zzso level and by Western zzso and zzso at the protein zzso zzso family genes showed variations in the expression level among zzso and kidney cell zzso Furthermore, the results of zzso of these genes in zzso cells suggest that all of these family proteins have an identical role in the formation of zzso stress zzso
