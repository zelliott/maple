zzso A zzso a zzso protein expressed by many neuroendocrine cells, zzso zzso and zzso is the precursor of various peptides that regulate the zzso metabolism and the cardiovascular zzso We have found that zzso locally administered to injured mice, can accelerate zzso proliferation and wound zzso This biological activity was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso fragments, but not the corresponding zzso zzso could selectively recognize the zzso on zzso (a zzso zzso that is zzso during wound zzso and regulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso No binding was observed to other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies showed that the entire zzso region is crucial for zzso recognition zzso zzso 7 zzso This region contains an zzso site zzso zzso followed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso both crucial for binding affinity and zzso These results suggest that the interaction of the zzso motif of zzso with zzso regulates zzso physiology in wound zzso
