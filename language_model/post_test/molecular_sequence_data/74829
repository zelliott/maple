zzso produced zzso are important zzso regulators of zzso growth and differentiation in cattle and zzso The key zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso of this gene in fetal zzso is the first regulatory step of zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to comparatively investigate if zzso mechanisms as zzso and zzso DNA zzso might be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Earlier investigations demonstrated that cattle and sheep use different zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso During the present investigation, zzso of individual zzso zzso within these promoter regions was analyzed with zzso direct sequencing in zzso and zzso zzso zzso abundance in sheep was determined with zzso Both promoters contain only few zzso and can therefore be classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso The average zzso levels of both promoter regions were significantly reduced in zzso compared to zzso and corpus zzso of both species, which zzso zzso with high and low expression levels, zzso It was evident however that even zzso zzso can show very different, individual zzso zzso From the data we conclude that zzso zzso promoters are zzso zzso in zzso and bovine zzso zzso of zzso and maternal zzso zzso DNA zzso is suggestively involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso the DNA zzso status on its own is not sufficient for the selection of zzso zzso zzso zzso
