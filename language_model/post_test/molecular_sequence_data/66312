Japanese pear zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso mechanism controlled by a single zzso with multiple zzso each of which contains separate genes that determine the zzso identity of zzso and zzso The zzso S gene is the zzso zzso zzso whereas good candidates for the zzso S gene are the zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a bud zzso of zzso zzso zzso S zzso has a zzso zzso zzso which lacks the S zzso gene but retains the zzso S zzso To delineate the deletion zzso in the zzso we constructed a bacterial artificial zzso zzso library from an S zzso and assembled a zzso zzso of zzso zzso around the S zzso zzso zzso of DNA from S zzso and zzso and the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso allowed the identification of a deletion of 236 zzso spanning from 48 zzso upstream to 188 zzso downstream of S zzso The zzso lacks 34 predicted open reading frames zzso including the S zzso and a zzso zzso protein gene zzso as S zzso zzso zzso zzso with a primer pair designed from the deletion junctions yielded a product specific for the zzso The product could be useful as a maker for early selection of SC zzso harboring the zzso
