The complete zzso acid sequence and zzso location of canine zzso zzso were determined by analyzing various fragments produced chemically and/or zzso zzso zzso consists of two light zzso and two heavy zzso chains with 83 and 245 zzso acid zzso zzso It has three potential zzso zzso zzso one in the L chain and two in the H zzso All of them are zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences between canine zzso and human zzso shows 68 and zzso zzso for L chains and H zzso zzso About zzso of the canine L chain still retains a zzso zzso zzso which is completely removed during maturation in human zzso The zzso zzso at position 15 in the L chain, which zzso in the zzso chain zzso bridging in human zzso has been replaced by a zzso zzso in canine zzso zzso an zzso unit in canine zzso may be joined to another zzso unit by a zzso zzso zzso interaction to form the complete zzso The zzso bridges in canine zzso link zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso as in the case of human zzso
