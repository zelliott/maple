We used an animal model system to transplant zzso mice with one million zzso cells which had zzso zzso collected from zzso zzso treated zzso and zzso zzso with zzso containing a multiple drug zzso zzso gene zzso zzso Following recovery from the zzso we exposed these mice to doses of zzso ranging from 7 zzso to 30 zzso which zzso to doses of 68 to 268 zzso in zzso The median white blood cell count by 5 days after zzso zzso as the percentage of the white blood cell count before zzso was zzso zzso zzso in 11 courses of zzso in mice transplanted once with zzso zzso zzso immediately after zzso whereas the median white blood cell count by 5 days after zzso in mice not transplanted with zzso zzso was zzso in nine courses of zzso zzso zzso This difference is statistically different at the P zzso zzso level zzso zzso One million zzso cells from the zzso transplanted mice were harvested and serially transplanted through five additional zzso of mice, and tested with zzso after each zzso The white blood cell count zzso as the percentage of zzso white blood cell zzso after each cohort ranged from zzso in the 29 mice transplanted with the zzso zzso zzso which had been through more than one zzso This is statistically different from the median white blood cell count recovery after zzso in mice which have no human zzso modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
