zzso zzso can function as zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth zzso We report that human zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso express zzso Lewis X zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso a zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Freshly isolated or cultured zzso bind zzso zzso zzso zzso which is specific for zzso zzso The relevant zzso is bona fide zzso because zzso treatment of zzso suspensions abrogates zzso binding while generating de zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso stained in zzso suspension display a zzso membrane distribution of zzso zzso by zzso zzso As others have reported, zzso appeared not to bind zzso in perpendicular skin zzso However, zzso zzso in intact zzso sheets exhibited obvious zzso zzso with zzso when stained and viewed en face, suggesting that zzso in intact zzso may occur in bands that parallel the major tissue zzso zzso specifically zzso proteins of Mr 34 zzso 44 zzso and 56 zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar proteins from zzso zzso The zzso basis for zzso zzso expression was studied by analyzing zzso zzso and other properties of zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso express both zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso could be an important element of the zzso zzso because both zzso cells and immune cells that home to zzso express zzso and related structures, and because zzso zzso is well positioned for zzso zzso binding after zzso zzso The apparent zzso of zzso in zzso and on isolated zzso are compatible with a functional role for zzso in these zzso zzso
