We have compared zzso DNA zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of repeatedly cloned zzso zzso zzso showing DNA amplification with zzso and zzso zzso of the same lineage that do not show DNA zzso DNA restriction patterns and the degree of zzso between zzso DNA fragments of zzso displaying DNA amplification and those of zzso without amplification were zzso In addition, the zzso sequence of the zzso b zzso gene from the coding region was compared between these two groups of zzso zzso changes were found in the zzso sequences and the zzso acid sequences of the zzso gene of the zzso of zzso with DNA zzso The zzso genes from both groups had much shorter open reading frames than the same gene from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The simultaneous changes in zzso and zzso of these zzso suggest that they may zzso the advantage of maintaining viable zzso function under selective zzso
