zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso is a segment polarity gene essential in each segment for normal zzso zzso We here report the isolation of two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and thus the existence of a zzso gene family in zzso zzso and zzso map to zzso 2 position zzso and zzso X position zzso zzso zzso and zzso like the other known zzso zzso zzso zzso signal peptides suggesting that the gene products are zzso zzso The putative translation product of zzso and the zzso half of the deduced zzso product are both rich in zzso zzso zzso In comparison with other zzso gene products, mostly about 40 zzso zzso relative molecular mass, the zzso protein has an extended zzso zzso and a long internal zzso and its predicted relative molecular mass is 113 zzso zzso The expression patterns of these two zzso zzso are dynamic during zzso zzso The distribution of zzso transcripts is predominantly zzso with the additional presence of transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso appear to be associated with limb zzso in the zzso and may therefore specify limb zzso zzso is also expressed in zzso and zzso zzso The distribution of zzso transcripts in cells of the central nervous system zzso during zzso zzso suggests that zzso could be involved in zzso zzso
