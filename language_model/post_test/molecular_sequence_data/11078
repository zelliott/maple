zzso are important regulators of zzso zzso At the time zzso in zzso zzso is produced by zzso cells, in response to zzso zzso The mechanism by which OT zzso the release of zzso remains to be zzso We have used 13 different cultures of bovine zzso zzso cells to study the effect of OT on the regulation of zzso and to identify the possible involvement of zzso zzso OT induced a zzso increase of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso concentration in zzso cells labeled with zzso or loaded with zzso zzso a fluorescent microscope imaging zzso zzso OT induced a zzso increase of both zzso production and zzso gene expression (as demonstrated by zzso and Northern zzso zzso production was increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso gene expression (as determined by zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with OT zzso zzso treatment, compared with zzso zzso of zzso (1 zzso and a specific zzso inhibitor zzso 1 zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed at zzso levels, but no effect of OT was detected on their zzso Combined to zzso 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to decrease significantly zzso zzso zzso the zzso increase of zzso zzso Furthermore, partial bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso An zzso of zzso and zzso was found in relation with rat and zzso for zzso zzso zzso was found to bear zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in relation to zzso guinea zzso and human, zzso zzso these results zzso for the first time, that zzso is involved in the mechanism by which OT regulates zzso production in the zzso
