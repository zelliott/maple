Through a series of promoter deletions and gene transfer experiments we have examined the zzso regulation and zzso repression of the rat zzso zzso zzso Three regions of the zzso zzso sequence were found to influence the zzso level of promoter function in zzso zzso zzso Region A zzso to zzso zzso contains an apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso while regions B zzso to zzso zzso and C zzso to zzso were found to contain important sequences required for optimal promoter zzso Previous work has demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by approximately 50% in isolated rat liver zzso and, in this study, we have demonstrated that the ability of the zzso zzso promoter to drive zzso expression is similarly zzso in zzso cells treated with 1 zzso zzso Furthermore, the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso is decreased by zzso in zzso zzso cells treated with zzso Interestingly, promoter activity was not decreased by zzso in zzso cells, which lack zzso zzso The current data show that sequences from zzso to zzso zzso are sufficient to support the zzso response, and, zzso they suggest that repression may not require direct interaction of the zzso complex with the promoter zzso
