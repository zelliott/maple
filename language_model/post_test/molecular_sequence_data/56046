zzso of zzso acid zzso in the human pathogen zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso and not by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (both obtained from zzso or zzso showed that the last three compounds were donors of zzso acid zzso to the first zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso respectively, served as zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso nor zzso donated zzso acid units to zzso zzso when incubated with zzso This showed that only zzso acid units bound to terminal zzso zzso were zzso zzso was converted to zzso and zzso to zzso when incubated with the appropriate zzso The fact that zzso was converted to a zzso zzso as zzso on zzso zzso suggested that zzso acid units may be transferred to internal zzso zzso although once linked to those zzso they can not be further transferred to other zzso zzso acid zzso linked alpha zzso but not alpha zzso or alpha zzso were transferred by the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso served as zzso of zzso acid units, thus suggesting that terminal zzso zzso units in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso by the zzso As the zzso employed in these experiments has been shown to be located on the external surface of the zzso and to be shed to the zzso the relatively broad specificity shown by the zzso with respect to zzso and zzso zzso strongly suggests that infection by zzso zzso might alter the zzso acid distribution in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso
