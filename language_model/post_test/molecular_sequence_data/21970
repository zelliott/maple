A zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso library by zzso with a zzso rabbit serum raised against a crude extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso acid zzso which exhibits high similarity zzso to zzso molecules from various other organisms, including zzso zzso After zzso and expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso the resulting zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso by zzso zzso showed functional zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso using zzso obtained from zzso mice zzso with crude extracts zzso of zzso zzso or other zzso species, zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso or zzso mice infected with zzso larvae by the zzso zzso In addition, we used zzso to investigate the presence of zzso and zzso zzso against this zzso in zzso from patients infected with zzso zzso Mouse zzso obtained after infection with zzso or raised against zzso zzso but not zzso raised against zzso zzso showed strong zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also obtained good zzso in Western zzso with zzso from mice zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not with zzso from mice zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast to the experimental zzso in mice, we were unable to detect zzso zzso zzso in zzso from human patients infected with zzso (15 zzso and the levels of zzso zzso zzso in these zzso were low and apparently zzso These results seem to indicate that, during natural infection in humans, zzso zzso larvae do not offer sufficient zzso stimulus to induce zzso zzso
