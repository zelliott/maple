zzso of zzso zzso have been designed and zzso to incorporate a zzso or a zzso function in place of the zzso group of the template zzso zzso design was based on the three-dimensional models of the solution structures of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso which had been derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted solution structure of the zzso analog as its minor groove complex with duplex zzso was confirmed by direct high-resolution zzso zzso combined with molecular zzso using zzso distance zzso While the zzso analog was unable to cleave DNA in the presence of zzso zzso the zzso analog of zzso zzso was found to be an effective zzso of DNA at low concentration when activated by zzso zzso a difference ascribed to the zzso for copper zzso of the zzso site in its minor groove complex with zzso
