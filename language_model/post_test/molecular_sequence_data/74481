The zzso gene encodes a putative zzso box zzso factor that controls tomato fruit zzso and its zzso inhibitor zzso zzso yields zzso zzso In this study, the molecular properties of zzso and the zzso zzso protein were zzso The results revealed that the zzso protein accumulates in zzso fruit specifically and is localized in the nucleus of the zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso forms a stable zzso that binds to zzso zzso DNA zzso Analysis of binding site selection experiments revealed that the consensus binding sites of zzso highly resemble those of the zzso zzso zzso which are zzso zzso box proteins that control the identity of floral zzso zzso exhibited a zzso function similar to that exhibited by the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso exhibits similar molecular functions to zzso proteins although they play distinctly different biological zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso binds to the zzso of zzso Our results also revealed that the zzso zzso protein accumulates in the zzso fruit and exhibits a zzso activity similar to that exhibited by the zzso zzso but has lost its zzso function, which in turn would inhibit zzso in zzso zzso
