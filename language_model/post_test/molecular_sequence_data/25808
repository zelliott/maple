A series of zzso zzso zzso have been used to type zzso at the zzso zzso zzso DNA was amplified to high copy number by the zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso of the zzso amplified DNA to a series of 14 zzso enabled the identification of the major zzso zzso Certain zzso zzso and zzso could be rapidly and accurately identified by running the products of zzso amplification of zzso DNA on zzso zzso This approach facilitated the typing of zzso zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso previously detected by the mixed zzso reaction including zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso types obtained by zzso probing zzso to rules of zzso inheritance when they were applied to a series of 75 zzso A full DR type could be obtained from many individuals simultaneously without needing to separate or store viable zzso Thus, this technique may have considerable implications for the analysis of disease associations with zzso class II zzso particularly in circumstances where facilities for the initial preparation and storage of the samples may be zzso
