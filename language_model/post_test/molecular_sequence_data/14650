The addition of organic compounds to groundwater in order to promote zzso may represent a new selective pressure on subsurface zzso The ability of zzso zzso which serves as a model for the zzso species that are important in various types of zzso groundwater zzso to adapt for rapid metabolism of zzso a common zzso amendment, was zzso zzso transfer of five parallel cultures in a medium with zzso as the sole electron donor yielded five strains that could metabolize zzso faster than the zzso zzso Genome sequencing revealed that all five strains had zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso from one of the five strains into the zzso strain zzso rapid growth on zzso This strain and the five zzso evolved strains had four to zzso higher transcript abundance than zzso cells for genes for the two zzso of zzso zzso an zzso required for growth on zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the protein zzso by zzso bound to the putative promoter of the zzso zzso zzso The binding sequence was not apparent elsewhere in the zzso These results demonstrate that a zzso zzso in a zzso regulator can have a significant impact on the capacity for zzso zzso and suggest that zzso evolution should be considered as a potential response of zzso to environmental zzso imposed during zzso
