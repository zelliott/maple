We have obtained a zzso clone coding for human transforming growth factor zzso zzso The clone was isolated from a zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso using zzso zzso based on the partial zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence predicts that zzso 2 is zzso as a zzso zzso precursor from which the mature zzso zzso 2 zzso is derived by zzso zzso The proteins coded for by the human zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso show an overall zzso of zzso The mature and zzso precursor regions show zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis identified zzso 2 transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso from several different zzso Analysis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells showed that these cells contain higher numbers of transcripts for zzso 1 than for zzso 2, although they produce more zzso 2 protein than zzso zzso This suggests that there is a zzso level of regulation for the production of these zzso
