zzso zzso catalyze the commitment step to zzso and other important biological precursors which make this class of zzso essential for the survival of bacteria, plants and zzso This class of zzso is not found in humans, making them an attractive new target for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a representative from this class, with little known about the key zzso acids involved in zzso specificity and zzso zzso from zzso coli has been zzso zzso and zzso zzso Through zzso zzso and zzso kinetic studies the zzso that comprise a zzso zzso for zzso the zzso zzso zzso an active site zzso zzso and the base zzso zzso have been identified and zzso Several zzso which zzso zzso specificity for both zzso and zzso have also been identified and zzso zzso zzso of an active site zzso to either zzso or zzso drastically increase the zzso for zzso assigning this zzso to a binding role for the zzso group of zzso An active site zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso while the zzso zzso of zzso is positioned for zzso by a zzso zzso zzso functionality at either of these positions alters the zzso ability to effectively zzso zzso or zzso respectively, reflected in an increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso The data presented here provides new details of the zzso mechanism of zzso resolves a controversy between alternative zzso zzso and provides a starting point for the development of selective zzso of zzso
