zzso zzso protein zzso is made in the zzso as a zzso imported into the zzso and processed to the mature form in two zzso We report here that the intermediate produced following the first processing step associates specifically with a zzso complex zzso with the zzso zzso large zzso peak in zzso zzso and is then processed into mature zzso This processing event is slowed down in zzso cells deficient in synthesis of zzso proteins in the zzso Thus the second processing step of zzso occurs during zzso zzso depends on one or more zzso proteins made in the zzso and may be required for the maturation of the 50 S zzso zzso The mature zzso protein shows extensive sequence zzso at its zzso to zzso coli zzso protein zzso which is located at the interface between 30 S and 50 S zzso and is involved in the formation of the zzso binding zzso
