zzso is the major source of methane in zzso The majority of investigations have focused on zzso zzso for which zzso electron transport is dependent on the production and consumption of zzso as an zzso although the great majority of zzso are unable to metabolize zzso The presence of zzso c and a complex zzso zzso to the zzso zzso nitrogen zzso complexes distributed in the domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso species suggesting fundamentally different electron transport zzso Thus, the zzso electron transport chain of zzso zzso zzso was investigated to advance a more complete understanding of zzso zzso 

A component of the CO zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso and shown to reduce a zzso zzso using an zzso zzso reduction of the zzso to zzso of zzso Mass zzso analysis of the zzso identified the zzso gene among zzso for nine zzso zzso in the zzso Reduction of zzso zzso from zzso cells with zzso lead to reduction of zzso zzso zzso c that was zzso by the addition of either the zzso of zzso M and zzso B zzso or zzso the soluble analog of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso that was dependent on addition of zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso identified genes zzso to zzso c and the zzso complex of zzso zzso 

The results support roles for zzso zzso c and zzso in the zzso electron transport zzso of zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of involvement of a zzso c in zzso zzso The results suggest that diverse zzso zzso species have evolved diverse zzso electron transport pathways leading from zzso and culminating with zzso zzso electrons to the zzso zzso zzso for reduction of zzso
