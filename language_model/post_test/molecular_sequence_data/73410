zzso a zzso protein highly expressed during zzso plays an essential role in the differentiation of the zzso cells, particularly in the structural changes of zzso taking place at the end of the zzso To shed light on the mechanisms that zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso during zzso and stabilize the message when zzso is not longer active, we have compared the characteristics of zzso transcripts in mature and immature zzso and zzso zzso In mature chicken zzso zzso starts at a site placed closer to the zzso promoters than in zzso zzso This site is upstream from the zzso box used in zzso zzso In addition, zzso transcript zzso an alternative zzso that produces a longer zzso untranslated region in mature zzso These findings may provide a basis for the observed increase in expression of zzso in mature chicken zzso and for the stability of the message when zzso zzso at the end of zzso
