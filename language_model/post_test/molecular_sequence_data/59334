zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso factors zzso which act as zzso signal molecules on zzso zzso The common zzso zzso present in all zzso species, are required for the synthesis of the core structure of zzso zzso is an zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso nod genes are involved in diverse zzso zzso that zzso plant zzso We transferred to zzso zzso a broad zzso tropical zzso the ability to zzso zzso by introducing nod genes of zzso zzso In addition to the specific zzso and zzso zzso the common zzso genes of zzso zzso were required for infection and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso hybrid strain, which contained zzso zzso and were partly zzso with zzso zzso fatty zzso were able to elicit zzso formation on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes suppressed the ability of the zzso to zzso zzso Studies of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in contrast to zzso of zzso zzso is able to transfer zzso zzso fatty acids onto the zzso backbone and zzso zzso of zzso zzso specifies the synthesis of zzso zzso These results show that zzso variation of the common zzso genes is a genetic mechanism that plays an important role in signaling variation and in the control of host zzso
