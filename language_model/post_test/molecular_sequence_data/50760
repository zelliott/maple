zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression as determined by increased zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso activity in mouse zzso zzso rat zzso zzso E and human zzso zzso cancer cell zzso In contrast, treatment of these cell lines with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso at zzso as high as zzso M resulted in only minimal induction of zzso zzso levels or zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso M zzso plus different zzso zzso zzso of zzso or alpha zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso activity in the three cell zzso Moreover, using zzso M zzso it was shown that the alpha zzso and zzso antagonism of zzso zzso gene expression was paralleled by a decrease in levels of the nuclear zzso zzso complex as determined by zzso zzso analysis of the nuclear zzso The binding of nuclear extracts from the treated cells to a synthetic consensus zzso responsive element zzso (a zzso was determined by gel zzso studies using zzso In cells treated with zzso M zzso or zzso plus zzso M alpha zzso the zzso decrease in zzso zzso gene expression by alpha zzso was also paralleled by decreased levels of a retarded band associated with the nuclear zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the results of the gel shift zzso of nuclear extracts treated with zzso M zzso or zzso plus zzso M zzso indicated that there were relatively high levels of nuclear zzso zzso complex in the cells zzso with zzso plus the zzso but this was not accompanied by induced zzso gene zzso The results suggest that alpha zzso and possibly zzso compete with zzso for zzso zzso zzso binding zzso however, zzso may also inhibit the induction response by competing for and/or partially zzso zzso binding zzso
