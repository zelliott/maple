zzso is a type zzso zzso having a regulatory N zzso whose zzso action can be suppressed by binding of zzso zzso or of zzso zzso zzso N zzso is able to interact with a region of the small zzso loop connecting zzso zzso 2 and zzso To determine the role of this interaction in zzso we analyzed single point zzso produced by zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to Ala of any of six tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso renders an zzso that is less dependent on zzso for zzso These results highlight the relevance in zzso zzso of a negative charge of the surface area of the small zzso zzso The most zzso of these zzso is zzso zzso which is less activated by controlled zzso or by zzso zzso the zzso zzso has an apparent affinity for zzso higher than zzso zzso Moreover, its zzso is stronger than that of zzso zzso suggesting a more direct involvement of this zzso in the mechanism of zzso Among the other produced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso zzso is less dependent on zzso for activity than the wild zzso The results reported in this study provide the first evidence that the small zzso loop of a type zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of the zzso zzso
