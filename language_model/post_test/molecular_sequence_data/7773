We have investigated the regulation of gene expression of a novel zzso zzso family, zzso in zzso mouse zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso which zzso with only one of strain zzso of the zzso By zzso with zzso zzso the zzso protein was zzso detected in zzso zzso from zzso to zzso stage, but no signals were zzso in zzso zzso To know the timing of paternal zzso zzso we examined the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso No positive signals were zzso in zzso before zzso zzso In early zzso stage zzso positive signals appeared in the peripheral region of the zzso From late zzso stage, the protein was zzso zzso and was persistently expressed in all types of zzso We have also applied a sensitive methodology to distinguish genetic zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction followed by single strand zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the paternal transcripts were first detected in zzso zzso while the maternal transcripts were constantly zzso These results indicate that the transcripts and proteins of zzso were derived only from the maternal gene from zzso to zzso zzso and that from zzso stage the paternal gene is also zzso and the significant increase of the zzso derived protein occurred around late zzso zzso
