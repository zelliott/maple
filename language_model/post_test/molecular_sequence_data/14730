Plant cell shape is determined by the orientation of cellulose zzso in the primary cell zzso zzso zzso that affect genes zzso the zzso responsible for the synthesis of zzso zzso the cellulose zzso zzso zzso can alter cell shape zzso particularly in the roots of affected zzso The multiple response zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results from a point zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes one of the three zzso of the cellulose zzso zzso zzso required for synthesis of cellulose in the primary cell zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso with three other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso showed that these four zzso form an zzso series with respect to their root zzso with zzso being the weakest zzso identified to zzso These analyses demonstrated that zzso affects a significant zzso of cell shape in the roots of these zzso and likely suppresses root cell division in them as well, and that the chemical zzso acid can suppress these effects of zzso Interestingly, the cell walls in the roots of these four zzso zzso contain different percentages of zzso and these percentages correlate with the lengths of the roots and zzso cells in these roots when grown on media containing high levels of zzso
