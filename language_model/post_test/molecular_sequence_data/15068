zzso are characterized by expression of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and/or zzso and some muscle structural genes in a population of cells that continues to zzso Because zzso is sufficient to induce terminal differentiation in a variety of cell types, we have sought to determine the molecular mechanisms that prevent zzso activity in human zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that a combination of zzso zzso complexes and a novel zzso form of zzso compete with zzso for the generation of active full-length zzso zzso A forced zzso between zzso and the full-length zzso robustly restores differentiation in zzso cells and broadly suppresses multiple zzso zzso Our studies indicate that zzso represent an arrested progress through a normal transitional state that is regulated by the relative abundance of zzso between zzso and the full-length zzso zzso The demonstration that multiple zzso mechanisms can be suppressed and zzso differentiation can be induced in the zzso zzso by increasing the abundance of zzso zzso suggests a central zzso function that can be targeted to force differentiation in muscle cancer zzso
