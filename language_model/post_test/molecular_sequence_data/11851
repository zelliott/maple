The cell zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso and in promoting zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso contains six zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region, followed by five zzso type zzso zzso zzso is capable of undergoing zzso binding as well as zzso zzso To map the zzso binding domain in zzso three zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins zzso zzso and zzso were prepared and coupled to zzso and their zzso binding activity was determined using the zzso binding zzso Only zzso was capable of zzso zzso Next, zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were expressed and subjected to similar zzso Only zzso and zzso were capable of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and soluble zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso binding site resides within zzso To examine effects of these zzso zzso proteins on zzso zzso neural retinal cells were cultured on different zzso fusion zzso Both zzso and zzso were potent zzso of zzso zzso These results thus indicate that the zzso zzso domain 2 alone is sufficient to mediate zzso interaction and promote zzso outgrowth from retinal zzso
