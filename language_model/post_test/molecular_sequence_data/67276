In this study, zzso community structure and zzso dynamics were zzso using zzso zzso clone libraries construction from a horizontal subsurface flow constructed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene sequences shows that zzso of the total operational zzso units zzso were affiliated with zzso a newly proposed zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Among the total zzso zzso and zzso were affiliated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively with more than zzso zzso zzso suggest that several dominant and active zzso may benefit from the zzso conditions around the zzso roots to perform zzso zzso The zzso diversity detected in the zzso zone is clearly different from that detected in the bottom zzso This engineered habitat revealed the zzso root and the water composition effects on the zzso zzso
