The bacterial zzso is a highly complex zzso zzso It is the motor that drives bacterial zzso and despite the large amount of energy required to make and operate zzso zzso organisms have a strong zzso zzso zzso zzso is both complex and highly coordinated and it typically involves at least three zzso zzso Part of the zzso is a type III zzso system, and it is via this structure that zzso components are zzso The assembly of a zzso occurs in a number of zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso functions in this process by detecting when the zzso hook zzso has reached its optimal zzso zzso then zzso hook export and assembly and zzso a signal to begin filament export, the final stage in zzso zzso As yet the exact mechanism of how zzso achieves this is not zzso Here we review what is known of the zzso protein and discuss the evidence for and against the various hypotheses that have been proposed in recent years to explain how zzso controls hook zzso zzso as a molecular ruler, the measuring cup theory, the role of the zzso N zzso the zzso molecular ruler theory, and the molecular clock zzso
