We present a comparative study on zzso mapping of four zzso zzso directed against four different zzso using alternative zzso display techniques and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the largest zzso of zzso zzso II, zzso with the tumor zzso protein zzso zzso with the zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso were determined zzso by zzso zzso display libraries, constructed by zzso zzso random gene fragments cloned into the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by random zzso zzso libraries displaying zzso and zzso peptides at the zzso of the zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso display libraries a single round of affinity selection resulted in the determination of the corresponding zzso for all zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso and zzso random zzso libraries was only successful for two of the zzso zzso and zzso after three or four rounds of zzso For the zzso zzso we recovered the zzso from both the zzso and zzso library, for zzso only the zzso library displayed the zzso zzso However, screening of the random zzso libraries with zzso and zzso failed to yield zzso zzso Fine mapping of the zzso by zzso scan revealed that the minimal zzso recognized by zzso and zzso consist of four and five zzso zzso respectively, whereas zzso requires a minimal zzso of 11 zzso acids for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not react with any of the zzso zzso zzso The limits of the different methods of zzso mapping tested in this study are compared and the advantages of the zzso zzso display system are zzso
