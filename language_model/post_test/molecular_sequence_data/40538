zzso play an important role in human cancer development, and have been isolated from a number of animal zzso However, the association of zzso with tumors has been poorly investigated in zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso zzso was cloned from sheep zzso cell zzso Unlike the already known zzso zzso belonging to the Delta zzso zzso lacks the zzso open reading frame and maintains the zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso zzso exclusively zzso cells, and was found in skin of healthy sheep of geographically separated flocks located in zzso zzso This new virus is zzso active in tumors and shares low zzso with all the other zzso establishing a new zzso Taken together, the zzso of zzso and tumors, its cell and tissue zzso and its gene repertoire, suggests a role for this virus in development of sheep zzso cell zzso
