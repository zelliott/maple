zzso zzso was isolated from several turkey flocks at different locations in the United States that were clinically affected with respiratory zzso Five of these zzso from four series of outbreaks had patterns similar to the zzso vaccine strain of zzso zzso by random amplified zzso DNA zzso analysis using three different primer sets, whereas with a fourth primer set zzso and zzso only two of the zzso were similar to zzso zzso obtained by sequencing portions of the zzso zzso and zzso genes and an zzso surface zzso gene indicated that the field zzso had DNA sequences that ranged from zzso to zzso similar to the zzso zzso In some of the outbreaks there was an indirect association with the presence of commercial layers in the area that had been vaccinated with this vaccine strain, but there was no known close association with vaccinated birds in any of the zzso zzso were challenged with two of the field zzso and with zzso vaccine zzso zzso challenged with the field zzso developed respiratory disease with zzso and a typical zzso zzso zzso response, whereas birds challenged with zzso developed no respiratory signs or zzso and developed only a weak zzso zzso Although these zzso were very similar to the zzso vaccine strain, it was not possible to prove that they originated from the vaccine zzso is possible that they could be naturally occurring field zzso
