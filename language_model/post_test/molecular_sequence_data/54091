zzso zzso is an important cellular zzso zzso is an essential protein component in the zzso system, as it contains the molecular motor that zzso protein zzso In this study, a zzso approach was applied in the search for possible zzso zzso regions in protein zzso motor zzso Novel zzso regions in zzso coli zzso were zzso zzso multiple zzso sites were also identified in other motor proteins such as zzso which is involved in zzso protein zzso The zzso signal recognition particle zzso zzso though not a motor zzso is in many ways related to zzso and was therefore included in this zzso The results demonstrate a possible general feature for motor proteins involved in protein zzso
