To understand how snake zzso interact with zzso zzso zzso we have elaborated an zzso based model of the zzso zzso zzso This model was achieved by using zzso a three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso domain derived from the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the previously solved zzso structure of the zzso and zzso nine pairs of zzso identified by zzso experiments to make contacts between the zzso and zzso zzso Because the zzso loop F zzso entrance of the toxin binding pocket, we submitted this loop to a dynamics simulation and selected a zzso that allowed the toxin to reach its binding zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso complex model was validated a zzso by an additional zzso zzso The model shows that the toxin interacts zzso to the zzso zzso in an equatorial position of the zzso zzso The tip of the toxin central loop plugs into the zzso between two zzso just below the functional zzso loop C, the zzso tail of the toxin making adjacent additional interactions at the zzso zzso The zzso establishes major contacts with the toxin by its loop C, which is assisted by principal zzso A and zzso and complementary zzso D, zzso and 1) functional zzso This model explains the zzso properties of the toxin toward the zzso zzso and opens the way to the design of new zzso
