The zzso A gene from zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli from zzso plasmids when zzso was initiated from a promoter in the cloning zzso The zzso A zzso zzso was found to have an zzso mobility in sodium zzso zzso gels of zzso zzso identical in size to the mature zzso A made by zzso zzso Analysis of the location of zzso A in various bacterial compartments by zzso revealed that zzso A was exported by zzso coli into its zzso zzso Several functional zzso including analyses of zzso bond formation, zzso of zzso activity, and zzso cell zzso were used to establish that the zzso of zzso A isolated from the zzso coli zzso space is identical to that of zzso exported by zzso zzso to its zzso zzso Previous studies with zzso plasmids expressing zzso A from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gray, zzso Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso showed a complete lack of processing and export of zzso A in zzso coli, differing from results reported zzso These discrepancies may be explained by observed differences in the sequence of signal peptides zzso by the zzso A genes of zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso
