zzso inherited bacteria that reside zzso or zzso in zzso can increase their prevalence in the population by altering their zzso zzso Such zzso zzso have been reported from the major zzso groups such as insects (in particular zzso zzso zzso and zzso crustaceans zzso and zzso Despite the observation that zzso bacteria are frequently encountered in zzso and that the sex ratio of particular zzso species is strongly female zzso a direct relationship between bacterial infection and sex ratio variation has not yet been demonstrated for this zzso zzso 

zzso of the dwarf zzso zzso zzso exhibit considerable variation in the sex ratio of their zzso and were infected with at least three different zzso bacteria capable of altering host reproduction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments show that sex ratio variation in this species is primarily zzso inherited and that removal of the bacteria by antibiotics restores an unbiased sex zzso Moreover, zzso of females infected with zzso were significantly female biased while zzso females showed an even sex zzso As female biased zzso were of significantly smaller size compared to zzso zzso killing of male zzso appears to be the most likely manipulative zzso 

This represents to our knowledge the first direct evidence that zzso bacteria, and in particular zzso might induce sex ratio variation in zzso These findings are pivotal to further understand the diversity of zzso zzso observed in this zzso zzso
