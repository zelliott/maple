zzso zzso has important regulatory functions in the immune system, particularly in the generation of zzso zzso the principal zzso of allergic zzso The molecular basis of zzso action has remained elusive so zzso Here we report on a novel human zzso factor, termed nuclear factor zzso zzso which is zzso activated by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding sequences for zzso were identified in the promoter regions of the zzso controlled zzso and I zzso zzso We defined a zzso zzso consensus sequence zzso as zzso element zzso Point zzso analysis of the zzso promoter showed that binding of zzso to the zzso is essential for the initiation of gene zzso in response to zzso zzso was not activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso either alone or in combination suggesting a non classical zzso for zzso signal zzso
