Mouse cell lines of different lineages have been established which zzso zzso large quantities of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso An existing bovine zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was modified to allow transformed zzso myeloma cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells to zzso carry multiple copies of the zzso to express the inserted zzso zzso a single zzso zzso and to zzso the zzso in high zzso Cell lines transformed with zzso zzso zzso carried zzso copies of the zzso per cell and zzso zzso biologically active zzso in quantities similar to those produced by zzso zzso zzso cells or rat zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso of the 3' untranslated region containing zzso sequences from the zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso production and zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso of a heavy metal further increased the production 2 to zzso zzso transformed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso times higher activities of zzso than the zzso leukemia line zzso zzso produced by the similar zzso induced zzso zzso of a T cell line, a mast cell line and B leukemia cells, and enhanced the production of zzso by B zzso zzso zzso were 150 times higher than those produced by the zzso zzso T cell line zzso zzso was zzso by similar zzso at zzso higher zzso than those produced by zzso zzso zzso T cells, as judged by the proliferation and maturation of B cell leukemia zzso The expression zzso should be useful in establishing zzso cell lines producing proteins from full length zzso clones at higher zzso The established cell lines zzso zzso 3, 4 or 5 at high rate should be useful sources for these zzso in the investigation of their function in the immune zzso
