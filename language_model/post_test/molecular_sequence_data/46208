The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel type of zzso zzso inhibitor with eight zzso zzso that are all involved in zzso zzso We have produced zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso and determined its zzso bond zzso By zzso zzso of all eight zzso zzso we show that three of the four zzso bonds are required for zzso zzso The six zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso contain one zzso bond that is not embedded in its overall zzso zzso is not processed by the tomato zzso zzso zzso and is an uncompetitive inhibitor of zzso We also produced zzso zzso proteins in which selected zzso acid zzso were individually replaced by zzso and, in one zzso all six zzso zzso acid zzso were zzso We determined the zzso constant zzso ) of these zzso for zzso and their ability to trigger a zzso hypersensitive response zzso in zzso We found that the two zzso zzso zzso and the six zzso acid zzso tail of zzso are required for both zzso zzso activity and the ability to trigger a zzso zzso Individual replacement of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso did not affect significantly the biological activity of zzso Overall, our data suggest that the affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso with their ability to trigger a zzso zzso
