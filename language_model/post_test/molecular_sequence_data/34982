zzso that are presented by zzso class I zzso are processed from two potential sources, as zzso newly zzso zzso proteins for direct presentation on the surface of most zzso cells and zzso proteins for zzso typically by professional zzso In this study, we present data that zzso the zzso zzso and open zzso of zzso expressed on activated cells in a zzso for the presentation of zzso proteins by zzso This zzso is distinguished from the conventional zzso zzso by its independence from TAP and zzso and its sensitivity to zzso of zzso zzso and further distinguished by its dependence on zzso zzso zzso recognition for zzso zzso Thus, our data from in zzso experiments collectively support a previously zzso model of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso open zzso on activated zzso and zzso which may significantly contribute to the regulation of immune system functions and the immune zzso
