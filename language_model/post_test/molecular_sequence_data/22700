zzso characterization of the zzso region of zzso yellow seed 1 shows the presence of two genes that are arranged in a head to tail zzso The two duplicated gene copies, zzso and zzso are separated by a zzso zzso zzso region, which is largely composed of highly repetitive zzso The zzso is the functional zzso while the zzso may represent a zzso there are several sequence zzso and zzso within the putative coding region of zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso type of zzso domain protein that regulates the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes required for the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso can be observed throughout the plant and it represents a combination of expression patterns produced by different zzso of the zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis within the coding regions and zzso sequences of zzso zzso and their zzso and zzso zzso show local zzso and insertions that may have created modified regulatory zzso These zzso modifications possibly are responsible for differential patterns of expression in zzso and zzso floral and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso and zzso sequences may have arisen by gene zzso mechanisms and represent an zzso parallel event to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
