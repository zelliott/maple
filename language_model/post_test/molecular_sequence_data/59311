Since the cloning of a full length zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso several laboratories have been actively trying to develop an optimal animal model to understand the zzso of zzso zzso zzso diseases and have made considerable zzso To date, results from our laboratory have indicated that the nature of the zzso and the zzso used for zzso zzso background of the animal and fine zzso of zzso zzso might play an important role in determining the qualitative nature of the zzso zzso Although an ideal animal model for either zzso disease or primary zzso is not yet available, ongoing studies in our laboratory and elsewhere hold promise for establishing animal models for various zzso zzso zzso diseases in the near zzso
