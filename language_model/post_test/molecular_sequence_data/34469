zzso zzso which is zzso in almost all zzso organisms, is the most abundant natural polar zzso on zzso In plants, zzso is highly accumulated in the zzso zzso and is an important bulk constituent of zzso zzso However, precise functions of zzso in photosynthesis have not been well zzso Here, we report a novel zzso zzso from the green sulfur zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis using zzso as a zzso The gene zzso zzso was essential for this zzso only zzso zzso zzso could be zzso An zzso zzso zzso affected in zzso assembly of zzso c zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in the construction of the zzso complex called zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso has been independently established in each zzso zzso to perform photosynthesis under different environmental zzso We zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso expression of zzso The zzso plants showed almost normal levels of zzso although they also had abnormal zzso zzso including reduced zzso content, no zzso dominance in shoot growth, zzso flower development, and zzso These observations provide new insights regarding the importance of regulated zzso synthesis in the physiology of higher zzso
