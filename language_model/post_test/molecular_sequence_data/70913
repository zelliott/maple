Small zzso of the zzso family are regulators of zzso protein trafficking in zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso play an important role as down regulators of zzso We here report the molecular cloning of a novel zzso gene zzso for GAP for zzso by high expression from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein with a molecular mass of 87 zzso zzso of its primary sequence with that of the three other known zzso for transport zzso the zzso zzso and zzso proteins and the zzso from rat brain, shows similarity between the zzso zzso zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso is not essential for zzso cell zzso zzso was able to most effectively accelerate the intrinsic zzso activity of zzso It was also active, but to a lesser extent, on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the human zzso protein did not serve as zzso We also report the identification and cloning of a gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a protein whose primary structure and zzso activity are significantly related to those of zzso from zzso zzso
