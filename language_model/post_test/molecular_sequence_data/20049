A full-length zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first zzso gene reported in the zzso zzso third in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso strain indicates that it encodes a functional zzso Gene expression analyses revealed that the transcript levels of zzso were elevated in zzso treated with 5 zzso zzso or zzso but inhibited in zzso treated with 50 zzso zzso or 450 zzso zzso The elevated expression of zzso in the 5 zzso zzso zzso together with the ability of zzso to provide tolerance to a zzso zzso suggests that zzso might afford protection against zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso and 5 zzso zzso treatments that also produced an zzso damage to the zzso zzso suggests that zzso may play a role in the regulation of the zzso status of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
