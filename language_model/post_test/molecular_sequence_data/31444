zzso group zzso protein complexes repress zzso regulator genes by zzso their zzso How different zzso proteins assemble into complexes and are recruited to their target genes is poorly zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the core of the zzso zzso protein complex zzso zzso complex zzso which contains the zzso response element zzso protein zzso and zzso The zzso region of zzso separated from the zzso domain by a long flexible zzso forms a tight complex with the four zzso brain tumor zzso domain of zzso The highly zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso binds three of the four human zzso domain proteins in an analogous manner but with lower zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and human zzso complex structures provides a molecular explanation for the lower affinity of zzso for human zzso domain zzso zzso zzso that disrupt the interaction between zzso and zzso abolish formation of a zzso zzso complex in zzso and repression of zzso regulator genes in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is therefore essential for zzso repression in zzso Our results support a model where DNA zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso interactions of zzso with zzso modifications and other zzso proteins create a hub for zzso protein complex assembly at zzso
