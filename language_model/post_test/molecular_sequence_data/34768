We present a novel zzso method for zzso meaningful motifs from biological sequence zzso This de zzso motif extraction zzso zzso is data driven, finding motifs that are not necessarily zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso class of zzso containing approximately zzso zzso zzso a relatively small set of motifs is zzso This set spans a zzso that is used for functional zzso of the zzso by an zzso zzso The zzso based on zzso motifs zzso that of two other zzso based zzso zzso a method based on the analysis of zzso properties of a protein generated from its sequence of zzso zzso and zzso applied to a zzso distances zzso Our findings demonstrate that the zzso zzso extracts relevant zzso supporting a successful zzso zzso
