A zzso locus zzso zzso genes for a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified and zzso To achieve this, two sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used in zzso These zzso were selected based on highly zzso units of known zzso zzso involved in zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso The discrete amplified bands from zzso zzso 300 zzso for zzso and zzso 500 zzso for zzso proved to be integral part of the zzso DNA of zzso zzso were cloned and zzso zzso alignments of both fragments confirmed the putative zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso The present study describes the identification and cloning of zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso which can be used to identify a genetic locus zzso zzso zzso in other microbial zzso
