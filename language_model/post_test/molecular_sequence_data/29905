Two behavioral zzso of zzso zzso zzso A1 and zzso have single zzso acid defects in the structure of zzso The zzso exhibit several major zzso current defects under zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso current activated upon zzso of zzso is greatly reduced or missing in both zzso zzso both zzso lack a zzso zzso current activated upon zzso and zzso the zzso zzso current is significantly smaller in zzso A1 compared with the wild type, whereas this current is slightly increased in zzso zzso zzso minor defects include a reduction in peak zzso of the zzso zzso current in zzso zzso increased rates of zzso zzso of this zzso current in both zzso A1 and zzso zzso and an increase in the time required for the zzso zzso current to recover from zzso in the zzso The diversity of the zzso zzso effects on zzso current function may indicate specific associations of zzso with a variety of zzso zzso channel species in zzso
