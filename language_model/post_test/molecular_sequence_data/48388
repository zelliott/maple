To describe the molecular characteristics of four Japanese patients with cone zzso with zzso rod responses zzso 

Four individuals with a clinical and zzso diagnosis of zzso were zzso The zzso findings of the zzso zzso zzso included a decrease in the rod responses, a square-shaped zzso an excessive increase in the zzso in the bright flash responses, and decreased zzso zzso zzso screening of the coding regions and zzso zzso sequences of the zzso channel, zzso zzso member 2 zzso gene was performed with zzso zzso The segregation of each zzso was confirmed by screening other family zzso zzso in zzso the zzso consequences for protein function were zzso 

There were two siblings from one family and one case in each of the two zzso One family had a zzso zzso zzso screening revealed compound zzso for the two zzso zzso and zzso in three patients, and zzso for complex zzso zzso and zzso in one patient from the zzso zzso There were three putative novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso The four zzso in the families with zzso were highly zzso in other zzso In zzso analyses predicted that all of the zzso zzso would alter protein zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were identified in four Japanese patients with zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso features are helpful in making a molecular diagnosis of zzso Three novel zzso were identified, and we conclude that there may be a distinct spectrum of zzso zzso in the Japanese zzso
