The zzso locus of the mouse encodes the zzso zzso light chain joining zzso zzso Four zzso zzso have been described on the basis of restriction zzso length zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso have been determined and are compared with the previously reported zzso zzso sequence zzso strain, zzso The mouse sequences are also compared with published sequences for rat and human J zzso zzso Far more differences were found between the zzso zzso and the other mouse zzso than between any two of the zzso These result in two zzso acid zzso which distinguish the zzso and zzso segments of the zzso zzso from the other three zzso Use of the zzso Analysis Using zzso program to generate a zzso tree strongly indicates that after divergence from the rat zzso there appears to have been an early split between the zzso zzso and the evolutionary precursor of the other mouse zzso There also appears to have been far less divergence from the ancestral condition in the zzso zzso than in the other zzso Also, the presence of only one zzso zzso among the four mouse zzso provides strong evidence against any crossing over within the zzso locus during the history of these zzso Finally, the differences in rates of evolution of the zzso zzso are in marked contrast to the relatively uniform rates of divergence of four zzso of a mouse V zzso zzso zzso
