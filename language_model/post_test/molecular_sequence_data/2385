zzso a major class of zzso zzso consists of a family of proteins that are zzso in molecular zzso The presence of internal deletions in previously described zzso clones for zzso and bovine zzso suggested that alternative zzso of transcripts could account for the protein size zzso Analysis of the zzso structure of the bovine zzso gene provided sequence information necessary to detect new zzso of zzso transcripts by in zzso amplification zzso The zzso transcripts found corresponded to zzso species missing one or more zzso which suggested that by skipping various zzso during zzso zzso a family of proteins is zzso Four major zzso protein zzso isolated from bovine brain were identified by comparison with translation products of zzso zzso and the use of zzso raised against synthetic zzso These studies provide zzso and a basis for analyzing potentially altered forms of zzso proteins in brains of patients with Alzheimer's zzso
