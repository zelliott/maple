zzso receptors are zzso zzso channels formed by the zzso assembly of five zzso zzso around the central channel zzso The five zzso zzso segments largely line the zzso In the present work we zzso the water surface accessibility of the zzso zzso zzso segment using the zzso zzso accessibility zzso We zzso the reaction of the zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso by its effect on subsequent currents zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso applied with zzso reacted with 14 of the 19 zzso zzso At the zzso zzso end from 2' to zzso only zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in the presence of zzso We zzso that the zzso segments are tightly packed in this zzso Toward the zzso half of zzso all zzso from zzso zzso through zzso zzso reacted with zzso applied with zzso We zzso that this region is highly mobile and loosely packed against the rest of the zzso Based on differences in zzso reaction rates two zzso can be distinguished on the putative zzso side of zzso A faster reacting domain includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The slower reacting face contains the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We zzso that these may represent the zzso faces in the closed and open states and that gating involves an zzso degrees rotation of the zzso zzso These results are consistent with the loose packing of the zzso segments zzso from the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
