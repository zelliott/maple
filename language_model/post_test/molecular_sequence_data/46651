zzso zzso C zzso is a family which consists of multiple zzso whose distinct zzso roles within the cell are zzso We have previously demonstrated that levels of zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso melanoma cells can be modulated by zzso zzso We investigated this regulation by cloning and characterizing the promoter region of the zzso zzso alpha zzso A 13 zzso mouse zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso region, first zzso and first zzso was isolated and zzso Two zzso initiation sites were identified at zzso and 925 zzso upstream from the translation start zzso The promoter region contained a zzso box at zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site, but no zzso zzso zzso activity differed between cell lines and correlated with the levels of zzso alpha expressed in these cell zzso zzso gene zzso showed that the region between zzso and zzso zzso likely contains a zzso zzso The promoter activity of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was zzso twofold by zzso zzso Within this region zzso to zzso zzso there is a zzso acid response zzso An zzso spanning this region specifically bound zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso nuclear zzso These results suggest that zzso acid increases zzso alpha gene expression in zzso cells, at least in part, through direct zzso stimulation of its zzso
