The identification of the zzso involved in the metabolism of simple and complex carbohydrates presents one zzso challenge in the zzso zzso Here, we present the zzso and zzso zzso for identifying those proteins adopting the zzso barrel fold that function as zzso These zzso are based on the observation that proteins adopting the zzso barrel fold share positions in their zzso structures having equivalent sets of atomic zzso These are zzso zzso interaction positions, which have been implicated in both structure and zzso zzso adopting the zzso barrel fold share more zzso zzso interactions than zzso barrel proteins having other zzso The enrichment pattern of zzso zzso interactions in the zzso is the information that zzso and zzso use to predict whether any given zzso barrel will function as a zzso or zzso Using as a test set a database of 19 zzso and 45 zzso zzso barrel proteins with low sequence zzso zzso and zzso can correctly predict zzso function for zzso of the proteins known to function as zzso zzso and zzso incorrectly predict zzso function for zzso of the zzso The program zzso can also correctly identify zzso of the 19 zzso however, it incorrectly predicts zzso function for 50% of the zzso zzso greater than zzso and zzso Overall, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are both more selective and sensitive for predicting zzso function than the zzso zzso zzso
