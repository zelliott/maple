Roots of most plants in nature are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the beneficial effects of this zzso to the host plant is the transport of water by the AM zzso from zzso soil water resources to host zzso Here, an zzso zzso zzso gene from an AM fungus zzso zzso which was named zzso is reported for the first zzso From experiments in different zzso host roots growing under several environmental conditions, it seems that zzso gene expression is regulated in a zzso way regarding host root zzso zzso At the same time, from in zzso experiments, it was shown that a signaling communication between zzso zzso and zzso zzso took place in order to regulate gene expression of both zzso and host root zzso This communication could be involved in the transport of water from zzso favorable growing zzso or host roots to zzso zzso
