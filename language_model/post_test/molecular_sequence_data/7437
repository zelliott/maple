The zzso fusion gene is thought to have a critical role in the zzso of zzso with zzso To specifically inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells having the zzso fusion zzso we constructed two zzso zzso against zzso Two zzso sites were targeted as zzso site 1 for zzso zzso a zzso located 3 bases upstream from the fusion zzso site 2 for zzso zzso an zzso located 3 bases downstream from the fusion zzso In a zzso system, zzso and zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso dependent on the concentration of zzso When these zzso were zzso to zzso cells, an zzso cell line with zzso they were able to inhibit the cell zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso may be applied as a new therapeutic agent in the treatment of zzso with zzso
