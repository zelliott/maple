In zzso zzso at least 17 DNA replication genes are zzso expressed at the zzso boundary during the cell zzso All of these genes have the DNA sequence element zzso in their zzso upstream regulatory zzso This sequence has been shown to be essential for periodic expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso and HO genes are another subset of genes that are expressed with the same timing as the DNA replication zzso Their periodic expression requires the participation of two zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso gene zzso In this study, we present evidence that zzso contributes to the regulation of DNA replication genes as zzso Surprisingly, a preferential requirement for zzso over zzso is observed in our studies of zzso reporter gene expression in zzso This selectivity has not been observed for the other zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso results, zzso complexes formed in zzso on zzso zzso elements are either abolished or reduced in zzso delta deletion zzso
