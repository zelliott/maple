In zzso zzso zzso cells, interaction between zzso is believed to occur after their transport out of the zzso zzso We show here that, in zzso zzso the rate of transport of the other zzso to the zzso apparatus is highly reduced whereas zzso of zzso proteins is not significantly zzso This leads to zzso of immature zzso in distended rough zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were still observed in zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso was found in zzso zzso cells which lack zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso an intermediate amount of zzso less zzso accumulated in the rough zzso zzso and the transport of zzso to the zzso occurred with zzso similar to that of control zzso In zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso cells, which do not express zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso The amount of several zzso zzso proteins increased in conjunction with zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of rough zzso zzso zzso allowed the recovery of the accumulated zzso in soluble zzso We conclude that optimal export of the zzso out of the zzso zzso is dependent upon zzso Our data suggest that zzso interacts with the other zzso in the rough zzso zzso and that the formation of this complex is required for their efficient export to the zzso
