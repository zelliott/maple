zzso structure models of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso were built by the zzso modeling technique from the crystal structures of nuclear zzso Two models were created based both on known zzso domain structures of the receptors with the highest sequence identity to the zzso zzso and on those of steroid hormone zzso The latter model, which was found to have better zzso quality and be in good agreement with the binding of the zzso framework of the zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to the zzso model revealed that the zzso zzso can interact with the zzso in a similar manner to other steroid zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was performed based on the zzso between the zzso and zzso expected by molecular zzso The interactions of the zzso with the zzso in the complexes modeled were investigated and found to be consistent with known zzso zzso
