Many aquatic zzso use gas zzso to regulate their depth in the water zzso The molecular basis for the novel physical properties of these zzso zzso remains mysterious due to the zzso of either solution or single crystal structural zzso In the present study, some folding constraints for the approximately zzso zzso building blocks of the zzso are established via zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso studies of intact and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso show no evidence of zzso modification of the zzso The extent of zzso zzso shows that the zzso rich zzso zzso of zzso is exposed to the surface in both zzso The bonds that are zzso by zzso and zzso are exclusively in the extended zzso of the zzso zzso protein and in the extended zzso of the zzso zzso zzso All the potentially zzso zzso bonds in the central, highly zzso portion of the protein appear to be zzso from zzso attack in spite of the fact that some of the corresponding side chains are almost certainly exposed to the zzso zzso
