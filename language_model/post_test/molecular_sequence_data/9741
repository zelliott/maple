zzso binding to its zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso which associate with several zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify unique zzso zzso we screened a human heart zzso library with zzso zzso zzso and obtained two zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso protein has been shown to associate with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, Chinese zzso zzso cells, and bovine brain zzso zzso a protein structurally similar to zzso was also shown to form a complex with zzso protein using a zzso expression zzso The amount of zzso protein associated with zzso was not affected by insulin stimulation but was increased significantly by treatment with zzso acid, a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso peptides of zzso revealed that zzso contains three putative binding sites for zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso Among these three, the motif around zzso is located in the zzso binding domain of zzso which is responsible for the interaction with the insulin zzso Indeed, a truncated zzso of zzso consisting of only the zzso binding domain retained the capacity to bind to zzso protein in zzso Finally, the effect of zzso protein binding on the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso acid analysis revealed that zzso zzso with zzso zzso to be zzso zzso after insulin zzso on zzso as well as zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso with zzso zzso Thus, the association with zzso protein may play a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity by interrupting the association between the insulin zzso and zzso
