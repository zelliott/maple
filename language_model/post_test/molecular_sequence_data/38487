The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a promising drug target against tropical zzso As zzso zzso genes are assumed to be highly zzso we have cloned and expressed the zzso zzso of the zzso strain zzso In comparison to the known zzso of the zzso zzso strain there are three base exchanges all of them leading to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso 285 and zzso The zzso efficiency zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso lower than for the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso the drugs zzso zzso blue and zzso the two zzso species exhibited identical zzso zzso Two structural motifs which are specific for zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso deletion analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be important for folding and stability of the zzso whereas the zzso zzso was found to be involved in zzso The zzso has no major influence on the known functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of inactive point zzso showed that zzso forms a zzso charge transfer complex and zzso is the interchange zzso which reduces zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a normal zzso for zzso zzso reduction but only zzso residual zzso activity when compared with zzso zzso which confirms its function as an zzso zzso The zzso zzso in combination with the zzso zzso zzso appear to be a suitable target zzso for zzso zzso in zzso
