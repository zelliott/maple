zzso protein C zzso is proposed to take on a zzso zzso arrangement around the thick filament backbone in cardiac muscle, based on interactions between cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have now determined, using zzso zzso and in zzso binding zzso that the zzso interaction is not dependent on the zzso zzso insert in zzso Furthermore, an interaction of similar affinity occurs between zzso zzso and zzso of fast skeletal muscle zzso but not between these zzso of the slow skeletal muscle zzso These data have implications for the role and zzso structure of zzso in skeletal zzso
