zzso and zzso properties of the V2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified in patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso were investigated by expression in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity failed to detect function for the truncated zzso although zzso labeling demonstrated normal levels of protein zzso zzso zzso performed on cells expressing the receptors zzso at the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso failed to detect zzso zzso on the plasma zzso Treatment with zzso H revealed that the zzso was present only as a precursor form because the mature zzso zzso resistant to zzso H treatment, was not zzso The precursor of zzso had a longer zzso than that of the wild type zzso suggesting that arrested maturation may slow the degradation of the zzso zzso experiments had demonstrated that zzso containing eight additional zzso zzso was expressed on the plasma membrane and functioned zzso zzso zzso longer than zzso revealed that four of the eight zzso acids identified initially provided the minimum length required for the protein to acquire cell surface zzso This was shown by the production of mature zzso zzso zzso in zzso which zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso activity and bound zzso In addition, the identity of zzso acid 340 was found to play a role in this zzso In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the zzso zzso is zzso because it does not reach the plasma membrane and that the minimal protein length required for zzso of the zzso to the cell surface is sufficient to zzso function to the zzso zzso They also suggest the existence of a protein quality control in the zzso zzso independent of zzso
