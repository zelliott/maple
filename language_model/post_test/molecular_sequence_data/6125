The zzso sequence of the zzso 186 zzso from zzso was determined and was found to contain two open reading frames highly similar to the tail sheath gene zzso and tail tube gene zzso of zzso zzso The reading frames were identified as genes J and I by marker rescue zzso A late promoter zzso was identified by zzso reporter and primer extension zzso Northern analysis suggested that the zzso transcript predominantly terminated immediately after gene I, although some transcripts could extend to the zzso zzso at zzso
