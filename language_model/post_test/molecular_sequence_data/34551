zzso is a globally distributed zzso of zzso zzso zzso of interest as a model system for the study of zzso and the biological control of zzso zzso Species recognition in zzso is difficult due to a lack of zzso zzso zzso This has zzso assessment of species diversity in this zzso and investigation of their natural zzso A zzso approach was used to investigate molecular zzso diversity of zzso and several zzso related zzso zzso zzso were based on nuclear zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso sequences for 86 zzso zzso from diverse geographic origins, zzso and insect zzso zzso trees were zzso using maximum zzso and zzso likelihood zzso Six well supported zzso within zzso zzso designated zzso were resolved in the zzso and combined gene zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous species that is characterized zzso by zzso to zzso zzso was determined to be zzso and consists of two unrelated zzso zzso A and zzso zzso A is globally distributed and includes the Asian zzso zzso zzso and its probable synonym zzso zzso All zzso contained in zzso C are zzso and originate from Europe and North zzso zzso B includes zzso of zzso zzso a zzso species complex characterized by zzso zzso zzso D includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso which produce zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from Asia, includes zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that both produce zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso branch in the zzso zzso includes the South American species zzso zzso which produces zzso zzso zzso diversity detected within zzso A, B and C suggests that prevailing zzso species concepts underestimate species diversity within these zzso Continental zzso of lineages in zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso indicates that isolation by distance has been an important factor in the evolutionary diversification of these zzso zzso tests indicate that host association is essentially random in both zzso zzso zzso zzso A and C, supporting past assumptions that this species is not host zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso B and D occurred primarily on zzso zzso although sampling in these zzso was insufficient to assess host zzso at lower zzso zzso The zzso placement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso corroborates prior reports of these zzso zzso These results establish a zzso framework for further zzso zzso and comparative biological investigations of zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso
