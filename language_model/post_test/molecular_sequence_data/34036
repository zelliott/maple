In recent years, the use of zzso zzso in biomedical research has increased zzso However, with the exception of the zzso population, knowledge of the zzso class II zzso of the species remains zzso Here, using zzso cloning and zzso sequencing, we identified zzso full-length zzso class II zzso in a group of 12 Indonesian and 12 Vietnamese zzso zzso Forty two of these were completely novel to zzso zzso while 61 extended the sequence of previously identified zzso from partial to full zzso This more than doubles the number of full-length zzso zzso zzso class II zzso available in zzso significantly expanding the zzso library for the species and laying the groundwork for future evolutionary and functional zzso
