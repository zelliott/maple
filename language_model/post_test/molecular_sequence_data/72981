The zzso are a family of recently identified zzso zzso binding peptides derived from the zzso processing of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso chains of zzso They have previously been identified at high concentration in human zzso zzso and in the zzso of patients with cerebral zzso zzso are potent zzso of zzso converting zzso and therefore possibly have a role to play in blood pressure zzso We report the presence of four zzso peptides in extracts of normal adrenal tissue and in zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and structurally characterized using mass zzso High zzso of zzso were found in all samples, comparable with the levels reported in the literature for zzso and brain zzso
