Prevention of zzso urinary tract infection zzso a leading cause of zzso disease, is complicated by the propensity of bacteria to form zzso on zzso medical devices zzso 

To better understand the microbial diversity of these communities, we report the results of a zzso bacterial survey of Foley urinary zzso obtained from patients following total zzso Two patient zzso were zzso based on treatment or no treatment with systemic zzso antibiotics during zzso zzso indicate the presence of diverse zzso zzso that were most commonly observed in patients who did not receive systemic zzso The communities typically contained both zzso and zzso zzso that included multiple potential zzso 

Prevention and treatment of zzso must take into consideration the possible zzso nature of any particular zzso
