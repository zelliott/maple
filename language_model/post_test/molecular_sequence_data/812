zzso zzso are the most common zzso in women of zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso show recurring structural zzso anomalies, including zzso zzso zzso and anomalies affecting zzso or zzso Using zzso cloning strategies, we and others had previously identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso referred to as zzso as primary target zzso genes associated with tumor development in three of these distinct zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso cloning of a single, zzso zzso anomaly, zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso intervals showed that that zzso zzso zzso and zzso flank the zzso on zzso 1 and that zzso and zzso flank the zzso on zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso regions revealed that in this particular case the zzso was associated with a zzso deletion on zzso 1 and a zzso zzso on zzso zzso No zzso zzso genes were zzso In zzso prediction of zzso factor binding sites, however, indicated the presence of several such sites in the respective zzso regions, and major changes zzso as a result of the zzso under zzso We zzso that zzso deregulation of one or more of these zzso genes may contribute to the development of human zzso zzso
