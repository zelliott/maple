An 800 zzso zzso DNA containing promoter region of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and used as a zzso probe against the zzso DNA, which led to the identification of another zzso zzso zzso showing zzso to zzso A corresponding clone of zzso DNA was isolated from a zzso gene bank zzso The restriction zzso analysis and zzso zzso of zzso DNA indicated the zzso zzso was located in the zzso zzso region zzso zzso omega zzso deletion of zzso zzso DNA resulted in a zzso strain zzso that delayed to zzso the stems of zzso zzso This zzso was zzso by the introduction of zzso carrying nod locus 5 zzso
