zzso proteins destined for zzso into the inner membrane of bacteria or the zzso zzso membrane in zzso cells are zzso by zzso bound to the bacterial zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso membrane integration, zzso zzso segments in the nascent chain exit the zzso through a lateral gate that opens toward the surrounding zzso but the mechanism of lateral exit is not well zzso In particular, little is known about how a zzso zzso behaves when entering and zzso the zzso Using zzso peptides from bacterial zzso proteins and from the zzso zzso protein as force sensors, we show that substantial force is exerted on a zzso zzso at two distinct points during its transit through the zzso channel, providing direct insight into the dynamics of membrane zzso
