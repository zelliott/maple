A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was discovered containing a deletion of 37 zzso acids near the zzso tail and has been designated zzso The 111 zzso corresponding to the deleted zzso acid sequence were found in a separate zzso bounded by consensus zzso junction sequences in rat zzso zzso A partial restriction map of zzso DNA zzso this region placed the deleted zzso approximately 600 base pairs zzso downstream of the upstream zzso zzso analysis of zzso from different brain regions showed that the deletion zzso is more abundantly expressed in the brain stem and zzso while the full-length form is expressed more abundantly in the zzso bulb, zzso zzso and zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso from different brain regions with zzso specific for the deleted zzso zzso full-length zzso and for the zzso junction zzso zzso indicated approximately zzso zzso zzso The probe for the deleted zzso zzso to transcripts in zzso bulb, cortex, zzso and zzso while the zzso junction probe zzso most strongly to transcripts in zzso The results suggest an interesting zzso to zzso shift in the expression of zzso zzso of the zzso which may signify important functional differences in native forms of zzso zzso
