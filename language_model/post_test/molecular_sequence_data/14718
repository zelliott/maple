zzso is a key zzso in the zzso of zzso a critical component of the outer envelope of zzso zzso Embedded in the zzso face of the inner zzso zzso zzso the transfer of zzso acid zzso to the zzso A precursor of zzso Here we present crystal structures of the free and zzso forms of zzso from zzso zzso an ancient zzso zzso These structures reveal details of the zzso site and zzso a unique sequence motif zzso in zzso zzso In addition, a cluster of highly zzso zzso acid zzso was identified which represents the potential zzso and zzso binding site of zzso A series of zzso zzso experiments revealed critical roles for zzso 30 and zzso 31 in zzso zzso Our results provide the structural basis of a critical reaction in zzso zzso and allowed the development of a detailed model of the zzso mechanism of zzso
