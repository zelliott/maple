zzso zzso are activated by the exchange of bound zzso for zzso a process that is zzso by zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso The zzso unit of zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso domain followed almost zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The majority of the zzso interface forms between the switch regions of the zzso and the zzso domain, but full zzso activity often requires the associated zzso zzso Although zzso zzso are usually characterized as zzso regions, they also participate in zzso zzso For example, the zzso zzso domain of zzso must contact its zzso zzso for efficient zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which zzso exchange on both zzso and zzso is fourfold more active in zzso than the isolated zzso zzso Given continued uncertainty regarding functional roles of zzso zzso zzso we have undertaken structural and functional analyses of the zzso zzso cassette of zzso The crystal structure of this zzso of Trio bound to zzso zzso highlights the engagement of the zzso domain with zzso and substitution of zzso involved in this interface substantially diminishes zzso of zzso and zzso Also, these zzso significantly reduce the ability of full-length Trio to induce zzso outgrowth dependent on zzso zzso in zzso zzso Overall, these studies substantiate a general role for zzso zzso zzso in engaging zzso zzso directly for efficient zzso zzso exchange and support a zzso explanation for the essentially zzso linkage between zzso and zzso zzso
