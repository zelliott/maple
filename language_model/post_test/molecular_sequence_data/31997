In this study, we cloned and zzso a zzso pair zzso band, zzso in the tightly linked random amplified zzso DNA marker zzso and converted it into a zzso amplified region zzso marker referred to as zzso which was specific for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso basic local alignment search tool search showed that the sequence of zzso had no primary sequence zzso with known zzso and Southern zzso confirmed this zzso This zzso marker was used to detect zzso zzso zzso in zzso and it was successfully amplified in zzso zzso itself, a complete set of zzso zzso zzso addition lines zzso and zzso zzso group addition zzso This zzso marker will be a powerful tool for the zzso selection of zzso zzso zzso in a wheat background, and it should also allow wheat breeders to screen for the excellent traits found in zzso zzso zzso
