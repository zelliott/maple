The zzso sequence upstream of the zzso coli zzso gene presents features similar to those found in zzso system regulatory sites zzso zzso box, zzso and zzso promoter boxes and a zzso binding zzso zzso fusion zzso demonstrate now that this region controls zzso in a zzso zzso way and that the reporter gene expression is zzso by DNA damage zzso to zzso C zzso Increased expression does not result from an increase in zzso copy zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso The zzso product is predicted to be a 96 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso protein whose function is not yet zzso Unlike other zzso zzso the construct carrying the zzso regulatory region is not stationary phase zzso
