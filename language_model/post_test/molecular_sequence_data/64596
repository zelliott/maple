We examined the modification of the zzso zzso during zzso the zzso reaction, and studied its role in zzso These studies revealed that the molecular mass of zzso in zzso zzso was approximately zzso Dalton zzso zzso A limited change in molecular mass was seen in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso extracts with zzso zzso zzso reduced the molecular mass of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso to 23-20 zzso suggesting that zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso is zzso and indicating that zzso zzso minor zzso modifications in the structure of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was redistributed from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the head and equatorial segment after zzso and zzso reaction, respectively, when traced by indirect zzso under in zzso zzso zzso zzso Some zzso did not stain for the zzso zzso and might represent zzso that have shed the zzso zzso experiments conducted to assess the effect of an zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that this zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso binding was not zzso These findings suggest the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
