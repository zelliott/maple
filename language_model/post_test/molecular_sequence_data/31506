Since the original description of zzso zzso zzso zzso in 2009, additional samples available from humans and ticks from Europe and zzso respectively, have been used to further characterize zzso strains belonging to this group of zzso that zzso zzso as zzso zzso These investigations suggested the presence of related strains in Europe and Asia and confirmed their status as representing a distinct zzso Furthermore, samples that were investigated by researchers from China and Japan confirm the ecological relationship of members of this proposed species with zzso and suggest that it has a wide distribution in zzso Here, we use zzso and genetic distance analyses to validate zzso zzso zzso zzso as a species within the zzso zzso zzso zzso species zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso
