zzso and zzso zzso zzso that bound and neutralized zzso zzso virus zzso were isolated from a large pool of random sequences by multiple cycles of in zzso selection using infectious viral zzso The selected zzso pool of zzso sequences at a concentration of zzso zzso completely neutralized the zzso Of 19 sequences cloned from the selected pool, 5 inhibited zzso zzso The selected zzso and zzso zzso were shown to neutralize zzso by interacting with the virus, rather than by adversely affecting the host zzso The selection of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by intact zzso immediately suggests the potential application of this approach to develop zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of other viruses such as human zzso zzso
