zzso is a zzso important zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was found by random zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso A bulky side chain at position 332 is deleterious to the transport zzso A spontaneous zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and identified as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located on opposite ends of zzso segment zzso As judged from zzso binding to zzso zzso the zzso at position zzso which is originally exposed to water, was buried in the membrane by a zzso zzso through a remote zzso change of zzso segment zzso This effect is the same as that of a zzso zzso at position 30 through zzso segment II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was also suppressed by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was moderately suppressed by the zzso zzso These results indicate the presence of a close zzso relationship between the zzso regions of the zzso segments II and zzso
