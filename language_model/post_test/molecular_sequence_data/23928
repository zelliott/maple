zzso zzso of the zzso family regulate a spectrum of functionally diverse downstream zzso initiating a network of signal zzso pathways by interaction and zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso are defined as proteins that selectively bind the zzso state of the small zzso there have been also several indications for a zzso binding zzso By characterizing the molecular mechanism of zzso interaction with its zzso we have determined the equilibrium zzso zzso of several zzso zzso of three different zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso is zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso using zzso zzso In addition, we have identified two novel zzso zzso in zzso which bind zzso with high affinity but not zzso or zzso Our results, together with recent structural data, support the notion of multiple zzso sites in zzso and strongly indicate a cooperative binding mechanism for zzso and zzso that may be the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso
