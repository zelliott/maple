The barley zzso gene not only controls plant height but also yield and zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the long arm of zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene was located in the zzso region of the rice zzso gene zzso on zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso of rice zzso was isolated from barley using zzso chain zzso The barley and rice genes showed a similar gene structure consisting of three zzso and two zzso Both genes share zzso zzso sequence similarity and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso A single zzso zzso was identified in zzso 2 between barley varieties zzso and zzso zzso with zzso known to contain the zzso zzso zzso The single zzso zzso zzso marker was mapped to zzso zzso in a doubled zzso population of zzso zzso zzso zzso with 178 zzso zzso zzso trait locus analysis revealed that plant height zzso with the zzso The zzso gene in barley is the most likely zzso of the zzso in zzso The result will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling zzso zzso and provide a diagnostic marker for selection of zzso gene in zzso
