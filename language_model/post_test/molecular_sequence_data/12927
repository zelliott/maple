The role of specific zzso acid zzso within the sequence region between zzso and zzso of the human zzso hormone zzso zzso in the zzso interaction has been zzso Competitive binding activities of seven sets of synthetic peptides were evaluated with both zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso Set 1 included two overlapping peptides zzso zzso and alpha zzso spanning the alpha zzso region, while zzso 2-6 included peptides of different size or structure in which the alpha zzso sequence was zzso zzso truncated either from the zzso or from the zzso or zzso zzso alternatively reduced to a series of overlapping zzso zzso or zzso modified at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with substitution by Ala zzso In Set 7, synthetic peptides related to the parent alpha zzso zzso were prepared in which all the zzso zzso were zzso either zzso or multiply with zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso The zzso values of the parent alpha zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were 2 and 7 zzso zzso M, depending on whether the zzso was present as the zzso or the free acid form, zzso The zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso was totally inactive in the zzso zzso The zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso and zzso all contribute to the zzso interaction, with zzso being the major zzso zzso zzso Similar results were observed when these peptides were evaluated in the zzso zzso where the zzso value for the parent alpha zzso zzso was observed to be 2 or 3 zzso zzso M, depending on whether the zzso was the zzso or the free zzso The zzso zzso did not appear to contribute to the zzso zzso however, removal of zzso and zzso resulted in significant decreases in binding zzso The zzso zzso studies of the alpha zzso zzso revealed that zzso contributes to zzso zzso binding activity but does not contribute to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or substitution of zzso with zzso in the alpha zzso zzso sequence prepared as part of the Set 1 synthetic peptides zzso the alpha zzso zzso zzso or as part of the Set 6 zzso series, alpha zzso zzso confirmed the involvement of this zzso in the zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
