Recently, several groups have designed and zzso zzso devices based on DNA that can switch between different zzso in response to sequential addition of fuel DNA zzso There is considerable interest in improving the speed of these zzso One approach is the use of rationally designed DNA zzso to promote zzso of complementary zzso A particularly simple and robust DNA device reported by Li and Tan is comprised of a zzso zzso zzso that folds into a zzso zzso zzso We have identified the key zzso barrier in this device as the tendency for one of the fuel strands B to fold into the zzso zzso of the device zzso This seriously zzso the restoration zzso We have designed a zzso strand to inhibit the folding of B and shown that the catalyst speeds up the restoration reaction by roughly a factor of zzso The catalyst remains effective even after repeated cycling
