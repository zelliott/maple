The zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels is the final step in zzso and visual zzso Previously we have shown that, in addition to their zzso by zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso compounds can directly open zzso zzso channels through a zzso reaction that results in the zzso of a free zzso group on a zzso zzso To identify the target zzso of zzso we have now zzso the four candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso channel into zzso zzso All zzso channels continue to be activated by zzso zzso but only one of them, the zzso zzso channel, exhibited a total loss of NO zzso This result was further supported by a similar lack of NO sensitivity that we found for a natural zzso of this precise zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso region of the channel known to be important in channel zzso zzso analyses suggested that at least two of these zzso zzso on different channel zzso were involved in the zzso by zzso Our results show that one single zzso zzso is responsible for NO sensitivity but that several channel zzso need to be activated for channel opening by zzso
