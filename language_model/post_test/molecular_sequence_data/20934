zzso zzso zzso zzso channels respond to diverse stimuli and thus function as the primary zzso of varied sensory zzso They are also activated by various compounds and secondary zzso to mediate zzso interactions as well as to detect changes in the local zzso Their zzso roles have been primarily characterized only in mice and fruit flies, and evolutionary studies are zzso To understand the evolution of insect zzso channels and the mechanisms of zzso sensory zzso in insects, we have identified and compared zzso channel genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as part of zzso sequencing zzso 

All the insects examined have 2 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso and 1 zzso zzso members, demonstrating that these channels have the ancient origins in zzso The common pattern also suggests that the mechanisms for detecting mechanical and visual stimuli and maintaining zzso functions may be zzso well zzso in zzso However, a zzso channel, the most ancient zzso channel, is missing in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain 4 zzso zzso members, the other insects have 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain zzso channels, which have been specifically retained or gained in zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso which functions for zzso in zzso is missing in zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, they have other zzso zzso channels zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells is activated by temperature increase, demonstrating that zzso function as novel zzso sensors in zzso 

The total number of insect zzso family members is zzso approximately half that of zzso zzso family zzso As shown for zzso zzso channels, this may suggest that single zzso channels are responsible for zzso diverse sensory zzso to maintain the insect sensory zzso The above results demonstrate that there are both evolutionary conservation and changes in insect zzso zzso In particular, the evolutionary processes have been accelerated in the zzso zzso indicating divergence in the mechanisms that insects use to detect environmental zzso
