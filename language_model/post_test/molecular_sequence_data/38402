We have isolated a novel zzso gene in a screen for genes of which expression is not apparent zzso in rat zzso but is abundant zzso on day 14 zzso This zzso named zzso encodes a putative type I zzso protein containing five zzso repeats zzso a single zzso zzso domain, and a single zzso type III domain and is considered to be a new member of the zzso and zzso zzso No expression of zzso was found in rat zzso at zzso but it was detected at zzso and markedly increased with subsequent zzso These expression patterns of zzso appeared to be correlated with the development of the zzso outer zzso because in the adult rat zzso it was specifically localized in these zzso zzso zzso zzso was distributed zzso on the disk membrane in the zzso zzso On the basis of its structural features and zzso pattern, zzso may act as a zzso for a certain zzso factor or for an zzso zzso participating in zzso The human zzso of zzso was mapped to zzso zzso using zzso in zzso zzso
