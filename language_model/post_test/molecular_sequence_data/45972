A novel member of the zzso family, human zzso was identified by a differential screening approach of zzso and zzso tumor zzso The protein consists of 6 zzso repeats at its zzso zzso and shares about zzso identity with other zzso zzso zzso associates with both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso activity as well as the DNA binding of the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is localized in the nucleus where it zzso in zzso zzso bodies, indicating that zzso regulates nuclear zzso activity rather than its nuclear zzso from the zzso zzso expression itself was regulated by zzso suggesting that its activity is controlled in a negative feedback zzso Unlike classical zzso zzso zzso was not zzso upon cell zzso Treatment with tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso induced a strong induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected in different zzso including zzso liver, and in zzso but not in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference rendered cells more resistant to zzso whereas zzso of zzso was sufficient to induce cell zzso Our results, therefore, suggest that zzso functions as an additional regulator of zzso activity and, zzso provides another control level for the zzso of zzso target zzso
