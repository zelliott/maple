zzso acid zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso released an zzso zzso a zzso repeating unit, the corresponding zzso and a zzso zzso of the repeating zzso Complete and incomplete cores, and zzso zzso fragments of the repeating unit and the core region, were also zzso On the basis of sugar and zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso products, the repeating unit of the zzso zzso was shown to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso The linkage between the zzso zzso chain and the core region, which appeared to be of the zzso type, was zzso These results indicate that zzso acid, located in the zzso zzso is an inherent zzso zzso
