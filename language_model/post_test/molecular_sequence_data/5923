The complete zzso acid sequences of two zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso bodies of these two edible mushrooms have been established based on the sequence information of the peptides generated from the reduced and zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso using zzso zzso and other zzso as well as by several chemical zzso From the zzso it was found that zzso and zzso were zzso composed of 167 and zzso zzso acid zzso from which their molecular weights were calculated to be zzso and zzso in zzso with the observed zzso values of zzso and zzso respectively, as determined by zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso Two zzso bonds in zzso were found to link zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso An unusual zzso modification of zzso was zzso to be a partial attachment of a single zzso to zzso zzso of the sequences revealed that overall identity between the zzso was zzso Although a highly zzso sequence was not found in sequence data bases except for a consensus zzso zzso zzso both zzso somewhat resembled a family of zzso zzso as zzso These zzso together with zzso and zzso do not have zzso third and/or fourth zzso zzso acid zzso seen in zzso or zzso zzso proteins and belong to a novel zinc zzso zzso
