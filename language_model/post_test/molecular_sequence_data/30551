In zzso zzso of zzso acid has recently been demonstrated in a synthetic zzso based on the structure of the first zzso growth factor domain in human factor IX zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jacobs, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stern, zzso zzso and Friedman, zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86, zzso The putative zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a member of a class of zzso zzso which include zzso and zzso In the present study, we describe the zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso from bovine liver zzso and its zzso using zzso followed by zzso No additional zzso was required during zzso The partially zzso zzso preparation was found to contain no zzso or zzso zzso Using a synthetic zzso based on the structure of the zzso growth zzso region in human factor X as zzso the apparent zzso values for iron and zzso were 3 and 5 zzso zzso The zzso zzso the factor X zzso with the same zzso zzso zzso zzso and occurred only at the zzso corresponding to the position seen in zzso Furthermore, the extent to which either zzso zzso IX or zzso was zzso reflected the extent of zzso observed for both human plasma factors IX and zzso
