The zzso side chain of zzso present in zzso II is proposed to interact with the side chain of zzso 167 of the zzso zzso To determine the contribution of the analogous zzso in the zzso properties of the zzso we replaced the zzso with zzso and Ala, and analyzed the zzso zzso Our results suggest that replacing zzso with either zzso or Ala abolished the ability of the zzso zzso to bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso II and zzso II, as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that replacing the positively charged side chain of zzso with the zzso charged side chain of zzso in the fifth zzso did not alter the high affinity binding of zzso to the zzso zzso However, zzso properties of the zzso zzso suggest that positively charged side chain of zzso located in the junction of second zzso and the fourth zzso is critical for high affinity binding of all three zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
