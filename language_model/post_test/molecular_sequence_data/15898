A synthetic gene zzso human zzso zzso was designed such that the zzso usage bias resembled that found in highly expressed zzso coli zzso The percentage of preferred zzso was increased from zzso in the native zzso sequence to zzso in the synthetic zzso The zzso and synthetic zzso genes were placed under the control of the zzso promoter and expressed in zzso coli zzso While Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from each genetic construct demonstrated equivalent message zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed the synthetic gene to direct the synthesis of up to 16 times more zzso than the native zzso zzso
