The aim of this study was to establish an identification method for the zzso group within the zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso Using a primer pair based on the zzso sequences of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was amplified from each species in the group but no zzso products were obtained in other zzso Further identification in the species or subspecies level was possible by a multiplex zzso with zzso for the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso the zzso zzso genes both of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso In the case zzso zzso zzso zzso the amplified zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso while that from the zzso gene was zzso These results also indicate that two different zzso zzso genes are distributed among the zzso zzso
