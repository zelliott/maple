A zzso zzso changing zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene was reported to be associated with zzso diabetes zzso zzso A possible involvement of this zzso in impaired zzso tolerance was also suggested in a French zzso To replicate this finding we screened 311 unrelated zzso patients, 101 unrelated individuals with impaired zzso tolerance and zzso control subjects for the presence of the zzso zzso by use of zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso in a Finnish zzso None of the zzso or impaired zzso tolerant patients had this zzso Instead, four of the control subjects zzso were zzso carriers of the zzso zzso The age, body mass index, zzso blood zzso level, zzso insulin level, and incremental insulin are of the four subjects with this zzso were similar to those of the control subjects zzso for the wild zzso Taken together, the data do not support the suggested involvement of the zzso zzso in impaired zzso tolerance and the hypothesis of an association between zzso and the zzso zzso gene in this zzso
