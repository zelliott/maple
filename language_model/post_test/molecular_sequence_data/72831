The zzso who zzso zzso gene functions during the late stages of zzso muscle development when zzso migrate and attach to specific zzso zzso Animals lacking who function are capable of forming zzso zzso but these cells are restricted in zzso who zzso die at the end of zzso with the zzso end of their zzso arrested over the zzso zzso Animals that possess weak who zzso either die as zzso or survive as adults with defects in wing zzso These zzso indicate that who also functions during zzso when muscles are reorganized to support adult structures and zzso These embryonic and metamorphosis defects are similar to the zzso produced by previously identified genes that function in either muscle development or steroid signaling zzso who zzso occurs in muscle and muscle attachment site cells during both zzso and zzso and is zzso by the steroid zzso at the onset of zzso who encodes a protein that contains a zzso zzso binding zzso Animals that possess a zzso in a zzso loop that links predicted alpha and beta structures of this zzso binding motif lack who zzso These results indicate that who plays an essential role in steroid regulation of muscle zzso
