The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a surface zzso zzso that functions as a zzso zzso adhesive zzso It mediates several important zzso and zzso adhesive interactions among which the interaction with vascular zzso cells that lead to zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso for the rat complement zzso type 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso The zzso sequence showed respectively zzso and zzso zzso with its mouse and human zzso We have expressed the sequence coding for the VA module or Von zzso type domain zzso and produced it in zzso coli as a soluble zzso fusion protein with zzso zzso we have cloned DNA fragments specific to the rat zzso domain 1 and domain 3 and expressed each clone in zzso coli as zzso soluble zzso fusion proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso was released from the fusion protein by zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion peptides and zzso zzso were used to develop a direct binding zzso that showed a specific binding between the rat zzso zzso like domain 3 and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso can be produced as a soluble zzso fusion protein and used to study direct binding to the VA module displayed by members of the zzso zzso
