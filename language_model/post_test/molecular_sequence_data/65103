Experimental data and in zzso analyses of zzso bacterial zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso proteins and their respective target sites are surprisingly well zzso in very diverse zzso zzso regulation therefore constitutes an interesting model system from the study of evolutionary aspects of bacterial zzso Moreover, zzso zzso molecules are multifunctional, they repress the zzso zzso genes and are involved in the zzso of the various zzso zzso zzso Studies on the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have reinforced the uniform view of the bacterial zzso interaction, but have also revealed that the zzso zzso exhibits unique zzso Thus, its zzso activity is nearly zzso and exhibits poor sequence zzso zzso has a remarkable capacity to bind zzso zzso operators and zzso zzso
