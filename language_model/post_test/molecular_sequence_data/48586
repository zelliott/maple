Most bacteria of the zzso zzso are opportunistic zzso and some of them produce zzso zzso which may be important for zzso Genome analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso revealed the presence of seven genes zzso zzso zzso zzso although their functions, if any, are zzso In this study, we observed that zzso growth of zzso led to the zzso zzso of a putative zzso identified as being zzso by the zzso zzso When zzso in zzso zzso the protein was found to be a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that we named zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso reduced zzso activity of the zzso zzso strain, indicating that zzso is the major zzso ex zzso We determined that zzso is able to degrade the DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso trap zzso The zzso zzso was impaired for this function, implicating zzso in the zzso of zzso In zzso infection studies confirmed that zzso is required for full infection, as the zzso strain allowed increased bacterial clearance from lung tissue and decreased mortality in infected zzso These results show that zzso is involved in zzso escape and is needed for full zzso
