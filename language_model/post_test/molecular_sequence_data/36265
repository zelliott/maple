The primary structure of an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso 33 was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid in zzso ratios of zzso The main chain contained zzso zzso acid linked to the zzso at zzso in addition to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso of the side chain was linked to position 4 of the zzso In addition, the zzso was zzso corresponding to one zzso group per repeating zzso From the results two structural possibilities could be zzso As the zzso carries zzso groups zzso of zzso it is very likely that these are of general significance for the zzso activity of zzso It also seems to be possible that this zzso is at least partially responsible for the zzso cell surface properties of the zzso strain zzso 33 and it may be involved in zzso interactions when adhering to zzso zzso
