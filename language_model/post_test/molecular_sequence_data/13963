A gene zzso zzso an alkaline zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated by screening a zzso gene bank for expression of alkaline zzso activity in zzso coli zzso Two independent clones carrying the same zzso gene were zzso One of these clones zzso was further zzso and the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was zzso Two complete open reading frames zzso and zzso and an incomplete zzso were identified reading in the same zzso The deduced zzso gene product showed zzso identity to the alkaline zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso part of the putative zzso protein exhibited 57% identity to a protein of unknown function from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene failed, indicating an essential role for either the zzso or the zzso gene zzso zzso consists of 550 zzso acid zzso resulting in a molecular mass of zzso zzso To zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso coli, zzso zzso was transformed into a zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso In zzso coli strain zzso zzso was expressed zzso with high rates of activity, and was shown to be membrane associated in the zzso zzso After partial zzso of the zzso zzso it was shown that, like other alkaline zzso the zzso zzso had a broad pH optimum in the alkaline region and a broad zzso specificity for zzso required zzso for activity, and was inhibited by zzso In contrast to several other alkaline zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso Due to the lack of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, the function of zzso remains zzso However, the present results show that zzso zzso zzso has a second, probably zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso 145 zzso already zzso
