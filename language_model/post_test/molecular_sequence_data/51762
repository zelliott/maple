The zzso zzso zzso visual system presents as accessible a system for study of zzso zzso signal zzso as the zzso rod outer segment with the added advantage that the major zzso is a member of the zzso Here the zzso clone zzso the zzso of this zzso is reported, thereby completing the molecular cloning of the zzso zzso The deduced protein structure of zzso has relatively little sequence identity with known zzso counterparts particularly in comparison with the relatively high degree found for both the zzso and zzso of this zzso In particular, the zzso of the zzso visual zzso contains a zzso highly charged region, rich in zzso and zzso that has no parallel in other zzso The zzso acid sequence of a number of peptides derived by chemical zzso of zzso accounted for much of the protein sequence predicted from the zzso including the unusual zzso zzso
