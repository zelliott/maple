The ability to predict from zzso acid sequence how membrane protein structures will respond to zzso zzso would significantly facilitate experimental characterization of these zzso Here we have investigated and compared the response to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso of zzso and point zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins derived from the third and fourth TM segments of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso and the intervening zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate the secondary structures, zzso complex excluded volumes, and hairpin zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is found to be the dominant factor dictating membrane protein response to zzso zzso by zzso and zzso with hairpin secondary structure exquisitely sensitive to zzso when zzso is used for zzso zzso and zzso differ principally in their ability to promote approach of TM segment ends, although hairpin zzso remains sensitive to point zzso Our overall findings suggest that zzso and zzso interactions are determined zzso with the net zzso of zzso exposed to zzso dominating the observed properties of the zzso zzso
