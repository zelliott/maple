zzso B cells are responsive to zzso zzso signals transmitted through their surface zzso zzso Although zzso cells express surface Ak molecules with normal protein zzso the Ak molecules do not deliver zzso signal to these B zzso To determine whether introduction of a new A zzso into zzso cells would correct this zzso zzso cells were zzso with the genes zzso new zzso and/or zzso zzso It was found that zzso cells responded to zzso signals delivered via the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, the B cells did not respond to signals generated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of these sequences suggests that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important to the transmission of zzso signals to B zzso
