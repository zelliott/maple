A method for the simultaneous isolation of zzso DNA from as many as 96 zzso coli clones in less than 2 h is zzso It is based on a modified version of the alkaline zzso procedure originally described by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso The handling of DNA samples is facilitated by the use of zzso plates with membrane filter zzso All zzso steps are replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso The yield of zzso DNA from zzso zzso of an overnight culture is sufficient for restriction analysis of the zzso zzso Up to 400 zzso zzso sequences could be obtained in cycle sequencing reactions with an unmodified sequencing protocol on an automated zzso zzso
