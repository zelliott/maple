The critical chilling temperature of zzso zzso bean zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined to be zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso three fatty acid zzso were isolated from zzso bean zzso The zzso open reading frame zzso had zzso zzso and a single zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids that showing zzso zzso with the zzso zzso carrier protein zzso in zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and was zzso zzso a zzso of 352 zzso acids having zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso and seven zzso zzso a zzso of 371 zzso acids showing zzso zzso with the zzso omega-3 zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were expressed highly in leaves but poorly in roots and zzso while zzso was expressed in three zzso All three genes were significantly induced in leaves by zzso zzso and zzso in leaves were zzso by high temperature and zzso whereas zzso was zzso by the two zzso The expression patterns of the three genes in zzso bean leaves under zzso temperature, zzso were different from those under zzso The zzso of zzso transcript at chilling temperature might be an important factor contributing to chilling zzso for zzso bean zzso
