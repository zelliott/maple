zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the metabolism of zzso 30 commonly prescribed zzso zzso in zzso activity, inherited as an zzso zzso zzso was found to be significantly less common in American blacks zzso than whites zzso To determine the genetic basis for this difference, zzso zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso amplification and zzso analyses of zzso DNA from 126 unrelated whites and zzso unrelated zzso zzso had a twofold lower frequency zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso while complete deletion of the zzso gene zzso blacks, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion in zzso zzso zzso blacks, zzso zzso were not different between the two zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso was significantly lower in blacks zzso versus zzso of extensive zzso P zzso zzso consistent with the observed prevalence of the deficient trait in blacks and zzso We conclude that the same zzso zzso lead to a loss of functional expression in blacks and zzso but American blacks have a lower prevalence of the deficient trait due to a lower frequency of the zzso zzso This could explain racial differences in drug effects and disease zzso
