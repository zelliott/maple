The combined sequences zzso a partial and putative zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso region, a putative zzso for the zzso zzso to zzso protein zzso a putative zzso ORF, NC region and a partial and putative zzso ORF, were identified in 16 zzso zzso zzso using two novel zzso primer zzso zzso consensus sequence at the zzso and zzso regions were identified in all zzso zzso zzso as a zzso 

Thus, zzso zzso gene is highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso cells in zzso was also confirmed and the zzso initiation site was zzso A zzso zzso motif in the zzso regions of some bacterial zzso proteins was completely zzso amongst the putative zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso 

The putative zzso zzso zzso from all zzso zzso zzso were nine zzso acid larger than those from zzso zzso and showed zzso acid zzso 137 zzso of zzso zzso zzso instead of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity site demonstrated within zzso zzso zzso A neighbor joining tree constructed based on zzso zzso gene sequence information formed a major cluster consisting of zzso zzso zzso separating from the other three zzso zzso
