zzso zzso zzso are generally designed to inhibit zzso or DNA replication but can be used for more diverse zzso Here we have designed a zzso zzso able to activate zzso from a target zzso The designed hybrid zzso contains a zzso zzso linked through a zzso bond to several minimal zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso virus protein 16 zzso We show here that this zzso zzso zzso can specifically zzso its DNA target at zzso salt and pH zzso Bound to the zzso target DNA in a promoter region, the zzso is able to activate gene zzso Our results suggest that this type of zzso may prove useful in the design of new tools for artificial zzso of gene zzso
