zzso coli strain zzso is a zzso that exhibits zzso growth at 43 degrees C and zzso translation in zzso and in zzso zzso of the zzso produce an zzso pattern of translation products of zzso zzso zzso Previous work has shown that a zzso called zzso isolated from the parental strain partly zzso the defective translation in zzso Here we report the zzso to zzso of a second factor from zzso zzso of the zzso parental zzso the zzso protein is a zzso of 54 zzso The partial sequence of the second protein was determined, and a zzso zzso was isolated based on its ability to complement the zzso growth zzso of the zzso at the zzso zzso The cloned gene was zzso mapped to the zzso region of the zzso coli zzso and shown to code for a zzso protein with a molecular mass of 52 zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence and the correspondence to that of the partial protein sequence has identified the zzso factor as zzso zzso zzso rescue experiments indicate that the zzso zzso in zzso resides within the motif 2 domain of the zzso A potential role of this zzso in restoring normal protein synthesis with respect to zzso zzso zzso of nonsense zzso and protein copy number is zzso
