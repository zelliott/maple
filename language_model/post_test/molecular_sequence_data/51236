The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso product zzso has been determined in both its active, zzso and its zzso zzso zzso This has supplied a wealth of information on the mode of binding of zzso zzso on the mechanism of the zzso reaction and on the zzso change of the protein which accompanies zzso zzso The structural analysis has also given clues to the interaction of zzso with the regulatory proteins GAP zzso zzso zzso and zzso exchange zzso The three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso of zzso have also been determined and can nicely explain different zzso and biological zzso of these zzso zzso
