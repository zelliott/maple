The zzso sequence of an zzso DNA zzso from the zzso zzso part of the chicken zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso upstream and 6436 zzso downstream from a presumed zzso initiation zzso was zzso A zzso G + zzso region found in this sequence had also other features characterizing zzso islands, zzso no zzso zzso and lack of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis starts in two major regions of the zzso island, namely 98 to 108 and 143 to 145 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation zzso These two regions are in or close to the zzso zzso zzso element located in the middle part of the zzso zzso No alternative zzso of the zzso end of zzso zzso suggested earlier zzso was zzso The zzso promoter contains neither zzso nor zzso zzso structures at the usual zzso Instead, numerous potential zzso factor binding sites were found both upstream and downstream from the zzso initiation zzso Moreover, consensus zzso protein zzso sites were revealed in the promoter region and in sequences downstream from zzso
