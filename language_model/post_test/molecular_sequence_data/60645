zzso of zzso on mast cells results in the zzso of the zzso chain on zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study we sought to identify the site of zzso zzso in zzso and investigate its functional zzso We found that zzso 60 was zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso mast cells, resulted in a delay of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso production, and zzso of zzso but did not affect zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gamma chain was normal, but zzso zzso was dramatically reduced in these zzso This correlated with reduced zzso of zzso with zzso zzso of an zzso zzso for zzso 60 of the zzso zzso complete zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso We conclude that the negative charge provided by zzso of zzso 60 of the zzso is required for the appropriate interaction and zzso of zzso This is a likely requirement for zzso zzso zzso motifs involved in zzso zzso
