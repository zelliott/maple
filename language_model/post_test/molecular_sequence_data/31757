Here we show that zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein quality control mechanisms in the heart through zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso promoted zzso of zzso and zzso formation, accompanied by the disappearance of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso which enhanced the interaction between zzso and zzso and/or zzso stabilized the zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity of the zzso complex and suppressed zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso allows zzso to become active, thereby stimulating zzso zzso promoted cardiac dysfunction in mice subjected to zzso zzso by zzso zzso associated with increased levels of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in humans was associated with increased levels of zzso zzso and signs of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and consequently modulating a three-way interaction among zzso zzso zzso and zzso
