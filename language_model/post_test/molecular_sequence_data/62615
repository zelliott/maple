zzso are a prolific source of secondary zzso including compounds with toxic and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the end products of a secondary zzso zzso comprised of mixed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both peptides are potent natural toxins produced by zzso related zzso of zzso zzso gene transfer is thought to play a role in the sporadic distribution of zzso producers among zzso Our zzso analyses indicate a zzso of zzso genes and zzso zzso genes for the entire evolutionary history of the zzso Hence they do not corroborate horizontal transfer of genes for zzso zzso between the zzso The sporadic distribution of zzso zzso genes in modern zzso suggests that the ability to produce the toxin has been lost repeatedly in the more derived lineages of zzso The data we present here strongly suggest that the genes zzso zzso zzso are recently derived from those zzso zzso zzso
