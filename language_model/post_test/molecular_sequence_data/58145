Three zzso were prepared, each corresponding to the four zzso zzso acid zzso of highly zzso second-generation zzso zzso zzso The zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for each were determined by incorporating zzso distance zzso determined by zzso zzso experiments performed in water at neutral zzso into a series of distance zzso zzso model building zzso Similarly, systematic zzso analyses were performed for each using molecular mechanics zzso Both the zzso structures, as well as the calculated structures, are shown to adopt a zzso as the primary zzso Excellent agreement between the predicted structures and the zzso structures is zzso Aside from being the first examples of linear zzso reported to be ordered in zzso zzso the results presented support the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso must adopt zzso zzso zzso
