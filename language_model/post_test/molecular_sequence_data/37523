The zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso synthetic peptides were zzso in rabbits and mice using the peptides zzso to protein carriers in different zzso either through zzso zzso zzso or through zzso groups zzso zzso peptides were less potent in zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso and this type of zzso resulted in zzso to the zzso zzso However, the zzso present in either zzso or zzso peptides appeared to be similar, indicating that zzso acid zzso which form the zzso were located in the middle part of the zzso and did not include both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to a protein carrier did not play a role in stabilizing the zzso zzso but was necessary to concentrate the zzso zzso on the carrier surface enabling zzso zzso zzso
