zzso zzso is an zzso zzso which is exposed to high zzso of zzso oxygen and low levels of nutrients in its aquatic zzso zzso studies of zzso and zzso stresses in zzso zzso were undertaken through a study of zzso fusion and zzso zzso strains constructed from the cloned zzso end of zzso zzso a zzso The zzso gene was shown to be solely responsible for zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso Like the zzso of zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso is induced by hydrogen zzso and is important in sustaining the exponential growth zzso However, dramatic differences are seen in growth stage zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities are induced zzso to zzso during exponential growth and then approximately zzso in the stationary zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso activity is constant throughout exponential growth and is induced zzso in the stationary zzso Moreover, the survival of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced by more than 3 orders of magnitude after 24 h in stationary phase and more than 6 orders of magnitude after 48 zzso a zzso not seen for zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results indicate a major role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso survival and raise questions about whether the zzso activity as well as the protective zzso activity of the zzso zzso is important in the response to zzso zzso
