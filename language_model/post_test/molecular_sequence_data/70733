A novel zzso zzso zzso was identified in a zzso zzso individual from zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso by two zzso zzso one zzso the other zzso The resulting zzso acid difference at zzso 116 in the zzso zzso zzso binding site is likely to affect the nature of the peptides which bind to this zzso The finding of this novel zzso supports previous findings of increased diversity at zzso in zzso zzso
