zzso deficits in neural input activate pathological muscle zzso leading to zzso In zzso muscle, zzso of the zzso program requires zzso a potent zzso of the master muscle zzso factor zzso However, the signaling mechanism that connects zzso a protein zzso to the zzso machinery remains zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso factor as a critical target of zzso in zzso muscle zzso In zzso muscle, zzso activates zzso transcription, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the muscle zzso zzso We show that zzso activates zzso independently of its zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso stimulates zzso activity by zzso the zzso zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso binds and promotes the zzso and zzso of a key zzso zzso zzso Our findings establish an zzso signaling axis essential for zzso muscle zzso and uncover a direct zzso between zzso and zzso signaling zzso
