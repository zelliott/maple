The production of fatty acids is an important cellular zzso for both cellular function and the development of engineered pathways for the synthesis of advanced zzso Despite the zzso reaction chemistry of various fatty acid zzso systems, the individual zzso that catalyze these steps are quite diverse in their structural and zzso features and are important for controlling differences at the cellular zzso One of the key steps in the fatty acid zzso cycle is the zzso zzso zzso function that drives the equilibrium forward toward chain zzso In this work, we report the structural and zzso characterization of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which has been zzso for the engineering of synthetic zzso pathways with an order of magnitude increase in product zzso compared to those of pathways constructed with other zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso was determined to zzso zzso resolution and shows that the zzso zzso are distinct from members of the zzso zzso and zzso families but are highly similar to members of the zzso zzso Further zzso studies show that zzso uses an ordered zzso mechanism initiated by binding of the zzso zzso zzso which is consistent with the behavior of other zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding loop, characterization of zzso activity with respect to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and product zzso by zzso suggest that this region is important for controlling chain length zzso with the major portal playing a more important role for longer chain length zzso
