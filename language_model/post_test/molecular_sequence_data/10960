zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso Its activity was found in several zzso of bacteria such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in zzso or zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso from one strain, zzso zzso zzso The zzso appeared to consist of a single zzso chain with an apparent molecular mass of 51 zzso This zzso as well as zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso as a zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso zzso also requires a zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso for its zzso zzso The zzso completely lost its activity in the absence of either zzso or a zzso zzso A zzso zzso was also essential for the zzso stability of the zzso The zzso zzso tends to become zzso zzso resulting in the irreversible loss of its zzso zzso The zzso is strictly zzso for the zzso whereas it cannot distinguish between zzso and zzso forms at the zzso Thus, zzso and zzso act as zzso of the zzso but their kinetic parameters are zzso the zzso and zzso values are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toward zzso and zzso zzso and 102 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toward zzso zzso The zzso reaction is zzso and the zzso is therefore able to produce nearly zzso amounts of zzso and zzso through zzso bond formation between zzso and zzso The zzso also acts, in the same manner, on several other zzso zzso including zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso
