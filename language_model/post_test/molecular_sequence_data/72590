The zzso zzso domain of zzso coli zzso 54 was randomly zzso to provide a library of changes that might allow the required zzso function to be zzso Five clones zzso zzso zzso factors were obtained that exhibited this property in that they enhanced growth under zzso conditions in cells lacking zzso DNA sequence analysis located all zzso to four zzso in a small region between zzso acids 25 and zzso No zzso zzso factors retained the zzso character of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factors were shown to transcribe in zzso without the need for zzso binding zzso or zzso zzso confirming the in zzso zzso These and other data suggest that a very small set of zzso is critical for keeping zzso function in check, allowing high responsiveness to zzso induction via zzso proteins such as zzso
