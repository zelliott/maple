We investigated activity of bone zzso zzso to mediate attachment of cells to zzso using a model zzso zzso which contains a putative zzso site zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso has affinity to zzso with a zzso constant of zzso zzso The zzso affected in zzso zzso in a gel system, indicating interaction between this zzso and calcium zzso The zzso cell line zzso was incubated with zzso powder coated with the zzso or zzso zzso of the cells was observed on the powder coated with zzso but not on the powder coated with serum zzso The cells were attached to the powder coated with the zzso The cells were flattened on the powder, and zzso zzso The attachment of the cells was inhibited by an excessive amount of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso attachment of zzso cells to zzso and this activity could be accomplished only by the zzso sequence and the zzso zzso
