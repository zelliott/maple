zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene is the most common genetic zzso identified to date in human zzso zzso of zzso zzso found in human zzso with those induced in experimental systems have been interpreted as evidence supporting a zzso role for environmental zzso in certain tumor zzso We have developed and validated a method for generation of zzso zzso and measurement of zzso frequency directly on human zzso zzso in a zzso following treatment with zzso and replication in zzso zzso that had lost the DNA zzso zzso function of zzso were detected by zzso colony color, isolated, and zzso zzso light was used to characterize and validate the system, and a zzso increase in zzso frequency was seen following exposure of the zzso to increasing doses of zzso resulting in an zzso increase over the spontaneous frequency zzso zzso zzso at the highest level tested zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso in the zzso revealed that the types of zzso induced were similar to those obtained in previous studies of zzso zzso in other model systems, and the types and positions of zzso were also similar to those found in human skin zzso This experimental system will be useful in further evaluation of the importance of environmental agents as risk factors for zzso
