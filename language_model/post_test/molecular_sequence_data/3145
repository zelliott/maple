Although zzso diphtheria antitoxin may be an effective therapy for human diphtheria, its use often zzso serum zzso We describe here a strategy for developing an alternative treatment based on the human diphtheria toxin zzso zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso mature human zzso acts as a soluble zzso zzso binding zzso zzso and preventing its binding to the cellular zzso zzso zzso However, the possibility existed that zzso zzso complexes associate with cells due to the binding of the zzso domain of zzso zzso to cell surface zzso zzso zzso This possibility was confirmed by performing zzso binding studies in the presence of zzso A zzso truncated zzso zzso 106 to zzso which lacks most of the zzso domain, showed an essentially zzso binding of zzso zzso to zzso Furthermore, it was a more effective inhibitor of zzso binding than was zzso mature zzso Since mature zzso is a known zzso for the zzso zzso and is thus highly zzso zzso we then changed zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso truncated zzso and demonstrated that this zzso zzso analog zzso displayed a low zzso zzso The truncated zzso zzso protein retained high zzso binding zzso as confirmed by using surface zzso zzso Our results suggest that the truncated zzso zzso protein could be an effective, safe antidote for human zzso
