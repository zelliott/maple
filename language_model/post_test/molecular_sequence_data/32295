We have previously shown that cadmium, a metal that alters cellular zzso status, zzso zzso expression in nuclear factor zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso mice but not in the knockout zzso zzso In the present studies, the potential role of zzso in zzso regulation of zzso gene was investigated in mouse primary zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso induction of the zzso at zzso zzso and activity levels, with a substantial increase observed within 3 h of zzso zzso showed zzso nuclear zzso of zzso within 1 h of zzso zzso of mouse primary zzso with zzso zzso reporter plasmids and zzso expression zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso analysis of the promoter localized the zzso responsive region to an area from zzso to zzso base zzso zzso sequence analysis identified two putative stress response elements zzso within the region at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso showed that interaction of the more zzso zzso with zzso was zzso by zzso Finally, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso reporter plasmids abolished zzso zzso zzso the results indicate that zzso activates zzso zzso by directly binding to the zzso in the zzso region of the zzso This acknowledges zzso as the first phase I zzso gene identified under the control of the zzso zzso with a potential role in zzso response to cellular zzso
