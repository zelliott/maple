The zzso of numerous proteins during zzso growth of zzso zzso and the zzso development cycle induced upon zzso of these bacteria, are partially interrelated in so far as zzso impaired in zzso protein production are unable to undergo zzso We have cloned and zzso a gene in which a zzso zzso leads to a decrease in the production of most, if not all, zzso zzso and prevents development and zzso The deduced protein is zzso to the putative zzso zzso of bacterial and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first example of the presence of this complex in a zzso from zzso delta of the zzso This gene is expressed during growth and during early zzso As its disruption by zzso does not impair growth of the zzso strain, we assume the presence of a second alternative zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso caused by the zzso are due to a decrease in the zzso zzso
