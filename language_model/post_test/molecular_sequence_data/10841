The zzso fungus zzso zzso grows to form zzso either in rich media or in media with zzso as a carbon zzso A visual zzso called zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso growth zzso has been zzso The zzso screen was used to identify three zzso zzso genes that abolish zzso formation in all media zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene whose deletion prevents the zzso transition both in liquid and solid media, was zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso protein with a zzso zzso to that found in the chicken zzso zzso Analysis of the protein predicts a nuclear zzso These observations suggest that zzso may function as a zzso regulatory zzso In disrupted zzso zzso of zzso restored the capacity for zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso revealed the zzso transcript to be approximately zzso zzso zzso of this gene was detected when zzso zzso grew as a budding zzso but an increase in its expression was observed by 1 h after cells had been induced to form zzso The possible functions of zzso in zzso growth and the uses of the zzso screen to identify zzso regulatory genes from zzso organisms are zzso
