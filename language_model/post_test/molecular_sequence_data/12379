zzso the zzso regulator of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a member of a novel class of zzso zzso The zzso by which this class of proteins interacts with target DNA sites is not zzso To address this issue, we investigated the nature of the DNA sequences recognized by zzso A 36 zzso DNA zzso was identified that is capable of supporting zzso interaction in zzso The base pairs within this region of DNA that are critical to this interaction were identified by zzso zzso within the zzso that hinder normal zzso zzso The results obtained provide insights concerning the nature of the sequences recognized by zzso and also support a model in which zzso binding is involved in zzso zzso
