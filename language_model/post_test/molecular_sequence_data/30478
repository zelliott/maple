The restriction zzso zzso zzso is blocked by zzso within its recognition sequence at zzso This sensitivity to zzso can be used to enhance the specificity of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso will block zzso zzso zzso at overlapping zzso sites zzso zzso to zzso and increase the apparent zzso specificity of zzso about zzso This zzso procedure reduces the number of zzso fragments in the zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso as resolved by zzso field zzso Application of this method to large zzso in zzso requires the preparation of highly zzso DNA zzso
