A zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor was used to express this protein in zzso under control of the zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso with a yield of zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso and was found to be indistinguishable from the inhibitor isolated from zzso liver on the basis of the following criteria: the zzso acid zzso the number of free zzso groups, the molecular weight of the native and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso A simple method was developed for measuring accurately the slow, zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso From the dependence of the observed zzso constant on the zzso zzso it could be concluded that zzso was competitive with the zzso zzso The dependence of the observed association rate constant on the zzso concentration was consistent with a zzso mechanism in which the zzso only zzso in the second zzso zzso The values for the zzso constant for the zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso 67 zzso the association rate constant, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso rate constant, zzso zzso zzso zzso were in good agreement with those obtained for the zzso liver zzso zzso
