zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step of the universal zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso The recently characterized type III zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is distinct in zzso structure and zzso properties from both the zzso bacterial type I zzso zzso exemplified by the zzso coli zzso zzso and the predominantly zzso type II zzso zzso zzso zzso have an unusually high zzso for zzso are resistant to feedback zzso by zzso and are unable to zzso the zzso family of zzso zzso as alternative zzso thus making type III zzso ineffective in generating zzso zzso as zzso in zzso Previously, we reported the crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso and identified it as a member of the zzso and sugar zzso shock protein zzso zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structures of the same zzso in complex with one of its zzso zzso its product zzso as well as a zzso complex structure of zzso with zzso and zzso These results are combined with zzso zzso zzso experiments to present a detailed structural and zzso characterization of the interactions between zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso binding and zzso sites of zzso with that of zzso zzso revealed drastic differences in the binding modes for both zzso and zzso zzso and suggests that these differences may be exploited in the development of new zzso specifically targeting zzso
