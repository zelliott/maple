The sequence of an zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was determined following zzso amplification of zzso DNA from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this sequence with that of the zzso zzso from a zzso strain zzso revealed a zzso difference between the zzso This zzso led to the substitution of a zzso zzso for a zzso zzso within the third zzso cluster of the deduced zzso sequence of the zzso zzso This zzso which is associated with the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the transport of electrons from zzso to zzso zzso Confirmation that this zzso change led to enhanced resistance to zzso was obtained following zzso of the sensitive zzso zzso to the resistant form and expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
