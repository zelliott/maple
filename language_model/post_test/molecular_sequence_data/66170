The zzso zzso sexual zzso gene was isolated by using an expressed sequence tag zzso as a probe from a zzso library of the early sexual zzso stage zzso of zzso zzso The sequence analysis revealed that the zzso gene contains a zzso zzso and encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The zzso protein is zzso among zzso zzso and has a domain with similarity to a zzso binding domain zzso in the beta zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso gene was expressed during asexual development, the expression reached its maximum at zzso and decreased thereafter up to zzso after the end of the induction of sexual zzso In an zzso zzso under a zzso background, no sexual structures were formed at any condition zzso However, zzso zzso did not lead to an induction of sexual zzso In addition, to the effect of the zzso zzso on the sexual development, more zzso were formed in the zzso zzso than in a wild zzso These results indicate that the zzso gene is necessary for sexual structure formation but its zzso is not sufficient to enhance this zzso zzso of the zzso gene throughout development was positively regulated by the zzso zzso In addition, very little and no zzso transcript, respectively, was observed in an zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso and the zzso transcript level was higher in a zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso than in a wild type, indicating that zzso of zzso is necessary for positive regulation of zzso zzso
