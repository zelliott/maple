A gene zzso zzso a zzso protein with significant zzso to the zzso coli outer membrane zzso was identified upstream of an zzso zzso an zzso transport system in zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that this gene encodes an outer membrane zzso A in zzso zzso First, expression of the zzso gene product in a zzso zzso of zzso coli led to the restoration of zzso A zzso The zzso product also zzso to the outer zzso suggesting that it may be similarly located in zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso in zzso coli, followed by in zzso folding and zzso of zzso coli zzso resulted in pure protein which displayed zzso zzso and zzso A activities in zzso Finally, zzso of zzso coli in which the zzso gene had been zzso by zzso exchange were deficient in zzso A zzso zzso are associated with zzso of zzso by a number of bacterial zzso The zzso zzso was shown to have a reduced zzso activity compared to the zzso strain, suggesting a role for the zzso A in the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Since zzso are intimately associated with the zzso potential of a number of bacterial zzso it is likely that the zzso A plays some role in zzso zzso
