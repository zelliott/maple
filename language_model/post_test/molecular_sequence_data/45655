The zzso zzso is a multilayered structure zzso by the underlying zzso cells and mainly composed of small zzso which are zzso by a large gene zzso In previous work, we reported analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso expressed zzso of the zzso family essential for viability and zzso zzso We have generated a large set of zzso zzso of zzso zzso most of which we show here to be zzso to the zzso collagen genes zzso and zzso We analyzed the interaction among zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso which was employed in zzso zzso Our results support a role for zzso in zzso zzso processing and suggest that the zzso zzso zzso region serves multiple roles during zzso zzso Different zzso zzso of this region have diverse zzso consequences, including zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso and genetic data indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso most likely because the zzso are incorporated into the same zzso zzso We find that absence of zzso causes extensive zzso retention of zzso indicating that formation of the zzso zzso could begin in the zzso environment before zzso
