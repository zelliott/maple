zzso to zzso agents and predisposition to zzso are characteristic of the genetically zzso inherited bone zzso failure syndrome, zzso anemia zzso The protein zzso by the recently cloned zzso zzso group A zzso zzso has been expected to zzso in the nucleus as based on the presence of sequences zzso to a zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso and a zzso repeat zzso In contrast to this zzso we show here that a functionally active zzso fluorescent protein zzso hybrid resides in the zzso compartment of human kidney zzso zzso In accordance with this finding, disruption of the putative zzso by zzso zzso failed to affect both zzso zzso and the capacity to complement hypersensitivity to the zzso agent zzso C in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso part of zzso with the putative zzso at zzso acid position 18 to 35 showed no nuclear zzso activity when fused to zzso while the first 115 zzso zzso acids appeared to be indispensable for the zzso activity in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso studies of the putative zzso repeat showed that, even though this region of the protein is important for zzso activity, this activity does not depend on an intact zzso zzso zzso Finally, fusion of the zzso motif derived from the zzso large T zzso to zzso could not direct the hybrid protein into the nucleus of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is somehow maintained in the zzso via currently unknown zzso Thus, like the first identified zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to exert its function in the zzso compartment suggesting zzso proteins to be active in a yet to be zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso and protects against zzso zzso
