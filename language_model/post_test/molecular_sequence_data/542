In order to get zzso candidate zzso zzso method was employed to analyze sequences between two zzso markers zzso and zzso linked with zzso zzso open reading frame zzso sequences were found, zzso of which zzso protein zzso The zzso acid sequences zzso by these zzso sequences were blasted with the 24 cloned resistance gene zzso acid zzso and a zzso tree was zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso binding site zzso containing a lot of random zzso had both high identity and close relationship with zzso resistant to bacterial zzso and was predicted to be related with zzso The remaining thirteen zzso sequences had no enough evidence to show any relationships with zzso due to lack of zzso zzso low identity or distant zzso
