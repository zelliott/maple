The vault is a highly zzso zzso particle found in all higher zzso It has a zzso structure and is composed of the major vault protein zzso vault zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and small untranslated zzso zzso Although its strong conservation and high abundance indicate an important cellular role, the function of the vault is zzso In humans, vaults have been implicated in zzso resistance during zzso Recently, assembly of zzso vaults has been established in insect cells expressing only zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso with one or both of the other two vault proteins results in their zzso into regularly shaped zzso zzso assembled from zzso with zzso zzso tags of various length are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso image reconstruction methods were used to determine the structure of nine zzso vaults of various zzso as well as zzso and zzso mouse zzso zzso vaults with zzso zzso zzso tags showed internal density that varied in size with the length of the zzso Reconstruction of a zzso vault with a zzso tag revealed zzso zzso symmetry for the zzso A model is proposed for the organization of zzso within the vault with all of the zzso N zzso interacting zzso at the vault midsection and 48 copies of zzso forming each half zzso zzso difference mapping localized zzso to three density bands lining the inner surface of the zzso zzso maps designed to zzso zzso showed only weak density inside of the zzso suggesting that zzso may interact with zzso via a small interaction zzso In the absence of zzso structures for either zzso or zzso fold recognition methods were zzso A total of 21 repeats were predicted for the zzso zzso domain, suggesting an unusually large zzso zzso
