zzso peptides zzso are present in a wide range of zzso groups and played a crucial role in host adaptation to a diverse array of ever-changing zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is known to exhibit zzso activity against zzso and zzso bacteria in zzso Given their important role in zzso defense, a large proportion of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso are expected to be fixed by natural zzso zzso the complete coding zzso sequence data of zzso the present study revealed the pervasive role of positive zzso selection in the evolution and divergence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in two zzso distinct groups of closely related zzso in zzso zzso are shown to have evolved under positive zzso Interestingly, several of these positively selected sites are located at the zzso region, the region that directly interacts with the invading zzso zzso selection pressure could be the likely cause for such an accelerated rate of zzso acid zzso and could have contributed to the structural and functional diversification of zzso zzso in several zzso
