This article reports the cloning and characterization of the gene zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This gene plays the key role in controlling sex determination and dosage compensation in zzso zzso The zzso gene of the three species studied produces a single transcript zzso a single protein in both males and zzso zzso of the zzso proteins of these zzso insects with those of the zzso showed their two zzso zzso zzso to be highly zzso whereas significant variation was observed in both the zzso and zzso zzso The great majority of zzso changes in the zzso were zzso indicating that zzso selection is acting on zzso In both sexes of the three zzso insects, the zzso protein zzso with zzso regions dependent on zzso zzso II but not on zzso zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso does not appear to play a zzso role in the control of sex determination and dosage compensation in zzso Thus, in the zzso lineage that gave rise to the zzso evolution zzso for the zzso zzso modified it, and converted it into the key gene controlling sex determination and dosage zzso At the same time, however, certain properties of the recruited ancestral zzso gene were zzso and these are maintained in the evolved zzso zzso allowing it to exert its zzso and dose compensation functions in zzso
