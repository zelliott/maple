zzso zzso are zzso that zzso zzso to their corresponding zzso They play potentially important roles in controlling the zzso of zzso drugs targeted against viral infections or cancer zzso The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We describe the high resolution structures of the zzso zzso in complex with two potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso resolution and zzso zzso at zzso zzso The mixed competitive inhibitor zzso and the competitive inhibitor zzso both bind in the active site of zzso but in distinctly different binding zzso explaining their different zzso of zzso The zzso part of the zzso binds with very similar hydrogen bond interactions to the protein but with their zzso zzso in different binding sites compared with each other and to the previously determined position of zzso bound to zzso Together, these zzso binding sites describe what might constitute a functionally relevant zzso entrance tunnel to the active zzso The structures of the zzso in complex with zzso being the first such complexes of any zzso might provide important information for the design of more specific zzso to control the zzso of zzso zzso
