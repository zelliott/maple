zzso plaques are a zzso hallmark of Alzheimer's disease zzso but their relationship to zzso and zzso remains zzso In contrast, there is a good correlation in zzso between cognitive decline and loss of zzso zzso zzso terminals in specific brain zzso We used zzso transgenic mouse lines to compare the effects of different human zzso protein precursors zzso and their products on plaque formation and zzso zzso zzso Four distinct zzso were generated zzso zzso zzso or zzso carrying zzso that alter the production of zzso zzso zzso The zzso growth factor beta chain promoter was used to express these zzso in zzso zzso zzso associated with familial zzso zzso increased cerebral zzso levels, whereas an experimental zzso of the zzso zzso site zzso eliminated production of human zzso High levels of zzso resulted in zzso formation of zzso plaques in zzso zzso mice but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso Yet, significant decreases in the density of zzso zzso terminals were found in both groups of zzso Across mice from different transgenic lines, the density of zzso zzso terminals correlated zzso with zzso levels but not with zzso levels or plaque zzso We conclude that zzso is zzso even in the absence of plaques and that high levels of zzso are insufficient to induce plaque formation in mice expressing zzso zzso Our results support the emerging view that zzso zzso toxicity plays an important role in the development of synaptic deficits in zzso and related zzso
