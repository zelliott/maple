zzso zzso are a class of zzso zzso molecules which have significant gene regulation roles in zzso The advent of new zzso sequencing technologies has enabled the discovery of novel zzso Although there are two recent reports on zzso sequencing analysis of small zzso libraries from different zzso of two wine zzso zzso there was a significant divergence in the number and kinds of zzso zzso in these zzso More sequencing of small zzso libraries is still important for the discovery of novel zzso in zzso In this study, a total of 130 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to 28 zzso families were zzso other 80 zzso zzso including 72 novel potential and 8 known but zzso ones were zzso zzso zzso of these 80 zzso zzso exhibited differential zzso reverse zzso chain reaction expression profiles in various zzso zzso that could further confirm their existence in zzso among which 20 were expressed only in zzso zzso indicating a degree of zzso One hundred thirty target genes for 56 zzso zzso could be zzso The locations of these potential target genes on zzso zzso and their complementary levels with the corresponding zzso were also zzso These results point to a regulatory role of zzso in zzso berry development and response to various zzso
