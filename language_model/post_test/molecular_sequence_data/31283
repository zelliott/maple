zzso origins in zzso zzso have been identified through the cloning of autonomous replication sequence zzso elements that allow the zzso maintenance of zzso zzso zzso activity requires a close match to an 11 zzso consensus sequence and A + zzso zzso zzso zzso elements with a wide range of capacities for promoting zzso maintenance have been zzso We determined the zzso activity of plasmids with zzso consisting of repetitions of a 64 zzso zzso A + T sequence that has sequence similarities to known zzso zzso An insert with approximately four repeats did not yield zzso but zzso with either eight or zzso repeats zzso The cooperative production of zzso activity did not require a zzso arrangement since a zzso containing two zzso of four repeats each, separated by about 1 zzso was zzso Our results show that a change from zzso to function can be accomplished by the cumulative action of individually inactive zzso We conclude that the probability of replication initiation is too low with only four repeats to allow zzso zzso but the overall probability is increased by further sequence iteration to provide origin zzso We suggest that zzso may contain stretches with zzso weak origin zzso each zzso by the conventional zzso zzso that in sum provide origin zzso
