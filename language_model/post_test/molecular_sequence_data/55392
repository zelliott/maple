We report here the degradation of a zzso zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from soil samples collected from zzso contaminated field and an army firing range zzso Both the strains were cultured in the presence of zzso under zzso and zzso zzso Both strains grew well in the medium having zzso concentration up to zzso zzso phase zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso was able to degrade zzso of zzso (an analogue of zzso and zzso of zzso while strain zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso after 7 days of zzso The zzso zzso acid and zzso acid were identified by Gas zzso zzso The factors affecting zzso efficiency were investigated and effect of zzso concentration on degradation rate was also zzso The strain was analyzed for zzso activity and maximum activity 210 zzso zzso U zzso and zzso U zzso zzso zzso was observed for strains zzso and zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of putative zzso degrading zzso gene was done using zzso based zzso zzso
