We identified and characterized the primary structure of the Korean oily zzso zzso zzso fast skeletal zzso light chain 2 zzso zzso zzso by seven zzso spanning zzso zzso the deduced zzso acid zzso zzso contained an zzso zzso motif and showed strong zzso zzso with the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and other species, including zzso zzso zzso was highly enriched in skeletal muscles, and was zzso in other zzso The upstream regions of zzso included a zzso box, one copy of a putative zzso binding site and several putative zzso binding zzso The functional activity of the promoter region of zzso was examined using zzso and red fluorescent protein zzso The zzso zzso reporter expressions were detected and increased by the zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso The activity of the promoter of zzso was also confirmed in the developing zzso zzso Although the detailed mechanism underlying the expression of zzso remains unknown, these results suggest the zzso expression of zzso transcript and the functional zzso of zzso promoter by zzso
