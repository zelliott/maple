The zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso gene has been tentatively identified based on the presence of zzso zzso In the present study, we perform a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene using the total zzso isolated from zzso infected zzso at different zzso Northern zzso analysis with a zzso zzso zzso showed a major transcript of zzso zzso zzso revealed that the major zzso start point was located 20 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso In a zzso expression analysis using differential zzso zzso zzso transcript was detected at low levels at 6 zzso increased from 6 to 36 zzso and remained fairly constant zzso Analysis of the predicted DNA zzso sequence using zzso and protein zzso zzso indicated that the predicted zzso zzso contained five motifs associated with DNA zzso synthetic activities and three additional motifs associated with zzso possessing 3' to zzso zzso zzso The molecular zzso analysis of this gene supported the placement of zzso zzso zzso virus in a separate virus zzso
