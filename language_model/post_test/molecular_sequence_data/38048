zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso the zzso of both zzso and zzso as well as their zzso via zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the members of which catalyze reactions that are initiated by abstraction of the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of zzso with that of MR reveals a zzso zzso motif and a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso bases in the active site of zzso zzso of zzso have been obtained into which the zzso zzso and two competitive zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso zzso is converted to the zzso product, zzso zzso The structures of these complexes have been determined and reveal the identities of the zzso for the required zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as confirm the expected presence of zzso and zzso the zzso bases that are properly positioned to abstract the zzso from zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso group of zzso is a zzso zzso to the zzso with the resulting geometry of the bound zzso suggesting that zzso roles of zzso and zzso are reversed from the predictions made on the basis of the established zzso relationships for the zzso zzso The zzso roles of these zzso have been examined by characterization of zzso zzso although we were unable to use these to demonstrate the zzso independence of zzso and zzso as was possible for the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso
