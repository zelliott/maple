zzso zzso zzso a battery of highly effective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and is therefore considered as one of the most efficient raw zzso zzso zzso Previously, we have cloned and characterized zzso and zzso copies of the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed them in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report on the cloning and characterization of the zzso and zzso copies of a second zzso gene zzso from the same strain of zzso zzso zzso was cloned initially as a zzso zzso zzso zzso an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that this zzso encodes a protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed significant zzso to several bacterial zzso zzso and also to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso was expressed under the control of the zzso zzso gene promoter zzso in zzso zzso it was found that the zzso copy contained a 55 zzso zzso that impaired the production of biologically active zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso the expression of the zzso construct of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the production of biologically active zzso The zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso exhibited a high specificity towards zzso containing zzso zzso zzso The optimum pH of zzso was found to be zzso and the optimum temperature was 60 degrees zzso Besides zzso zzso is only the second zzso zzso gene ever cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso characterization and zzso of these two genes zzso these highly efficient zzso form an important part of an extensive research zzso aimed at the development of zzso strains of zzso zzso for the efficient zzso of starch into commercially important zzso
