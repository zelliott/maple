An artificial neural network system is used for pattern recognition in protein zzso contact zzso A zzso network was trained on a set of patterns which are popular in zzso contact maps of protein zzso Several neural network zzso and different training parameters were tested to decide on the best combination for the neural zzso The resulting network can distinguish between original (from protein zzso and zzso patterns with an accuracy of zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso for the testing zzso zzso of this system for protein structure evaluation and refinement are also zzso Examples include structures obtained after the application of molecular dynamics to crystal structures, structures obtained from X-ray zzso at various stages of zzso structures obtained from a de zzso folding zzso and deliberately zzso zzso
