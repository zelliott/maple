The zzso zzso zzso are a family of proteins responsible for the zzso transport of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso In zzso the seven zzso zzso zzso display a characteristic tissue distribution reflecting the zzso requirement and metabolism of zzso This report describes the isolation and sequencing of the full length zzso zzso zzso and the tissue distribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso base pairs and the coding zzso show zzso and zzso zzso with the human and mouse zzso sequences zzso In addition, a reverse zzso chain reaction strategy is described for the rapid isolation of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso This method has been used to isolate the corresponding zzso zzso
