zzso sequences of zzso 1 and 2 of a Japanese strain of zzso wheat mosaic virus zzso the type species of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso spot virus zzso were determined from cloned zzso The relationship among the Japanese and US strains of zzso zzso zzso golden stripe virus zzso and recently proposed Chinese wheat mosaic and European wheat mosaic viruses zzso and zzso were examined at the zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso comparisons of zzso proteins among the six viruses showed that the US strains of zzso and zzso were the most closely related pair in zzso 1 and the Japanese strains of zzso and zzso were most closely related in zzso zzso zzso was most zzso related to the other five zzso zzso analysis indicated that there may have been an ancient zzso between zzso 1 and 2 of the four zzso viruses and zzso while zzso was shown to have separated from the rest before the other five viruses zzso The fact that zzso and zzso have almost identical biological properties as well as the sequence similarities to the two strains of zzso suggests that they be regarded as strains of zzso considering that zzso consists of genetically zzso zzso zzso and zzso are distinct in biological properties in addition to genetic divergence in the zzso zzso
