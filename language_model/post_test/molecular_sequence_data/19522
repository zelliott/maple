zzso retrograde signaling coordinates nuclear gene expression with zzso function and is essential for the zzso zzso of zzso Three retrograde signals have been zzso but little is known of their signaling zzso We show here that zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso an zzso 2 zzso zzso factor, are common to all three zzso zzso binds the promoter of a zzso gene through a zzso motif found in close proximity to a zzso zzso We propose a model in which multiple indicators of zzso zzso function in zzso are integrated upstream of zzso within zzso which leads to zzso repression of zzso zzso
