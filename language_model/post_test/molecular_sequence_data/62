zzso are known to play essential roles in various biological processes including zzso However, it remains largely unknown which zzso structure takes part in each biological zzso Here, we examined the roles of the human natural zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We first cloned two zzso zzso zzso and zzso key zzso for zzso zzso zzso of these zzso affected zzso zzso In addition, zzso experiments revealed that zzso is zzso indispensable for head zzso and zzso depletion also led to markedly increased zzso However, even when the zzso was zzso abnormal head zzso caused by zzso depletion was still observed, indicating that zzso was not the main cause of the zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso depletion resulted in the abnormal formation of the nervous system but not in cell zzso These results suggest that tight regulation of zzso expression is essential for proper zzso of zzso zzso
