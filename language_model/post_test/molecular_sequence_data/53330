The zzso bovine zzso (formerly known as zzso comprises two zzso zzso and two zzso zzso found in blood zzso factors V and zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso in an zzso manner and also to zzso especially zzso zzso To define and characterize these zzso the interactions between zzso and different zzso cell types were zzso Using zzso forms of bovine zzso the human breast zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso were shown to bind specifically to zzso containing zzso but not to a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso cells to zzso Green monkey kidney zzso cells, also expressing the zzso together with the zzso zzso showed binding to bovine zzso via both zzso To investigate the interaction of zzso with zzso two fragments were expressed corresponding to the zzso zzso and the C2 zzso Both fragments bound to zzso zzso in a zzso manner with an affinity similar to native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso corresponding to the zzso part of the C2 domain inhibited the binding of zzso to zzso in a zzso manner, and finally it was shown that zzso mediates binding between artificial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together these results show that zzso can act as link between two surfaces by binding to zzso receptors through its zzso and to zzso through its zzso
