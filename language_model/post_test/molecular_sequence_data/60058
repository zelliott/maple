A zzso zzso moderate zzso strain zzso capable of reducing zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso vat prepared essentially as in medieval zzso zzso zzso formed zzso cells, which occurred zzso in pairs or in chains and produced terminal oval zzso zzso zzso was zzso Growth occurred at pH zzso zzso zzso with an optimum at 50 degrees C of pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso the temperature range for growth was zzso degrees C with the optimum at zzso degrees zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the zzso represents a zzso unknown zzso within zzso cluster I zzso Based on the results of the zzso analysis and zzso criteria, it is proposed that the unknown moderate zzso should be classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso a new species of the zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
