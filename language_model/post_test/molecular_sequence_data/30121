zzso zzso have a zzso zzso long zzso zzso rich zzso zzso at their molecular zzso Some of the unique features of zzso are probably attributable to a specialized structure formed by this zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is comprised of approximately two repeats of the sequence zzso Previous work has shown that the synthetic zzso zzso can form an unusual zzso zzso structure (the zzso zzso containing zzso base pairs and zzso We have tested the zzso of various zzso in this structure to zzso by zzso At zzso degrees C one zzso zzso is hypersensitive to zzso while others are particularly zzso By systematically substituting zzso zzso for zzso in zzso we identify zzso groups of zzso essential for formation of the zzso zzso We show that zzso molecules that cannot form the zzso structure nonetheless function as zzso for zzso repeat addition in zzso by the zzso lengthening zzso zzso The implications of these data are zzso
