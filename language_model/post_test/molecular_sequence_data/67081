The aim of this study was to improve the gene delivery efficacy of zzso zzso zzso by introducing a zzso branch that targets zzso zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso were zzso by a zzso with the zzso zzso at the free end, and the ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso various cell lines in zzso and lung tissue after in zzso administration to mice was zzso zzso zzso zzso showed improved cellular zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso for the zzso zzso compared with the linear zzso zzso zzso stability was also enhanced with the zzso form, which suggests that the zzso branch zzso the zzso by means of a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, gene expression levels in the human liver zzso zzso cells were zzso higher with the zzso zzso than those zzso by zzso A similar improvement was obtained in a human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso with the zzso was significantly inhibited (by zzso for all the cell lines tested, in the presence of the free zzso branch, confirming zzso zzso Finally, in zzso studies showed that, 24 h after lung administration to mice, zzso gene expression was zzso higher with the zzso than with the corresponding linear zzso zzso
