Although controversial, zzso are believed to zzso themselves in zzso through zzso interactions with the zzso zzso zzso The acquisition of host zzso by the zzso may mask its foreign status and/or interfere with zzso zzso We report experiments aimed at characterizing the interaction between zzso and zzso a zzso zzso previously reported to bind human zzso We show that certain zzso classes, in particular zzso zzso and zzso are not only able to bind zzso zzso but also associate with other zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso contains four zzso patches, two of which are known to interact with distinct zzso one in the zzso zzso region bound by protein G, zzso binding zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and one at the top of the zzso domain bound by zzso zzso and zzso We zzso discounted the involvement of these regions, since zzso binding by zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso respiratory zzso and protein G was unable to block zzso binding to zzso Given their apparent low zzso we zzso hydrogen bonding between zzso zzso in a zzso patch at the bottom of the zzso domain and zzso charged zzso or zzso zzso acids in zzso
