A zzso study was performed to better understand the differences between human zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso models were constructed from available crystal structures, and comparisons of the active site zzso zzso zzso and 129 for these two zzso provide insight into observed zzso zzso The zzso model provided a basis for understanding how some of the common zzso may affect the structure of this zzso zzso dynamics simulations of the human zzso models and the template structure zzso from zzso zzso were performed and showed the models to be stable and zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso in the models of zzso and zzso zzso the differences exhibited by these two proteins with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were only able to fit into the zzso active site, and an alternative binding site by the zzso loop was found using our models and will be zzso zzso mechanical calculations on the zzso reaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that the reaction coordinates differ for these two compounds, but the zzso barrier separating the zzso from the product are both zzso The results of this study suggest that common zzso in human zzso are distant from the active site and are more likely to destabilize the zzso than affect zzso Additionally, the quantum mechanical calculations show that the observed differences in zzso activity between zzso zzso and zzso zzso are not related to their zzso reaction with zzso
