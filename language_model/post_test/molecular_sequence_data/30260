A zzso zzso zzso clone for a beta 1 zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The longest open reading frame of the zzso zzso contains zzso sequence zzso a portion of the putative signal sequence followed by 449 zzso acids of the entire mature zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso differs from a recently described human beta 1 zzso by a single zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the human zzso zzso beta 1 zzso share zzso identity with the beta 1 zzso of the bovine and rat zzso zzso with the majority of the differences occurring in the zzso loop between the zzso and zzso zzso regions of the zzso A single zzso transcript is observed in Northern blots of zzso zzso isolated from rat brain zzso with zzso zzso In human brain, the zzso probe recognized the zzso message, in addition to two other bands between 8 and zzso zzso studies of rat brain zzso show that the message of the zzso beta 1 zzso is highest at birth, rapidly zzso and reaches adult levels of 5 to 7 days of zzso This is in contrast to the development of the alpha 1 zzso which is low from days 1 to 5 and increases to adult levels by days 14 to zzso Relative levels of the zzso for the alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso vary among rat brain zzso The levels of zzso for the alpha 1 zzso are similar in the cortex, zzso and zzso whereas zzso levels are twice those in the zzso The rank order of the relative amount of beta 1 zzso message is zzso greater than zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso These data, taken with our previous study of the alpha 1 zzso of the zzso zzso suggest that the differences in the distribution and regulation of the alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso may reflect a variety of zzso combinations forming the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso composition may provide a molecular basis for the diverse pharmacological properties associated with this zzso
