In this study, we carried out a large-scale zzso tagging screening to identify genes whose expression is regulated by ambient zzso Of 35,000 zzso two strains carrying the genes whose expression is strictly dependent on pH of growth medium were zzso One of the genes with zzso induction by zzso pH was identified as zzso gene in the zzso Genome zzso and its expression was the highest at alkaline pH and moderately induced by zzso zzso However, the gene was expressed neither at zzso pH nor by other stress zzso The zzso zzso with truncated zzso gene showed growth zzso and an abnormal zzso at alkaline zzso On the other hand, the zzso strain carrying the zzso zzso gene reverted to the zzso zzso To confirm that zzso is an zzso zzso a zzso zzso to zzso was zzso While a zzso protein band appeared on the Western zzso of cells grown at alkaline zzso zzso was barely zzso on the blots of cells grown in zzso Our results indicate that zzso cells have an efficient system adapting to large variations in ambient pH and zzso is one of the genes required for the growth at alkaline zzso
