The majority of zzso zinc zzso form zzso However, zzso zzso and their zzso form zzso in the early zzso zzso where they load zinc onto zzso zzso and maintain zzso zzso zzso The details of this zzso remain to be zzso and much more is known about zzso that occurs in other zzso family zzso Here, we addressed this issue using zzso experiments, zzso and zzso studies of zzso and zzso in chicken zzso cells deficient in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso combine to form zzso but do not form complexes larger than zzso zzso of zzso indicated that the sites present in zzso zzso II and V in which many zzso proteins have zzso zzso zzso acid zzso are not involved in zinc binding of zzso although they are required for zinc transport in other zzso family zzso We also found that the long zzso half of zzso is not necessary for its functional interaction with zzso whereas the zzso zzso tail of zzso is important in determining zzso as a partner zzso for zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso lacking the zzso half was zzso induced during periods of zzso zzso stress and so seemed to function to supply zinc to zzso zzso under these zzso The results outlined here provide new information about the mechanism of action through zzso of zzso proteins that function in the early zzso zzso
