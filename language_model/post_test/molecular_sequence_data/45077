Our previous studies showed that zzso of zzso c and a zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso In this study, we examined effects of zzso of zzso an zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso of zzso and basic peptides including zzso and its zzso peptides on zzso binding to isolated rat zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso binding to zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso basic zzso fragments of zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso plot analysis showed that zzso inhibited the binding of zzso in a competitive zzso By substituting zzso for zzso in zzso at positions 9 and 15, the zzso effect on zzso binding to zzso was reduced, which may be related to a decrease in the zzso content in the zzso zzso binding to zzso treated with zzso in which zzso completely disappeared, was significantly but not completely decreased compared with the native zzso In addition, treatment of zzso with zzso led to a decrease in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso These observations support that zzso zzso and basic peptides including zzso decrease zzso zzso of zzso by zzso its binding to zzso of zzso zzso cells, partly interacting with zzso In addition, the zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso effect of zzso on the binding of zzso to zzso
