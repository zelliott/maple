zzso a zzso zzso caps the zzso zzso end of the zzso filament regulating its zzso zzso therefore, is important for determining cell zzso cell movement, and muscle zzso For the first time we show that one zzso zzso simultaneously binds two zzso molecules in a cooperative zzso On the basis of the zzso solution structure and predicted secondary structure, we introduced a series of point zzso in regions important for zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso activity of these zzso was zzso by measuring zzso zzso using zzso zzso Using direct methods zzso zzso and native gel zzso for detecting zzso zzso we localized the second zzso site to zzso zzso Despite previous reports that the second binding site is for zzso zzso only, we found that both short zzso and long muscle zzso bind there as well, though with different zzso We propose a model for zzso capping where one zzso zzso can bind to two zzso molecules at the pointed zzso
