A preliminary analysis of the sequence alignment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in tribe zzso reveals that zzso evolutionary events zzso combined with zzso zzso have occurred in large zones in some of the studied zzso Due to the frequent occurrence and large size of zzso within this tribe, zzso length varies from 531 to zzso base pairs within the studied zzso This situation poses gap coding problems that we had to tackle before zzso zzso Four methods of gap coding were zzso elimination of gapped sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coding method, which translates zzso into new multistate characters in the data zzso After application of these four methods of data treatment, zzso analyses zzso zzso did not lead to very different zzso Three robust zzso emerged in each case, corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the American species of zzso The theoretical basis and biological significance of these four methods are discussed in order to apply the best ones in future zzso
