A novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from the stem of the zzso plant zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso Province, zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that the isolate zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso with the highest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of isolate zzso zzso to these two type strains were zzso zzso zzso and 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew at the pH range zzso temperature range zzso zzso and with zzso % zzso The zzso properties of strain zzso zzso differ from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso zzso acid and zzso was the major respiratory zzso The zzso cellular fatty acid of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso The total DNA zzso content was zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
