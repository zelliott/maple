The survival of motor zzso zzso zzso the product of the gene responsible for the motor zzso degenerative disease spinal muscular zzso zzso is part of a large zzso zzso The zzso complex is localized in both the zzso and the nucleus and contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a few not yet identified zzso The zzso complex plays a key role in the zzso of zzso small nuclear zzso zzso and other zzso zzso As a step toward the complete characterization of the components of the zzso complex, we generated stable cell lines that express zzso zzso or zzso under the control of a zzso zzso Native zzso complexes of identical protein composition to those isolated by zzso with zzso zzso were zzso by affinity zzso from extracts of both cell zzso Here we report the identification by mass zzso of a novel protein component of the zzso complex termed zzso zzso zzso and in zzso binding experiments demonstrate that zzso is a component of the zzso complex that zzso to gems and interacts with several zzso proteins of the zzso zzso
