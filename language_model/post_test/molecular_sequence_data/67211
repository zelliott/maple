zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso in zzso The zzso untranslated region zzso of several zzso genes was found to contain an upstream open reading frame zzso We generated transgenic zzso zzso that expressed a zzso gene constructed by fusing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be involved in declining levels of the zzso gene zzso and repression of downstream zzso gene translation in the zzso when the cells were treated with zzso Further, we discuss the role of the zzso
