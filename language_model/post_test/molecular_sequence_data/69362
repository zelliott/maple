The clinical and zzso relevance of circulating zzso to zzso C virus zzso in zzso patients is uncertain, since clinical signs of infection are often mild or zzso with zzso zzso zzso values that are virtually always normal, and liver zzso are only rarely zzso zzso of zzso zzso in serum is therefore critical for distinguishing chronic zzso infection from previous exposure to the zzso We studied zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in the zzso region of the viral zzso in 77 dialysis patients who were screened for zzso by a second-generation zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2nd generation, zzso zzso Systems zzso zzso and a second-generation zzso zzso zzso zzso Corporation and zzso zzso zzso and zzso evaluated for zzso zzso over a period of 5 zzso Of 77 patients tested, 29 zzso had active infection as shown by a positive zzso zzso result, and of these, 26 were zzso zzso Although a good correlation was found between circulating zzso and zzso zzso in serum, 10 zzso of 36 zzso patients were zzso zzso negative by zzso suggesting either low levels of zzso or past exposure to zzso and subsequent zzso On the other hand, 3 zzso of 41 zzso patients had zzso zzso in their zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso The zzso level had no zzso value for zzso infection, because it was repeatedly normal in 18 zzso of 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso was also performed and indicated that all four known zzso of zzso were present in our zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso are reliable for detecting exposure to zzso in zzso zzso however, direct identification of the viral zzso is required to document current zzso
