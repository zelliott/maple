The zzso resistance marker is widely used for zzso zzso gene deletion and has been used to create a zzso deletion zzso zzso Transfer of zzso marker zzso from collection zzso is a very efficient way of introducing zzso into other zzso strains of zzso An important limitation of this strategy is that the zzso marker is not easily removed, zzso the construction of multiple gene deletion zzso The zzso is a novel zzso cassette that zzso clean or zzso zzso zzso The zzso cassette efficiently replaces the zzso cassette due to shared promoter and zzso zzso The zzso cassette is removed by the induction of an internal zzso break and transformation with a DNA zzso designed to recombine on either side of the cassette in combination with counter zzso zzso and inexpensive media are used for induction and counter selection, zzso the use of expensive zzso zzso thirty percent of zzso successfully removed the zzso zzso The resulting zzso contain no trace of the zzso zzso The unique properties of the zzso cassette make it an important addition to zzso genetic tools, especially in combination with the zzso deletion zzso
