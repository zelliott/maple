The successful use of zzso methods for the solution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I required the careful consideration of a number of parameters and exhibited some unusual characteristics when compared with zzso solutions of zzso zzso zzso data were required zzso to several features, including the zzso shape of the zzso (which results in a zzso structure at low zzso the relative uniformity of the structure in the direction along the zzso axis and the small differences between the two independent molecules in the zzso zzso zzso Other parameters which were important for the solution of this relatively low zzso content closely packed cell included the radius of integration, the use of zzso structure factors and especially the choice of starting zzso
