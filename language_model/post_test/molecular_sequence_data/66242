We present a novel method for the isolation and analysis of the bone collagen zzso zzso chain zzso as a species zzso Conventional methods for the analysis and sequencing of zzso of proteins and peptides commonly involve using the zzso zzso to cleave proteins present in the zzso However, in the study of zzso these methods result in very complex zzso of peptides that are difficult to analyze and the acquired results are not zzso Here we use bacterial zzso (from zzso zzso for its ability to cleave the highly unusual zzso repeating sequence of zzso where zzso usually is Pro and zzso often is zzso Followed by a simple isolation step using a reverse phase solid phase extraction zzso the zzso zzso chain zzso can be readily analyzed by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso and the results can be used to distinguish between different species of zzso
