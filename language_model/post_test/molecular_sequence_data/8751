zzso growth zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso cells by altering the expression or function of various components of the cell cycle zzso zzso of one of these zzso zzso A, is inhibited by zzso zzso We have identified a zzso pair zzso of the human zzso A gene promoter that is sufficient to zzso zzso zzso Using this promoter fragment, we have developed a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso that zzso the growth zzso effect of zzso in transient zzso zzso This zzso was used to determine which zzso of the type I zzso and type II zzso receptors were required for the zzso effect of zzso In zzso the functionality of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso or zzso was tested for zzso effect on gene expression using a reporter zzso based on the zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso of zzso A expression was absent in zzso or zzso zzso cells and that this response was restored by expression of zzso type I or type II receptors in these zzso Furthermore, expression of a single zzso zzso either zzso or zzso did not zzso zzso A regulation by zzso However, expression of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in growth zzso similarly to zzso zzso In addition, zzso receptors as well as zzso receptors with a deleted zzso domain and zzso receptors inhibited zzso responsiveness in the zzso A reporter zzso in a dominant negative zzso Finally, in both zzso types, the zzso domain preceding the zzso domain was essential for zzso function but the zzso tail was zzso Our results suggest that a functional zzso zzso complex is required for zzso zzso of zzso A gene expression and illustrate the identical zzso requirements for zzso growth zzso and gene zzso
