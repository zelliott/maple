zzso inflammation is characterized by the tissue zzso and zzso of zzso rich in zzso During these responses, there is marked induction of specific zzso that are involved in regulating the recruitment and zzso of these inflammatory zzso A zzso of zzso (or zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso have emerged as zzso involved in the recruitment and zzso of the cells seen in allergic zzso We now show that these zzso are zzso related in zzso location, gene structure, primary protein zzso biological activity, and zzso zzso We also show that these zzso are zzso regulated in human and animal models of allergic disease and perform distinct roles in zzso We propose that this zzso of zzso plays a fundamental role in the development of allergic zzso
