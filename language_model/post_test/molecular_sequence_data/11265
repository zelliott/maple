The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso region between the zzso and the zzso zzso coding regions has been determined for tobacco zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso can be subdivided into several regions zzso two of which, upstream and downstream of the putative zzso initiation site zzso contain prominent zzso (A and zzso The unique sequence in the central part of the zzso zzso zzso preceding the zzso is extremely zzso The distance from the putative zzso to the zzso end of the zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso The zzso sequences are compared with potato zzso zzso and tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of 13 zzso species shows that considerable zzso repeat length zzso in this zzso is probably due to different numbers of A and C zzso
