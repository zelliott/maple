The cellular and zzso zzso of the zzso of protein zzso C zzso in the rat brain was demonstrated by zzso using specific zzso against zzso The zzso zzso was most abundant in the zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso islands, was moderate in the cerebral cortex, anterior zzso zzso zzso nucleus, lateral zzso zzso and zzso and low in the zzso and zzso The zzso was zzso in the zzso except for the zzso cells of zzso region of the zzso and the zzso was mainly present in zzso and nerve zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso was consistent with that obtained by in zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic observations of the zzso revealed that the zzso is predominantly present in the zzso of zzso and nerve terminals and that this zzso is associated with zzso membrane and zzso These results suggested that zzso is probably involved in zzso functions in zzso perhaps even neurotransmitter zzso
