The bacterial zzso zzso system zzso mediates the zzso and zzso of carbohydrates and is involved in signal zzso In response to the availability of carbohydrates it zzso zzso repression, intermediate zzso gene expression and zzso It is ubiquitous in bacteria but does not occur in animals and zzso zzso and zzso function make the zzso a target for new zzso zzso zzso I is the first component of the divergent protein zzso cascade of the zzso It transfers zzso groups from zzso to the general zzso carrier protein zzso Six zzso nine zzso and nine zzso peptides that inhibit zzso I were selected from zzso display zzso Of these, 16 were zzso and zzso The majority of the peptides contain a zzso with an adjacent zzso Two peptides were found to contain zzso but no zzso All peptides are rich in basic zzso and lack zzso zzso zzso The peptides inhibit the zzso system in zzso with zzso of between 10 zzso and 2 zzso zzso but not all, of the peptides inhibit cell growth in the zzso diffusion test by an as yet undefined zzso All peptides are zzso by zzso I, and some are zzso by slow zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
