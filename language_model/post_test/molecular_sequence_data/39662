The zzso pump establishes essential zzso concentration zzso across animal cell zzso zzso steroids, such as zzso are specific zzso of the zzso zzso We exploited the marine zzso zzso to probe both the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso pump and the site of its interaction with zzso zzso zzso the zzso gates, which normally open strictly zzso thus allowing both gates to sometimes be open, so transforming the pump into an zzso zzso zzso therefore permits zzso analysis of even a single zzso zzso We used zzso patch recording of zzso zzso zzso pumps, which were made zzso by point zzso after expressing them in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pumps were silenced by continuous exposure to zzso We found that zzso charge of two zzso at either end of the alpha zzso first zzso loop, known to make a major contribution to zzso zzso strongly influenced zzso of single zzso zzso by an zzso zzso The effects were zzso by modification of zzso introduced at those two positions with variously charged zzso zzso The consequences of these modifications demonstrate that both zzso lie in a wide zzso near the mouth of the zzso zzso zzso Bound zzso protects the site with the strongest influence on zzso from zzso zzso while leaving the site with the weaker influence zzso The results suggest a method for mapping the footprint of bound zzso steroid on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso
