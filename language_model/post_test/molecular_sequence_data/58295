The solution structure of the zzso electron transfer protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso The determination of the structure is obtained through zzso zzso on the fully zzso zzso zzso The richness of structural motifs and the presence of three prosthetic groups in a protein of 68 zzso is discussed in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso already characterized through zzso zzso In particular, the orientation of the three zzso present in zzso zzso is similar to that of three out of four zzso of zzso zzso The reduction zzso of the individual zzso which have been obtained through the zzso assignment of the zzso zzso are discussed with respect to the properties of the protein zzso This information is relevant for any attempt to understand the electron transfer zzso
