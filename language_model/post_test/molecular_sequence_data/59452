zzso possess their own zzso responsible for the synthesis of a small number of proteins zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the two zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso are products of zzso zzso and the remaining approximately 80 zzso proteins are zzso in the zzso The zzso translation system is zzso in zzso providing an excellent experimental model for the molecular genetic analysis of the fundamental properties of zzso in general as well as adaptations required for the specialized role of zzso in zzso Recent studies of the zzso zzso center, one of the most highly zzso functional centers of the zzso and the zzso zzso an unusual yet essential protein in the small zzso zzso have provided new insight into zzso and divergent features of the zzso zzso
