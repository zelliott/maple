Two zzso class I zzso sequences from the tree shrew zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated which are probably derived from classical class I zzso zzso of the zzso class I genes was investigated in several zzso in particular the brain, in which slightly different amounts of class I transcripts are zzso in different zzso Gene tree analysis performed with zzso and zzso and including class I sequences derived from other orders, indicated that the zzso sequences cluster differently from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but might be related to zzso class I zzso
