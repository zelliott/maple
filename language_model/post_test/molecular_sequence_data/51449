On the basis of the results reviewed here, there are two major mechanisms zzso zzso rejection zzso may zzso The first mechanism is zzso Point zzso occurring in a large variety of genes may produce new zzso zzso either by providing them with the ability to bind to zzso class I molecules or by providing them with a new zzso zzso zzso The second mechanism is the zzso of a gene that is silent in normal zzso and for which no strong natural tolerance has been zzso zzso candidates for the zzso mechanism are the zzso specific transplantation zzso observed on zzso induced zzso and zzso induced by ultraviolet zzso The diversity of these zzso appears to be very large, like that of the zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso have been obtained with high doses of zzso which are proven zzso On the other hand, a zzso zzso rejection zzso appears to arise through the zzso of a silent zzso and it may turn out that this is the rule for most zzso rejection zzso It is our hope that other genes coding for mouse and human zzso rejection zzso will soon be identified, so that it will become clear whether the zzso mechanism is the rule or the zzso In our view, this is a crucial zzso zzso as zzso rejection zzso result from zzso they may be highly specific for every individual zzso The zzso specific nature of these zzso would then be easily zzso However, active zzso of cancer patients would require that a zzso cell line be obtained from each patient, a most zzso zzso If, on the other hand, production of zzso rejection zzso results from the zzso of a normal zzso then there is a good probability that the same gene may be activated in many different zzso being perhaps zzso shared by zzso of the same zzso zzso This would probably not result in the expression of the same zzso in all these zzso because the patients would differ in their presenting zzso which are determined by their zzso zzso However, a subset of the zzso expressing the same zzso zzso gene should share the same class I restricting element, so that all of these patients could be zzso with a cell that would express the gene and carry the appropriate zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
