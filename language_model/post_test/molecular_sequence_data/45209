zzso zzso are carried by zzso of individuals and are the most frequent zzso II zzso zzso Because we have recently characterized the zzso specificity of zzso zzso we developed a zzso prediction method to identify zzso peptides in multiple zzso zzso T cell response plays a key role in the immune control of zzso infection, but few zzso T cell zzso with zzso specificity have been zzso They are mostly restricted to zzso zzso which are very zzso zzso We therefore looked for zzso zzso T cell zzso in the whole zzso of zzso zzso peptides were selected from the zzso zzso zzso based on the prediction of binding to zzso zzso They were submitted to zzso zzso zzso peptides bound to the zzso zzso whereas 15 peptides bound to zzso Six peptides bound very tightly to zzso and were investigated for their capacity to induce specific zzso T cell lines in zzso using zzso cells and zzso T cells collected from eight zzso zzso zzso Four peptides from zzso and reverse zzso proteins induced in zzso T cell lines restricted to zzso zzso zzso T cells recognized zzso other than the zzso sequence and were zzso by native zzso processed by immature zzso zzso The reverse zzso zzso is present in zzso of the isolated zzso zzso To our knowledge, we describe the first zzso zzso restricted to zzso zzso
