zzso zzso mice expressing human zzso and zzso prion protein zzso genes were zzso with brain extracts from humans with inherited or sporadic prion disease to investigate the mechanism by which zzso is transformed into zzso Although zzso mice expressed high levels of zzso they were resistant to human zzso They became susceptible to human zzso upon zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso In contrast, mice expressing low levels of the zzso zzso were susceptible to human zzso and registered only a modest decrease in incubation times upon zzso gene zzso These and other findings argue that a zzso zzso zzso designated protein X, zzso in prion zzso While the results demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso in a region zzso by zzso 96 to zzso they also suggest that zzso binds protein X through zzso near the zzso zzso X might function as a molecular zzso in the formation of zzso
