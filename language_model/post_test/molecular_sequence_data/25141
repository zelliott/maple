Fluorescence decrease in zzso solutions induced by zzso zzso is mainly due to zzso of zzso and in particular to alpha zzso which is zzso the main component of commercial zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso acid, diminished its intrinsic zzso considerably and abolished the decrease in zzso induced by zzso zzso The zzso zzso at position 199 in alpha zzso contributes approximately zzso to the overall effect, while the zzso at position zzso contributes about zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso lowered the initial zzso of the preparation, but, in the resulting fragment, zzso still diminished some of the residual zzso The zzso of decrease in zzso zzso with the distance from the zzso in position zzso at which the zzso bond is zzso This effect seems to be rather unique for the zzso but particularly for alpha zzso this is due to the existence of a zzso that is in the vicinity of zzso zzso acids and which upon zzso becomes exposed to a more zzso zzso
