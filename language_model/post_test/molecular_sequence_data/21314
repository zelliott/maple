Several transgenic zzso lines for liver development studies had been obtained in the first decade of this century, but not any transgenic zzso zzso lines that mark the through liver development and zzso were zzso In this study, we analyzed expression pattern of zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and revealed its expression in liver zzso and in the following liver zzso zzso we isolated zzso zzso promoter of 1763 zzso zzso zzso and developed an zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso And, maternal expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were observed in the transgenic zzso zzso Moreover, we traced onset expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso behavior of the expressed cells in early zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso male to the wild type zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is initially expressed around zzso beneath the zzso body at 10 zzso when the zzso develop to tail bud zzso In about zzso zzso at zzso zzso a typical zzso expression pattern is clearly observed in zzso around the zzso zzso Then, a green zzso dot begins to appear between the zzso and the zzso zzso adjacent to zzso zzso at about 20 zzso which is later demonstrated to be liver zzso that gives rise to zzso Furthermore, we investigated dynamic progression of liver zzso in the zzso zzso zzso because the zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed from zzso and liver zzso cells in liver zzso to zzso in the zzso and adult zzso Additionally, we observed similar zzso between the liver zzso cells and the zzso zzso on the zzso suggesting that they might originate from the same zzso cells in early zzso Overall, the current study provides a transgenic zzso line that marks the through liver zzso
