The zzso zzso is composed of several species that cause severe crop losses around the zzso In Latin America, one of the most relevant species is zzso zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for black rot in zzso zzso This pathogen causes yield losses in several cultures, including cabbage, cauliflower and zzso Although the complete structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso little is known about the protein expression of this pathogen in close interaction with the host zzso Recently, a method for in zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In the present study, this technique was employed for the characterization of the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in close interaction with the host plant zzso zzso The zzso was infiltrated into leaves of the susceptible zzso and later recovered for zzso zzso zzso cells were used for protein extraction and separated by two-dimensional zzso zzso were zzso by zzso mass zzso or de zzso sequencing and identified by searches in public zzso The approach used in this study may be extremely useful in further analyses in order to develop novel strategies to control this important plant zzso
