zzso head blight or zzso caused by zzso zzso is an important disease of wheat and zzso The pathogen not only causes severe yield losses but also contaminates infested grains with zzso In a previous study, we identified several zzso zzso by random zzso zzso One of these zzso was disrupted in the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso factor unique to zzso zzso The zzso zzso generated by gene replacement was significantly reduced in zzso zzso production and zzso on flowering wheat zzso It was defective in spreading from zzso zzso to the zzso and other zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the rice blast fungus also caused reductions in zzso and in invasive zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is defective in sexual zzso Although it had normal male zzso when zzso or zzso as the female in zzso the zzso zzso produced small, pigmented zzso that were sterile zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting a zzso role for zzso during zzso or zzso zzso Similar zzso defects in sexual reproduction were observed in the zzso zzso When zzso as the female, the zzso zzso failed to develop long zzso and zzso or zzso The zzso gene is well zzso in zzso zzso particularly in the zzso domain, which is essential for its zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the defects of the zzso zzso These results indicate that this zzso zzso factor is functionally zzso in these two zzso pathogens for plant infection and sexual zzso
