A zzso zzso human zzso zzso library was screened with zzso zzso probe zzso based on zzso acid sequence data generated from zzso zzso fragments and zzso fragments of zzso human zzso Six positive clones were identified after screening 2 zzso zzso zzso The sequences of these six clones were determined and found to be derived from two different zzso The sequence of the longest of these zzso is nearly identical to that recently determined by zzso et zzso zzso It codes for a zzso protein and all 11 peptides that were generated from the zzso zzso The second clone is shorter by zzso zzso in the central portion of the coding zzso Analysis by Northern zzso revealed the presence of a single zzso species of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso It is deduced from the zzso acid sequence data that zzso processing of the precursor form of zzso must occur by zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso perhaps around zzso acid zzso at a uniquely zzso zzso Using a probe generated from the 3' region of the zzso we have mapped the locus coding for human zzso to zzso zzso
