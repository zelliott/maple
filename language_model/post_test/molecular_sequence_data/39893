This is the first systematic study of zzso associated with zzso zzso The analyses of zzso and sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins and zzso of zzso characters grouped the 31 zzso strains isolated from zzso into eight putative species within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among these eight zzso species, five were unique to zzso and the remaining three were shared with zzso and zzso two zzso trees zzso with zzso in zzso These results indicated that zzso species zzso with a wide range of zzso species and had preference of zzso different from zzso and zzso The definition of four novel groups, zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso II and zzso zzso indicates that further studies with enlarged zzso population are necessary to better understand the diversity and to clarify the zzso relationships of zzso zzso
