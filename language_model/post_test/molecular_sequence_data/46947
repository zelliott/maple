Nuclear factor zzso zzso represents a family of zzso DNA binding zzso the zzso form of which is a zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso The biological activity of zzso is controlled through its zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso by physical interaction with an zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation triggers the release and subsequent nuclear zzso of zzso It remains unknown whether the zzso shuttling between the zzso and nucleus is subjected to additional steps of zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso exhibits strong zzso zzso activity even in the absence of zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso is largely zzso by a zzso sequence zzso to the recently characterized nuclear export signal zzso This putative zzso is both required and sufficient to mediate zzso zzso of zzso as well as that of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso distribution of zzso is sensitive to a nuclear export zzso zzso B, suggesting that zzso zzso continuous nuclear zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso prevents the zzso expression of zzso leading to the nuclear zzso of both zzso and zzso Together, these results suggest that the nuclear and zzso shuttling of zzso is regulated by both an intrinsic zzso sequence and the zzso zzso of zzso
