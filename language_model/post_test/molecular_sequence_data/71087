zzso in motif zzso and zzso of the human cardiac calcium channel were made using zzso zzso from the rat brain sodium channel zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso sites maintained normal zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Whole cell zzso clamp recording from zzso zzso showed a dramatically slowed zzso and a complete loss of zzso block for zzso in the zzso connecting link to zzso zzso and in zzso zzso segment zzso with both zzso and zzso However, the zzso block by zzso was retained by these two zzso For zzso zzso and zzso the residual current appeared associated with a loss of zzso dependence in the rate of zzso indicating a zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso recovered from zzso significantly faster after drug block than that of the wild type zzso Our data demonstrate that accelerated recovery of zzso and zzso decreased zzso of these channels in zzso during pulse trains and suggest a close link between zzso gating of the channel and zzso block by zzso and zzso and provide evidence of a role for the zzso and zzso regions of zzso in the zzso block by zzso and zzso
