zzso see zzso A series of zzso and their zzso zzso was prepared with use of a simplified zzso reduction zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared from the corresponding zzso by reaction with zzso in zzso zzso isolated in solid form, and characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was studied using zzso zzso to establish optimal solution conditions for zzso zzso Major zzso zzso were observed and identified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of reaction zzso The zzso were subsequently employed in zzso reduction reactions with zzso to yield zzso zzso which were separated by zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso gave pure zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso involving the labeled zzso carbon were measured and compared to those observed previously in zzso zzso In parallel studies, theoretical zzso were calculated in model zzso zzso using density functional theory zzso to predict the effect of OH vs zzso substitution at C2 on zzso and zzso values in zzso zzso The synthetic method was also modified to accommodate zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso and some zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso atoms in zzso were measured and zzso
