The zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso which are able to degrade the zzso zzso of plant cell walls, and uses the degradation products as a carbon source for zzso We characterized a major outer membrane zzso zzso whose synthesis is strongly induced in the presence of zzso zzso The corresponding gene was zzso Analysis of zzso zzso showed that the zzso expression is controlled by the general zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso zzso and by zzso repression via the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso is unable to grow on zzso longer than zzso and its zzso is zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso behaves like a zzso zzso that is slightly selective for zzso and that exhibits fast block in the presence of zzso In contrast to most zzso zzso seems to be zzso zzso has no zzso with currently known zzso but proteins similar to zzso are present in several zzso zzso these proteins might constitute a new family of zzso zzso
