Mobile group II zzso zzso proteins with both reverse zzso activity, which functions in zzso mobility, and zzso activity, which promotes zzso zzso by stabilizing the zzso active structure of the zzso zzso Previous studies with the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested a model in which the zzso protein binds first to a zzso binding site in zzso zzso zzso an idiosyncratic structure at the beginning of its own coding region, and then makes additional contacts with zzso zzso core regions to stabilize the active zzso zzso Here, we developed an zzso coli genetic zzso that links the zzso of the zzso zzso to the expression of green fluorescent protein and used it to study the in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and to delineate regions of the zzso required for zzso Our results show that the zzso functions most efficiently when expressed in zzso from the same transcript as the zzso zzso In agreement with previous in zzso zzso we find that the zzso binding site in zzso is required for efficient zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso but in the absence of zzso zzso residual zzso occurs by the direct binding of the zzso to the zzso zzso Critical regions of the zzso were identified by statistically analyzing ratios of zzso to silent zzso in functional zzso zzso isolated from a library generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso This analysis shows that both the reverse zzso domain and domain X, which likely zzso to the reverse zzso zzso are required for zzso zzso while the zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso are not zzso Within the reverse zzso domain, the most critical regions for zzso activity include parts of the fingers and palm that function in template and primer binding in zzso reverse zzso but the integrity of the reverse zzso active site is not zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicates that the N zzso of the reverse zzso domain is required for zzso binding of the zzso zzso possibly via direct interaction with zzso while parts of domain X interact with zzso regions of the zzso zzso Our results support the hypothesis that the zzso protein adapted to function in zzso by zzso at least in part, interactions used initially to recognize the zzso zzso as a template for reverse zzso
