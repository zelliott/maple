zzso of zzso zzso binding factor 2 zzso proteins to the nucleus depends on a zzso zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso By expression of green fluorescent protein zzso fusion proteins in zzso zzso we show that zzso contains an additional 13 zzso acids domain, located immediately upstream of the zzso which contributes to its nuclear zzso We also show that the zzso present in zzso proteins is required for efficient nuclear zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso In muscle cells, zzso zzso is largely zzso or, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso causes zzso to accumulate in the nucleus in association with zzso This effect strongly depends on zzso zzso it also requires the specific interaction of zzso with zzso since the isolated zzso is not sufficient for targeting zzso to the nucleus and other nuclear zzso such as zzso cannot substitute zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso different from zzso is mainly a zzso resident zzso requiring a zzso zzso for nuclear zzso The zzso implications of zzso carrying its own inhibitor to the nucleus are zzso
