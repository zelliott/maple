We describe zzso mapping on zzso zzso In this approach, specific sequence motifs in single DNA molecules are zzso labeled, and the DNA molecules are zzso stretched in thousands of silicon channels on a zzso zzso Fluorescence imaging allows the construction of maps of the physical distances between zzso of the sequence zzso We demonstrate the analysis, individually and as zzso of 95 bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones that cover the zzso human major zzso complex zzso We obtain accurate, zzso sequence motif maps hundreds of zzso in zzso resulting in a median coverage of zzso for the zzso The final sequence motif map assembly contains three zzso With an average distance of 9 zzso between labels, we detect 22 zzso zzso We also use the sequence motif maps to provide scaffolds for de zzso assembly of sequencing zzso zzso zzso mapping should facilitate de zzso assembly of sequencing reads from complex regions in zzso organisms, zzso and structural variation analysis and comparative zzso
