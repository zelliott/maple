zzso and differentiation are tightly controlled during neural zzso In the embryonic neural plate, primary zzso is driven by the zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of zzso a novel, zzso zzso protein that is required for normal primary zzso zzso is detected throughout the early nervous system, yet it is most strongly expressed in zzso zzso of the embryonic fish, zzso and mouse nervous zzso zzso expression can be induced by the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso while zzso zzso the differentiation of zzso zzso resulting in neural plate zzso zzso zzso blocks the ability of zzso zzso and zzso to drive zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both required for, and can zzso to promote differentiation of the primary zzso in zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso functions during primary zzso and is required for the zzso zzso to regulate neural zzso
