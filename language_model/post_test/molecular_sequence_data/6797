The lower zzso zzso widely considered the closest living zzso relative of the zzso is a key zzso for understanding the relationship between gene zzso and evolution of the complex zzso body zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso light chain genes zzso which code for proteins associated with the zzso head of the zzso heavy chain, constitute a large family with zzso zzso and zzso expression of different zzso thought to have arisen by zzso of a single ancestral zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only one zzso gene has been found, but the number of such genes in zzso zzso and lower zzso is zzso The present report, describing the sequence and expression throughout development of the zzso gene for zzso zzso light chain zzso thus fills a major gap in understanding the relation between gene zzso and increasing diversity of zzso zzso A full-length clone (1 zzso of zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso It coded for a zzso protein most closely related to the zzso embryonic form of zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed only one copy of zzso and suggested that it is the only zzso gene in zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that this gene produces only one transcript, which is expressed at all stages of development and in zzso In zzso zzso showed expression initially in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and soon thereafter in the zzso of zzso 1 and of newly forming zzso progressively added zzso zzso expression continues throughout zzso development and into the adult stage as the zzso cells differentiate into zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso muscle cells, those of zzso never become zzso In late larvae and adults zzso expression of zzso is localized along the zzso edge of the zzso and at the ends of the zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso zzso of zzso transcripts in muscle cells of any zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in smooth muscles as well as in zzso muscles not derived from the zzso These expression data are consistent with the Southern zzso analysis in suggesting that there is only one zzso gene in zzso Thus, zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso gene probably occurred after the zzso and zzso lineages zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
