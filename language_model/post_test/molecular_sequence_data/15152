The human zzso region is involved in growth and development, transient zzso diabetes zzso cancer, and zzso zzso To further characterize this region, the zzso status of DNA zzso and expression of zzso and zzso genes located within the mouse zzso region zzso of human zzso were zzso In mice, imprinted zzso and zzso were highly expressed at the end of fetal development but zzso at 4 and 11 weeks in brain, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was independent from promoter zzso of the expressed zzso suggesting the mediation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso island was zzso de zzso from zzso to 1 year with zzso zzso The high conservation in zzso of zzso zzso is suggestive of an important regulatory function in age-related regional zzso state and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in F1 mice zzso reflecting the influence of zzso factors on its zzso These data suggest the presence of a zzso domain and a coordinated gene expression pattern in multiple zzso zzso variation and zzso regulation of expression may zzso genetic diversity and contribute to disease zzso at the zzso locus in zzso
