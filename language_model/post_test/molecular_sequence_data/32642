The zzso DNA zzso by zzso 4 and 5, which consist of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso linked with an zzso zzso was investigated in the absence or presence of partner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso revealed that zzso 4 zzso DNA at the sequences zzso through hairpin formation, and zzso zzso through an extended binding zzso However, in the presence of partner zzso zzso 6, zzso 4 zzso DNA at a completely different zzso zzso zzso of 4 in the presence of 6 was effectively inhibited by a competitor zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso results indicated that zzso 4 does not bind to zzso whereas 6 binds tightly to this zzso The results suggest that zzso proceeds through zzso formation, indicating that this is a general way to expand the recognition sequence for DNA zzso by zzso zzso zzso
