zzso the very large number of zzso species of insects could be greatly accelerated by automated DNA based approaches, but procedures for large-scale species discovery from sequence data are currently zzso Here, we use zzso DNA variation to zzso species in a poorly known zzso radiation in the zzso zzso from arid zzso Among zzso individuals sampled from 65 sites and multiple zzso distinguishable types, sequence variation in three zzso genes zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly zzso between 46 or 47 putative species identified with quantitative methods of species recognition based on fixed unique zzso zzso The boundaries between groups were also recognizable from a striking increase in branching rate in zzso zzso zzso Models of zzso lineage growth zzso zzso were combined with zzso theory to develop a new likelihood method that determines the point of transition from zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso evolutionary zzso Fitting the location of the switches from zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso tree of zzso produced a transition in branching rate occurring at zzso zzso leading to an estimate of 48 putative species zzso zzso for the threshold ranging from 47 to 51 clusters within 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso in this way exhibited biological properties of traditionally defined species, showing zzso of geographic zzso broad zzso with zzso recognized species, and levels of sequence divergence typical for closely related species of zzso The finding of zzso evolutionary groupings that are readily apparent in patterns of sequence variation permits largely automated species zzso from DNA surveys of local communities as a scaffold for zzso in this poorly known insect zzso
