Changes in zzso structure during zzso were investigated using a zzso zzso that zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso which had been raised against rat zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso because of sequence zzso at the zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso was localized to the zzso of zzso as zzso zzso which lacked the zzso tail did not react with zzso and zzso zzso with a synthetic zzso made from the zzso sequence between zzso and zzso inhibited its binding to zzso and zzso In zzso sections of rat zzso the primary zzso and round zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso at steps zzso zzso intensely with zzso Increased zzso of zzso zzso was also observed in mouse and zzso by zzso However, zzso proteins extracted from separated rat zzso cells showed no increase in the zzso content of these late steps of zzso The apparent increase in the zzso zzso zzso to increased accessibility of the zzso in the zzso zzso This indicated that the zzso of zzso is less tightly bound to DNA or to other proteins at this time in preparation for the removal of zzso and other zzso
