zzso growing at elevated temperatures face the challenge of maintaining the integrity of their genetic zzso zzso possess unique zzso proteins for gene organization and information zzso We present the solution structure of zzso from zzso zzso which has a zzso zzso fold forming a swapped zzso zzso zzso The fold is reminiscent of the zzso zzso domain of zzso and zzso In addition, several zzso zzso in the zzso single quantum zzso zzso of zzso are shifted and broadened with the addition of small amounts of duplex DNA zzso The locations of the corresponding zzso in the zzso structure define its zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso with the protein further indicated that zzso interacts with DNA in the major zzso Taken together, a plausible model for the zzso complex is zzso in which the DNA double zzso is curved around the protein zzso
