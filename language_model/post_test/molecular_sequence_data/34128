zzso pole bodies zzso like nuclear pore complexes, are embedded in the nuclear envelope zzso at sites of fusion of the inner and outer nuclear zzso A network of interacting proteins is required to insert a zzso zzso precursor into the zzso A central player of this network is zzso that interacts with the zzso integral membrane protein zzso Here, we establish that zzso is a zzso membrane protein that is essential for zzso zzso at the inner face of the zzso In zzso and in zzso studies identified an zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a zzso element, with crucial functions in zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds to a nuclear zzso sequence next to this zzso zzso and prevents unspecific zzso of zzso to zzso After transport into the nucleus, zzso binds to the inner nuclear zzso These data define the targeting zzso of a zzso component and suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso is important for zzso zzso into the zzso from within the zzso
