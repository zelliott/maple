zzso of DNA double strand breaks by zzso end joining zzso requires zzso processing beyond simple zzso when the terminal bases are damaged or not fully zzso We transformed zzso with a series of zzso plasmids to examine the role of zzso zzso IV, DNA zzso zzso in repair at a variety of end zzso zzso of zzso did not impair DNA zzso zzso of fully compatible ends and led to at most a zzso reduction in the frequency of joins that require only DNA zzso In contrast, the frequency of joins that also required removal of a zzso or zzso mismatch was markedly reduced in zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In a zzso double strand break zzso zzso zzso zzso a marked increase in sensitivity to HO zzso in a zzso background, due primarily to loss of an zzso event that zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was dependent on its zzso zzso function, as well as its unique zzso zzso Paradoxically, in zzso analyses with zzso zzso demonstrated that although zzso fills gaps with displacement of mismatched but not matched zzso zzso it lacks both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is thus specifically recruited to perform zzso in an zzso zzso that must also involve as yet unidentified zzso
