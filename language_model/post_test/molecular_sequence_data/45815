We have zzso zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso from Aedes zzso cells and from Aedes aegypti zzso The zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a 260 zzso acid protein with a calculated mass of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso There was a single zzso acid difference between zzso proteins from zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso contained 260 zzso and the zzso gene was interrupted by a single 67 zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso A zzso comparison grouped known zzso zzso sequences into two zzso representing the zzso and the zzso zzso transcripts measured zzso zzso and were stable, as was zzso zzso zzso zzso was efficiently recognized by a commercially available mouse zzso zzso zzso which zzso 29 zzso and 35 zzso proteins from zzso cells representing different growth zzso These results support the feasibility of recovering zzso cell cycle zzso proteins by virtue of their interaction with zzso
