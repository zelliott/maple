zzso interference zzso is a recently developed technique for gene zzso by introducing zzso into cells, and it is shown to work in zzso cells when zzso are zzso Several groups have developed zzso zzso expression systems that can induce zzso in living zzso These zzso systems use a pol III promoter, such as zzso or zzso and are classified into two groups based on the form of expressed zzso zzso and zzso Here, we describe how to generate these zzso expression zzso and outline the experimental procedure for suppressing the expression of a reporter gene by transient zzso of a zzso expression zzso
