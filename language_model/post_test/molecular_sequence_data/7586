Previously, we constructed a zzso influenza virus that expresses the highly zzso zzso acid sequence zzso of zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso in mice by infection with this zzso virus showed zzso activity against zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso with this zzso virus are also able to induce a zzso immune response at the zzso zzso The zzso mice had zzso zzso A in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of these zzso zzso A were zzso for more than 1 year after zzso The results show that influenza virus can be used to efficiently induce zzso zzso against zzso from foreign zzso Since long-lasting zzso immunity in the zzso and zzso tracts might be essential for protective immunity against zzso influenza virus appears to be a promising zzso for zzso zzso
