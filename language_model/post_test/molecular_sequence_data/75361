The gene zzso zzso the major surface zzso of zzso zzso was isolated from zzso major using a synthetic zzso probe based on the zzso protein sequence of zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis and the translated zzso acid sequence indicate that zzso is zzso as precursor zzso having both an zzso zzso zzso zzso and an adjacent zzso This structure is consistent with the zzso activity of zzso since many other zzso are zzso as precursor forms requiring processing for zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that there are multiple copies of the zzso gene in the zzso of zzso major and other zzso zzso The conservation of the coding sequence of zzso amongst diverse species of zzso provides further support for the importance of zzso during the life cycle of zzso
