To clarify the involvement of the zzso gene in lung zzso we investigated the zzso status in the zzso upstream region of the zzso domain family 1, zzso A zzso gene in rat lung zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso male zzso rats were given 2000 zzso zzso in their drinking water for 12 zzso and maintained without further treatment until they were sacrificed at 25 zzso A total of 15 lung zzso were obtained and total zzso were extracted from each for assessment of expression of the zzso gene by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso To measure the zzso status of the zzso zzso five zzso with a marked reduction of the zzso expression and two normal lung zzso were used for a zzso sequencing zzso While the normal lung tissue was zzso all five zzso were highly zzso in the zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso were also extracted from 15 zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso was performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso were detected throughout zzso zzso The present results suggest that the zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of the zzso gene in the development of lung zzso induced by zzso in zzso
