Recently, the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso have been completely zzso Gross comparison indicated that the zzso of zzso is significantly bigger than the other strain and the difference is mainly contributed by the repetitive sequences including seven families of simple and complex zzso elements ranging from zzso to zzso zzso Analysis of these repeats resulted in the identification of a new distinct family of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso designated as zzso Using the concept of zzso zzso the zzso capabilities in zzso zzso zzso by the complete and partial connected zzso were zzso A comparison of the reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli essential genes and the genes predicted from the zzso zzso indicated that more than zzso of the zzso essential genes are preserved in zzso zzso Further examination of the highly and partly connected reactions by a novel zzso zzso tree, zzso network, and essential gene analysis indicated that some of the pathways zzso zzso and zzso zzso with partial connected reactions may be important for the zzso of intermediate zzso Taken together, in light of systems and network zzso the diversity among the zzso species was zzso on the variations of their limited zzso abilities during zzso
