zzso zzso is a zzso of 92 zzso acids which contains the extensively studied zzso zzso zzso and SS zzso at the C zzso Little is known about the zzso part of zzso In previous studies, using a zzso against zzso zzso zzso deduced from human zzso zzso we have identified a zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 8000 zzso in extracts of zzso and zzso zzso Using a variety of zzso procedures we have now isolated this zzso from extracts of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso The isolated peptides were zzso on an zzso zzso gas phase zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso for sequencing of zzso zzso The peptides had an zzso acid sequence identical to human zzso zzso In zzso from isolated zzso preparations of zzso small zzso and zzso we identified upon appropriate stimulation zzso zzso zzso peptides that by zzso high pressure liquid zzso appeared identical to zzso zzso An identical zzso was identified in pig zzso Thus, in zzso and gut zzso processing gives rise to the same zzso zzso zzso in spite of differential processing of the C zzso zzso zzso in zzso and SS zzso in zzso The eventual hormonal role of zzso zzso may now be zzso
