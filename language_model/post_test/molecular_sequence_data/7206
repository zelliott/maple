zzso that are destined for export out of the zzso of zzso coli cells are zzso as precursor proteins with zzso extensions or signal zzso which are essential for zzso of the protein across the inner zzso Signal sequences contain very little primary sequence zzso and therefore recognition of these sequences is thought to involve specific zzso To assess the zzso flexibility of signal zzso we have studied the signal zzso of zzso zzso by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and circular zzso in different membrane zzso zzso The secondary structure of the zzso signal zzso was analyzed via zzso nuclear zzso enhancement zzso chemical shifts of backbone zzso and by measuring zzso zzso zzso The membrane zzso environments studied were zzso zzso and zzso of sodium zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In all systems zzso formation was zzso In zzso the zzso stretches from the positively charged zzso to zzso In zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso half are separated from each other by a zzso at the zzso position, with the zzso content being higher at the zzso and lower at the zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso region has a less regular or more flexible structure compared to zzso The zzso of the zzso signal zzso into the zzso environment of the zzso was demonstrated by the effect of zzso zzso on the line zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
