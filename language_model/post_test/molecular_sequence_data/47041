To identify and to characterize functionally the zzso basis of zzso zzso syndromes zzso linked to zzso zzso 

A total of 37 patients belonging to 13 zzso families, 9 of them zzso were zzso All patients were linked previously to the zzso region of zzso zzso Two candidate genes in this region zzso zzso 2, a zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso 2 gene revealed no zzso The authors thus searched for zzso in the zzso gene of zzso 

zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso restriction analysis, zzso zzso and expression studies in human embryonic kidney cells were zzso 

The authors identified two previously characterized and five novel zzso gene zzso all zzso in the 13 zzso Two of the novel zzso are zzso zzso and zzso one is a zzso zzso in the signal zzso region zzso one is a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso and one is a zzso donor site zzso in zzso 10 zzso zzso family members have no zzso or are zzso zzso studies indicate that the four novel zzso in the coding region of the gene and the most likely transcript of the zzso zzso which skips zzso 10, are zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso syndromes are caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in this gene are a common cause of zzso in eastern Mediterranean zzso
