The interaction of zzso with various cell systems was studied using fluorescent derivatives of the zzso The native zzso form of zzso bound to cells at low levels and in a zzso zzso In contrast, both the truncated zzso zzso (the commercially available zzso and the zzso zzso protein bound to cells in enhanced levels and in a specific, zzso zzso This suggests that the binding of zzso or zzso of the terminal zzso of the native protein zzso causes zzso changes which lead to the exposure of sites which presumably interact with cell surface zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the majority of binding to cells appears to be dependent on zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso may exhibit such zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the protein is associated mainly with the cell zzso Moreover, zzso was demonstrated to compete with specific zzso zzso to the zzso site on the zzso zzso of activated zzso thus suggesting that zzso may facilitate binding to ubiquitous zzso zzso receptors via zzso zzso
