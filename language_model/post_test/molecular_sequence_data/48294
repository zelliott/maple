zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a vital role in neural zzso The zzso domain of zzso binds to various zzso which control the activity of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To understand the regulatory mechanism of zzso we carried out structural and zzso analyses of zzso zzso In the crystal structure analysis of a zzso form of zzso of zzso we unexpectedly found that the zzso zzso of D1 is oxidized to zzso zzso acid, while that of zzso remained in its reduced form, suggesting that D1 is more sensitive to zzso than zzso This finding contrasts previous observations on zzso The zzso zzso acid of D1 was further confirmed by zzso and mass zzso zzso The stabilization of the zzso zzso acid in the active site of zzso suggests that the formation of zzso zzso acid may function as a stable intermediate during the zzso of zzso
