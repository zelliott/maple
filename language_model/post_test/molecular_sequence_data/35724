The tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by many cell and tissue types and has been shown to inhibit most zzso zzso zzso In zzso and tissue invasion zzso the zzso or removal of zzso enhances zzso However, many of the cells that zzso zzso also zzso other zzso zzso By analysis of medium zzso by various zzso zzso and neural cells on zzso gels zzso zzso we have detected at least three other distinct zzso of zzso zzso Some or all of these zzso have been detected in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and human cells and are all smaller in apparent molecular size than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are not zzso degradation products of zzso nor do they represent zzso zzso The zzso do not zzso in the native or zzso state with any of several zzso zzso The zzso appear to be regulated independently of each other and of zzso In zzso the complex consisting of one of the zzso or zzso and a zzso can be zzso into functional inhibitor and zzso Whether this characteristic is significant in zzso is not zzso zzso has been zzso from several sources and shares sequence zzso with zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso may constitute a gene zzso The most significant characteristic of zzso is that it appears to zzso zzso on a zzso basis, the zzso 68,000 zzso rather than zzso or zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
