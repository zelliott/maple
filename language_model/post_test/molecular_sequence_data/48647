zzso is a toxic aromatic compound used or produced in many industries and as a result a common component of industrial zzso zzso containing waste zzso are frequently zzso and therefore require zzso zzso for efficient zzso without zzso In this study three zzso bacteria isolated from different saline environments and identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to be able to grow on zzso in zzso media containing zzso of total zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso well above the concentration found in most waste zzso Genes zzso the aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in all strains as determined by zzso amplification using zzso specific for highly zzso regions of the zzso The gene for zzso zzso was cloned from the isolated zzso zzso and the translated protein was evaluated by comparative protein sequence analysis with zzso zzso proteins from other zzso Although the analysis revealed a wide range of sequence divergence among the zzso zzso family, all of the zzso domain zzso acid structures identified for this zzso family are identical or conservatively zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
