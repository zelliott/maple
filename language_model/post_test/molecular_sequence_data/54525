zzso are critical for the processing of zzso for presentation through the major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso zzso protein is a component of several experimental zzso zzso zzso understanding the processing of zzso zzso protein and the resulting zzso repertoire is zzso zzso zzso from mature zzso cells zzso and activated zzso T cells from the same volunteer were used to cleave full-length zzso zzso and the resulting zzso fragments were identified by mass zzso zzso zzso degradation patterns and zzso fragments were unique to either mature DC or activated zzso T zzso Almost half of the peptides generated were cell type zzso Two additional differences were observed in the peptides identified from the two cell zzso These were in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These zzso have been linked to zzso disease zzso Our results suggest that the source of generation of precursor zzso class I zzso may be a critical factor for the induction of relevant zzso zzso T zzso
