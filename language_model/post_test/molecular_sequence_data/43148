zzso and dynamic aspects of zzso zzso zzso 5 beta 1 zzso were investigated by zzso zzso on freshly isolated mouse zzso zzso and after zzso in zzso This zzso has only been characterized zzso zzso of zzso was proved by binding of the zzso against the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and mouse zzso marker on the plasma membrane revealed that these zzso were rapidly zzso within the first minutes after zzso zzso zzso of these zzso was demonstrated by double zzso and secondary labeling with gold particles of different zzso zzso was found in zzso and zzso zzso but not in coated zzso During further zzso the zzso marker zzso again on the plasma membrane after 3 zzso but the zzso zzso was not zzso Treatment with zzso B in culture and incubation at 4 degrees C resulted in strongly labeled plasma membrane and zzso of zzso In contrast to zzso alpha 5 beta 1 zzso was zzso on zzso skin zzso even after 3 days in zzso In this cell type, zzso zzso was solely zzso in coated zzso These results suggest a high zzso activity of zzso after isolation leading to a rapid disappearance of both zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso only the zzso marker is recycled zzso These data indicate a change in plasma membrane zzso zzso after isolation and zzso of zzso and zzso differences in zzso
