Over half of the zzso cells in ocean surface waters are capable of carrying out a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that routes the sulfur zzso away from the zzso active gas zzso zzso In this study, we tracked changes in zzso the gene responsible for zzso zzso over the course of an induced zzso bloom in Gulf of Mexico seawater zzso Analysis of zzso zzso sequences indicated zzso different zzso sequence clusters at a conservative zzso criterion of zzso zzso sequence identity over the zzso zzso The representation of the major zzso of zzso several of which are linked to specific zzso through zzso of cultured marine zzso remained fairly zzso However, the representation of clusters within these major zzso shifted significantly in response to the zzso including two zzso clusters and a zzso zzso and the best correlate with shifts of the dominant zzso zzso was zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification and sequencing indicated the presence of zzso zzso zzso and marine zzso zzso all of which are known to harbor zzso zzso although the largest zzso change was an increase in zzso a group not yet demonstrated to have zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and other functional gene populations is becoming increasingly evident with the advent of zzso sequencing technologies, and understanding the ecological implications of this zzso is a major challenge for marine microbial zzso
