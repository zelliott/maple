zzso zzso the removal of zzso from zzso takes place within the zzso a zzso complex composed of five small nuclear zzso and a large number of associated zzso zzso assembly is modulated by the zzso and 3' zzso site consensus sequences situated at the ends of each zzso as well as by zzso and zzso zzso zzso recognized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso introducing a premature termination zzso zzso often result in the zzso of cellular quality control systems that reduce zzso levels or alter the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a commonly used genetic model for zzso muscular zzso zzso lacks zzso by virtue of a premature termination zzso zzso in zzso 23 that also severely reduces the level of zzso zzso However, the effect of the zzso on zzso zzso processing has not yet been zzso 

Using combinations of different zzso and cellular zzso we found that the zzso zzso partially zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is recognized by a 40 zzso zzso zzso In spite of the presence of an inefficient zzso 22 3' zzso site containing the rare zzso zzso the zzso zzso does not activate zzso altered zzso zzso but zzso exclusively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sites for zzso proteins were also identified in zzso 22 and 24, and in zzso experiments show that zzso proteins can mediate direct association between zzso 22, 23, and zzso 

Our findings highlight the complex zzso between zzso factors, zzso and the zzso surveillance machinery occurring during zzso zzso zzso Moreover, they suggest that zzso zzso interactions could play an important role in preventing zzso zzso 23 zzso as well as in zzso the pairing of committed zzso zzso
