zzso promotes assembly of zzso complexes, and is a target for regulation by zzso protein zzso C, and zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso is required to stabilize zzso lateral zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cells through interaction with zzso We use a zzso regulated zzso small interfering zzso zzso system to zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso of zzso after normal membrane zzso during zzso zzso depletion of zzso resulted in loss of zzso from the lateral zzso zzso zzso prevented loss of lateral zzso but only if zzso retained the zzso domain that mediates zzso zzso zzso versions of zzso with zzso zzso at protein zzso C zzso sites in the zzso domain were not active in zzso We find that zzso zzso long-range organization of the lateral membrane based on several zzso First, the lateral membrane of zzso cells exhibited reduced zzso increased zzso and expansion into the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso which normally is restricted in lateral mobility, rapidly zzso over distances up to 10 zzso We conclude that zzso acting through zzso provides a novel mechanism to regulate global properties of the lateral membrane of zzso zzso zzso
