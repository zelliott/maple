zzso A zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso providing precursors for a large variety of important plant secondary zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso have been believed to be specific to plants, a gene zzso a zzso zzso which shows more than zzso identity in zzso acid sequence to plant zzso was found in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced in zzso coli with a zzso tag at its zzso end, showed distinct zzso zzso The optimum pH and temperature of the reaction were pH zzso and 30 degrees C, zzso The zzso value for zzso and zzso were determined as 131 zzso 4 zzso M and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso value was comparable to those of plant zzso The zzso specificity of this zzso was, however, distinctly different from those of plant zzso The zzso efficiently converted zzso zzso 190 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a very poor zzso for plant zzso Furthermore, the zzso showed only low activity toward zzso and no activity toward zzso both of which are generally good zzso for plant zzso The zzso was therefore named zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the zzso acid zzso providing the unique zzso specificity of zzso eight zzso zzso zzso having a zzso at zzso acid zzso that probably line up along the zzso pocket were zzso zzso zzso used zzso as a zzso more efficiently than zzso and zzso zzso used zzso which zzso could not use as a zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activities of zzso and zzso toward zzso and zzso were greatly enhanced compared with those of the zzso zzso
