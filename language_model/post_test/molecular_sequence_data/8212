The zzso zzso protein is one of the zzso targets strongly associated with the zzso response in mothers whose children have manifestations of zzso zzso In addition to the zzso clone we previously reported for the full-length zzso zzso zzso an interesting zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to have an internal deletion of 231 zzso including the domain zzso the zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the nature of this zzso zzso DNA clones were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso The complete gene for the full-length zzso protein zzso form, 52 zzso spans 10 zzso of DNA and is composed of seven zzso zzso 1 contains only the zzso untranslated zzso while the translation initiation zzso is located 3 zzso downstream in zzso 2, which also encodes the three zinc finger zzso zzso 4 encodes zzso acids zzso including the coiled zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 is the longest and encodes the zzso domain and the 3' untranslated zzso The zzso zzso can now be accounted for as a product of alternative zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso of zzso 3 to zzso 5, skipping zzso 4, which results in a smaller protein zzso zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso An initial approach to identifying this alternatively spliced form in the human heart used a zzso protection zzso Using an zzso probe corresponding to bases zzso of the full-length zzso two protected zzso fragments were identified, a zzso zzso corresponding to expression of 52 alpha and a smaller zzso of 144 zzso the predicted size of 52 zzso Using reverse zzso followed by zzso chain reaction, zzso from a zzso fetal heart, zzso heart, and adult heart were amplified with zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso chain reaction products were observed in each zzso one zzso zzso likely representing 52 alpha and a second zzso zzso consistent with 52 zzso The zzso zzso identified in the zzso heart was zzso and DNA sequencing confirmed the 52 beta zzso zzso of in zzso zzso 52 beta form was performed to evaluate the zzso of this novel form of zzso zzso 26 zzso of 30 zzso tested from mothers whose children were known to have zzso lupus zzso the 52 beta zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
