We report the isolation and sequence of a zzso clone that encodes a locust zzso zzso nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The calculated molecular weight of the zzso zzso which contains in the proposed zzso domain two adjacent zzso zzso which are characteristic of alpha zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso of zzso zzso from this clone in zzso results in expression of functional zzso receptors in the zzso zzso In these, nicotine opens a zzso zzso the receptors are blocked by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso block of the expressed insect zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has also been zzso These data are entirely consistent with previously reported zzso studies on in zzso insect zzso receptors and also with zzso studies on an zzso affinity zzso locust zzso Thus, a functional zzso exhibiting the characteristic pharmacology of an in zzso insect zzso zzso can be expressed in zzso zzso by injection with a single zzso zzso
