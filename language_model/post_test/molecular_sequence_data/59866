zzso transport into the zzso zzso zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso prevents protein transport at the level of association of precursor proteins with the components of the transport machinery, zzso and zzso zzso The same zzso of zzso was observed after depleting a zzso zzso extract of zzso proteins by passage through zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso into zzso Transport was restored by zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso showed eight distinct bands in zzso zzso We identified five zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso one membrane protein zzso I) and two zzso proteins zzso and zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso was most efficiently retained on zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate transport zzso zzso analysis revealed a striking similarity of zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso which was recently shown to be involved in protein transport into zzso zzso We suggest that zzso mediates efficient zzso of zzso into the zzso membrane at the expense of zzso zzso
