zzso zzso gene sequences of three previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso All three were found to cluster within the zzso and related zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso formed an individual line of descent and was zzso placed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso both of which also form single lines of zzso zzso zzso was related to zzso zzso a member of cluster IX, with a similarity of zzso whereas zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a member of cluster zzso Based on the zzso data presented in this report and the zzso descriptions of these bacteria published zzso it is recommended that zzso zzso be transferred to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso be transferred to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso Though the transfer of zzso zzso to a new zzso is zzso this is not recommended until the zzso status of all the members of cluster zzso has been zzso
