zzso from zzso acid and zzso zzso were prepared by zzso with zzso zzso and separated according to their degree of zzso by zzso zzso These materials were successively analyzed by zzso zzso mass zzso with an zzso zzso zzso An zzso interface was used to produce zzso via the zzso evaporation process, producing mass zzso containing a series of molecular species carrying multiple zzso Using two adjacent multiply charged molecular zzso the exact molecular weights up to the zzso were calculated with a precision of zzso 1 zzso This type of mass zzso was also demonstrated to be feasible for the analysis of zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso acid or zzso zzso without zzso zzso mass zzso was thus shown to be zzso to the structural analysis of zzso from zzso
