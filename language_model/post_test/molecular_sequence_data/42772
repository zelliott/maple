zzso zzso is thought to play a central role in the zzso of heavy metals, and thus studies on its regulation are zzso zzso Heavy zzso induction of zzso genes is zzso by metal responsive elements zzso located upstream of the zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso is a zzso zzso protein that was originally detected in zzso cell nuclear extracts using the most zzso zzso of the human zzso gene zzso as a zzso We show that zzso in zzso cell nuclear extracts can also bind to the most potent zzso of the mouse zzso gene zzso This finding was further confirmed by using partially zzso zzso Moreover, cadmium could not promote complex formation between zzso and zzso at any concentration tested, as is also the case with zzso and zzso These observations suggest that the zzso regulatory system of zzso genes by zinc is zzso beyond zzso
