Point zzso in the tumor zzso gene zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found in many tumor zzso Because the function of the products of these naturally occurring zzso has not been fully zzso we investigated the functional activities of a wide range of naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso were characterized for their ability to bind and inhibit the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to induce cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso 

Among 16 zzso zzso nine had zzso functional zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso had defects in zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso The corresponding zzso are located in the third zzso repeat in a highly zzso region believed to form the zzso binding zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso had defects in zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso Among the 10 zzso with normal zzso binding and zzso activity, three zzso zzso zzso and zzso had defects only in their ability to induce cell cycle zzso Thus, zzso zzso proteins that retain zzso and zzso binding may have more subtle functional zzso All nine zzso leading to functional zzso mapped to the central portion of the zzso zzso zzso repeats II and III appear more critical to zzso function, and zzso in zzso repeats I and IV are less likely to disrupt zzso zzso
