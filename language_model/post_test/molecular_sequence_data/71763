zzso virus zzso is a newly discovered zzso DNA virus, which may cause zzso zzso The virus was detected in zzso of Japanese blood zzso The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence and clinical influence of zzso in bone zzso transplant zzso zzso zzso from 25 zzso recipients obtained 6 to 12 weeks after the transplant were examined for zzso by the zzso zzso chain zzso zzso samples were additionally analyzed in patients with zzso Fifteen of 25 recipients zzso were positive for zzso after zzso whereas it was detected in only two of 20 zzso donors zzso In patients positive for zzso before zzso the amount of zzso decreased to an zzso level during the zzso period after zzso We also found that there was a novel group of zzso zzso classified by the zzso zzso The median peak zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso range, 4 to 36 zzso in zzso and zzso recipients, zzso In one of the seven zzso patients who developed zzso injury zzso zzso 150 zzso a serial change in the serum zzso zzso showed a good correlation with the zzso zzso We concluded that zzso the prevalence of zzso is high in zzso recipients, zzso zzso might be zzso mainly in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso may cause persistent infection, zzso a novel genetic group of zzso zzso was discovered, and zzso zzso does not seem to frequently cause zzso injury, although one patient was strongly suggested to have zzso zzso
