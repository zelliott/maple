Members of the zzso zzso family are key regulatory molecules that link surface receptors to the organization of the zzso zzso It is now well established that these small zzso are also crucial for zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso in zzso (also known as zzso or zzso ), zzso a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, have been implicated in zzso mental zzso In an attempt to get insight into the biological function of zzso and the upstream signaling zzso leading to its zzso we used the full-length coding region of zzso as bait in zzso hybrid screens and identified zzso zzso or zzso as a novel binding zzso The interaction was confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso We showed by zzso that zzso and zzso zzso at the cell periphery to zzso and zzso in zzso and actively spreading cells zzso to zzso In addition, interaction of zzso to zzso zzso or zzso a close zzso of zzso was zzso In in zzso zzso two zzso zzso identified previously in patients with zzso zzso mental zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished interaction of zzso to zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was not affected by zzso zzso but did not occur with zzso zzso These data suggest that both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are necessary for the zzso zzso In contrast, it seems that only the zzso domain is required for the interaction and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is known to interact with zzso zzso zzso and is involved in the early stage of zzso interaction through zzso The identification of zzso as an zzso interacting partner together with the zzso of zzso and zzso in spreading cells suggest that zzso is involved in zzso signaling leading to zzso of the zzso zzso and/or zzso
