The main causes of microbial death after heat exposure are not well zzso Here, it is shown that the zzso protein zzso plays a major role in zzso growth arrest in zzso zzso A zzso lacking the zzso zzso was more sensitive to the zzso effects of heat, salt and zzso stress than the zzso zzso zzso During growth arrest, this zzso displayed important modifications of its total protein content, including a decreased level of essential zzso zzso such as the alcohol zzso Analysis of protein zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso plays a role in preventing accelerated protein zzso Higher levels of oxidized zzso a key zzso of the zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso and these were increased following heat zzso zzso of zzso zzso might explain why the zzso zzso was unable to properly zzso DNA and zzso and why it exhibited an zzso cell zzso Even though zzso plays a minor role in the zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso infection model, the data presented here point to the importance of zzso in zzso stress zzso in preventing zzso cell zzso
