We have reported previously on seven genes zzso of zzso zzso zzso 14, which are part of the type 14 zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso This study describes the cloning and sequencing of the remaining part of the zzso zzso The entire zzso gene cluster consists of 12 open reading genes zzso to zzso which appear to be arranged as a single zzso zzso The zzso regions of the zzso locus contain zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso repeated DNA element, which is also present in several other zzso regions on the zzso zzso has been identified upstream of zzso All 12 open reading frames zzso were zzso by the zzso of a zzso resistance zzso The zzso to zzso and zzso zzso were zzso whereas only a limited amount of zzso zzso was expressed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso with DNA and protein sequences available in databases allowed us to predict functions for four out of the five new zzso gene zzso The zzso function of zzso was determined zzso by analysis of zzso in the synthesis of the type 14 zzso zzso zzso by membrane preparations of zzso coli expressing zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes the zzso activity necessary for the addition of the third sugar in the synthesis of the type 14 repeating zzso The activity zzso by zzso was established using a synthetic zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso which requires zzso zzso as an zzso Thus, zzso is responsible for the addition of the last zzso sugar in the synthesis of the type 14 zzso
