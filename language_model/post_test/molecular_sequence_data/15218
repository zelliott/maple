zzso is a cosmopolitan zzso of zzso living in the zzso zone of freshwater and marine zzso Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related zzso strains from the Baltic zzso The zzso showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation zzso yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and zzso zzso These pigmentation zzso could not be differentiated on the basis of their zzso zzso transcribed zzso zzso zzso Thirty-nine zzso designated zzso possessed zzso zzso sequences almost identical with zzso strain zzso Despite their similar zzso zzso zzso the zzso strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the zzso zzso zzso This separation was largely consistent with the zzso composition of the different zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso strains clustered with zzso zzso the zzso zzso strains of zzso formed an as yet unidentified cluster within the zzso zzso zzso related to other zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso using zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso strains are probably endemic for the Baltic zzso zzso of the zzso obtained by the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences revealed possible events of horizontal gene transfer among different zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is important in zzso populations and that it can reflect extensive diversification of different pigmentation zzso into different ecological zzso
