To expand our knowledge of factors involved in zzso metabolism in the blood vessel wall, we have cloned unique molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso a truncated protein zzso lacking the first 80 zzso acid zzso of the previously characterized zzso zzso including the signal zzso A similar second clone zzso was identified that lacked not only the first 80 zzso zzso but also a zzso region that encodes a portion of the lid zzso zzso analysis confirmed expression of zzso zzso in several human zzso and cultured cells, including zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso studies using stable zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were localized in the zzso while, zzso was zzso into the culture zzso Cell extracts of zzso zzso did not have zzso or zzso zzso Thus zzso cells express three zzso zzso two of which remain zzso and do not function as zzso
