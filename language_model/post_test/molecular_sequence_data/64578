We show that zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso loop alter cardiac zzso zzso zzso channel activity in a zzso zzso zzso The peptides were zzso zzso of the cardiac zzso zzso AS zzso of the skeletal zzso zzso and a modified AS zzso zzso with an extended zzso zzso The peptides added to the zzso side of channels in zzso zzso at zzso or zzso 10 zzso activated channels when the zzso zzso was 100 zzso but either inhibited or did not affect channel activity when the zzso zzso was 10 or 100 zzso Both zzso and zzso were independent of zzso zzso zzso by zzso but not by zzso or zzso was reduced at zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner (at zzso zzso In control experiments, channels were not activated by the scrambled AS sequence zzso or skeletal zzso loop zzso zzso zzso zzso release from cardiac zzso zzso was not altered by zzso zzso but zzso zzso release was zzso zzso and zzso zzso release were enhanced by both the native and modified AS zzso zzso revealed zzso that the structure of zzso zzso is not influenced by zzso and zzso that zzso zzso adopts a zzso structure, particularly in the region containing positively charged zzso This is the first report of specific functional interactions between zzso zzso A region peptides and cardiac zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso
