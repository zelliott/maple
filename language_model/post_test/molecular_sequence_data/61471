Type I zzso zzso exerts its zzso effects mainly through the zzso signaling pathway, which is presently best described in zzso By zzso suppression zzso two fish signaling factors, zzso and zzso had been identified in the zzso zzso carp zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso cells after treatment with zzso grass carp zzso virus zzso Further, the full-length zzso of zzso termed zzso was zzso It contains zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso is most similar to rat zzso with 59% identity overall and displays all highly zzso zzso that the zzso family zzso Like human zzso it lacks the zzso acting as zzso zzso domain in zzso By contrast, only a single transcript was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso could be activated by stimulation of zzso cells with zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and displayed diverse expression patterns similar to that of zzso zzso Additionally, the expression of an zzso gene zzso was also induced under the same conditions, and expression difference between zzso and zzso was revealed by induction of zzso zzso These results provide molecular evidence supporting the notion that the fish zzso signaling zzso zzso is similar to that in zzso Fish zzso exerts its multiple functions, at least zzso action, through a zzso zzso
