Here we report on the use of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso electric tissue in order to define zzso portions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso using the zzso agent zzso The zzso zzso were separated by zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso with zzso The resulting peptides were separated by zzso zzso and the radioactive peptides were identified by mass zzso and protein zzso For the zzso we identified five zzso peptides containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The surface zzso of these zzso acids is in agreement with the zzso model zzso zzso of the zzso but the assignment to the zzso or zzso surface is zzso According to this model, the zzso portion of the zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso and zzso as a site of zzso zzso is located on the zzso zzso But since this latter zzso is among the first to be zzso using an immobilized zzso agent, its true position with respect to the membrane zzso is not zzso
