Tibetan zzso zzso zzso survived with high zzso zzso and zzso White zzso zzso zzso from low zzso survived rarely and with a low zzso zzso after simulated incubation under zzso of zzso zzso The functional zzso of zzso of zzso zzso chain was related with zzso based on zzso distribution, zzso model building and oxygen affinity zzso Whole zzso on days zzso and whole blood on days zzso were collected to investigate the stage expression profiles of all seven zzso and zzso by real-time zzso Under zzso zzso zzso on days zzso zzso was zzso zzso was expressed earlier and zzso expression was zzso which completely overturned the expression profile under zzso The amount of zzso expression in Tibetan zzso was remarkably higher than that of zzso zzso expression peaked early in both breeds, zzso In conclusion, the special hypoxic expression profile on days zzso certainly is a common molecular mechanism of zzso tolerance in surviving Tibetan chick and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and increasing zzso are important mechanisms of zzso adaptation in Tibetan chick zzso and we suggest that zzso could be responsible for the hypoxic expression zzso
