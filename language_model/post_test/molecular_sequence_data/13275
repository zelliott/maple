It is well demonstrated that various peptides derived from zzso are biologically zzso The zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso peptides were demonstrated to be zzso for zzso while zzso had marked biological effects on human zzso The aim of our present work was to zzso various zzso peptides and compare their action to that of zzso and this zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso and the two other zzso zzso zzso III and zzso zzso had very similar and specific effects on zzso free calcium zzso on zzso zzso production and zzso zzso The other peptides had no effects on these zzso except a zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the effect of the zzso zzso and zzso could be abolished by zzso toxin zzso All peptides had very similar stimulating effects on zzso production and zzso zzso We conclude that most probably the zzso size and zzso as well as zzso composition play a role in the biological effects of these zzso through specific receptors on zzso zzso
