zzso oceanic islands are excellent natural laboratories to test the relative role of historical contingency and determinism in evolutionary zzso zzso of the marine zzso snail zzso in the Cape zzso zzso were originated from at least two independent colonizations of zzso and zzso zzso species separated by 12 million zzso In this study, we have reconstructed zzso relationships within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The reconstructed molecular zzso revealed three zzso and relatively divergent zzso zzso B, and zzso that do not zzso to current species zzso based on shell zzso and zzso zzso zzso A grouped specimens assigned either to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso B is composed of specimens assigned to zzso zzso and zzso C comprises specimens assigned either to zzso zzso or zzso zzso Geometric zzso analyses found significant differences between the zzso teeth shape of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso A and B, northwestern zzso and zzso specimens cluster together to the exclusion of eastern zzso zzso In zzso populations form a zzso island zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso have remarkably zzso zzso patterns of diversification of zzso zzso Similar selective forces zzso zzso zzso with limited zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with repeated instances of low sea level stands during glacial zzso that allowed connection between islands, have overcome the effect of historical zzso and explain the observed recurring zzso zzso
