We previously showed that the zzso zzso gene regulates the zzso of leaves of zzso zzso by controlling the polar zzso of leaf zzso In the present study, we found that the abnormal arrangement of cortical zzso zzso in an leaf cells appeared to account entirely for the abnormal shape of the zzso It suggested that the AN gene might regulate the polarity of cell growth by controlling the arrangement of cortical zzso We cloned the AN gene using a zzso strategy and identified it as the first member of the zzso family to be found in zzso zzso AN zzso reversed the zzso zzso and the abnormal arrangement of cortical zzso of the zzso zzso In the animal kingdom, zzso zzso and act as zzso of zzso The AN protein can also zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis suggested that the AN gene might regulate the expression of certain zzso zzso the gene involved in formation of cell walls, zzso A discussion of the molecular mechanisms involved in the leaf shape regulation is presented based on our zzso
