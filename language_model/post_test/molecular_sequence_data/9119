zzso a member of the zzso zzso of zzso gene family, encodes a zzso factor with a highly zzso zzso domain, which called zzso zzso is involved in zzso and zzso in zzso such as limb development, heart zzso and neural zzso zzso In the present study, a full-length 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was obtained using zzso and zzso technique, which includes a 2 166 zzso complete open reading frame zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso shares zzso identity with its human zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso shared zzso identity with human zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was grouped with zzso in other zzso which were clustered with zzso and separated from zzso The predicted secondary and three-dimensional structures of the zzso of zzso were remarkably similar to human zzso Through zzso zzso the expression of zzso was first detected at zzso stage during zzso sturgeon embryonic development, increased zzso reached its peak at early zzso stage and then decreased zzso In adult sturgeon, zzso was strongly expressed in eye, brain, zzso zzso zzso fin and pelvic zzso but not in liver, blood, heart, kidney and zzso The whole mount in zzso zzso showed that zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso organ and zzso fin bud in the larvae of stage 37 and zzso
