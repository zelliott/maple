The three-dimensional structure of zzso an zzso zzso protein isolated from zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso at zzso resolution and refined to R zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso is similar to that of the related proteins zzso and zzso It is also in good agreement with the solution structure determined by zzso zzso The protein zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso and a smaller lobe formed by two zzso A deep zzso between the two zzso is a putative zzso binding zzso Side chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso aligning the binding zzso in zzso suggest the importance of zzso interactions in stabilizing the zzso zzso zzso of the atomic models of zzso zzso and zzso reveals functional zzso which might determine specificity towards different zzso
