Previous reports of individuals with zzso disorder with maternal zzso of zzso the zzso syndrome region, suggest this area as a source of candidate genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which encodes for zzso zzso zzso have been shown to cause zzso syndrome, which can also result from the absence of maternal zzso material from this zzso Despite showing no evidence for zzso in other zzso this gene was recently discovered to be zzso zzso expressed in human brain and expressed solely from the zzso maternal zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso cells, regions implicated in the zzso of zzso Based on this evidence, the coding region and a putative promoter region were zzso in ten zzso zzso Several zzso were zzso but no evidence was found for a functional zzso Evidence for likely altered regulation of zzso expression in maternal zzso zzso suggests further investigation of the regulatory regions of this gene in zzso zzso
