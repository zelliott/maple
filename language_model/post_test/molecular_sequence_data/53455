Two new high-resolution zzso structures of zzso zzso bound to DNA show that a large variation in zzso angles is sampled in the ground state zzso zzso Together with previous structures, these data reveal a zzso series of protein zzso states zzso a specific trajectory for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso together with movements of two zzso zzso binding in the minor groove, causes base zzso at a key zzso step and zzso structural changes that assemble the active zzso These structures suggest a complex mechanism for DNA zzso that depends on forces generated by interacting protein zzso and on selective zzso of zzso charges along the inner face of the bent double zzso
