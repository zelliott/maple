Numerous small, zzso insect viruses are currently classified as zzso or as zzso since they zzso resemble the true zzso zzso evidence now suggests that several of these viruses are members of a distinct zzso We have determined the gene sequence of the zzso proteins and the zzso A resolution crystal structure of the cricket paralysis zzso While the zzso sequence indicates that the insect zzso viruses represent a distinct lineage compared to true zzso the zzso structure demonstrates that the two groups are zzso These viral zzso are, thus, best viewed as composed of zzso zzso that have zzso
