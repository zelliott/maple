The expression of zzso zzso competent to zzso functional zzso beta proteins requires the zzso of programmed DNA zzso zzso It is not known whether other regulatory mechanisms control the zzso levels of mature zzso transcripts during zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso accumulate in T cells, thus implicating zzso zzso as another potential level of zzso Three methods were used to characterize the zzso content of these zzso Northern zzso analysis, zzso H zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Using these methods, we demonstrate that zzso zzso transcripts derived from both the zzso beta 1 and zzso beta 2 zzso accumulate in zzso fetal and adult zzso zzso beta 1 zzso that accumulate in the zzso possess unusually long zzso tails zzso or zzso 300 zzso and contain different combinations of four zzso the large zzso between the J beta 1 and C beta 1 elements and the three zzso within the C beta 1 zzso The presence of an unusual transcript possessing zzso beta 1 at the zzso zzso suggests that zzso of its zzso zzso is inefficient or zzso zzso The profile of incompletely spliced zzso transcripts present in the zzso in zzso is identical in zzso content to those that we previously showed accumulate in the nucleus of the immature zzso T zzso cell zzso An unstable negative regulatory protein may control zzso expression in this cell clone because fully spliced zzso transcripts are dramatically induced in the zzso after treatment with any of five different protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which act by distinct mechanisms to inhibit protein zzso
