In the zzso zzso zzso there are five nuclear zzso zzso that act in two distinct zzso zzso 3, and 6 function in mismatch repair in both zzso and zzso cells, whereas zzso and zzso act specifically to facilitate crossovers between zzso during zzso zzso as well as zzso experiments indicate that the zzso and zzso proteins form a zzso structure similar to what is observed for the zzso proteins involved in mismatch zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids in the zzso binding and putative zzso zzso of zzso abolish function but are still capable of interaction with zzso suggesting that zzso binding plays a role downstream of zzso zzso No zzso are observed between the mismatch repair zzso proteins zzso and zzso and either zzso or zzso These results indicate that one level of functional specificity between the mismatch repair and zzso crossover zzso zzso in zzso is provided by the ability to form distinct zzso
