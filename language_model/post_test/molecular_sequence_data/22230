We report the results on the expression in zzso coli of a functional zzso zzso from the scorpion zzso zzso zzso The gene for zzso was zzso using zzso zzso and expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso zzso coli strain zzso thus permitting zzso zzso When cultured at 37 degrees C, about 50% of the expressed protein is contained as a zzso in the soluble fraction of the zzso coli zzso The fusion protein from the soluble fraction was zzso and the zzso was zzso by zzso resulting in a yield of about zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso protein was confirmed by zzso and CD zzso zzso zzso using native sodium channels in guinea pig zzso zzso reveal zzso a slowing of zzso and zzso a decrease in peak current upon application of zzso thus confirming the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso
