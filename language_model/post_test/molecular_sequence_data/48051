zzso studies of the folding and zzso properties of a zzso zzso several zzso fragments of the zzso and zzso zzso have enabled the various contributions to zzso stability in water to be zzso zzso and zzso unfolding studies indicate that the zzso equilibrium zzso to a two-state zzso The hairpin is highly resistant to zzso and is still significantly folded in 7 M zzso at zzso zzso zzso analysis shows the hairpin to fold in water with a significant change in heat capacity, however, zzso degrees in 7 M zzso is zzso zzso zzso on one strand of the hairpin reduce folding to zzso zzso consistent with a zzso zzso zzso We show that in a truncated zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso on one zzso the type zzso zzso turn in the sequence zzso is significantly populated in water in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations of zzso using an explicit zzso model, show that the zzso of the zzso turn persists for longer than the AG zzso which has a much lower propensity for type zzso turn formation from a data base analysis of preferred zzso The origin of the high stability of the zzso turn is not entirely clear; data base analysis of 66 zzso turns, together with molecular dynamics simulations, reveals no participation of the zzso zzso in zzso interactions with the zzso zzso However, zzso analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations reveals a pocket of zzso zzso water bridging between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso that suggests zzso interactions may play an important role in modulating zzso zzso in the zzso turn zzso
