In zzso the zzso protein shows a great variation in size, especially in its zzso zzso Extremely large zzso proteins consisting of almost 200 zzso acid zzso and more are found within the zzso family zzso The difference in size compared to other zzso proteins is due to a zzso domain near the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso soil zzso and member of the zzso encodes a large zzso zzso zzso containing the unique and repetitive zzso acid pattern zzso within the zzso zzso Despite the presence of the zzso extension, zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso in zzso By using zzso zzso zzso we detected the large zzso zzso zzso that zzso to its zzso size indicating the expression and stability of the full zzso zzso of the complete zzso zzso zzso open reading frame resulted in severe reduction of zzso In addition, a deletion or zzso of zzso was accompanied by the loss of cell chain zzso The zzso domain was not responsible for growth and cell zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso is strictly zzso within the zzso zzso and we show that zzso expression starts within the preceding zzso gene or further zzso
