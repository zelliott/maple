zzso zzso zzso zzso to the corresponding natural zzso have been zzso by zzso assembly of unprotected natural zzso with zzso zzso in an zzso zzso The zzso reactions were found to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mimics when using zzso and zzso in the case of zzso the zzso was prevalent zzso An zzso method for the synthesis of linear zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated, based on the use of an unprotected zzso building block in which an zzso functionality at zzso is converted during the synthesis into the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso analysis of these compounds was carried out by using zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular mechanics, and molecular dynamics zzso zzso zzso and energies of zzso zzso for each compound have been calculated at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with the results based on zzso experiments and good agreement was zzso It appears that zzso zzso zzso exhibit a slightly different zzso behavior to their parent natural zzso
