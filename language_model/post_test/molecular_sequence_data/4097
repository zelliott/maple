zzso interactions are central to most biological zzso Although much recent effort has been put into methods to identify interacting partners, there has been a limited focus on how these interactions compare with those known from three-dimensional zzso zzso Because comparison of protein interactions often involves considering zzso but not zzso zzso a key issue is whether proteins that are zzso to an interacting pair will interact in the same way, or interact at zzso zzso we describe a method to test putative interactions on complexes of known zzso zzso Given a zzso complex and alignments of zzso of the interacting zzso we assess the fit of any possible interacting pair on the complex by using empirical zzso For studies of interacting protein families that show different zzso the method provides a ranking of interacting pairs useful for zzso zzso We evaluate the method on interacting families of proteins with multiple complex zzso We then consider the zzso growth zzso system and explore the intersection between complexes of known structure and interactions proposed between zzso proteins by methods such as zzso We provide confirmation for several zzso in addition to suggesting molecular details of how they zzso
