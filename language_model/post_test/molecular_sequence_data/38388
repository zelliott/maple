Human serum zzso zzso is produced in bone zzso and interacts with specific cellular receptors that mediate biological zzso In this study, we have analyzed the detailed zzso structure of the human serum zzso zzso zzso hinge region by zzso zzso liquid mass zzso The zzso fragments containing the hinge zzso were separated from 4 zzso zzso patient zzso pooled zzso 10 zzso pooled zzso with other primary zzso and 5 healthy control subject pooled zzso by zzso treatment and zzso affinity zzso The molecular weights of zzso hinge zzso were estimated using mass zzso and 13 zzso and 8 zzso zzso groups were zzso The results obtained clearly showed a decrease of zzso zzso and zzso acid in zzso compared with zzso and normal controls, and those strongly suggested the possibility that the decreased zzso and zzso of the zzso hinge result in its zzso deposition in zzso
