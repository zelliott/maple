A zzso zzso jumping strategy has been zzso to investigate the zzso structure of the human zzso zzso gene and determine the sequences of zzso zzso There are 18 zzso and zzso zzso to a large zzso zzso the last translated segment and a sizable 3' untranslated zzso All of the translated segments are zzso by zzso zzso The tight turn zzso which is critical to the process of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso Based on recent studies of zzso zzso zzso it appears that the zzso most likely to be involved in zzso binding are zzso by zzso zzso zzso 12 exhibits the greatest degree of zzso with the gene for the prostate specific membrane zzso A zzso has been tentatively identified at zzso position zzso in zzso 4; the presence of either zzso or zzso should result in either zzso or zzso respectively, at position 142 of the zzso acid zzso This analysis of zzso structure will permit further detailed studies of the regulation, expression and evolution of the human zzso zzso zzso
