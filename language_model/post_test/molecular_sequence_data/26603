zzso microbial activity has a major influence on the subsurface zzso We investigated the zzso and zzso in zzso groundwater at a depth of zzso in two zzso drilled in a zzso geological setting, where the zzso potential zzso The average maximum potential zzso rates, measured under zzso conditions in the two zzso using an zzso N zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequences obtained from in zzso samples were similar to those of zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso the same operational zzso unit dominated incubated samples from each zzso zzso candidates were detected by zzso zzso gene analysis, but no sequence was detected using zzso for the functional zzso gene zzso Although the stable isotope signatures suggested that some of the dissolved methane was of zzso origin, no potential for methane production was evident during the zzso The groundwater at zzso depth did not contain zzso had an zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and was found to be a potential field for zzso
