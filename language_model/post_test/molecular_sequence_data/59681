We report the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA carrying an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso designated zzso This zzso was shown to be transcribed only during zzso growth from a putative zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence predicted a zzso of 51 zzso zzso zzso which shows significant percentage of identity with the zzso coli zzso zzso However no zzso zzso were observed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
