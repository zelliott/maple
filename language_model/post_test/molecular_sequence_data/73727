The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso which are regulated by control of zzso of a leader region zzso zzso zzso is induced by interaction of the zzso zzso zzso with the leader; the system responds to decreased zzso zzso caused by zzso acid limitation or insufficient levels of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso by pairing of the zzso of the zzso with the zzso sequence of the leader, a zzso specifying the appropriate zzso zzso a second interaction between the zzso end of the zzso and an zzso structure is also zzso Certain switches of the zzso sequence to a new zzso result in a switch in the specificity of the zzso acid response, while other switches do zzso These effects may reflect additional sequence or structural requirements for the zzso zzso This study includes investigation of the effects of a large number of zzso sequence switches in zzso and analysis of structural differences between zzso and zzso species which interact zzso with the zzso leader to promote zzso
