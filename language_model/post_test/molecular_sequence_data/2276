zzso from rat skeletal muscle has been zzso to zzso and its structure and kinetic properties have been zzso The Mr of the native zzso was 100,000 and the zzso Mr was zzso The apparent zzso values of zzso for zzso and zzso were 56 and 48 zzso zzso The apparent zzso value for zzso of zzso was zzso zzso and the Ki for zzso was zzso zzso The zzso was zzso and the zzso activity was zzso times higher than the zzso zzso The zzso was not zzso by zzso protein zzso The zzso acid composition of the skeletal muscle zzso was similar to that of the rat liver zzso and the zzso zzso sequence zzso was the same as that of the liver zzso The zzso peptides generated from the liver and skeletal muscle zzso were identical except for two zzso A zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the rat liver zzso was not detected in the skeletal muscle zzso A zzso whose zzso acid sequence was zzso - zzso was also zzso This zzso was the same as that of rat liver zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso site except in the muscle zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been altered to zzso Thus, the rat skeletal muscle zzso is very similar in structure to the rat liver zzso except for the lack of possibly one zzso and the lack of a zzso site by the substitution of the target zzso with zzso
