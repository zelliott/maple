The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso that has been demonstrated to interact with a wide range of zzso zzso The zzso function of zzso in these complexes is, however, zzso Recent studies with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have suggested that zzso proteins may act as negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso As the zzso and other protein zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways are highly zzso between insects and zzso we sought a zzso zzso of zzso for a detailed genetic zzso We report here that zzso zzso has a single zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso We find that zzso encodes a 52 zzso protein that has a high degree of similarity to zzso and zzso across novel zzso zzso and zzso finger zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso is zzso truncated relative to zzso and zzso and consequently is unable to bind zzso containing zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso protein lacks zzso binding sites it can nevertheless associate with a zzso zzso zzso or is itself zzso zzso in an zzso dependent manner and associates with activated zzso zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso with a role for zzso in zzso dependent patterning in the zzso and adult, zzso is expressed at a high level in early zzso and throughout the zzso discs in third zzso zzso This study forms the basis for future genetic analysis of zzso aimed at gaining insights into the role of zzso proteins in signal zzso
