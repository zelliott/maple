zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso failed to induce nuclear zzso B zzso zzso nuclear zzso in several primary human cells although a marked and rapid induction was observed in their zzso virus 40 transformed zzso zzso to induce zzso B cannot be due to a zzso system since zzso B was strongly activated by tumor necrosis factor in all the five primary cell types zzso It is also unlikely that the differential induction was due to differential sensitivity of primary and transformed cells to zzso zzso as the zzso zzso activities of both cell types were equally inhibited by these zzso However, zzso with hydrogen zzso or zzso zzso chemicals known to directly or indirectly elevate the zzso zzso levels, enabled zzso acid to induce nuclear zzso of zzso B in primary zzso zzso zzso an zzso and precursor of the free radical scavenger, zzso inhibited the induction of zzso B by tumor necrosis factor in primary cells, and by zzso acid or tumor necrosis factor in transformed zzso These data, taken together, suggest that free zzso zzso and protein zzso are not independent modes of zzso B zzso but are both required for the release of zzso B from I zzso zzso Furthermore, the differential induction of zzso B nuclear zzso by zzso acid in primary and transformed human cells, reported zzso reflects intrinsic differences in the zzso zzso state between the two groups of zzso The induction of zzso B by tumor necrosis factor in primary cells suggests that this zzso fulfills the requirement for zzso possibly by inducing the production of free zzso
