A gene causing zzso zzso hearing loss, zzso was previously mapped to an 18 zzso zzso on zzso zzso We mapped an additional 40 zzso families segregating zzso hearing loss to the zzso locus and refined the zzso zzso to zzso zzso The coding regions of all genes in this zzso were zzso and no zzso nonsense, or zzso zzso were zzso We zzso the zzso sequences of zzso as well as zzso zzso and found three zzso clustered in zzso 4 and zzso 5 in the zzso growth factor gene zzso Two zzso 4 deletions occur in a highly zzso sequence that is part of the 3' untranslated region of a previously zzso short zzso of zzso The third zzso is a silent zzso and we demonstrate that it affects zzso in zzso zzso is involved in a wide variety of signaling pathways in many different zzso yet these putative regulatory zzso cause a surprisingly specific zzso which is zzso hearing zzso Two mouse models of zzso zzso one in which an zzso zzso is zzso zzso and the other a conditional knockout that zzso zzso from a limited number of zzso including the zzso result in zzso zzso of zzso is associated with progressive zzso of outer hair cells in the zzso whereas cochlear deletion of zzso is associated with more general zzso
