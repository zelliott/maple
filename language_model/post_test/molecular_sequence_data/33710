zzso in genes associated with the zzso small nuclear zzso zzso complex of the zzso are implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso a group of progressive retinal degenerative disorders leading to visual zzso loss of visual field, and even zzso We recently assigned a locus zzso for zzso to zzso a region that harbors the zzso gene zzso zzso another zzso zzso component that is required for unwinding of zzso zzso during zzso zzso and for zzso of the zzso Here, we report the identification of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 25 of the zzso gene in an zzso zzso The zzso substitution showed complete zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso over four generations, but was absent in a panel of 400 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso another zzso zzso reside in the zzso zzso of the first of two zzso zzso implicated in the zzso and zzso of zzso acid zzso Indeed, marked defects in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso were observed in budding zzso for the analogous zzso zzso and zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso The linkage of zzso to zzso suggests that the mechanism of zzso for zzso zzso may fundamentally derive from a zzso in zzso zzso unwinding and a zzso zzso in zzso zzso
