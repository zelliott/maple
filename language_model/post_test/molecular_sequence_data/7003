zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the major zzso zzso produced by the oral zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is important for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were constructed via gene disruption by use of suicide zzso zzso First, Southern zzso analyses suggested that two separate zzso genes designated zzso and zzso existed on zzso and zzso pair zzso zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso single zzso were constructed by zzso of a suicide zzso Then, an zzso zzso double zzso was isolated by zzso with a second suicide zzso No zzso activity for zzso was observed in either the cell extract or the culture zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso response of zzso zzso which is closely related to their zzso function, was not inhibited by the culture zzso of the zzso zzso zzso while the wild type parent showed a significant zzso of the zzso The result suggests that zzso is responsible for disruption of the function of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso double zzso caused a marked decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso indicating that a major part of the zzso activity of the zzso is associated with the two zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso makes a significant contribution to the zzso of zzso zzso
