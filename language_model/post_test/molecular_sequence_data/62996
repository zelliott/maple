zzso zzso cells play a role in the zzso of zzso by producing zzso zzso We investigated the role of zzso B and zzso in zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso induced zzso zzso protein 1 zzso production in cultured human zzso zzso cells zzso We also examined whether or not these processes could be modified by zzso 

zzso protein and zzso levels were measured by zzso and northern zzso zzso B and zzso binding activity were assessed by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso I zzso B alpha and nuclear zzso protein were evaluated by western zzso For specific zzso of zzso B or zzso we used a decoy zzso 

zzso (10 zzso increased zzso zzso expression in zzso and also the release of zzso protein into culture zzso These effects could be partially inhibited by zzso (10 zzso zzso induced zzso production appeared to be zzso B and zzso zzso based on the following zzso zzso zzso increased zzso B and zzso binding zzso zzso Both zzso B decoy zzso and zzso decoy zzso partially suppressed zzso induced zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso decreased zzso induced zzso activity of zzso without an effect on the zzso activity of zzso B, zzso I zzso B alpha degradation or zzso nuclear zzso 

These data demonstrate that while zzso induced zzso production is zzso by the cooperative action of zzso B and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso production via suppression of zzso binding zzso
