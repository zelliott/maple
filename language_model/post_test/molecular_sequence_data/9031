zzso zzso is a major opportunistic pathogen and zzso of zzso zzso sensing and acquisition mechanisms, as well as the capability to cope with different stressing conditions, are essential for zzso zzso zzso and survival in the zzso zzso This study characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, which is the putative zzso of the factor zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated reduced growth in the presence of zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and poor nutritional conditions, while viability associated with zzso was also affected by heat shock zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso was shown to accumulate in the nucleus upon exposure to zzso stress and heat shock zzso In addition, genes involved in either the zzso stress or heat shock response had reduced zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso strain was attenuated in zzso in a zzso model of invasive pulmonary zzso Furthermore, killing of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was increased compared to killing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a complex role, contributing to several stress tolerance pathways and growth under poor nutritional conditions, and seems to be integrated into different stress zzso
