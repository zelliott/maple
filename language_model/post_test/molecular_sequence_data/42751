The gene crumbs zzso of zzso encodes a zzso protein with 30 zzso and four zzso A zzso repeats in its zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to severe disorganization and zzso of zzso derived embryonic zzso In zzso zzso for zzso an zzso zzso the zzso protein is zzso distributed in the zzso instead of being zzso localized as in zzso this zzso occurs before any zzso zzso cellular zzso becomes zzso suggesting that zzso targeting of proteins is affected in zzso zzso zzso This has been confirmed by using an zzso directed against zzso another zzso expressed zzso A single base exchange in zzso leads to the introduction of a premature stop zzso thus eliminating the zzso part of the zzso zzso A possible role for zzso in controlling zzso polarity is zzso
