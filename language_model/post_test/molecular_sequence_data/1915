zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso signals through zzso zzso complexes composed of type I and type II zzso zzso zzso zzso by type II zzso the type I zzso zzso thereby zzso its zzso zzso and zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso receptors zzso to early zzso where they zzso zzso However, whether zzso and zzso can signal without zzso zzso is still in zzso We report that a zzso changing zzso to Ala in the zzso domain rendered the type I zzso zzso zzso unable to undergo zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso named zzso retained the ability to zzso zzso and mediate zzso zzso zzso Also, a zzso to Ala zzso abolished the zzso of zzso a zzso active type I zzso zzso The action of the zzso zzso became zzso zzso Finally, blocking zzso by depletion of zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso by zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso receptors can zzso zzso signals without zzso and suggest the possibility that an zzso zzso signaling zzso exists, which may act as an alternative mechanism for signal zzso
