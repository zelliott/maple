zzso acid based techniques are widely used to characterize microbial communities in environmental zzso In this study, seven landfill zzso were tested for the presence of zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso from the family zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strategy was employed to amplify the zzso zzso gene region of zzso zzso from landfill sites zzso All of the zzso products from landfill zzso amplified with the first primer pair zzso and the second primer pair zzso were subjected to zzso gel zzso to show seven samples containing zzso from the family zzso One of the positive results was then selected for cloning and sequencing of the zzso product to confirm the identity of the amplified zzso The molecular data presented here reveals for the first time that zzso zzso associated with the zzso rumen environment are also present in landfill zzso
