A full length zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso liver zzso library constructed in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso was zzso zzso to that of rainbow trout zzso zzso and 57 and 51% zzso to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Comparisons of these sequences show the zzso zzso to be most similar to zzso and trout zzso zzso zzso but also to have certain zzso specific to fish zzso zzso Analysis of Southern blots of restriction zzso zzso zzso DNA showed only 1 or 2 bands after zzso to the first 800 zzso of the zzso zzso and Northern blots showed only one zzso band in a variety of zzso suggesting that only 1 gene and no closely related sequences were zzso This evidence implies that the zzso (and zzso zzso may represent an ancestral gene to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A variety of zzso zzso showed increases in zzso zzso zzso after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the strongest response occurred in heart, with slightly less induction in kidney and zzso zzso A significant induction of zzso zzso zzso was also observed in zzso whole blood after zzso or zzso zzso Liver zzso zzso zzso showed a relatively weak response to these zzso but did exhibit elevated zzso zzso activities, especially in zzso zzso The results are discussed with reference to the possible use of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a probe for environmental monitoring zzso
