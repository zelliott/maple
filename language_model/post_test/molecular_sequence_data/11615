zzso the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso binds its DNA zzso across the minor groove in a zzso zzso We demonstrate here that the 28 zzso zzso binds the extensive 37 zzso zzso zzso site as a zzso and significantly zzso its zzso In zzso zzso zzso and phasing analyses indicate that upon zzso the bottom strand of the zzso zzso site, zzso zzso a directed bend of 38 degrees towards the major groove near the zzso zzso zzso of the bent zzso complex is proposed to promote zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, reductions in the degree of distortion and in the efficiency of binding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site indicate that sequences zzso the zzso site contribute to the zzso zzso zzso These results, combined with zzso physical and zzso studies, form the basis of a model, wherein zzso acts as a hinged zzso to induce a distortion that widens the minor groove, zzso access to the zzso zzso zzso The model is compatible with both unmodified DNA and zzso zzso DNA, as exists in the zzso zzso
