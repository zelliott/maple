zzso zzso III zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the zzso protein zzso of zzso Although zzso by zzso zzso is a general feature of zzso III originating from various species, the function of activity important zzso groups is still zzso zzso The present study of the zzso of these groups was undertaken in order to clarify their biological zzso The zzso zzso of human and rat zzso III by zzso zzso zzso zzso was monitored by determination of the zzso residual activity with zzso zzso zzso of this human zzso exhibited zzso zzso suggesting that all zzso zzso have equivalent zzso and the zzso rate constant was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso III was zzso to zzso and showed zzso zzso indicating two classes of zzso zzso The zzso rate zzso of zzso for slower reacting zzso and zzso for faster reacting zzso were obtained from slopes of linear plots of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso protected both zzso zzso III from zzso by zzso zzso zzso of biological zzso and zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso Human zzso was resistant to zzso attack and less affected by reduced zzso zzso than the rat zzso A significantly lower zzso III level, determined by activity measurement and Western zzso was found in the zzso of highly zzso rat zzso These results provide kinetic evidence that zzso zzso are involved in zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso
