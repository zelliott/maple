zzso zzso precursors play an essential role in the assembly of the zzso particle by zzso into a zzso shell at the plasma zzso In order to define the zzso within zzso responsible for this zzso interaction, we have coupled the technology of the zzso zzso system with the technology of a zzso zzso zzso By this method, we have identified a minimal region of zzso capable of efficient zzso This region consists of the zzso portion of the zzso protein zzso including the first zinc finger and the previously described interaction, or I, zzso In parallel with this zzso approach, individual zzso zzso zzso and combinations of these zzso were tested for potential zzso and zzso interactions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the results from the zzso library screen, only combinations of species containing NC were strongly zzso
