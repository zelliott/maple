We have identified two different zzso in the zzso genes of Japanese patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso One is a single base zzso in the zzso 2 of the zzso gene that shifts the reading frame and introduces a premature termination zzso zzso after the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso The other is a G to A transition at zzso zzso leading to a single zzso acid zzso zzso at position 59 zzso zzso to zzso The promoter activity of the patients' zzso genes was evaluated in the zzso zzso system prepared from pigmented melanoma cells, indicating that the patients' genes were accurately transcribed in zzso It is therefore conceivable that the zzso gene is expressed in their zzso Furthermore, transient expression of the zzso genes indicates that the truncated zzso or the zzso containing zzso 59 is unable to form zzso in zzso We therefore propose that these zzso in the zzso genes lead to a zzso of zzso zzso
