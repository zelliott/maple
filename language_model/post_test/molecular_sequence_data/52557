The zzso domain zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso is the main human zzso responsible for the zzso activity of zzso The zzso region of zzso is comprised of seven zzso zzso of which the first three have been shown to be required for zzso zzso We have previously described zzso directed against the zzso region of zzso including zzso and zzso which were shown to block the binding of zzso to the zzso and to inhibit both zzso zzso of human zzso cells in zzso and tumor growth in zzso Here we generated a series of zzso deletion zzso consisting of truncated zzso regions and mapped out the zzso responsible for binding to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were found to require domain 3 for efficient zzso zzso zzso of domain 3 identified two different sets of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were critical for binding to zzso and zzso zzso Combination of zzso zzso affecting both zzso and zzso binding resulted in a zzso that also lost binding to zzso These results suggest that the zzso within this region of domain 3 are critical for zzso zzso Our studies provide a basis for the mechanism of action of our zzso zzso and establish a functional foundation for the development of other classes of zzso to the zzso
