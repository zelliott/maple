The zzso gene in humans is principally expressed in liver and small zzso Using transgenic mice, we previously showed that 256 zzso of zzso zzso DNA was sufficient for liver zzso but as much as zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of 3' DNA did not allow zzso expression of the human zzso zzso In the current study, a zzso zzso DNA construction containing the zzso and the adjacent zzso transcribed zzso zzso which extends from 300 zzso zzso to the zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso produced high levels of zzso zzso zzso A similar DNA construction ending zzso zzso zzso to the zzso gene also allowed zzso zzso zzso The DNA region from zzso to zzso zzso zzso to the zzso gene was then cloned zzso zzso 3' to the zzso gene in both zzso in the absence of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso expression was also achieved with both of these zzso In zzso these in zzso experiments suggest that the zzso control region for the zzso gene is distinct from the liver control region, resides 3' to the gene in the promoter of the adjacent zzso zzso and has some properties of a zzso zzso
