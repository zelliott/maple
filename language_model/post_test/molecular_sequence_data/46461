The zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso which is a zzso step in the zzso zzso via the zzso zzso In this study, the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The cloned gene was then transformed into the zzso root of zzso zzso and the zzso activity and production of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The full-length zzso of zzso comprises zzso with a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso modeling showed that zzso is a new zzso with a spatial structure similar to other plant zzso zzso contains two zzso motifs and two zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain can form a zzso The deduced protein has an zzso point of zzso and a calculated molecular weight of approximately zzso zzso comparison analysis showed that zzso had the highest zzso to zzso from zzso zzso As expected, a zzso tree analysis indicates that zzso belongs to plant zzso zzso zzso expression pattern analysis shows that zzso is strongly expressed in the leaves, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso mediates the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso activity and enhanced the production of zzso and zzso in cultured zzso roots of zzso zzso Our DNA gel zzso analysis has confirmed the presence and integration of the associated zzso zzso zzso is a novel and important zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
