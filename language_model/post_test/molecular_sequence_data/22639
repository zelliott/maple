Assembly of zzso zzso proteins into zzso complexes is required for many zzso membrane fusion zzso However, the mechanisms that govern zzso complex assembly and zzso during fusion are not well zzso We have devised a new in zzso zzso zzso to monitor zzso complex assembly during fusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso transport requires four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso After zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso proteins are thought to assemble into a zzso zzso bundle analogous to the structurally characterized zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling was used to generate a structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on this structure, zzso zzso were introduced into adjacent zzso proteins such that zzso bonds would form if assembled into a zzso zzso Our initial studies focused on zzso bond formation between the zzso motifs of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso derivatives in the same strain produced a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso under zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso zzso formed during in zzso transport reactions when zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso fused with zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso Using this zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso of transport with zzso zzso blocked formation of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso did not inhibit formation of the zzso zzso during in zzso transport but zzso inhibited zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso This data suggests that zzso is not directly required for membrane fusion between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
