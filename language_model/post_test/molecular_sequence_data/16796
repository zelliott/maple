zzso is a putative tumor zzso gene that is zzso in a variety of human zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in zzso and in zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso mediates its tumor zzso effects remain to be zzso Here, we report that zzso is a zzso protein that interacts with and zzso zzso We have identified the zzso region harboring a basic domain that appears to mediate the interactions between zzso and zzso The basic zzso zzso zzso also interacts with and zzso zzso We further show that in addition to zzso arrest, zzso promotes growth arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and zzso zzso also interacts with zzso Based on our results, we propose that zzso may mediate its tumor zzso effects by inducing growth arrest in the zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which this novel tumor zzso mediates its biological zzso
