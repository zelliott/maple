Previous efforts at understanding the evolution of the zzso zzso based on zzso zzso have been plagued by poorly supported zzso zzso and zzso 2008; Moore and zzso 2009, in zzso It has been suggested zzso and zzso zzso that a molecular zzso might provide more insight into this history than can be easily discovered using zzso zzso In this study, zzso of the zzso c zzso zzso I gene zzso zzso of the zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso nuclear gene zzso 3) were zzso for 18 species of zzso and six zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso sites were used for zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso All three analyses produced similar zzso with the exception of a single difference within the zzso zzso zzso values and zzso probabilities provided strong support at many shallow zzso and the zzso of zzso was supported in every zzso Three distinct zzso of zzso are evident in this zzso One of these represents the majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso species, is clearly a member of a symbiotic zzso and appears to have zzso lost its symbiotic relationship with zzso There was moderate support confirming similar zzso trends seen in earlier zzso zzso including the hypothesis that symbiotic species zzso with zzso have evolved more recently than zzso zzso Despite the inclusion of a presumably conservative nuclear zzso some deep zzso are still unresolved or are not well zzso Future inclusion of additional zzso and more slowly evolving zzso will likely improve resolution of these deeper zzso The subsequent zzso supports previous hypotheses by zzso zzso zzso (1991) and zzso et zzso zzso that evolution of more complex zzso zzso structures is related to increased complexity of zzso with zzso and greater efficiency of zzso zzso Our zzso also demonstrates that this zzso has evolved only once in zzso and that zzso species are sister, rather than zzso to zzso zzso
