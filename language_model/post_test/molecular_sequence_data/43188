We report the identification of DNA sequences that determine the activity of the zzso zzso promoter and a new form of zzso zzso zzso that recognizes these sequences in zzso Base zzso were introduced throughout the zzso promoter region, and bases at positions zzso zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso start site were shown to be required for promoter zzso These bases zzso in their positions to regions known to be important for zzso zzso binding in several classes of zzso zzso but the sequences themselves are not similar to those previously zzso The zzso region of the zzso promoter consists of six G zzso and base changes in this G zzso had a dramatic effect on promoter zzso By using zzso DNA template, a new zzso zzso activity was zzso from zzso zzso zzso experiments identified a new zzso factor that directs zzso zzso in zzso zzso I protection experiments identified a binding site for this new zzso immediately upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso
