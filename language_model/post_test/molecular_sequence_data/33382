zzso DNA zzso possess a zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso motif termed the zzso protein zzso zzso We investigated the role of the zzso box on the functional interactions of the two DNA zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso D zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with its zzso zzso The zzso box was essential for interactions of zzso B with zzso as shown by surface zzso resonance and primer extension zzso In contrast, binding of zzso D to zzso was affected only partially by removing the zzso zzso We identified a second zzso zzso box motif at the zzso of the large zzso of zzso D that was required for the interactions of zzso D with zzso Thus, two zzso motifs were needed for zzso D for binding to zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso was essential for stimulation of zzso D activity but not for stimulation of zzso B zzso Neither DNA zzso zzso with the zzso zzso connecting zzso Our data suggest that distinct processes are involved in zzso D and zzso B binding to zzso raising the possibility that zzso require two mechanisms for recruiting zzso DNA zzso at the replication zzso
