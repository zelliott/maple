The zzso induced T cell specific adapter protein zzso zzso by zzso interacts with and zzso zzso zzso Several transcript zzso of zzso zzso exist, but their biological significance remains zzso Here we examined expression of zzso transcripts in activated zzso T cells and used the zzso zzso as tools to identify functionally important regions of zzso 

zzso was found to interact with zzso in human zzso T cells ex zzso Three interaction modes of zzso with zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso domain, whereas one or more of the four zzso within zzso zzso by zzso zzso 7 was found to zzso interaction with the zzso Finally the zzso domain was found to interact with zzso The zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso information essential not only for zzso interaction with zzso but also for zzso zzso of zzso activity and zzso of zzso to the zzso All five zzso transcripts were found to be expressed in zzso zzso zzso T zzso 

These data show that zzso and zzso may interact through several different zzso and that zzso zzso interaction occurs in zzso T cells ex zzso Alternative zzso of zzso 7 zzso zzso results in loss of the majority of protein interaction motives of zzso and yields truncated zzso molecules with altered ability to zzso zzso zzso Whether zzso is regulated through differential alternative zzso of the zzso transcript remains to be zzso
