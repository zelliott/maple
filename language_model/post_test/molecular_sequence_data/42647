An assessment of optimal conditions for zzso primer amplification of low copy number target DNA sequences was made using a human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso In this zzso chain reaction zzso strategy, an outer primer pair is first used to amplify the target sequence and a fraction of the amplification product is further amplified with a pair of inner zzso zzso Several zzso parameters were zzso including number of cycles in the first and second step of the reaction, proportion of zzso material to be used as the template for the second amplification, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso in the outer and inner zzso The zzso zzso required minimal amounts of reaction components and was shown to be highly flexible, resulting in exquisite and specificity over a wide range of technical zzso Potential drawbacks of this practical and effective amplification procedure are also zzso
