The zzso zzso develops mainly after birth, and shows a repeated cycle of zzso zzso differentiation for zzso and a zzso phase after weaning known as zzso Compared to the proliferation and differentiation zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso are largely zzso In the present study we screened genes that could play a potential role in early zzso of the mouse zzso zzso using fluorescent differential display followed by zzso reverse zzso chain zzso We found that five genes were zzso more than twofold 48 h after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso P zzso The products of these genes can be linked to defense against zzso stress and/or infectious zzso zzso analysis and mass zzso of milk proteins showed that the zzso of zzso and zzso in milk were increased fivefold and more than zzso respectively, within 48 h after zzso These increases were in contrast to the constant presence of other major proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may cooperate in the defense of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
