The study of several human breast cancer cell lines containing zzso receptors has allowed characterization of a number of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso In primary zzso these markers have different zzso significance for predicting whether the zzso will be hormone responsive zzso zzso zzso zzso and whether it will zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of regulation of gene expression by zzso and zzso in breast cancer is complex and varies according to the nature of both the gene and the cell in which it is zzso Our laboratory has identified the sequences zzso zzso activity in the zzso region of zzso D, including a zzso zzso element located at zzso which acts in zzso with other regulatory zzso In addition to the classical effect of zzso zzso in stimulating zzso of genes controlled by the zzso element, we found that zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso of zzso genes without interacting directly with zzso zzso between zzso zzso and members of the zzso family via zzso interactions may explain how zzso inhibit the zzso effect of growth factors in the apparent absence of zzso and why tamoxifen is able to stimulate zzso D gene expression and induce zzso in certain zzso zzso breast cancer zzso The nature and degree of this zzso appears to vary according to the zzso the cell type and the type of zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso genes are not only useful for zzso breast zzso according to their ability to zzso and respond to therapies, but also should lead to new therapeutic approaches for zzso and zzso zzso
