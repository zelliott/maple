zzso in zzso an essential zzso of the zzso factor zzso lead to zzso zzso repair zzso defects and zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso and the molecular mechanisms resulting in XP are poorly zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso interacts with zzso and stimulates its zzso zzso A zzso found among zzso patients zzso zzso this interaction and the resulting zzso zzso thereby explaining the zzso in the damaged DNA zzso We next found that zzso in the zzso motifs III zzso and VI zzso that inhibit zzso zzso activity preserve the zzso function of zzso Our results suggest a mechanism in which the zzso activity of zzso is not used for the opening and repair of damaged DNA, which is instead only driven by its zzso activity, in combination with the zzso activity of zzso
