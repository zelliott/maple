In zzso the zzso gene is highly zzso in the zzso corpus zzso as well as in the zzso This expression is already elevated on Day 2 of the zzso cycle, representing zzso of all transcripts in this zzso and it declines thereafter to low levels after Day 6 of the zzso In order to study the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso gene zzso we have cloned and zzso the zzso gene from the zzso This gene is closely zzso to other known zzso zzso zzso especially the bovine one, and comparison of the gene promoter regions highlights several blocks of putative control zzso
