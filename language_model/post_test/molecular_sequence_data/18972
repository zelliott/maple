zzso zzso is the most common zzso zzso in children and zzso being characterized by expression of genes and zzso and zzso features of zzso zzso The zzso cell zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso in adults has been defined as an entity, separated from zzso zzso zzso with zzso clinical zzso So far, no zzso genetic zzso has been identified in the adult form of zzso cell zzso We studied a case of adult zzso cell zzso using next-generation sequencing zzso after zzso zzso Using this approach, we identified 31 zzso zzso zzso and selected four genes with predicted functional relevance to muscle differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were further tested for zzso using zzso sequencing on DNA from zzso samples from 16 zzso adult zzso cell zzso zzso The highly zzso sequence zzso of zzso with other zzso zzso factors prompted us to screen the basic zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso From the investigated 17 samples, seven zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso indicating a critical role in this rare zzso of adult zzso cell zzso while no zzso were found in any of the other genes involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso occurs in the zzso DNA binding domain in zzso and leads to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso events in zzso zzso cell zzso
