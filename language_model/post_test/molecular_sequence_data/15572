zzso zzso gene zzso promoter use leads to protein zzso differing by 8 or 15 zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose regulation and function are not completely understood versus the well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso To describe how zzso zzso levels were regulated by chronic drug use, we measured zzso zzso zzso levels in different human brain regions from cocaine addicts relative to age, race, and zzso zzso The cocaine group had zzso higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso versus controls zzso zzso zzso In cortex, zzso 4 and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso were significantly reduced in the cocaine group relative to controls zzso P zzso zzso We also tested the hypothesis that the signal peptides of zzso zzso and zzso zzso different functional properties and determined if the functional zzso zzso influenced these zzso In contrast to zzso zzso cells producing zzso Short, regulated zzso of zzso or zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso producing zzso or zzso on either the zzso or zzso background were similarly distributed in zzso and had similar zzso patterns with the zzso zzso marker zzso zzso This pattern differed from zzso producing zzso Short zzso which had impaired zzso Together, these findings support a mechanism by which zzso zzso proteins can overcome the functional zzso of the zzso substitution and suggest how functional differences in zzso may impact brain responses in zzso
