zzso 1 is a zzso cell surface zzso for zzso Since zzso are commonly present on zzso cell walls, it has been suggested that zzso 1 is important for recognizing zzso zzso In this study we tried to deduce the zzso acid zzso in zzso 1 responsible for zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with mouse zzso 1 zzso could bind to a zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso to a zzso 1 zzso was inhibited by zzso with other zzso having a zzso linkage but not by zzso with zzso zzso 1 has a zzso recognition domain zzso consisting of six zzso zzso that are highly zzso in zzso zzso We prepared 32 point zzso with zzso in the zzso and analyzed their binding to zzso zzso at zzso and zzso resulted in decreased binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso 1 zzso zzso which had a blocking effect on the zzso interaction, completely failed to bind the zzso zzso zzso A zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso did not have a collaborative effect on zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso in response to zzso These zzso acid zzso are distinct from zzso in other zzso zzso sequences of typical zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso acid sequence zzso is critical for formation of a zzso binding site in the zzso of zzso zzso
