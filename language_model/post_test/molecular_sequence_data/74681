A zzso zzso a zzso zzso was identified among the expressed sequence tags zzso of the Antarctic zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame consisted of zzso zzso zzso 382 zzso acids with a putative signal zzso zzso acid sequence comparison with other zzso indicated that zzso likely belongs to zzso 10 of the zzso zzso family 5, together with zzso zzso zzso shows typical features of a zzso zzso it has a high frequency of polar zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and a low frequency of zzso zzso as well as a low ratio of zzso compared to the zzso zzso When zzso was fused with the zzso gene in zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso after zzso treatment, zzso active zzso was zzso zzso has high specific activity zzso zzso toward locust bean gum at an optimal temperature of 30 degrees C and an optimal pH of zzso Its optimal temperature is the lowest among those of the known zzso and the optimal pH is also the lowest except those of zzso Even at zzso degrees C, this zzso retained zzso of its maximum zzso zzso metal zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso activity, but zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso This study represents the first record of a zzso from an zzso and provides a new source of zzso zzso zzso with novel zzso
