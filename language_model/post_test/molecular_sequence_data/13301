16 pairs of zzso zzso complementary to unique DNA sequences of human zzso 3, were zzso For 10 of these, fragments of expected length were generated in zzso chain reaction zzso These fragments may be used as markers for detailed physical mapping of this zzso The above zzso were used in zzso in order to zzso a hybrid zzso cell line which contained presumably a zzso of human zzso zzso The presence of human DNA in the hybrid line has been zzso but no ultimate evidence was received to confirm its location in human zzso zzso By means of zzso complementary to the zzso gene zzso pools of clones from the zzso total library of human DNA were zzso and then the pool and later the individual zzso of zzso zzso containing a zzso of zzso zzso were zzso
