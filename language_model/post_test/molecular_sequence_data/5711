zzso are a group of zzso 12 zzso zzso proteins that mediate numerous zzso processes in all zzso Human zzso can be exported out of the cell where it has additional functions including the ability to stimulate cell zzso A recent crystal structure determination of human zzso revealed an inactive zzso form of the protein zzso linked through a zzso bond involving zzso 73 from each zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso In the present study, apparent zzso zzso zzso for the zzso linked zzso were determined at various zzso using a novel zzso in which zzso zzso but not zzso were rapidly linked through zzso (with zzso of the zzso 73 zzso bond, and the relative amounts of zzso and zzso were detected by gel zzso The values obtained were zzso varying between zzso and 166 zzso for the pH range of zzso and were consistent with the zzso of a single zzso group having a zzso of zzso A similar value was obtained using gel zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the crystal structure of the zzso protein was determined to be nearly identical to that obtained in the absence of zzso zzso 60 lies in the zzso interface and was found to be responsible for the pH dependence for zzso formation, and therefore must have a zzso elevated by approximately zzso pH zzso zzso of zzso 60 to zzso abolished nearly all of the pH dependence for zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso revealed a zzso nearly identical to the wild type, but, surprisingly, it had the zzso 60 side chain rotated out of the zzso interface and replaced with two water zzso The values obtained for zzso suggest human zzso may zzso in zzso and possible roles for such zzso are zzso
