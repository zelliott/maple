An zzso zzso protein from the liver fluke, zzso zzso has been identified and zzso The protein shows strongest sequence similarity to egg zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protein is predicted to adopt a zzso zzso it thus represents the third zzso protein to be zzso in zzso zzso and has been named zzso Compared to the classical zzso structure there are some zzso Most zzso the central, zzso zzso is disrupted by a zzso zzso zzso native gel zzso showed that zzso binds calcium zzso This binding event increases the ability of the protein to bind the zzso fluorescent probe zzso consistent with an increase in surface zzso as seen in other zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not to the zzso regulatory light chain binding compound zzso zzso demonstrated that the protein is found in eggs and zzso zzso Given the critical role of calcium zzso in egg formation and zzso this suggests that zzso may play a role in calcium zzso in these zzso zzso the antagonism of zzso may, zzso offer a method for zzso egg production and thus reducing the spread of zzso
