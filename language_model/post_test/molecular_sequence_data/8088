The zzso of zzso to zzso in the A alpha chains of human zzso zzso is associated with a delayed zzso release of zzso A zzso or A alpha 1 to 16 of zzso by zzso leading to a bleeding zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso have been designed that include a zzso to replace zzso in natural zzso and to mimic the frequent zzso of a zzso zzso at equivalent positions of other protein zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso bind specifically to the active site of zzso as shown by zzso differential line broadening and transferred nuclear zzso effects zzso zzso zzso is well tolerated by the zzso structures of both zzso and zzso zzso in solution, resulting in enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso causes backbone zzso changes in zzso zzso and zzso accompanied by an expansion of the zzso cluster of zzso to accommodate the bulky zzso of zzso The single turn of zzso structure between zzso zzso and zzso is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from the zzso zzso of zzso to the exposed backbone zzso groups of zzso and/or zzso zzso and by hydrogen bonds between the exposed backbone zzso groups of zzso zzso and zzso and the backbone zzso groups of zzso and zzso zzso The bound structure of zzso zzso may be further stabilized by a zzso zzso + 4) interaction between the aromatic zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso Despite these zzso zzso zzso the zzso interactions are highly dynamic as indicated by the fast rate of zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso comparison between zzso zzso A and B suggests that the specificity of zzso is dictated by a zzso consensus zzso zzso or zzso when zzso at zzso can be a charged or a neutral polar zzso capable of specific interactions with zzso near the active site of zzso
