The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso The mouse zzso of this zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The gene encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso zzso The sequence conservation to its zzso counterpart is restricted to several zzso In the zzso part of the protein all six zzso are present that are characteristic for zzso DNA zzso In the zzso part of the protein two regions can be identified with considerable similarity to the zzso boxes of mouse zzso zzso In addition, a region of 60 zzso unique for the zzso zzso can be found in the middle part of the zzso The mouse zzso protein shows strong sequence conservation with the recently cloned human zzso protein zzso identity zzso Northern zzso analysis of various zzso of the mouse revealed that zzso of the zzso gene was highest in brain, zzso and zzso The human zzso gene was zzso to the long arm of zzso 6, region zzso The mouse equivalent maps to zzso 10, zzso to the zzso zzso close to the Macs zzso
