zzso is a general mechanism for zzso the activity of cell surface receptors by consigning these proteins for zzso degradation through the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein functions at the zzso step of zzso and binds zzso proteins through a zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in a broad range of cellular proteins but previous studies have suggested that the mode of zzso recognition might not be universally zzso Here we present the solution structure of the zzso zzso domain in complex with zzso The zzso zzso domain forms a zzso bundle structure and binds zzso through a largely zzso surface in a manner reminiscent of the zzso zzso and the remotely zzso zzso zzso zzso for which high-resolution structures have been zzso However, the interaction is dissimilar to the molecular models proposed for the zzso zzso zzso bound to either zzso or zzso zzso Our zzso analyses of the zzso zzso zzso interaction reveal several key affinity zzso and, unexpectedly, a negative affinity zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso interactions may not be the sole criterion for optimal function of zzso zzso zzso
