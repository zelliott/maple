zzso sequences from zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso hormone zzso genes were used to investigate zzso relationships among South American zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with special emphasis on the family zzso zzso among most zzso were well resolved by a combined analysis of both zzso and the molecular zzso was used to address several long-standing zzso zzso The family zzso was the most zzso lineage within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the family zzso was sister to the family zzso followed by a zzso group containing the families zzso and zzso A basic zzso was observed within the family zzso The Argentine desert specialists, zzso and zzso grouped separate from zzso which was sister to a zzso containing a zzso zzso and a zzso represented by species of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso relative to zzso The zzso was used as an interpretive framework for an examination of variation in several zzso zzso The primitive zzso number for most of the zzso was determined to be between 46 and 56, and the primitive zzso size zzso zzso Members of the zzso appeared to be derived from an ancestral stock occupying lower zzso in scrub zzso Furthermore, estimates of divergence time from the molecular data provided a zzso perspective for changes in plant communities, which demonstrated turnover and diversification in response to zzso and zzso events occurring in the zzso through the zzso
