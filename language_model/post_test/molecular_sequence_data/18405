The effectiveness of zzso acid for the monitoring of zzso completion during solid phase zzso synthesis was zzso Each zzso step was monitored during the synthesis of 124 peptides by the method of simultaneous multiple zzso zzso Of the peptides tested zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso underwent a single low yield step, another zzso had 2 or 3 consecutive low yield steps and about zzso contained zzso 4 to 8 steps zzso In virtually all instances, the low yield steps occurred only at or after zzso step zzso High zzso values obtained after incorporation of zzso appear to be caused by a zzso salt in the side chain of zzso zzso in average zzso of zzso acids correlated with structural elements of their side zzso zzso acid, which is currently seldom used for monitoring of zzso completion during solid phase zzso zzso was found to be straightforward and zzso While zzso acid monitoring is not as sensitive as the more commonly used zzso method, it yields information which is not zzso with the use of zzso and is clearly superior for certain applications and zzso
