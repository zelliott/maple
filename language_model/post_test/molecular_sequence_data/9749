The zzso family zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in T cell zzso zzso zzso yet its precise role and mechanism of zzso remain zzso To investigate these issues, we examined the zzso response of zzso to zzso zzso We found that zzso is zzso after zzso zzso and that this zzso depends on the presence of functional zzso To determine if this zzso dependence results from direct zzso of zzso by zzso we generated zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso expression system and used these proteins in subsequent zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso upon zzso in insect cells and, further, that this zzso of zzso results in increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso The major site of zzso zzso on zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in insect cells, indicating that zzso at this site plays a critical role in regulating zzso zzso
