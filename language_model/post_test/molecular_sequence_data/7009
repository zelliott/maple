zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso expressed on zzso cells, zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso expression in the developing mouse zzso has revealed the presence of multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso that appeared to result from the alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso domain sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Chung, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Newman, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Buck, zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso To investigate the functional consequences of alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso for each zzso and their ability to promote cell zzso was zzso In this zzso full-length zzso and all three zzso containing zzso 14 behaved like human zzso in that they zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, three zzso zzso all missing zzso 14, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 thus appears to zzso the zzso and adhesive interactions of the zzso domain of zzso These findings suggest that alternative zzso may represent a mode of regulating the adhesive function of zzso in zzso and provides direct evidence that alternative zzso involving the zzso domain affects the zzso specificity and binding properties of a cell zzso zzso
