Gene VI of cauliflower mosaic virus zzso has been shown to be a zzso of host specificity of the virus as well as a factor influencing symptom development in infected zzso In addition, it plays a crucial role in viral gene expression through a process of zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso within gene VI of a zzso zzso cauliflower mosaic virus zzso were constructed and tested for zzso symptom development on zzso plants, and the ability of zzso viral gene zzso Certain zzso in the first third of the gene resulted in changes in symptoms shown by test zzso Another zzso also in the first third of the zzso blocked zzso in the zzso species tested and systemic movement in zzso zzso The zzso were also tested in zzso for the ability to zzso virus gene zzso zzso zzso were invariably positive for zzso and zzso negative for zzso were zzso Interestingly, two zzso positive for zzso were zzso suggesting a second function for gene VI in the infection zzso These results further suggest a role for gene zzso as yet not fully zzso in systemic movement of the virus in infected zzso
