zzso virus, recently isolated from a zzso mouse zzso zzso captured in a northern zzso village where severe cases of zzso fever with zzso syndrome were zzso was shown by zzso and restriction zzso zzso of zzso gene segments to be related to previously recognized zzso To investigate further the relationship of this new isolate to other zzso a portion of the medium zzso zzso segment of zzso virus was amplified by zzso and the zzso sequence zzso Comparing the zzso sequence with the same gene region of other zzso revealed an overall zzso of zzso A zzso tree based on zzso sequence similarity clearly showed that zzso virus is genetically zzso and probably represents a new virus in the zzso Hantavirus of the family zzso
