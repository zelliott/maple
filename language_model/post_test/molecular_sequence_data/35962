A simple and rapid method for identification of zzso at the human zzso zzso zzso locus is zzso The zzso second zzso of the zzso locus was amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The amplified DNA was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and restriction zzso zzso zzso Using this method, the eight known zzso zzso could be distinguished from each zzso This paper suggests that the method can be used for quick zzso of zzso zzso but detecting point zzso at various positions in a zzso as well as new zzso zzso should also be zzso
