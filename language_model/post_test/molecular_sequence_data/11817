zzso and zzso are human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which is required for growth in high zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso a zzso delta zzso A zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso delta was isolated and found to have approximately zzso lower zzso activity than the zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that both the zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is regulated by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is zzso active but dependent on the upstream zzso zzso zzso studies showed that reduction or elimination of zzso zzso activity restores salt responsiveness as measured by zzso zzso suggesting that too high a level of zzso activity can result in zzso of the host cell and inability to grow in high zzso
