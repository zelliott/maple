The zzso coli zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Q proteins were expressed as zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso The fusion proteins were zzso under zzso conditions by affinity zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fusion proteins yielded zzso pure zzso (5 zzso zzso and almost zzso pure zzso protein zzso zzso zzso where zzso indicates the presence of zzso additional zzso acids at the zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso exhibited the same activities as zzso zzso in enhancement of zzso zzso enhancement of termination at zzso zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso protein exhibited both zzso and zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso was lost gradually during storage if the zzso used for zzso of the zzso fusion protein was not zzso This was due to zzso by zzso after zzso within the Q protein itself, at a zzso zzso zzso site, so the truncated protein zzso lacked the first 22 zzso acids at the zzso of zzso The expression zzso described here can be used to rapidly produce large quantities of these zzso and the truncated Q protein can be used to evaluate the requirement for the zzso of Q in zzso zzso interactions with the DNA template zzso zzso and interaction with zzso zzso zzso
