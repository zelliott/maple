The zzso control region zzso was studied across five zzso orders, in order to give a detailed overview of its zzso 

The zzso is zzso into three zzso similar to the zzso of zzso zzso However, the conservation of different features among the zzso orders is in general more zzso In the first domain, two zzso blocks extended zzso sequences zzso 1 and zzso 2) are present in all zzso zzso In the third domain, the three zzso sequence blocks zzso 1, zzso 2 and zzso 3) are present and complete, with zzso 1 being duplicated in four of five zzso zzso 

The zzso frequency and secondary structures of the repeats were typical for zzso zzso The repeats are generally zzso except in zzso and zzso which show a significant increase in zzso zzso
