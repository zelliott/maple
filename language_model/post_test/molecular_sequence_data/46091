Two genetically zzso gene clusters currently define the turkey major zzso complex zzso Previous studies identified turkey bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones hypothesized as zzso of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso Physical mapping assigned these clones to the same zzso zzso and sequencing of the zzso zzso found near zzso with a portion of the chicken zzso This study examines the sequence of the second zzso zzso clone that was hypothesized, based on zzso zzso to be zzso to the zzso zzso of this clone identified a class I locus and zzso of additional genes found in the zzso class III zzso zzso 50% of the zzso insert is comprised of sequence corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso This turkey zzso zzso sequence is unique from sequences assigned to the zzso in the zzso Based on sequence zzso the class I gene appears to be a zzso zzso The class III genes zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso represent the second class III gene cluster identified in the zzso zzso This cluster appears to be of ancient origin and provides insight into the evolution of the avian zzso
