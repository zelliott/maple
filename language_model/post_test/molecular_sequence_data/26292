In this communication, we zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso from zzso coli, a zzso zzso active transport zzso We zzso zzso zzso by zzso and suggest possible roles for some individual zzso in the mechanism of zzso zzso Although high-resolution structural information is not presently available, kinetic analysis of the partial reactions zzso by the zzso zzso as well as zzso studies, suggest an evolving model for the mechanism of zzso zzso
