Marine zzso zzso have escaped all zzso attempts to date, all zzso growing in pure culture so far being zzso Here, we present a comparative zzso analysis of a zzso plus zzso zzso of a zzso retrieved from an environmental zzso library constructed from zzso collected at 500 m depth in the Antarctic Polar zzso The clone zzso contained an insert of zzso zzso which was completely zzso zzso appears to represent a lineage specific to zzso waters but widespread zzso as revealed by the analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison with previously zzso marine zzso zzso clones also containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains A and zzso revealed a highly variable structure involving gene zzso and zzso The surroundings of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene appear hot spots for zzso zzso analyses of all individual predicted proteins revealed the existence of several likely cases of horizontal gene transfer both, between the two zzso zzso and between the two zzso zzso The most frequent horizontal transfers appear to involve genes from zzso zzso zzso related to zzso We zzso that the acquisition of genes from zzso bacteria and zzso has played a major role in the adaptation of Group I zzso to life at lower zzso
