zzso zzso displaying zzso resistance zzso a plasma membrane protein zzso which is zzso by the zzso gene and apparently functions as an zzso drug zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and other members of the zzso gene family has been observed in normal cells, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso We have isolated a gene from the zzso zzso zzso that encodes a protein very similar to zzso zzso zzso of this gene resulted in zzso of zzso but not of zzso alpha zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso is the product of the zzso zzso a locus previously shown to be required in zzso cells for production of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso protein functions to export the zzso zzso zzso in a manner analogous to the zzso of zzso zzso drugs zzso by the related zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso including the zzso gene of zzso coli and the zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes components of zzso pathways distinct from the classical, signal zzso protein zzso zzso
