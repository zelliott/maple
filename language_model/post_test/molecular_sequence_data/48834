A zzso zzso strictly zzso bacterial strain zzso by zzso designated zzso was isolated from a tidal flat at zzso zzso zzso were moderately zzso zzso and zzso zzso Growth was observed at zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso 2-4 zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 0 zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The polar zzso pattern comprised zzso four unidentified zzso and three unidentified zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso and the only respiratory zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso formed a tight zzso lineage with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity of zzso zzso but the zzso zzso value between the two strains was only zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular features, strain zzso was shown to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of zzso zzso is also zzso
