Using 40 known zzso zzso zzso we have derived a consensus sequence for an evolutionary young zzso zzso zzso family, which was named the HS zzso In the human zzso the HS family is represented by approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso of them being zzso zzso The family can be subdivided into two zzso differing in five linked zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso evolutionary ages, zzso The zzso zzso members were zzso active both before the divergence of the human and zzso zzso lineages and after it in both zzso The zzso zzso comprises only zzso zzso These and other data strongly suggest that at least three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were active in the human zzso lineage after the zzso zzso We also found zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of 12 human genes and identified 13 new zzso zzso zzso zzso
