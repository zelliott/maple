Three series of basic proteins and peptides were selected for use in studying the zzso behavior of zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparative study of zzso and treated zzso columns was zzso The zzso used as coating materials ranged from very zzso to very zzso The average efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso for basic proteins was over 1 million theoretical plates at a buffer pH of zzso For this zzso it was found that the maximum column efficiency was obtained at a film thickness of approximately 100 zzso It was easily seen that both zzso and zzso interaction forces can play important roles in protein zzso onto the zzso zzso Furthermore, strongly zzso zzso zzso may possibly lead to zzso zzso which decrease column zzso Studies have been conducted using two series of zzso with varying chain zzso One series was used to study the effect of zzso chain length on retention zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso drugs on zzso columns were zzso The results indicate that high efficiency and resolution of basic peptides tested can be realized on columns modified with zzso zzso zzso at a pH value of about zzso
