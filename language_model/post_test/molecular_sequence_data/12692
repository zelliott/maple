zzso zzso zzso is a highly regulated zzso activity and multiple zzso of this zzso are coded for by a zzso family in zzso species, including zzso zzso L zzso is the main activity present in adult human liver and is the protein product of the zzso zzso which is widely expressed in zzso zzso and zzso A previous report described almost the full-length zzso sequence and part of the human zzso gene and also presented Northern zzso evidence for multiple transcripts in zzso This study was performed to further characterize the zzso gene and its expression in human zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso clones were isolated, zzso and used as zzso in zzso protection analyses which together demonstrated the zzso zzso an intervening sequence near the zzso of the published zzso zzso which affects the predicted zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso alternative transcripts resulting from zzso zzso at, or near, the zzso of the zzso gene that exhibit zzso patterns of relative zzso zzso predicted usage of three different initiation zzso to zzso variable zzso extensions on zzso L zzso and zzso an extension of a 3' untranslated sequence in some zzso zzso In addition, reverse zzso zzso and additional zzso protection analyses were used to map the zzso of two zzso zzso 1 zzso both of which contain multiple zzso zzso These results are discussed in relation to predicted zzso L diversity across human zzso and zzso
