Previous results have indicated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors are targets of zzso In the present study, we determined the effects of zzso treatment of synaptic zzso on zzso zzso using western blots with zzso directed against the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and compared them with the effects of calcium treatment of zzso brain zzso zzso treatment of synaptic zzso resulted in a large decrease in the zzso band zzso zzso labeled with zzso and in the formation of a zzso band labeled with zzso due to the appearance of a new species of zzso zzso zzso These effects were blocked almost completely by zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso properties were not associated with modifications of zzso or zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso brain sections with zzso of calcium as low as zzso zzso resulted in a large decrease in the zzso zzso band and in the concurrent appearance of the zzso zzso This treatment was associated with increased zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that there exist several zzso of zzso zzso exhibiting different sensitivities to zzso Our data also indicate the existence of additional zzso processes regulating the characteristics of receptors in intact zzso
