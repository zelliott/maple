zzso data, zzso complete zzso zzso zzso are popular molecular markers used for zzso zzso and ecological studies in different animal zzso Their comparative analysis has been used to shed light on the evolutionary history of given zzso and on the molecular processes that regulate the evolution of the zzso zzso A considerable literature is available in the fields of zzso zzso and zzso adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, exemplified by those of the zzso Nevertheless, limited molecular data are available from zzso Antarctic species, and this study represents the first attempt towards the description of a zzso zzso from one of the most widespread and common zzso species of zzso 

In this study we describe the zzso zzso of the Antarctic zzso zzso zzso Willem, zzso The zzso contains the standard set of 37 genes usually present in animal zzso and a large zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the region zzso responsible for the control of replication and zzso All genes are arranged in the gene order typical of zzso Three additional short zzso regions are present at gene zzso Two of these are located in positions of abrupt shift of the coding polarity of genes oriented on opposite strands suggesting a role in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, remnants of an additional copy of zzso are present between zzso and zzso zzso composition is biased towards a high zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as typically found in zzso zzso There is also a significant strand zzso with the zzso being more abundant in A and zzso Within the zzso region, some short sequence fragments appear to be similar (in position and primary zzso to those involved in the origin of the zzso replication of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso shares several features with other zzso zzso although the presence of unusual zzso regions is also suggestive of molecular zzso that probably occurred before the differentiation of major zzso zzso Closer examination of gene boundaries also confirms previous observations on the presence of unusual start and stop zzso and suggests a role for zzso secondary structures as potential zzso signals involved in the maturation of the primary zzso zzso potentially involved in the regulation of zzso are present both in the zzso region and in other areas of the zzso Their position is similar to that observed in a limited number of insect species, suggesting unique zzso mechanisms for zzso and derived zzso zzso This initial description and characterization of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso will constitute the essential foundation prerequisite for investigations of the evolutionary history of one of the most zzso zzso zzso present in zzso and other localities of the Southern zzso
