To perform effectively as a molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso the assistance of its zzso zzso zzso partner, which efficiently stimulates its zzso weak zzso activity and zzso its interaction with zzso zzso In this study, we address the function of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso region of the zzso coli zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso region is critical for zzso zzso functions in zzso and that despite a significant degree of sequence conservation among the zzso regions of zzso zzso from bacteria, zzso or humans, functional zzso in the context of the zzso coli zzso is zzso Furthermore, we found that the deletion of the whole zzso region is mirrored by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso motif contained in this zzso Further genetic and zzso analyses revealed that this zzso acid zzso plays a critical role in regulation of the zzso zzso cycle, possibly by modulating a crucial step subsequent to zzso zzso zzso
