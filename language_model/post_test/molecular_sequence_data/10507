zzso zzso rates and zzso zzso relaxation times have been obtained at two magnetic fields zzso and zzso zzso and at a variety of temperatures for the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso In addition, zzso relaxation data have also been recorded at both zzso The zzso relaxation data have been interpreted using different zzso models to obtain zzso correlation zzso The results indicate that the zzso and zzso rings display more extensive local motion than the two inner zzso and Gal zzso since those present significantly shorter local correlation zzso The zzso relaxation parameters have been interpreted in terms of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, order parameters and internal motion correlation times have been zzso As obtained for the zzso relaxation data, the two outer zzso possess smaller order parameters than the two inner zzso Internal correlation times are in the order of 100 zzso The zzso groups have also different zzso with the zzso carbon on the zzso unit showing the highest zzso zzso dynamics simulations using a zzso system have also been performed and internal motion correlation functions have been deduced from these zzso Order parameters and zzso distances have been compared to those zzso from the zzso zzso The obtained results are in fair agreement with the experimental zzso
