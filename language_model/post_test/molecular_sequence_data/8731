The zzso zzso a major inherited risk factor for zzso consists of a low density zzso particle containing zzso zzso plus the distinguishing component zzso zzso Human zzso contains highly repeated zzso related to zzso zzso four plus single zzso five and zzso zzso zzso is virtually confined to zzso and the gene may have arisen during zzso zzso One exception is the occurrence of an zzso particle in the zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso gene shows that it is distinctive in form and evolutionary history from human zzso but that it has acquired several common zzso It appears that the zzso and zzso zzso genes evolved independently by zzso and modification of different zzso of the zzso zzso providing a novel type of zzso molecular zzso
