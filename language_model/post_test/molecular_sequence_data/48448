zzso salt zzso zzso active zzso strains zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso which triggers cholesterol consumption in liver to zzso new zzso leading to consequential cholesterol zzso zzso zzso salt zzso potential was the criterion to select zzso zzso zzso for this study and its gene zzso zzso was identified and zzso The resulting zzso sequence of zzso gene contained an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a predicted protein of 325 zzso acids with a theoretical zzso of zzso Moreover, deduced zzso protein had high similarity with the zzso of zzso zzso only and also exhibited significant similarity to the zzso V zzso of other zzso zzso Five zzso important zzso acids were highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso while four zzso acid motifs around these active sites, were not as consistent as in other zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso into zzso zzso and its expression was induced with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso using zzso column and characterized for zzso zzso pH and zzso The zzso zzso six major human zzso zzso with a slight preference towards zzso zzso zzso The optimum pH of zzso was six, and its zzso activity declined below pH 5 and above pH zzso The zzso was stable and functional even at 65 zzso while showed its maximum activity at 37 zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso may be a promising candidate zzso which may affect cholesterol metabolism in zzso
