A growing class of proteins in biological processes has been found to be unfolded on isolation under normal solution zzso We have used zzso zzso to characterize the structural and dynamic properties of the unfolded and partially folded states of a zzso zzso protein zzso at temperatures from -5 degrees C to 40 degrees zzso At 40 degrees C, zzso zzso in zzso adopt zzso and zzso angles, consistent with a significant ensemble population of zzso II zzso Analysis of relaxation rates in the protein reveals that a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 42, displays slow zzso dynamics at both -5 degrees C and 40 degrees zzso zzso chemical shift changes indicate that this region is the site of zzso zzso The remaining zzso zzso become increasingly dynamic as they extend from the nucleation zzso The C zzso remains dynamic and changes less with temperature, indicating it is relatively zzso zzso provides a high-resolution portrait of the unfolded state and the process of zzso nucleation and propagation in the absence of zzso zzso information that bears on early events in protein zzso
