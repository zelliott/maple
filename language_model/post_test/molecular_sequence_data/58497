zzso hormone plays a zzso role during zzso zzso and its effect is zzso by zzso hormone receptors zzso To investigate the function of zzso zzso we have recently developed a zzso hormone dependent in zzso zzso system by introducing zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso into zzso zzso Interestingly, using this system, we have found that the zzso cloned previously is defective in zzso zzso compared with zzso In zzso DNA binding experiments show that zzso zzso have drastically reduced affinity for a zzso hormone response zzso zzso zzso shows that two of the seven zzso acid zzso that differ between zzso and zzso are responsible for the zzso in zzso zzso These two zzso affect the DNA binding by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso formation with zzso is not affected as demonstrated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso By zzso and zzso DNA sequence analysis, we have demonstrated that the zzso which affect zzso function when zzso are identical between the wild type zzso and zzso Thus, our experiments have discovered the first zzso zzso zzso The DNA binding and zzso zzso functions of the zzso are discussed in relation to the recently published zzso crystal zzso
