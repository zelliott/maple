In the twelve zzso zzso group species zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso subgroups, the zzso DNA length ranges from zzso to zzso zzso This length zzso is mainly due to zzso in the variable region of the A + zzso zzso In addition, one species zzso zzso possess a tandem zzso of a zzso zzso that contains the replication zzso The same zzso has occurred at least twice in the zzso evolutionary history due to the fact that the repetition is analogous to repetitions found in the four species of the zzso zzso zzso By comparing the zzso sequence of the zzso region in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show the presence of a secondary structure, likely implied in the replication origin, which could favor the generation of this kind of zzso Finally, we propose that the high A and T content in the variable region of the A + zzso region favors the formation of zzso secondary structures, which could explain the generation of minor zzso found in this zzso
