A zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from wood falls in the South Sea, South Korea, and its zzso position was investigated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 25 zzso at pH zzso and in the absence of zzso A zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso clustered with the type strain of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso value of zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively and less than zzso to the type strains of other species used in the zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso and the mean zzso zzso value with zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso zzso zzso properties, together with the zzso and genetic zzso demonstrated that strain zzso was distinguishable from zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
