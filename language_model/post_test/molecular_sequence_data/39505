The zzso zzso gene in zzso coli is important for the decrease in cell size during stationary phase or sudden carbon zzso A zzso zzso strain zzso in a gene with zzso to zzso reduced its cell size upon carbon zzso and zzso had little effect on zzso zzso The zzso grew slower than the zzso strain in minimal medium with zzso as the sole nitrogen source, while growth rates were similar on a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis indicated that the zzso zzso is the second gene in an zzso where the two next zzso zzso putative proteins with zzso to zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was only obtained by plasmids zzso zzso as well as the above two zzso Growth zzso and gene zzso suggest that zzso proteins have different functions in zzso coli and zzso
