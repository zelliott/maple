The human zzso zzso gene was cloned from the region of the short arm of the human X found in duplicate in zzso zzso Y females zzso zzso et zzso 1994, Nature zzso zzso zzso is suggested to be required for zzso differentiation and to play an important role in zzso sex determination or differentiation zzso Its proposed zzso effect on sexual development suggests that zzso could represent an evolutionary link with an ancestral zzso mechanism that depended on the dosage of an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso could also represent the putative zzso switch zzso which independently controls sexual zzso in zzso zzso in an zzso manner zzso Cooper et zzso 1993, zzso zzso zzso zzso If zzso has a present role in zzso sexual differentiation or had an ancestral role in zzso sex determination, it would be expected to lie on the zzso X zzso despite the zzso zzso of other human zzso zzso We therefore cloned and mapped the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was located on zzso zzso zzso near other human zzso zzso indicating that it was originally zzso and that it is not involved in zzso zzso sex determination in an ancestral zzso nor in zzso sexual zzso
