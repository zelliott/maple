The zzso zzso of neuroendocrine cells, which contain large amounts of zzso and zzso have been demonstrated to release zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso indicating the zzso zzso zzso store role of zzso zzso In our previous study, zzso A zzso was shown to interact with several zzso zzso membrane zzso including the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To examine the functional aspect of this zzso we measured the zzso zzso release property of the zzso zzso into zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso zzso release from the zzso Moreover, the number of zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso energy transfer and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the structure of zzso zzso becomes more ordered and exposed in the presence of zzso suggesting that the coupled zzso in the zzso caused structural changes of the zzso changing it to a structure that is better suited to zzso binding and subsequent zzso zzso These results appear to underscore the zzso significance of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
