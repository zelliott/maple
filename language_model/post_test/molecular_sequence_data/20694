zzso the products of zzso zzso have recently emerged as fundamental regulators of zzso function in different zzso and, presumably, zzso zzso To date, a single form of zzso has been described in zzso and recently, in several fish species and zzso We report zzso the cloning and characterization of two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso sea zzso While zzso encodes a zzso identical to zzso zzso the predicted zzso zzso zzso at 4 zzso acids zzso Genome database searches showed that both genes are present in zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso mapping analyses suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso genes that originated by zzso of an ancestral zzso although zzso is lost in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are present in brain and zzso of sea zzso zzso and zzso Comparative functional studies demonstrated that zzso zzso was significantly more potent than zzso zzso in inducing zzso and zzso zzso in sea zzso In contrast, zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso in rats, whereas zzso zzso was zzso zzso Our data are the first to provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a second zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso whose product is likely to play a dominant zzso role in the regulation of the zzso axis at least in zzso
