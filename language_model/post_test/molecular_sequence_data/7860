The zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of small zzso zzso and growth regulatory factors, contains an zzso zzso gamma zzso consisting of an extended imperfect zzso In this report we show that a novel factor, gamma zzso which binds to the gamma zzso element, is rapidly activated in a variety of primary cell types and tumor cell lines treated with zzso Our data indicate that gamma zzso is present in a zzso form in zzso cells and its zzso activity is dependent upon zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that gamma zzso consists of at least two proteins of approximately 95 and 130 zzso which interact with the gamma zzso zzso A comparison of gamma zzso and zzso an zzso zzso factor containing the zzso alpha protein zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso showed that these two factors exhibited differences in zzso mobility, responsiveness to zzso and zzso of zzso Using zzso zzso however, we found that one or more zzso of gamma zzso are zzso related to zzso zzso Our results zzso therefore, that gamma zzso and zzso are distinct zzso zzso factors and probably contain closely related members of the zzso protein zzso
