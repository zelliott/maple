Several zzso mechanisms have been zzso to mediate zzso of different animal zzso including blocking of zzso to zzso induction of zzso changes in the virus coat, and zzso zzso We have studied the molecular requirements for zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso in zzso and protection against lethal disease in zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso generated from a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were able to neutralize zzso in zzso and to protect zzso zzso zzso zzso mice against lethal disease after intravenous injection of 50 zzso units zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso mice infected with immune complexes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were protected against lethal zzso however, mice infected with immune complexes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Although repeated zzso treatment reduced virus quantities in the blood, neither zzso nor zzso zzso mice were protected against lethal disease after passive zzso and subsequent zzso zzso This was due to the short zzso of 17 zzso of zzso in the zzso These data demonstrate that zzso of zzso and protection against lethal disease do not require zzso mechanisms and that zzso is not crucial for protection against zzso relevant virus doses in zzso
