The role of a mobile loop in zzso zzso has been investigated by mutating each zzso acid in the loop and zzso analyzing the effect that each zzso has on the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso at three of the nine positions in the loop, zzso zzso and zzso have been reported elsewhere zzso et zzso zzso First & zzso zzso In this paper, the kinetic analyses of zzso in the remaining six positions, as well as a zzso in which the entire loop is deleted, are zzso With the exception of zzso which zzso the zzso and zzso complexes by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, none of the remaining zzso acids appears to be directly involved in the zzso mechanism of the zzso Instead, zzso of these zzso results in small zzso in the stability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The precise zzso acid zzso which stabilize each state vary, suggesting that the loop adopts different zzso in each of the complexes with the most highly constrained zzso being in the zzso zzso zzso of the loop reveals that the net effect of the loop in zzso is zzso zzso to destabilize the zzso complex preceding formation of the zzso complex and zzso to stabilize the zzso complex, indicating that the involvement of the loop in zzso occurs at the expense of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
