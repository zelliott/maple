zzso is a mixture of linear zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso data and computer simulation studies have established that each zzso zzso chain is comprised of zzso of defined zzso representing ordered zzso One such ordered zzso is a zzso corresponding to zzso zzso III binding zzso Previous computer simulation studies, performed under the assumption that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a random zzso action pattern, suggested that certain of these ordered zzso zzso may themselves be zzso arranged in the zzso zzso The present work presents computer simulations of alternative action patterns for zzso zzso while assuming a random distribution of these zzso units within the zzso zzso We consider action patterns that are determined solely by the primary structure of the zzso zzso zzso of the simulations are compared to zzso the experimental zzso of product chains formed throughout the reaction and zzso the change in weight average molecular weight zzso as a function of reaction completion as determined by zzso at 232 zzso From the simulation of 60 action patterns for zzso zzso we zzso that one of the following statements concerning zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso is a random arrangement of a small number of structurally defined zzso zzso zzso zzso changes its action pattern during the zzso of zzso (perhaps influenced by the secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso contain clusters of zzso sequences that are present in low zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso has a specificity for zzso zzso linkages either zzso at the zzso zzso of a chain or zzso at the reducing side of these rare zzso zzso
