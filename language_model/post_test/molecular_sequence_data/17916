zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso has been studied in zzso solution and in zzso zzso using 500 zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso parameters indicates that in zzso solution, zzso exists as a random zzso On incorporation into zzso zzso the zzso adopts a rigid and well defined zzso The zzso end is stabilized by the zzso environment of the zzso zzso The zzso end is located near the zzso interface and attains rigidity due to interaction with the zzso groups of zzso The observations emphasize the role of environment in stabilizing significantly different zzso of zzso in three different zzso zzso and zzso zzso
