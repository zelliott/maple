The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso by coding for an zzso pump for zzso of zzso from cells of zzso zzso The zzso encodes three structural genes zzso zzso and zzso The zzso pump requires only two zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein exhibits zzso zzso activity and was demonstrated to bind zzso by zzso labeling with zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso gene suggests that the zzso protein contains two potential zzso binding zzso one in the zzso half and one in the zzso half of the zzso A combination of zzso and zzso zzso was used to alter the zzso region of the zzso putative zzso sequence zzso Four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso bearing the zzso plasmids were all zzso sensitive and were unable to zzso zzso Each zzso zzso protein lacked zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso sequence is part of a zzso domain required for zzso
