The primary sequence of the zzso protein zzso contains multiple repeats of the sequence zzso the consensus sequence for the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso When zzso by zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso was found to incorporate up to zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso focusing of the zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of five distinct peptides with zzso values of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by high performance liquid zzso techniques demonstrated three distinct zzso Data from gas phase sequencing, zzso acid analysis, and zzso acid analysis suggest that zzso protein zzso zzso zzso at four zzso Each site demonstrates the presence of a zzso zzso on the zzso side of the zzso zzso Two zzso sites are located adjacent to the zzso zzso domain that has been found to be required for the in zzso zzso of zzso protein to zzso Two other putative zzso sites are located within the identified zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these sites altered the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso protein zzso is multiply zzso in Alzheimer's disease, and zzso zzso is similarly reduced in zzso zzso and enhanced after zzso zzso at one or more of these sites may correlate with zzso zzso sites in zzso protein in Alzheimer's zzso
