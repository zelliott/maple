The zzso DNA region of the zzso zzso flanked by the genes zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso for seven species of the grass family zzso This region had previously been observed as a hotspot area for length zzso zzso comparison reveals that short zzso probably resulting from zzso zzso account for many small length differences between sequences but that major zzso hotspots are localized in three small areas, two of which show potential secondary zzso zzso in one of these hotspots appears to be a result of more complex zzso zzso All seven species contain a zzso for zzso and evidence is presented that this zzso is being maintained by gene conversion with the functional zzso Different zzso biases and AT contents between the zzso and the surrounding zzso sequences are zzso In the zzso zzso there is a deletion in which almost 1 zzso of ancestral zzso including the 3' end of the zzso zzso has been replaced by a zzso zzso sequence of unknown zzso Two other deletions of almost the same region have occurred in the grass zzso The deleted zzso region has zzso and compositional properties similar to the zzso coding sequence and the zzso zzso The three independent zzso as well as the pattern of zzso in the localized zzso indicate that such zzso DNA may be misleading for studies of zzso zzso
