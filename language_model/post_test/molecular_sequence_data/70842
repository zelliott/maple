Up to zzso of zzso zzso zzso grain zzso is stored in the form of zzso in the zzso Our objective is to determine the control of zzso zzso during zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been previously characterized zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso In the present work, zzso zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso library and two distinct zzso zzso I and zzso II, were isolated and zzso The transcribed sequences of these two genes presented a strong zzso whereas the zzso upstream and downstream sequences appeared very zzso Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso showed a high zzso of zzso zzso at the early steps of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was also detected at a lower extent in the zzso In adult plants, northern zzso analyses revealed low but significant levels of zzso zzso in the zzso In zzso zzso on root zzso localized zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso at the same sites as its zzso A zzso approach was used in an attempt to discriminate between the transcripts from each gene in the different zzso These experiments indicate that both genes are expressed during zzso whereas only zzso I is expressed in adult zzso This suggests that signals responsible for zzso gene expression in roots are different from those responsible for gene expression during zzso
