A characteristic of the zzso response is the zzso of wall proteins possibly through the formation of zzso zzso and the subsequent barrier formation against zzso A requirement for this is the generation of active oxygen species, particularly hydrogen zzso In the present work, we examine in depth the requirement for zzso and the specificity of the zzso with respect to particular wall zzso zzso wall proteins were zzso for zzso content and the subset of proteins with this zzso modification was found to be zzso About 50 proteins were found to be easily zzso and in response to zzso treatment about 5 were found to be specifically zzso zzso was very rapid and completed within 15 zzso after zzso and dependent upon the type of zzso and the intensity of the production of active oxygen zzso zzso sequencing and zzso acid analysis revealed that, apart from one zzso all zzso proteins were zzso zzso with zzso zzso side zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were not zzso zzso protein sequencing revealed the zzso zzso to be novel, but both zzso and zzso zzso of these findings for both zzso and symbiotic processes are also zzso
