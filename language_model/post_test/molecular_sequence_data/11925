zzso checkpoint control genes were found to affect processing of DNA damage as well as cell cycle zzso An zzso that measures DNA damage processing in zzso showed that the checkpoint genes zzso zzso and zzso activated an zzso that degrades zzso The degradation is probably a direct consequence of checkpoint protein function, because zzso encodes a putative zzso DNA zzso Another checkpoint zzso zzso had a different zzso It inhibited the degradation by zzso zzso and zzso A model of how processing of DNA damage may be linked to both DNA repair and cell cycle arrest is zzso
