To investigate the association between the zzso of the zzso zzso gene and zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Three hundred and zzso patients with zzso and 218 healthy control subjects were detected by zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso length zzso The serum zzso B2 zzso in all subjects was detected with zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso group and control group were in zzso equilibrium zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso group while they were zzso and zzso in zzso There was significant difference in zzso of the zzso zzso and T zzso but no difference in zzso of zzso zzso between controls and zzso zzso There was significant difference in serum zzso level between the zzso and control group zzso and between individuals of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The serum zzso level in the zzso cases with zzso zzso was increased compared with that of other zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso and T zzso of zzso zzso gene might be risk factors of zzso in zzso population in zzso which might result from the increased serum zzso zzso
