zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso that zzso the degradation of toxic zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the presence of a zzso gene family zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso All the genes identified zzso to zzso have been cloned and zzso and shown to zzso potentially functional zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data revealed a considerable molecular zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, was active and its structure obtained by zzso modeling using X-ray crystal structures of zzso exhibited the typical fold of zzso zzso zzso studies including 110 other zzso zzso and closely related zzso zzso zzso sequences showed that the zzso zzso zzso form a zzso group and have all been acquired by the same event of horizontal gene zzso It also revealed a zzso within the zzso zzso zzso sequences that could be explained by an ancestral sod gene zzso followed by subsequent gene zzso within each of the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity indicated the presence of two zzso activities in zzso zzso cell zzso whereas zzso and zzso were not zzso These activities contrasted with the zzso repertoire previously characterized in zzso zzso To explain these differences, a hypothetical evolutionary scenario is proposed that suggests gains and losses of sod genes in zzso
