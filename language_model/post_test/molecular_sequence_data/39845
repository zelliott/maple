zzso is a zzso member of the zzso zzso of zzso family, but its molecular interactions in protection from cell death and regulation of cell division have not been completely zzso In a zzso screening to identify novel zzso partners, we found that the zzso hydrocarbon zzso protein zzso directly associates with zzso in zzso and in zzso experiments in zzso This interaction is zzso by the zzso end of zzso which contains three zzso zzso and involves the zzso zzso coiled zzso in zzso with critical roles of zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso lacking only zzso fails to bind zzso and exhibits accelerated degradation in zzso in a reaction reversed by a zzso zzso Acute zzso of zzso by short interference zzso or competition of the zzso complex by zzso mimicry zzso zzso levels in cells, with enhanced zzso but no changes in cell cycle zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso stability, thus zzso a cellular zzso zzso The zzso complex may influence the cellular zzso response to environmental zzso and contribute to zzso zzso trafficking during cell death zzso
