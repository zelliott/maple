The freshwater tropical snail zzso zzso is an intermediate host for zzso zzso the zzso agent of human zzso zzso and strains differ in their zzso to zzso zzso Changes in gene expression in response to zzso infection have been simultaneously examined in a susceptible strain zzso and a resistant strain zzso using a newly developed zzso differential display zzso Such zzso profiling techniques allow the examination of changes in gene expression in response to zzso infection, without requiring previous sequence knowledge, or selecting candidate genes that may be involved in the complex neuroendocrine or zzso systems of the zzso Thus, novel genes may be zzso Ten transcripts were initially identified, present only in the profiles derived from snails of the resistant strain when exposed to zzso The differential expression of five of these zzso including zzso and several novel transcripts with one containing at least two zzso zzso has been confirmed by zzso zzso
