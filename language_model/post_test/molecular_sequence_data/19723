Type I zzso receptors mediate the action of the members of the long chain zzso zzso involved in numerous zzso zzso Here we report a novel zzso zzso termed Japanese zzso zzso 130 zzso or zzso exhibiting the unique type I zzso zzso motifs zzso having a zzso binding domain zzso containing two pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso three zzso zzso all in the zzso zzso It is also composed of the zzso binding zzso Box 1 and Box 2, and a zzso 3 binding motif zzso 3) in the zzso region suggesting its zzso role for zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso is about zzso zzso 801 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso and its gene has an zzso zzso While zzso shows significant zzso with the members of zzso zzso zzso family including zzso (or zzso zzso (or zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso structural and zzso analysis of its protein revealed that it is a novel and an ancestral zzso zzso found in zzso zzso gene is zzso expressed in Japanese zzso zzso and in a natural zzso zzso cell line showing its critical role in zzso zzso functions similar to zzso in higher zzso High expression of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso and, in zzso and zzso cell line suggest its role in immune responses, and zzso zzso In zzso stimulation of zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso is zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso suggesting an apparent control of the zzso expression during zzso zzso zzso
