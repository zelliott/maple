The skin zzso zzso is an important zzso in the zzso immune system of zzso zzso However, the transport mechanism associated with this zzso has yet to be zzso In this study, we isolated a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso from a species of zzso fish, zzso zzso zzso This gene is known to be an zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso Our studies further demonstrated that zzso zzso was expressed in the skin and that a zzso of zzso bound to zzso zzso in the skin zzso These results indicate that the skin zzso zzso zzso zzso into the skin zzso The zzso zzso exhibits a unique structure containing only two zzso zzso corresponding to domain 1 and domain zzso of zzso zzso This structure was sufficient for successful binding to zzso zzso zzso skin thus adopts the same zzso transport system as zzso zzso via a unique zzso
