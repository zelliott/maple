We cloned the products of zzso chain reaction of the zzso DNA of potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and isolated 35 zzso which represent copies of eight genes zzso zzso type C zzso Their zzso sequences were zzso All the genes were found for the first time and designated as zzso The gene zzso which we had earlier presumed to zzso the zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso zzso and then expressed in zzso coli zzso The zzso protein zzso underwent spontaneous folding and transformation into a soluble zzso We zzso it to zzso by affinity zzso The zzso protein efficiently inhibited zzso zzso activity and did not act on zzso zzso or zzso
