An zzso B zzso was previously zzso to zzso from rat zzso extracts and zzso In the present work, by using zzso selected on the basis of partial zzso acid zzso of pure zzso and zzso techniques, the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso to a zzso protein zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso signature, which allowed its zzso as a member of the zzso family of zzso It exhibits zzso identity and zzso similarity with zzso zzso a relation further supported by the capacity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Both zzso also were closely related to a partially zzso protein from zzso zzso which might constitute the putative common zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso and its zzso were detected in the germ line and in the zzso and zzso cells of the zzso zzso Because the zzso was found in the medium zzso by zzso and zzso and in the zzso during zzso formation, together these observations suggested an involvement of this zzso in the zzso zzso It is concluded that this ubiquitous zzso may be involved in multiple processing zzso
