Previous studies have suggested that a group of structurally and zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso as the preferred zzso and show zzso zzso activity towards zzso zzso may be important for the defense of cells against zzso zzso In present studies we have zzso and characterized zzso zzso of bovine pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of these studies indicate that zzso cells express relatively high amounts of a zzso zzso which zzso zzso as the preferred zzso This zzso zzso zzso to zzso from zzso cells showed remarkably high specific activity towards zzso zzso zzso zzso and had similar zzso zzso and structural characteristics as reported for mouse zzso zzso and other zzso zzso of this zzso Since the zzso cells are exposed to constant zzso stress, we suggest that this zzso zzso may be important for the defense of these cells against zzso zzso
