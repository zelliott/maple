zzso zzso (AP) is zzso into the medium when the zzso 25 zzso acids are replaced by the 60 zzso acid zzso signal zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fusion protein is dependent on zzso and zzso but independent of zzso and zzso The efficiency of zzso by zzso is decreased when zzso carries its own zzso signal zzso zzso of this fusion protein into the zzso is not observed even in the absence of zzso The failure of the zzso export machinery to transport the latter protein into the zzso seems to be due in part to the loss of the zzso sequence of zzso since even zzso derivatives which do not carry the zzso signal zzso but lack the 25 zzso zzso acids of zzso are localized in the membrane but not zzso into the zzso
