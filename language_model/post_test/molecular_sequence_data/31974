zzso is an zzso protein to enhance the zzso process by preventing the formation of the zzso complex, thus freeing zzso to trigger the zzso zzso Here, we presented the full-length sequence of zzso from the black tiger shrimp zzso The full-length zzso transcript was zzso zzso with a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids and contains 5 zzso zzso zzso a zzso targeting signal zzso a zzso zzso domain, an zzso motif zzso a zzso zzso domain, and a zzso domain normally found in zzso proteins of other zzso The mature form of zzso was cloned into the zzso and zzso zzso and the expression of the protein was compared in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Greater quantities of stable and soluble zzso were expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the expression of zzso in shrimp, the crude proteins from several shrimp zzso were zzso by Western zzso using the zzso zzso specific to the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso immature zzso protein could be detected in shrimp zzso from the zzso and the zzso This study is the first to report the full-length zzso zzso which is functional in black tiger shrimp and will lead to more focused studies on the function of zzso in zzso regulation during immune responses to viral infection in zzso
