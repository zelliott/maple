The structural basis for induction of the mercury resistance zzso with zzso mercury and with the zzso compound zzso zzso was addressed by DNA sequencing analysis and by zzso fusion zzso experiments regulated by zzso in trans from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso fusion results were compared with those from a zzso zzso responding but not zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso deleted at the 3' zzso The zzso sequence of the beginning region of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was determined, including that of the zzso zzso the zzso region, the zzso and zzso zzso and the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of this sequence with DNA sequences of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that a major difference occurred in the 3' 29 base pairs of the zzso zzso resulting in unrelated zzso 10 zzso zzso A hybrid zzso zzso consisting of the zzso gene from zzso a hybrid zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and lacking the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso This shows that zzso zzso is not needed for induction by zzso zzso A zzso form of zzso zzso missing the zzso 17 zzso acids responded to zzso zzso but not to zzso Thus, the zzso region of the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the recognition of zzso
