zzso domain zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso clip zzso is a new zzso zzso family identified mainly in zzso and plays important roles in development and zzso In the present study, the full-length zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was cloned from Chinese zzso crab zzso zzso by expressed sequence tags zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso region zzso of 54 zzso and a zzso of 174 zzso Multiple sequence alignment presented twelve zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso critical for the fundamental structure and function of zzso Two types of zzso zzso the clip domain and zzso domain, were identified in the deduced zzso acids sequence of zzso The conservation characteristics and similarities with previously known zzso indicated that zzso was a member of the large zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in different zzso and the zzso expression in zzso challenged by zzso zzso were measured by real-time zzso zzso zzso transcripts could be detected in all examined zzso and were higher expressed in muscle than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso expression in zzso was zzso after zzso zzso challenge and peaked at 2 h zzso fold, P zzso zzso and 12 h zzso fold, P zzso zzso Its expression pattern was similar to zzso zzso one of the components of crab zzso system found in our previous zzso These results implied that zzso was involved in the processes of zzso interaction probably as one of the zzso system zzso
