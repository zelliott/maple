This study has examined the abilities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso selective for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to block zzso caused by intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso guinea zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to cause, at a zzso tolerated dose of 9 zzso an approximate zzso rightward shift of the zzso zzso for selective zzso zzso substance P zzso zzso and zzso without altering responses to selective zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso caused zzso rightward shifts of the zzso zzso for the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso using combinations of the zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso could cause zzso by acting on the zzso receptors at large doses relative to those used without zzso Of the zzso used here, zzso appeared to be the most selective for the zzso zzso When used alone, only zzso was found to block zzso caused by zzso zzso (after blockade of zzso receptors by zzso and zzso When zzso was also given, larger additional blockade was seen with zzso than with zzso or zzso as zzso zzso zzso caused small and variable degrees of blockade of zzso and zzso but not of zzso after combinations of the two zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
