zzso that contain the zzso domain constitute a new zzso family zzso Members of this family have predominantly been identified in microbes found in the human gut and oral zzso The crystal structure of one member of this family, zzso from zzso zzso has been determined, revealing a zzso inhibitor zzso structure with a tandem repeat of zzso zzso analysis and structural comparisons reveal that zzso and other zzso proteins are related to zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso proteins and hence are likely to function as zzso zzso
