Species differences among membrane zzso can be remarkable and difficult to properly assess by conventional zzso zzso we employed the first use of stable isotope labeling in zzso or stable zzso peptides combined with mass zzso to identify species differences in sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression in liver tissue and to characterize the zzso of protein expression in zzso human zzso and rat zzso zzso The lower limit of zzso was established to be 5 zzso on column with a standard curve that was linear up to 2000 zzso The accuracy and precision were evaluated with three quality control samples and known amounts of synthetic zzso peptides that were spiked into the membrane protein zzso The overall relative error and zzso of variation were less than zzso The expression of zzso in mouse and rat was significant higher than that in human zzso and monkey zzso and ranked as mouse zzso rat zzso monkey zzso zzso In the cultured zzso although significant zzso of zzso expression in zzso at day 5 after the culture was zzso zzso expression in zzso was comparable to the suspension zzso The results suggested that zzso zzso in cultured zzso is species zzso
