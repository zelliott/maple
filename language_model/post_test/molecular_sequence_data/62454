zzso is a zzso factor essential for the development of zzso zzso zzso In search for regulatory mechanisms of zzso function, we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an interaction partner of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso cells, and their interaction is demonstrated through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso results in a potent repression of zzso zzso zzso of an artificial zzso response element zzso reporter as well as of a reporter driven by the native zzso zzso zzso We identified two consensus zzso sites in zzso The substitution of zzso 91 by zzso in one zzso site enhanced the zzso activity of zzso whereas the substitution of zzso 577 by zzso in the second zzso site decreased zzso activity of zzso Interestingly, zzso repression of zzso activity does not require the two zzso sites, because each zzso is zzso as efficiently as the wild type zzso In addition, the zzso do not alter zzso nuclear zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso and zzso co-exist in several zzso of the zzso central nervous system by demonstrating the zzso of zzso protein and zzso zzso in the same zzso In conclusion, our studies identified zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso and suggest that this interaction may have a zzso role in regulating the expression of zzso target zzso
