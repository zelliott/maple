By using zzso zzso and the conventional B zzso zzso technique, we have established two novel zzso cell lines zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso to zzso termed as zzso and zzso zzso The two cell lines were then subjected to zzso extraction and the zzso and zzso segments were obtained by reverse zzso of zzso followed by zzso chain reaction zzso and characterized by zzso sequence zzso The zzso segments of zzso and zzso belong to the zzso family and the zzso segments of zzso and zzso belong to zzso and zzso groups, zzso The two zzso zzso different zzso segments and have disparities in their zzso regions, which may contribute to the different zzso recognition of the two zzso
