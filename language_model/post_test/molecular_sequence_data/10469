The genetic linkages of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene and the zzso small eye zzso with the zzso gene has demonstrated the importance of zzso class zzso genes in the development of the zzso zzso Previously, we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso whose expression in the adult goldfish zzso is restricted to the inner nuclear layer zzso and to zzso zzso zzso cells in the growth zone at the retinal peripheral margin, where zzso continues throughout zzso Here, we report the molecular cloning and expression pattern of a new zzso class zzso zzso zzso in the adult goldfish zzso Like zzso zzso expression is highly restricted to the zzso in the adult goldfish and zzso with zzso expression in the mature zzso At the peripheral margin, zzso is expressed in zzso active zzso zzso and is zzso as these cells become zzso and begin to zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reveal a zzso zzso and a unique domain termed the zzso zzso The similarities of the zzso zzso and zzso expression patterns suggest that genes containing the zzso domain have zzso functions during retinal development in zzso
