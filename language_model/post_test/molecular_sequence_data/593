When the organic zzso zzso zzso was first identified as zzso zzso zzso You G, Bush zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it was argued that it, together with zzso may be part of a larger zzso (now known as zzso involved in organic zzso and zzso zzso The least studied among zzso zzso are the so-called unknown zzso zzso zzso Here, five novel genes located in a cluster on mouse zzso 19, immediately between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified as zzso of human zzso These genes display preferential expression in liver and zzso and one zzso zzso has several zzso zzso with differential tissue expression and embryonic zzso Along with zzso zzso and zzso these zzso define the largest known cluster of zzso zzso zzso Given the established functions of zzso these genes may also be involved in organic zzso zzso zzso have characteristic motifs and share a signature zzso in the possible active site of zzso domain 7, a zzso positively charged, zzso acid, zzso possibly a site for interaction with organic zzso In certain species, zzso and zzso appeared to be highly zzso whereas the zzso part of this cluster appeared to undergo repeated zzso amplification, suggesting strong environmental selection pressure, and perhaps providing an explanation for copy number variation in the human zzso One zzso amplification in mouse appears to be zzso This cluster may be zzso regulated and under selective pressure in a zzso zzso
