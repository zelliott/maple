The zzso coating zzso zzso zzso protein zzso family forms a complex of nine elements that are specifically zzso under zzso control and zzso by the zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso We report here the cloning and sequencing of an zzso pair full-length zzso zzso zzso one of the elements of the zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso analysis of zzso total zzso DNA revealed a complex band pattern, suggesting that zzso are zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame of 516 zzso starting at an zzso zzso encodes a protein precursor of zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso zzso zzso The corresponding mature form of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been identified as the element zzso IV, and presents significant similarities to the different members of the large zzso protein zzso and especially to mouse zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins that share a common basic framework for the transport of small zzso molecules like zzso thus suggesting that zzso could be such zzso into the zzso fluid during the zzso zzso
