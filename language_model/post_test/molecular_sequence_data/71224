The gating characteristics of two zzso channels in the zzso zzso channel zzso were compared at the single-channel zzso The strong inward zzso zzso zzso zzso opened and closed with zzso that were slow relative to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At a membrane potential of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso had zzso zzso zzso with mean open times of 279 zzso 58 zzso zzso zzso 4) for zzso and 23 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 7) for zzso At zzso zzso (and no zzso zzso had two closed times: zzso zzso zzso and 36 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso Under the same conditions, zzso exhibited four discrete closed states with mean closed times of zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso 99 zzso 19 zzso and zzso zzso 640 zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the open and the three shortest zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso with membrane zzso zzso open probability zzso decreased sharply with zzso due to an increase in the frequency of long closed events that were attributable to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso eliminated the zzso zzso distribution of zzso and blunted the zzso fall in open zzso In contrast, zzso had shorter open and closed times and only two closed states, and its zzso was less affected by zzso zzso channels were constructed to address the question of which parts of the molecules were responsible for the differences in zzso The property of multiple closed states was zzso by the second zzso domain zzso of zzso The zzso open and closed states, including the higher sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso correlated with the zzso loop of zzso including the zzso Channel zzso were essentially unaffected by the zzso and zzso The data of the present study are consistent with the idea that the locus of gating is near the outer mouth of the zzso
