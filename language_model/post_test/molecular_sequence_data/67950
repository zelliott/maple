Three of the most important zzso pathogens of zzso are zzso zzso the cause of tan spot on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the cause of spot form and net form of net zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso regions were used to examine the genetic relationships and divergence times between these zzso Mean divergence times were calculated at zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso from both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Individual zzso regions showed a consistent pattern of zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso with the pattern supported by zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso in calculated divergence times between individual zzso regions suggested that they are not entirely under neutral selection, a phenomenon shared with higher zzso zzso zzso regions varied in divergence time approximately zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso compared to the separation of wheat and barley some 12 zzso while the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso to the middle zzso The data suggest there is no correlation between the divergence of these pathogens the zzso of wheat and zzso and show zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are closely related but zzso The results are discussed in the context of zzso and the evolution of zzso zzso
