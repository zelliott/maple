Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence of binding of zzso zzso and zzso to the insulin promoter in living zzso were zzso All four factors were shown to bind to the mouse insulin 2 promoter in a cyclical manner with a zzso of approximately zzso zzso The cyclical binding of zzso zzso and zzso was largely unaffected by the zzso or insulin concentration in the zzso However, the binding and cycling of zzso was markedly abolished in low zzso (1 zzso and this was reversed in the presence of low zzso of zzso
