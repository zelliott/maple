Gene zzso and domain zzso are thought to be the major mechanisms for the emergence of novel genes during zzso Such events are thought to have occurred at early stages in the zzso zzso but zzso sequencing has recently revealed extensive amplification events during the evolution of higher zzso We report here that the zzso zzso zzso is derived from the zzso fusion of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an zzso highly zzso zzso whereas zzso is derived from a recent zzso duplication, which is absent in most other zzso and shows rapid amplification and zzso through the zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso exists only in the zzso lineage of zzso This zzso zzso arose as recently as zzso million years ago, after proliferation of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast to the broad expression pattern of zzso and zzso expression of zzso is zzso a pattern proposed for novel genes implicated in the emergence of zzso zzso The sudden emergence of zzso zzso such as that zzso by zzso may have contributed to zzso zzso
