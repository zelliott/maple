Using a new zzso method and chemically induced rat zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene designated zzso that zzso a zzso zzso The predicted protein was similar to the bovine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the liver and zzso and its gene expression was zzso in the zzso liver as well as in zzso zzso Interestingly, it was demonstrated in various zzso cells that zzso was localized in regions surrounding the zzso where zzso were not zzso Moreover, its zzso zzso was evident in the zzso but not in the zzso phase of the cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was dependent on zzso and zzso expressed zzso was seen at zzso even in zzso which do not exhibit a typical zzso pattern of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso became invisible by zzso treatment, whereas the zzso zzso pattern was not affected by zzso In zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso indicated that zzso bound to zzso directly and that its zzso ability was dependent on the zzso basic domain of the zzso These results suggest that, different from early predictions based on its primary structure, zzso has a zzso and zzso function that may be independent of zzso zzso
