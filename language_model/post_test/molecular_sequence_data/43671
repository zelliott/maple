zzso zzso are zzso assembled from two types of zzso chain which provide the zzso with different zzso zzso chains zzso the first step in iron storage, the zzso of zzso zzso chains promote the nucleation of the mineral zzso enabling storage of zzso inside the protein zzso We report here the comparison of the three-dimensional structures of zzso human H chain zzso and horse L chain zzso zzso zzso which have been refined at zzso A zzso There is zzso sequence identity between these zzso and the two structures are very similar, the H and L zzso zzso zzso to within zzso A zzso zzso with 41 water molecules in zzso Nevertheless, there are significant important differences which can be related to differences in zzso In particular, the zzso of the zzso zzso contain distinctive groups of zzso zzso which have been associated with zzso activity in H chains and enhanced stability in L zzso L chains contain a group of zzso associated with zzso within the iron storage cavity of the zzso
