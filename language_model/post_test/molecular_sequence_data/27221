zzso VI is the only known molecular motor that moves toward the minus ends of zzso zzso thus, it plays unique roles in diverse cellular zzso The zzso walking of zzso VI on zzso filaments requires zzso of the zzso but the protein can also function as a zzso zzso The molecular mechanism governing the zzso conversion is not zzso We report the high-resolution zzso structure of the zzso zzso VI zzso domain zzso and show that it is a stable zzso in zzso The zzso VI zzso binds to a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a high zzso and the X-ray structure of the zzso VI zzso in complex with zzso reveals that the motor zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso may represent a general paradigm for the regulation of zzso for zzso VI as well as other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso
