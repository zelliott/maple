The expression of zzso 5 S zzso genes in zzso is examined as a basis for further studies on the control, structure, and function of the zzso 5 S zzso zzso single base zzso zzso positions 98 or zzso or short insertions can result in substantial structural changes that can easily be detected by gel zzso and permit the zzso of zzso zzso synthesis and zzso In addition, the use of high and low copy shuttle zzso as well as alternate growth conditions permits the adjustment of zzso zzso levels in zzso Despite the high zzso copy number for the 5 S zzso zzso under zzso conditions as much as zzso of the cellular 5 S zzso can be zzso and zzso structure analyses indicate that some of these zzso can readily be assembled into the zzso structure resulting in an in zzso zzso population which is also approximately zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso integrated 5 S zzso genes are zzso expressed and suggest that additional features of the zzso structure regulate 5 S zzso gene expression in zzso
