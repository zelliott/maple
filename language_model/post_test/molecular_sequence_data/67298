Bread zzso one of the world's staple food crops, has the largest, highly repetitive and zzso zzso among the cereal zzso The wheat zzso holds the key to crop genetic improvement against challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, and water zzso To unravel the complex wheat zzso the International Wheat Genome zzso zzso zzso is pursuing a zzso and zzso zzso approach to physical mapping and zzso Here we report on the use of a zzso library made from zzso zzso zzso 3A short arm zzso for marker development and analysis of sequence composition and comparative evolution of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso random zzso from a zzso arm zzso library zzso generated zzso of high quality sequence from zzso zzso with an average length of zzso The sequence represents zzso of zzso with an average DNA sequence read every zzso Overall, zzso of the sequence consisted of repetitive zzso zzso as coding regions zzso zzso zzso and another zzso of unknown zzso Comparative sequence analysis suggested that zzso of the genes present in both 3A and zzso were zzso with model zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most abundant repeat and was significantly more frequent in 3A compared to zzso zzso zzso Twenty novel repetitive sequences were also identified using de zzso repeat zzso zzso were screened to identify simple sequence repeats zzso and zzso element zzso A total of zzso zzso were identified with a density of one per zzso and zzso junctions between zzso elements zzso and other sequences were identified with a density of one per zzso With the objective of enhancing the marker density of zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully designed from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Site Based zzso zzso Of the 96 zzso primer pairs tested, 28 zzso were zzso and compared to 17 zzso for 96 zzso 

This work reports on the use of wheat zzso arm zzso zzso library for the targeted generation of sequence data from a particular region of the huge zzso of zzso A large quantity of sequences were generated from the A zzso of zzso wheat for comparative zzso analysis with zzso B and D zzso and other model grass zzso Hundreds of molecular markers were developed from the zzso zzso zzso these and other sequences will be useful in gene discovery and physical zzso
