zzso 105 in the third zzso zzso of the zzso hormone zzso zzso occupies a position equivalent to a zzso zzso charged zzso in receptors for zzso zzso where it acts as zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso levels of response to zzso in zzso expressing zzso zzso were indistinguishable from those of zzso expressing receptors zzso to zzso zzso or zzso in position zzso However, the zzso values for zzso of zzso responses increased more than 500 times in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso group of zzso has been removed by zzso zzso zzso effects do not seem to be involved in the huge effect of mutating zzso to zzso since zzso of zzso to zzso zzso only a zzso increase in zzso Furthermore, no change in zzso is observed after zzso of zzso to zzso The affinity shift zzso by changes in zzso values for systems of comparable zzso in zzso zzso receptors was partially recovered in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso These results and those obtained after substitution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso suggest that the presence and the correct position of the zzso hydrogen zzso zzso group are important for normal functionality of the zzso In wild type or zzso zzso receptors showing the same zzso responses, decreases in affinity with zzso and zzso correlated with increased zzso rates of hormone from the zzso Rapid dilution experiments following zzso stimulation indicate that the zzso is converted rapidly from a form showing fast zzso zzso to a form from which the hormone zzso zzso zzso of zzso 105 zzso the zzso shift between these two zzso This effect was demonstrated in a direct way by comparing zzso zzso rates in zzso cells zzso with either wild type or zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso located in zzso zzso III positions equivalent to those of the zzso for zzso zzso regulate zzso interactions in the zzso zzso (and perhaps other zzso Furthermore, the nature of the zzso acid in these positions may also play a role, directly or zzso in zzso changes leading to zzso zzso and hence to signal zzso
