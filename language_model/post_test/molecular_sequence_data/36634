zzso DNA clones coding for chicken zzso were isolated from retinal pigmented zzso of chicken zzso zzso analysis shows that one of the zzso clones consisting of zzso zzso has an open reading frame coding for 529 zzso zzso The deduced protein has nine zzso sites and a zzso zzso A sequence comparison of the deduced chicken zzso with the mouse and human zzso revealed that zzso acid sequences are zzso for the entire zzso zzso percent and zzso of zzso acids in the chicken sequence are identical to that of the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso neighboring the zzso zzso sites and the zzso are well zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a major transcript of zzso zzso is detected in retinal pigmented zzso of a zzso chicken zzso
