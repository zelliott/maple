There is a continuing search for improved insulin zzso in order to imitate as closely as possible the zzso pattern of insulin zzso and thereby to zzso the complications of diabetes zzso The major advances achieved to date are in the area of human insulin analogue synthesis resulting from the introduction of zzso DNA techniques, and in improved delivery systems that zzso zzso or minimally invasive modes of zzso To accommodate zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso have been developed, of which insulin zzso (the zzso zzso is already approved for clinical zzso These zzso have a rapid rate of zzso and, therefore, have to be administered at meal time (unlike the previous zzso zzso Their residence time is also about zzso shorter than regular human zzso this zzso the risk of the excessive zzso effect that zzso regular human insulin zzso Certain zzso zzso with zzso activity have been developed but were found to be poorly zzso The newer zzso molecules do not show zzso zzso In order to generate zzso insulin levels, zzso zzso zzso have been developed, zzso a soluble zzso (which upon subcutaneous administration, produces a zzso sustained release zzso zzso insulin and zzso zzso zzso To improve patient compliance the zzso device was developed for subcutaneous zzso zzso infusion pumps were developed to avoid repetitive subcutaneous zzso Great efforts have been made in searching for zzso modes of insulin administration that will avoid the need for zzso zzso These include: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso routes of zzso Various enhancers have been tested to increase the zzso of each zzso At present these alternative routes do not provide clinically relevant zzso for the subcutaneous mode of zzso In conclusion, although the newer zzso provide certain advantages, there is still much to be done to further facilitate and improve insulin zzso
