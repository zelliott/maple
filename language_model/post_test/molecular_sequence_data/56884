In recent years, the synthetic analogue zzso has been used successfully in the treatment of zzso During an investigation of synthetic strategies for the production of zzso a number of zzso products were zzso These could be zzso by liquid zzso and were shown to have identical zzso acid zzso Investigation by fast atom zzso zzso revealed three of the peptides to have a common zzso zzso but notably dissimilar fragmentation zzso Further studies involving chemical zzso mass zzso and zzso separation showed these products to be novel zzso zzso with an zzso bond between either the zzso or the zzso zzso and the side chain of zzso zzso
