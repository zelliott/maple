A novel subset of T cells characterized by the expression of an zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso by V alpha zzso alpha Q gene segments was investigated in patients with systemic sclerosis zzso zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the V alpha 24 zzso repertoire was selectively used in zzso zzso T cells both in patients and in healthy individuals, while almost all families of zzso V alpha were expressed in zzso T cell zzso The V alpha zzso zzso T cells were increased by approximately fivefold in zzso However, sequence analysis clearly showed significant differences in the V alpha 24 zzso repertoire dominating in patients and healthy zzso In healthy individuals, the zzso V alpha zzso alpha Q was expanded and comprised zzso of the total zzso while their selective reduction was observed in zzso patients who also showed expansion of zzso V alpha 24 zzso other than V alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso to zzso zzso V alpha zzso alpha 281 zzso these results suggest that T cells with zzso V alpha zzso alpha Q zzso would function as regulatory T cells, whereas T cells bearing other zzso V alpha 24 zzso in zzso patients could be zzso T cells in zzso
