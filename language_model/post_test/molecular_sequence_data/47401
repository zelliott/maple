zzso complex or zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which specifically targets zzso regulatory factors such as zzso and zzso zzso Identification of the zzso of zzso complex zzso in several species revealed the highly zzso composition of zzso from zzso to zzso It has been reported, however, that zzso zzso is composed of at least eight zzso zzso to zzso while budding zzso zzso is constituted of at least 12 zzso zzso to zzso It has not yet been clearly understood whether additional components found in budding zzso zzso to zzso are actually composed of zzso zzso Here we isolated and characterized human zzso and found that zzso binds to zzso core zzso throughout the cell zzso Further, it was found that zzso is localized in zzso and zzso zzso throughout zzso while it is also localized in zzso from zzso to zzso and in zzso in zzso and zzso These results strongly support the notion that human zzso may be one of the zzso core zzso rather than the zzso associated regulatory zzso
