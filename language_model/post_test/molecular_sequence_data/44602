We describe the specificity profile and V region sequences of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso studies show that the zzso is critical for steroid zzso while the zzso acid attached to the A ring is required for high binding zzso suggesting that both zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso The zzso domain is zzso by a gene from the zzso family, while zzso appears to be zzso by the zzso gene zzso II zzso with a deletion of six zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is 10 zzso acid zzso in zzso of which zzso contributes five zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with those of zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for which crystal structures have been determined, suggests that aromatic side chains are important for zzso binding and that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may interact with the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso in its native and steroid zzso and zzso zzso zzso An X-ray zzso data set to 3 A resolution has been collected for the native zzso
