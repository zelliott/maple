Carolina zzso are naturally occurring shallow elliptical depressions largely fed by rain and shallow ground zzso To identify members of the domain zzso which inhibit such an environment, we used zzso to construct a library of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso cloned from DNA extracted from the sediments of Rainbow bay, located on the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, zzso zzso complementary to zzso regions of zzso zzso were used as zzso for zzso and zzso zzso products were cloned into zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the cloned zzso zzso revealed an extensive amount of zzso diversity within this zzso Of the 35 clones zzso 32 were affiliated with five bacterial groups: 11 clustered with the zzso division (including members of the zzso zzso and delta zzso 8 clustered with the zzso subdivision of the zzso division (as zzso by the zzso Database Project's zzso zzso version zzso 7 clustered with the zzso subdivision of the zzso division, 3 clustered with the zzso bacteria zzso and relatives zzso and 3 clustered with the green zzso zzso One sequence zzso very deeply from the zzso and was found not to be associated with any of the major divisions when zzso trees were zzso Two clones did not consistently cluster with specific groups and may be zzso zzso None of the clones exhibited an exact match to any of the zzso zzso sequences deposited in the databases, suggesting that most of the bacteria in Rainbow Bay are novel zzso In particular, the clones related to the zzso subdivision and the zzso subdivision confirm the presence of novel zzso discovered previously in other molecular surveys of this zzso
