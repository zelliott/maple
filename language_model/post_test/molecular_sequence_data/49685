The zzso zzso of 20 strains of zzso were zzso and used for construction of a zzso tree together with already published zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso within the zzso zzso as reflected by the zzso zzso tree, was in agreement with existing zzso zzso and zzso zzso data, indicating that for zzso zzso zzso sequencing is a valid method for identification and zzso zzso Five closely related clusters were found in the zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso III, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso IV, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The position of zzso zzso within the zzso and closest to zzso zzso was zzso For the species zzso zzso data seem to indicate a subdivision into two zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso that was included in the analysis could not be assigned to any of the known species, but was found to be closest related to zzso zzso Furthermore, the high sequence similarity between the two environmental species zzso zzso and zzso zzso does not justify a distinction of the two zzso Finally, within a zzso stretch of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso
