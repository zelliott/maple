Using gene zzso constructed from gene sequence data, we show that both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso A and zzso to have been transmitted through susceptible populations faster than zzso The data and methods involved zzso examining the zzso database for zzso signal in an zzso open reading frame zzso zzso and an E1 zzso segment, zzso demonstrating that the same two fragments have evolved in a way consistent with a molecular clock, and zzso applying methods of zzso tree analysis that test different scenarios for the dynamics of viral transmission within zzso The results indicate increases in zzso populations of both zzso A and B in the recent zzso This form of the increases, which fit a zzso model of population growth with an zzso increasing in time, is compatible with the fact that human populations have grown at a faster than exponential rate, thus increasing the numbers of susceptible hosts for zzso There are, however, indications that the population of zzso A has now stopped increasing in zzso
