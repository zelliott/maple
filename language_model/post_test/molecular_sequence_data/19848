The protein zzso is a small heat shock protein that functions as a molecular zzso to protect zzso by preventing irreversible protein damage during embryonic zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso 174 zzso acid zzso and the zzso acid sequence contained the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that eight zzso populations were divided into four major zzso zzso zzso zzso belonged to the East Asia bisexual zzso zzso of the zzso gene at different zzso stages of zzso zzso was zzso using real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction followed by cloning and zzso The relationship between the quantity of zzso gene expression and embryonic development was zzso The results indicated that massive amounts of zzso were expressed during the development of zzso zzso At the zzso stage of 0 zzso zzso zzso expressed the highest level of zzso As development zzso expression levels of the zzso gene reduced zzso There was a small quantity of zzso gene expression at the zzso stages of 16 h and 24 zzso We concluded that zzso might be involved in protecting the zzso from zzso stress during embryonic zzso
