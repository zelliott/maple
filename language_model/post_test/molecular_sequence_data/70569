The zzso mercury resistance zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and compared to reported zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso resistance system is organized as an zzso that transcribes into a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso transport zzso and zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso gene was zzso zzso of structural genes is regulated by the product of the regulatory zzso zzso On the basis of sequence data and expression experiments in zzso coli, both zzso and zzso zzso units could be located close to each other and in different zzso with their promoters zzso and zzso zzso overlapping the putative zzso binding site in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso gene products were compared to their zzso Some sequence features, such as the number and position of zzso zzso are unique for the zzso proteins of this zzso zzso zzso and zzso boxes are zzso apart in both zzso and zzso zzso and differences zzso repeats in the zzso zzso zzso site are zzso shorter than in zzso zzso exist between the zzso zzso regions of both zzso In zzso experiments showed zzso expression of mercury resistance in zzso coli cells transformed with the entire zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso plus regulatory zzso and little or no expression in clones containing only the structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso
