To determine mechanistically how zzso mediate zzso gene zzso zzso in human cells, we have measured zzso zzso at targeted zzso the dependency on active transcription, and whether or not both strands of the zzso are required for zzso zzso We report here that zzso treatment increases both zzso and zzso zzso of the targeted zzso promoter and that this increase is dependent on nuclear specific delivery of the zzso We also find that zzso can be directed by the zzso strand alone, and requires active zzso by zzso zzso II in human cells as evidenced by sensitivity to zzso The observation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was substantiated by targeting the zzso region of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso strand of zzso zzso associates with the zzso expressed zzso zzso the targeted zzso promoter, and zzso zzso The observations reported here zzso a functional link between zzso targeting of zzso regions zzso zzso Pol II function, zzso zzso and zzso and support a paradigm in which the zzso strands of zzso alone can direct zzso zzso gene zzso in human zzso
