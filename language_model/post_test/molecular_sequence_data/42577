zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso times more rapidly than zzso zzso zzso It is established that zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in key polar interactions with the zzso in the case of zzso zzso analyses based on zzso calculations indicate that the zzso in space of zzso of zzso relative to zzso and zzso in the preferred zzso for the zzso zzso is energetically more readily achieved by zzso zzso zzso than for its zzso zzso A kinetic evaluation of the zzso in fact has shown that the zzso is more strongly bound by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the parent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso has the weakest zzso binding zzso zzso 90 zzso Since the zzso values were all within the range zzso zzso zzso zzso it is evident that the relative rates of zzso are related to the relative ease for the compounds to achieve an interaction of a zzso group in the zzso of an zzso with the zzso for the formation of the zzso zzso The relative rates of zzso of the zzso of the zzso 5 and 6, provide further support for this highly desirable but not necessary recognition for the orientation of the reducing zzso unit in the active zzso
