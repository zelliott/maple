An zzso gag gene zzso of human zzso virus type 1, which carries two zzso acid zzso in the center of the zzso coding region, was constructed in zzso and its replication properties in several cell lines were zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso synthesis and processing of viral zzso zzso and zzso proteins occurred zzso and viral particles were zzso zzso derived from the zzso displayed a severe replication zzso when zzso into some zzso cell lines zzso and zzso clone zzso but in other lines zzso and zzso the zzso virus grew fairly zzso The zzso was demonstrated to be defective at an early infection phase (from zzso to zzso in zzso clone 8 cells but was normal in zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 plays an important role at the early infection phase in a zzso zzso
