zzso zzso zzso zzso induced upon tobacco mosaic virus zzso infection in zzso zzso leaves, has a broad base zzso The crystal structures of zzso zzso in complex with either zzso zzso or zzso were determined at zzso A resolutions by molecular zzso zzso zzso consists of seven zzso and seven beta zzso and the structure is highly similar to that of zzso zzso a zzso acid preferential zzso from the zzso zzso leaves, showing root mean square zzso zzso of zzso A over an entire length of two molecules for zzso zzso The complex structures revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are involved in interactions with bases at B1 site zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate in recognition of bases at B2 site zzso The zzso and zzso bind both B1 and B2 sites in zzso zzso while zzso predominantly binds B1 site in the zzso The zzso binding modes in these complexes would provide a clue to zzso of structural basis for the broad base specificity for zzso zzso
