We provide evidence that zzso members of a ubiquitous family of zzso zzso zzso may represent a universal zzso zzso for calcium signaling because we find zzso are capable of interacting with a wide variety of zzso proteins including zzso protein zzso 5, and the zzso zzso that are themselves components of zzso signaling zzso The zzso target proteins were identified by zzso zzso screening and the interactions were verified in zzso using zzso zzso In the majority of cases the zzso binds to a domain of the target protein that is predicted to form a characteristic zzso A consensus sequence for the zzso zzso site was derived and found to have zzso value for identifying new zzso zzso We also show that interaction with zzso may result in recruitment of target proteins to membrane surfaces and regulation of the zzso activities of target zzso
