The structure of the human zzso for zzso growth factor zzso has been deduced through zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone predicts a zzso zzso including the zzso signal zzso The overall zzso acid sequence similarity with the zzso zzso zzso is zzso After zzso of the zzso and translation in zzso a zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso a product of predicted size, which also could be zzso in zzso zzso introduction of the zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells led to the expression of a zzso zzso which was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso this most probably represents the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso forms of zzso A and B chains showed that the zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells bound zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso but not zzso
