The zzso zzso zzso and the recently cloned TRAIL zzso belong to the zzso and share the ability to induce zzso in sensitive target zzso Little information is available on the degree of functional zzso between these two zzso in terms of target selectivity and zzso zzso zzso To address these issues, we have expressed and characterized zzso mouse zzso zzso detection with newly developed rabbit zzso zzso showed that the functional TRAIL zzso released into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells is very similar to that associated with the membrane fraction of zzso zzso zzso resistant myeloma cells were found to be sensitive to zzso displaying zzso features similar to those of the zzso and zzso T leukemia cells zzso To assess if zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso of both cell types, zzso zzso experiments were zzso The irreversible zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso changes, disorganization of plasma membrane zzso DNA zzso and loss of cell viability associated with zzso zzso In addition, cells undergoing zzso zzso displayed zzso of zzso zzso zzso that was completely blocked by zzso These results indicate that TRAIL seems to complement the activity of the zzso system as it allows cells, otherwise zzso to undergo zzso triggered by specific zzso zzso zzso however, induction of zzso in sensitive cells by TRAIL involves zzso in a fashion similar to zzso Thus, differential sensitivity to zzso and TRAIL seems to map to the zzso signaling events associated with zzso zzso
