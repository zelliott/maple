DNA fragments containing zzso clusters and their zzso regions were cloned from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and then their sequences were zzso Comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso 2003) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso revealed that the zzso backbone regions of ACT and TOM shared a high similarity to each other but presented a low similarity to those of zzso and zzso Nevertheless, zzso DNA regions of about 38 zzso were confirmed to be present on the zzso of both ACT and zzso which we named zzso zzso The facts that the zzso content of such zzso islands was zzso lower than that of the zzso backbone regions of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso which are considered to be of zzso origin based on our previous studies zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso were confirmed to be contained within the zzso islands, suggested that the zzso islands were an zzso mobile genetic element inserted into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso It was also predicted that the zzso islands integrated zzso into the zzso sites of the zzso of ACT and zzso in the same direction, respectively, wherein 34 common gene coding sequences zzso zzso Furthermore, at the left end of the zzso islands were three zzso which zzso zzso and had similarities to the members of the zzso zzso family, suggesting that these putative zzso zzso were involved in the recent horizontal transfer of zzso zzso
