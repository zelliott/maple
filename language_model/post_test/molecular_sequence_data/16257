The base sequences of the coding region of the zzso zzso genes of two H 10 influenza A zzso one avian zzso N) and one mink virus, have been determined by primer zzso When the zzso genes and the zzso sequences derived from the only open reading frame of the two H 10 viruses were compared with those of other human and avian influenza A zzso it turned out that the mink virus zzso was highly related to that of other avian zzso but differed from that of the human zzso zzso of the zzso genes of the mink and avian strains of European origin suggests a direct lineage between zzso Since the zzso plays a major role in species zzso it is assumed that an avian influenza virus has directly invaded the mink zzso
