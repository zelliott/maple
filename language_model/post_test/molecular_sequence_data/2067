The region lying between zzso zzso zzso and zzso of chicken zzso zzso zzso gene zzso upstream sequence zzso zzso control of expression in primary cultures of chicken zzso This region interacts with several nuclear factors present in muscle cells as shown by zzso I zzso and zzso zzso An zzso factor and a zzso zzso protein were found to bind to overlapping sites immediately upstream of the zzso zzso Several factors interacting in the same region with a domain similar to the zzso zzso core appeared during in zzso differentiation of zzso into zzso The concentration of some of these factors increased also after zzso of leg muscle in newborn zzso The specific interaction of nuclear factors with this domain may thus play a critical role in the regulation of zzso gene expression by muscle differentiation and electrical zzso
