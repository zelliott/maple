In zzso zzso signal zzso through pathways governing zzso zzso and nitrogen zzso depends upon a direct interaction between the sterile alpha motif zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and its regulator zzso Previously, we solved the zzso structure of the SAM domain from zzso and identified two zzso that diminished binding to the zzso SAM zzso Building upon the zzso study, we present the zzso structure of the zzso zzso SAM domain and a series of zzso bearing zzso at zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso defined by zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso region of zzso defined by zzso zzso were sensitive to zzso indicating that these two surfaces contribute to the zzso zzso The combination of two zzso zzso and zzso formed a zzso zzso unencumbered by competing zzso interactions that had prevented earlier zzso studies of the zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso that prevented the zzso zzso association in zzso presented signaling defects in the mating and zzso growth zzso
