Five novel zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso in China were subjected to a zzso analysis to determine their zzso zzso All of the novel zzso could grow on zzso plates at zzso zzso of up to 18 % zzso with optimum growth at 5-8 zzso The DNA zzso contents of the novel strains ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso characteristics of the zzso matched those described for members of the zzso zzso Based on their zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso zzso values and zzso zzso including the composition of zzso zzso acids and zzso zzso polar lipids and cellular fatty zzso the zzso are proposed as representing five novel species of the zzso zzso The novel species are proposed as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso data, the description of the recently described species zzso zzso Li et zzso 2004 is zzso
