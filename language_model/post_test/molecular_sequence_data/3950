zzso zzso zzso are widely distributed among zzso and zzso and have diverse functions in zzso Recent zzso sequencing revealed zzso protein in bacteria, but whether these proteins generate zzso oxide is zzso We therefore zzso zzso and zzso a zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso and characterized its zzso parameters in both multiple and single turnover zzso zzso was zzso bound zzso and zzso with similar affinity as zzso zzso and generated zzso from zzso when incubated with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso reacted with zzso to form a transient zzso zzso species in the presence of either zzso or the reaction intermediate zzso In the latter case, disappearance of the zzso species was zzso and zzso coupled to formation of a transient zzso zzso product, which then zzso to form zzso zzso This behavior mirrors zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows that zzso can generate zzso NO formation required a bound zzso and the kinetic effects of this zzso were consistent with it zzso an electron to the zzso intermediate during the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso product was much slower in zzso than in zzso zzso This zzso allowable rates of zzso zzso reduction by a protein zzso partner and underscores the utility of using a zzso electron donor in zzso
