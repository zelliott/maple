zzso 21 zzso is a recently identified novel zzso that plays an important role in the regulation of B, zzso and zzso cell zzso Its effects depend on binding to and signaling through an zzso zzso complex consisting of the zzso zzso zzso and the common zzso zzso In this study using zzso technique, the zzso properties of zzso and zzso which are presently poorly understood on a molecular level, were analyzed employing zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The formation of a zzso complex between zzso and immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso and immobilized zzso zzso 160 zzso and a zzso complex between zzso and zzso saturated immobilized zzso zzso zzso could be zzso The zzso zzso involved in zzso binding were defined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso comprises zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It is not identical but partially overlapping with the previously established zzso zzso for zzso zzso These results open the way to understand the molecular recognition mechanism in the zzso zzso system and also the zzso binding properties of zzso
