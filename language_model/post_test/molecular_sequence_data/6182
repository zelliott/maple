In our recent analyses zzso of five zzso arranged genes zzso a major zzso basic nuclear protein zzso of zzso zzso we found a gene containing a single base substitution which will give rise to the replacement of the 69th zzso among the 78 zzso acids of zzso In this study, the zzso from zzso zzso which were separated by zzso zzso as a distinct entity from zzso were collected for their zzso mapping with zzso zzso and partial zzso acid sequence zzso It resulted that a zzso exhibiting an zzso acid replacement at exactly the same position as predicted from a single base substitution of zzso occurs in approximately zzso of the amount of zzso This finding suggests that the relative amount of zzso and its zzso directly depends on the relative number of genes of zzso and its zzso
