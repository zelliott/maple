Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coding for rabbit zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits an open reading frame from zzso 74 to zzso zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to zzso the last 24 zzso zzso Comparative zzso acid sequence analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso from rat and man, were 70, 67, and zzso zzso respectively, to zzso zzso According to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene is termed zzso zzso of the zzso sequences indicated that zzso zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso However, whereas a zzso tract started 23 zzso after the zzso consensus sequence in zzso zzso zzso zzso had a 3' untranslated region extending 101 zzso beyond the zzso zzso which lacked zzso This observation is consistent with the previous finding that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso with two distinct species of zzso (1700 and zzso zzso from rabbit zzso The extreme zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso therefore was isolated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso I) and used to probe Northern blots of zzso from control and zzso rabbit zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso I zzso zzso only with the largest zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that rabbit liver contains two zzso zzso zzso species differing in the length of their 3' untranslated zzso
