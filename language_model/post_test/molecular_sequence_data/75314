A region of the zzso locus encompassing zzso to zzso contains zzso sequences zzso and zzso As part of a study to determine whether the zzso elements are involved in the expression of zzso zzso the zzso organization of this region was zzso in greater zzso A result of these investigations is the extension of the zzso zzso molecular zzso Two additional zzso genes have been isolated from zzso mice, zzso and zzso The zzso organization of zzso through zzso is zzso The zzso sequence has been determined for zzso 4, 5, and 6 of zzso As a result of a C to T conversion, a termination zzso is introduced into zzso 4, indicating that zzso either encodes a zzso protein or is a zzso zzso was found to be more zzso to the zzso genes outside the zzso zzso zzso has been physically disrupted by the integration of zzso and the zzso sequences appear to have zzso zzso The relationship of the zzso regions of the b and c zzso has been investigated using numerous low copy zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is shown to lack a counterpart of the zzso zzso zzso regions exist in the two zzso yet considerable zzso is zzso zzso mice do not express zzso on the cell surface of normal zzso while zzso mice zzso zzso expression is activated in many zzso zzso The diversity seen in the zzso region may provide insights into the zzso expression or regulatory mechanisms of zzso expression in these two zzso
