zzso zzso DNA is a linear duplex zzso with a 160 zzso direct repeat zzso zzso at its zzso During zzso large DNA zzso are formed, which are zzso of the zzso zzso linked head to tail through zzso at the terminal zzso We define the sequence that results from this zzso a mature right end joined to the left end of zzso DNA, as the zzso zzso To study the processing and packaging of zzso zzso into zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso junction into a zzso zzso This zzso is efficiently (at least 15 zzso zzso packaged into zzso particles during a zzso zzso These zzso particles can be separated from zzso zzso by zzso to equilibrium in zzso The packaged zzso DNA is a linear zzso of about 40 zzso zzso zzso with ends at the expected zzso DNA zzso Thus, the zzso zzso junction sequence on the zzso is recognized for processing and packaging by the zzso zzso We have identified a zzso DNA replication origin near the right end of the zzso zzso that is necessary for efficient zzso zzso The origin, which is associated with a zzso zzso zzso promoter, causes amplification of the zzso DNA during zzso zzso The amplified zzso DNA sediments very rapidly and contains large zzso which are expected to be good zzso for the packaging zzso When cloned in zzso a sequence containing only the mature right end of zzso DNA is sufficient for efficient zzso Since this sequence does not contain DNA to the right of the site where a mature zzso right end is formed, it was expected that right ends would not form on this zzso In fact, with this zzso the right end does not form at the normal zzso sequence but is instead formed within the zzso Apparently, the zzso packaging system can also recognize a site in zzso DNA to produce an end for zzso This site is not recognized solely by a zzso zzso since there can be considerable variation in the amount of DNA packaged (32 zzso zzso to 42 zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of this region from the zzso DNA prevents packaging of the zzso The end that is formed in zzso DNA is somewhat zzso About one-third of the ends are at a unique site zzso zzso of zzso which is followed by the sequence zzso This sequence is also found adjacent to the cut made in a zzso DNA zzso to produce a normal zzso right zzso
