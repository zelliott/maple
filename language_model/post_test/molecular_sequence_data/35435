zzso processes and, in particular, base compositional zzso have long been recognized as a critical source of systematic zzso But only a small fraction of current molecular systematic studies methodically examine and effectively account for the potentially zzso effect of zzso The problem is especially overlooked in zzso or zzso scale zzso in part because no efficient tools exist to accommodate base composition zzso in large data zzso We present a detailed analysis of a data set with 20 genes and 214 zzso to study the zzso of zzso zzso and their position among zzso Most genes vary significantly in base composition among zzso and fail to resolve zzso zzso and other emblematic groups, suggesting that zzso may be causing systematic zzso We show a strong association between base compositional bias and zzso zzso among individual gene partitions and their zzso zzso zzso methods applying zzso models to accommodate zzso have relatively minor effect to reduce gene tree zzso suggesting that available computer programs applying these methods do not scale up efficiently to the data set of modest size zzso in this zzso By comparing zzso trees obtained with species tree zzso and zzso approaches, we show that gene tree zzso in our data set is most likely due to base compositional biases than to incomplete lineage zzso zzso analyses suggest that the combined zzso signal from all zzso in a zzso data set overcomes systematic biases induced by zzso at each zzso Finally, relationships among zzso and their relatives are discussed in the light of these zzso We find support for the zzso of zzso and confirm findings from previous molecular zzso studies suggesting their close affinity with several zzso groups zzso jack and allies, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso beach zzso and zzso and zzso
