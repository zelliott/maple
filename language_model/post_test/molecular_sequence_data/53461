zzso zzso zzso are modular zzso that assemble peptides of diverse structures and important biological zzso Their modular organization provides a great potential for the rational design of novel compounds by zzso of the zzso zzso Here we describe the extension of a zzso system to zzso ones based on zzso zzso The zzso hybrid zzso were zzso to monitor product assembly in zzso We started from the first two zzso of zzso zzso which catalyze the formation of the zzso zzso to construct such hybrid zzso Fusion of the second, zzso module with the ninth and tenth zzso of the zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso respectively, resulted in zzso hybrid zzso exhibiting the combined zzso zzso The zzso domain was fused to the terminal zzso Upon incubation of these zzso zzso with the first zzso zzso zzso incorporating zzso the predicted zzso zzso and zzso were obtained at rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The internal zzso domain was necessary and sufficient to release the products from the hybrid zzso and thereby facilitate a zzso zzso Our approach of zzso fusion is based on an improved definition of the fusion sites and overcomes the recently discovered editing function of the intrinsic zzso zzso The zzso construction of hybrid zzso zzso from zzso zzso reinforces the inherent potential for the synthesis of novel, designed zzso
