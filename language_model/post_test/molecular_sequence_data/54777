In zzso organisms, feedback dissipation of excess absorbed light energy balances harvesting of light with zzso energy zzso This mechanism prevents zzso caused by zzso oxygen species produced by the reaction of zzso zzso zzso states with zzso Plants have been found to perform the heat dissipation in specific zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso that belong to the zzso family, while triggering of the process is performed by the zzso zzso needed for zzso pH zzso zzso is not found in algae, suggesting important differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this zzso a different zzso gene product, called zzso (formerly known as zzso has been found to be essential for zzso in zzso zzso In this work, we report the production of two zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and their zzso and zzso zzso We found the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso contrary to higher plant zzso zzso the zzso zzso accumulating in high light, is a strong zzso of zzso excited states, exhibiting a very fast zzso zzso with lifetimes below 100 zzso capable of dissipating zzso energy from neighbor antenna zzso zzso the zzso zzso is highly active in the transient formation of Car radical zzso a species proposed to act as a zzso in the heat dissipation zzso zzso the radical zzso signal is detected at zzso corresponding to the Car zzso rather than to zzso zzso that the latter, zzso in plants, is not zzso zzso zzso is responsive to low zzso the trigger of zzso zzso since it binds the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and increases its energy dissipation properties upon zzso This is the first report of an isolated zzso protein zzso active in energy dissipation in its zzso form, opening the way to detailed molecular zzso zzso to its zzso zzso and zzso zzso energy zzso this protein appears to merge both zzso and zzso functions, accomplished respectively by zzso and zzso zzso proteins in zzso
