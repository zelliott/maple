zzso processes are considered to be important for the competitiveness of zzso in the zzso They affect zzso communication, zzso formation, and zzso production, and the zzso zzso system plays a role as a key zzso In spite of the importance of this system for the regulation of various zzso strains with a zzso zzso are readily recovered from natural zzso To analyze the influence of zzso sensing and the influence of the production of the zzso zzso on zzso colonization by zzso zzso a zzso system based on zzso zzso zzso in soil was zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso isolate zzso carrying insertions in different genes required for the production of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Analysis of solitary zzso colonization revealed that after prolonged growth, the population of the wild type was significantly larger than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of a zzso zzso In zzso experiments, however, the population size of the zzso zzso was similar to that of the wild type after extended growth in the zzso A detailed analysis of growth zzso was performed to explain this zzso After cells grown to the stationary phase were transferred to fresh zzso the zzso zzso had a reduced lag phase, and production of the zzso zzso factor zzso was strongly zzso This may provide a relative competitive advantage in zzso with other bacteria, because it permits faster zzso of growth after a change to zzso zzso In addition, delayed entry into the stationary phase may allow more efficient zzso zzso Thus, zzso processes are not absolutely required for efficient zzso colonization in populations containing the wild type and zzso zzso
