Two previously isolated resistance gene zzso zzso of zzso have been located as zzso in the reference map of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in regions either zzso or zzso to zzso for resistance to zzso zzso the zzso agent of crown zzso In this study, the zzso were mapped in two zzso zzso line zzso populations that segregate for crown rust zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso population zzso which has been used for mapping the complex locus zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso population zzso in which zzso have been zzso To obtain zzso zzso zzso were converted to sequence zzso site zzso markers using a procedure involving extension of the original zzso sequence lengths by zzso zzso walking, amplification and cloning of the parental fragments, and identification of single zzso zzso The procedure successfully obtained zzso from different members of the zzso family of zzso the initial zzso of which have zzso similarities of zzso However, for zzso zzso the parental lines were not zzso for the zzso zzso A sequence characterized amplified region zzso marker with features of an zzso had been previously identified for gene zzso This marker was also mapped in the above zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso with markers defining the zzso zzso in linkage group zzso and were located zzso zzso from zzso in linkage group zzso The zzso marker for zzso was also located in the zzso zzso but at zzso zzso from zzso in zzso indicating that the zzso sequence represented by this marker is not related to zzso zzso was also excluded as a member of the zzso zzso although it could be an appropriate marker for the zzso cluster if zzso zzso are zzso
