By binding to zzso elements located in the zzso of zzso zzso the protein zzso plays a key role in the assembly of the zzso incorporation zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso domain similar to that of protein zzso which binds zzso motifs with a zzso zzso loop closed by a tandem of zzso and zzso zzso Here, by zzso experiments, we demonstrate the capacity of zzso to bind such zzso motifs with a protruding U zzso However, we show that conversion of the zzso loop into an internal loop reinforces zzso affinity and to a greater extent zzso zzso zzso variations were found for zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed strong contacts of zzso with zzso I and II and the zzso of the internal loop, as opposed to the loose interaction of zzso Our data also identifies new zzso for zzso binding which are located in zzso zzso Among the zzso family members, these zzso are unique to zzso Finally, in accordance with functional data on zzso zzso the identity of zzso at positions 2 and 3 in the loop influences zzso zzso Altogether, the data provide a very precise definition of the zzso zzso zzso
