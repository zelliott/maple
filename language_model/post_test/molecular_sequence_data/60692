zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso response when grown at pH zzso instead of pH zzso zzso zzso of calcium in the exposure medium significantly decreased the death rate of zzso cells under conditions of acid stress zzso zzso The effect of calcium on survival at pH zzso however, appears unconnected to zzso zzso since a strain with a zzso in zzso zzso responded to calcium in the exposure medium in the same way as its zzso parent zzso The concentration of calcium in the growth medium also affected subsequent survival at pH zzso and the effect varied with zzso In cells grown at pH zzso higher calcium zzso also markedly increased the rate of synthesis of zzso this was not seen in cells grown at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso for isolated zzso from zzso cultures grown at pH zzso and pH zzso showed that low pH markedly lowered the degree of substitution with zzso and zzso groups, but not the degree of substitution with zzso zzso calcium concentration did not affect the pattern of substitution at either zzso For zzso to be involved in the effect of calcium concentration in the growth medium on survival would imply a deleterious effect of the zzso produced at low zzso
