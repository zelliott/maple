zzso necrosis factor zzso related zzso zzso zzso is a recently identified member of the zzso family, which zzso programmed cell death in a variety of zzso cell types, but not in most zzso zzso In this study, we report on the identification of two novel alternative zzso zzso of TRAIL in zzso and zzso human cells lacking either zzso 3 zzso or zzso 2 and 3 zzso In both zzso zzso loss of zzso 3 resulted in a frame shift generating a stop zzso with consecutive extensive zzso in the zzso zzso zzso expression revealed a loss of zzso potential for both alternative zzso zzso In contrast to the predominantly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed an additional association with the cell surface and nuclear zzso In conclusion, alternative zzso might be involved in fine tuning of zzso zzso and zzso the complexity of the TRAIL zzso
