The beta zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso of G zzso receptors that are characterized by seven putative zzso zzso connected by zzso zzso The mechanism by which the activated beta zzso transmit the signals across the plasma membrane involves the stimulation of zzso which in turn activates zzso zzso yielding the second zzso zzso In the present study, we created a series of zzso beta zzso to explore the structural basis for the zzso binding of zzso zzso a beta zzso zzso and for the zzso of the zzso to zzso To study the mechanism of zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that the zzso segment 5 region of the beta zzso contains critical zzso for observed high affinity for zzso zzso Previous studies of beta zzso have demonstrated a role for the third zzso loop in zzso zzso To investigate the role of this region in the beta zzso we constructed zzso beta zzso lacking a small segment of the zzso or zzso domain of the third zzso zzso zzso of these zzso receptors in mouse L cells and zzso cells reveals that although both zzso are capable of binding the zzso zzso the zzso zzso production zzso by these zzso receptors is markedly attenuated or zzso In addition, both zzso beta zzso exhibit an approximately zzso increase in affinity for zzso zzso whereas the affinity for zzso is not zzso This increased zzso affinity is not altered by treatment with 100 zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso receptors are zzso from G zzso The results of the present study demonstrate that these regions of the third zzso loop of beta zzso are critical for zzso to G proteins and suggest a role for these regions in maintaining the resting state of the zzso zzso
