zzso in zzso the gene zzso the gap junction protein zzso 31 zzso have been zzso linked to zzso and zzso zzso dominant zzso or zzso zzso hearing impairment zzso To determine the contribution of zzso to sporadic deafness, we assessed 63 individuals with zzso hearing impairment for zzso zzso Single coding zzso of zzso was amplified from zzso DNA and then zzso Single zzso sequence zzso was present in 15 out of 63 patients zzso all of the zzso being zzso for the four different single base pair changes that were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these, only zzso transition, identified in two patients, results in zzso acid change, zzso while the other three changes are single zzso zzso zzso The zzso substitution in zzso has been previously documented and is speculated to manifest variable zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Over one-third of all samples were also screened with zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso Seven out of 25 individuals screened were determined to be positive for zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis of the 25 individuals screened identified zzso zzso in all of the 7 zzso and in none of the 16 zzso yielding a specificity and sensitivity of zzso Thus, zzso represents a highly efficient zzso screening zzso This study suggests that while sequence zzso are common, zzso zzso of zzso are zzso in sporadic zzso hearing zzso
