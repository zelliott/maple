zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso is an zzso binding zzso produced by a variety of zzso In cancer patients expression of zzso has been associated with poor prognosis in several tumor types including breast, zzso and zzso zzso Despite wide expression in tumor cells and zzso there is limited evidence supporting role of zzso in tumor progression and zzso Using zzso display technology we identified a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding site for zzso was identified as zzso sequence which is immediately adjacent to the zzso motif and also spans the zzso zzso site of the human zzso zzso efficiently inhibited zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of 65 zzso Due to its unique binding site, zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso by zzso which has been shown to produce an zzso zzso that is biologically more active than the full length zzso zzso of human cell lines identified tumor cells with increased expression of zzso receptors zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso breast, and zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also found to be highly enriched in the zzso but not zzso subset of human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso In zzso zzso induced migration of both tumor and zzso in a zzso migration zzso zzso significantly blocked cell migration further zzso its specificity for the zzso zzso was found to be enriched in mouse plasma in a number of zzso tumor model of zzso cell lung zzso To assess the role of zzso in tumor growth and zzso and to evaluate a potential therapeutic indication for zzso we employed a zzso zzso implanted in zzso model of zzso which possesses a high capacity to zzso into the zzso Our data indicated that treatment of tumor bearing mice with zzso as a single agent or in combination with zzso significantly inhibited growth of large zzso tumors in the lung further supporting a role for zzso in tumor zzso and zzso
