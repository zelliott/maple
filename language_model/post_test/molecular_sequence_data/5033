zzso zzso are involved in the zzso zzso processing of zzso and zzso precursors within the zzso zzso In the present study, we have isolated zzso clones zzso the zzso region of the human zzso zzso 2 zzso gene and established characteristics of the zzso promoter zzso The zzso promoter region is very zzso and does not contain a zzso zzso box or a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso with a set of human zzso gene fragments containing progressive zzso deletions demonstrate that the zzso promoter region is capable of directing high levels of zzso expression of reporter gene zzso In addition, we show that the zzso factor zzso interacts with two distinct elements within the zzso human zzso promoter zzso zzso experiments also demonstrate that zzso is able to enhance zzso promoter zzso
