The group I zzso a zzso that zzso its own zzso reactions in the absence of proteins in zzso is a potential target for rational engineering and attracted our interest due to its potential utility in gene repair using zzso However, the zzso activity of a group I zzso appears to be facilitated by zzso zzso in zzso therefore, the efficiency of zzso could be dependent on the structure around the insert site or the length of the sequence to be zzso To better understand how zzso activity could be modulated in cultured zzso cells, a group I zzso was inserted into a short hairpin zzso zzso and zzso of a reporter gene by the zzso was estimated to reflect zzso activity in zzso In addition, we appended a zzso zzso to the zzso to investigate any potential effects caused by a zzso 

zzso zzso in which the loop region of the zzso was interrupted by an zzso were constructed to target zzso zzso zzso There was no remarkable toxicity of the zzso zzso in zzso cells, and the decrease in zzso activity was measured as an index of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of the zzso through zzso zzso was completely abolished in zzso cells, although the zzso induced by the zzso zzso alone was no different from that in the zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso also had implications for the potential of zzso to zzso promote zzso among cultured zzso zzso 

zzso by zzso interrupted by a group I zzso could be used to monitor zzso activity in cultured zzso cells, and the efficiency of zzso appears to be affected by zzso specific factors, demonstrating the potential effectiveness of a zzso
