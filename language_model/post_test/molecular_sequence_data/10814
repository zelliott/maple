The question whether immune pressure exerted by zzso T zzso zzso can influence the long-term evolution of genetically stable viruses such as zzso virus zzso has generated considerable scientific interest, primarily due to its important implications for the overall biology of the zzso While arguing for a role of zzso in the evolution of zzso it is important to differentiate between genetic variation in virus and immune recognition of these zzso virus by zzso To assess the role of genetic selection in the long-term evolution of zzso we have analyzed a large panel of type 1 zzso zzso from zzso Southeast Asian, zzso zzso zzso and Australian Caucasian zzso Seven different regions of the zzso zzso which include nine zzso zzso restricted through a range of zzso class I zzso were zzso and zzso Although numerous zzso changes were identified within these zzso comparison of synonymous and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso indicated that the genetic variation was generated mostly independently of immune selection zzso Surprisingly, an inverse correlation between genetic variation within certain zzso zzso and the frequency distribution of zzso zzso that present the zzso zzso was seen, suggesting that the evolutionary pressures on the zzso zzso of the virus may be toward their conservation rather than their zzso Furthermore, molecular evolutionary genetic analysis of zzso sequences revealed that viral zzso from zzso are evolving as a lineage distinct from zzso from zzso Southeast Asian, and Australian Caucasian zzso
