zzso zzso was modified by the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso A series of zzso compounds with zzso properties was zzso The zzso and biological zzso of all these zzso zzso acids zzso and their complexes with heavy metal zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso derivatives showed a good zzso activity and low zzso zzso which increased with increasing degree of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso complexes were demonstrated to zzso the growth of human zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso as a material is hindered by its high zzso in zzso zzso Our approach to improve its stability was directed to the synthesis of new zzso zzso and on the preparation of new zzso zzso surfaces obtained through zzso zzso of zzso The reaction of primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells was studied on both zzso in terms of cell number, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of cell movement showed that the cells respond to zzso showing good zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso containing materials could be used as zzso to aid cartilage repair and vessel zzso
