We have identified an zzso zzso domain within the sequence of the zzso base long zzso satellite zzso of tobacco zzso zzso The zzso domain contains two minimal sequences of satellite zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso represents a structure not previously found in any zzso zzso reaction described to zzso The reaction is truly zzso since the zzso zzso has multiple zzso zzso events and is not consumed during the course of the zzso A linear relationship is seen between reaction rate and zzso zzso zzso The reaction has a zzso of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso a temperature optimum of near 37 degrees C, and an energy of zzso of 19 zzso
