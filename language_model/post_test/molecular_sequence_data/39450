Because no zzso that reflects small zzso zzso rejection is available, we applied zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso to develop zzso markers required for routine zzso 

zzso small zzso transplantation zzso was performed in rats, and they were divided into four experimental groups: zzso rats zzso zzso transplants zzso zzso transplants zzso zzso transplants received zzso zzso Plasma samples were analyzed with zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso that predominated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in combination with zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso The identified protein was further analyzed by zzso 

An increase in the level of a zzso zzso identified as zzso was observed specifically in the plasma of the zzso zzso the levels of this protein remained unchanged in the plasma of the other zzso On the other hand, the levels of a zzso and a zzso zzso identified as migration zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso respectively, began to increase from an early stage of acute zzso We also observed that zzso zzso had strongly infiltrated the zzso zzso during acute zzso 

We identified three plasma zzso zzso and zzso increased during small zzso zzso zzso The identified proteins appeared to be markers for inflammation associated with zzso zzso This zzso approach will be useful for the identification of candidate zzso
