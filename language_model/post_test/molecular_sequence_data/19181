De zzso DNA zzso is thought to be critical for cellular zzso during tissue differentiation and zzso Little is known about the roles of de zzso DNA zzso during eye development, and particularly during lens zzso The lens is composed of lens zzso zzso and lens fiber zzso cells, with zzso zzso cells giving rise to differentiated zzso at the zzso zzso Given the unique architecture and zzso program of the zzso and the involvement of de zzso DNA zzso during differentiation events in other zzso we sought to identify de zzso DNA zzso expressed in the zzso zzso 

zzso possess six de zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso - zzso At 24 zzso zzso zzso all six are expressed zzso throughout the zzso By 72 zzso zzso and zzso become restricted to cells of the retinal zzso marginal zone zzso zzso and zzso to cells of the zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso to zzso cells and cells of the inner nuclear layer of the zzso 

These data identify regions of the eye where de zzso zzso could mediate DNA zzso events during zzso Overlapping expression zzso also suggest functional zzso within this gene family in the zzso
