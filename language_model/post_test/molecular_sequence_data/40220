A key feature of the immune system is its ability to discriminate self from zzso zzso in any of the mechanisms that maintain zzso to self (a state known as zzso contributes to the development of zzso zzso Recent studies in mice show that zzso T cells specific for the unconventional zzso class I zzso zzso bound to peptides derived from the signal sequence of zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether they exist in humans and play a role in human zzso zzso Here we have shown that zzso T cells specific for zzso bound to zzso (the human zzso of zzso exist and play an important role in maintaining peripheral zzso by discriminating self from zzso in zzso Furthermore, in the majority of type 1 diabetes zzso patients tested, there was a specific zzso in zzso T cell recognition of zzso which was associated with failure of zzso zzso However, the zzso in the zzso T cells from most of the zzso patients tested could be corrected in zzso by exposure to zzso immature zzso loaded with the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso T cells may play an important role in keeping zzso T cells in zzso Thus, correction of this zzso could be a potentially effective and safe approach in the therapy of zzso
