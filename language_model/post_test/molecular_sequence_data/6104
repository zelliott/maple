In this study, we examined the effects of altered environmental lighting on the infection process of a zzso leukemia virus, zzso which zzso a zzso zzso in zzso of zzso mice zzso as zzso One to two weeks after zzso high levels of zzso DNA are usually zzso This is followed by an zzso period of many weeks during which zzso DNA becomes essentially zzso zzso develops approximately 28 weeks zzso In this experiment, one group of mice was exposed a consistent zzso zzso cycle while a second was maintained in constant light zzso A third group was exposed to a rotating cycle characterized by phase shifting a zzso zzso cycle every three zzso days zzso All cycles began 2 weeks prior to zzso and were maintained zzso Animals were sacrificed at 1, 5, 10, and 15 weeks, and zzso tissue was examined for zzso DNA zzso At 1 week, zzso and zzso animals showed considerably less zzso DNA in bone zzso and zzso compared with zzso At 15 weeks, zzso from controls were showing signs of infection whereas tissue from zzso and zzso mice remained at background zzso We conclude that environmental lighting does alter the zzso pattern displayed by this zzso although whether this effect is zzso by changes in the target stem cells or through zzso has not yet been zzso
