We studied the prevalence of zzso virus zzso G virus zzso infection among 112 patients with liver disease and 121 blood donors in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction were employed to detect zzso zzso using the specific zzso derived from the zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sequences of all positive samples for zzso zzso were zzso The sequences were analyzed by a molecular evolutionary zzso Twenty-five zzso of 233 people were positive for zzso zzso Eight zzso 11 zzso and 30 zzso blood donors were positive for zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, although 17 zzso 65 zzso and 64 zzso patients with liver disease were positive for each viral zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the patients were significantly higher than those in blood donors zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the prevalence of zzso among people with and without zzso zzso while the prevalence of zzso among people with zzso zzso was significantly higher than among those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular evolutionary tree showed that zzso was a zzso virus and all strains could be divided into 2 zzso One is the same zzso type as zzso and the other is a new type that is different from zzso and zzso
