In the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso the simultaneous use of zzso and zzso zzso as zzso was found to give the desired zzso in a high yield without zzso In the presence of zzso reducing the amount of zzso zzso produced a higher zzso Besides improving the zzso efficiency as compared with the case using zzso zzso alone as an zzso the present procedure offered another advantage for zzso zzso Thus, even for the zzso where a low level of zzso was observed in the presence of zzso zzso the simultaneous addition of zzso and zzso zzso resulted in the elimination of zzso The effectiveness of this new procedure using the two zzso zzso in the synthesis of biologically active peptides was assessed by the preparation of a protected zzso In the 4 + 1 segment zzso using zzso and zzso zzso simultaneously as zzso no zzso was detected and the yield was high zzso The elimination of zzso and improvement of zzso efficiency produced by the present procedure can be attributable to a reduced tendency for the activated forms of the zzso component to form a zzso by the action of zzso and to the prevention of zzso by zzso zzso of the small amount of the zzso formed which is not eliminated by the action of zzso zzso
