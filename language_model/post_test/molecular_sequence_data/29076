zzso zzso is a widely used regulatory mechanism for controlling gene zzso and a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso participate in both zzso and alternative zzso Here we describe a novel function for the zzso protein zzso We used an embryonic chicken zzso library to screen for differential zzso expression in the chicken zzso line zzso expressing or not expressing zzso zzso out of 3 zzso zzso clones screened, only one, isolated several times zzso showed zzso differential zzso The isolated zzso referred to here as zzso (for zzso is closely related to the protein zzso C interacting protein zzso zzso zzso levels were increased approximately zzso in zzso cells compared with cells expressing zzso indicating a negative role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression had no significant effect on zzso zzso or transcription, but markedly increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Similarly, increased zzso stability was also observed upon expression of zzso zzso zzso in cells depleted of zzso zzso bound to a discrete region containing a zzso sequence in the 3' zzso of the zzso transcript, and deletion of this region eliminated zzso regulation of transcript zzso Together these data indicate a novel, direct effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and perhaps other zzso zzso affects gene expression in zzso cells through regulation of zzso stability as well as zzso
