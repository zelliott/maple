Most microbes have complex life cycles with multiple modes of reproduction that differ in their effects on DNA sequence zzso zzso zzso analyses can therefore be used to estimate the relative zzso of these different modes in zzso The life cycle of the wild zzso zzso zzso is complex, including zzso zzso zzso and two different modes of zzso To zzso these different aspects we analyzed DNA sequence variation in the third zzso among 20 zzso from two zzso zzso of zzso and zzso diversity were used to make two independent estimates of the population zzso In an zzso sexual population these values should be approximately zzso Instead there is a zzso of about three orders of magnitude between our two estimates of population size, indicating that zzso zzso goes through a sexual cycle approximately once in every 1,000 asexual zzso zzso III also contains the mating type locus zzso which is the most zzso part in the entire zzso and by comparing zzso diversity as a function of distance from zzso we estimate the frequency of zzso to be approximately zzso from within the same zzso zzso with a zzso after switching the mating type, and zzso zzso Our study illustrates the utility of population zzso data in zzso life zzso
