We describe the construction of an attenuated zzso zzso zzso strain which zzso via the zzso coli zzso zzso machinery an active hybrid zzso consisting of zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signal of zzso coli zzso This zzso zzso zzso strain is partially released into the zzso of the host cell following zzso by zzso zzso cells, whereas the zzso control zzso zzso zzso strain remains in the zzso
