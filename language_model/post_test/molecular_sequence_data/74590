A zzso zzso amplification zzso zzso was developed and evaluated for diagnosis of tropical zzso A set of six zzso was designed based on the unique gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain Ankara hypothetical protein zzso zzso The protocol for the reaction was setup and the specificity and sensitivity of the zzso were zzso The specificity experiment showed that zzso zzso amplified zzso zzso DNA zzso while no amplification was seen for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as bovine zzso DNA and water zzso When the sensitivity of zzso zzso was compared with that of conventional zzso a zzso higher sensitivity was found, with a detection limit of 10 zzso of zzso DNA isolated from a zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso product was confirmed by restriction zzso and zzso with zzso Green zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was applied for the diagnosis of zzso zzso in field samples and compared with reverse line zzso zzso demonstrating that results of the zzso zzso corresponded to those of zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is rapid and simple to run, zzso sensitive and specific and has potential usefulness for application in zzso studies on zzso zzso infection of zzso
