zzso zzso is a colonial marine zzso that belongs to the zzso zzso Previously we analyzed the activity of a zzso zzso in this species, and cloned a zzso zzso zzso In the present study we further analyzed the zzso activity of this animal, and found zzso evidence also for specific zzso zzso zzso we zzso a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso primer to clone two zzso zzso zzso coding for two different putative zzso each 243 zzso acids long, that differ within the coding region in 42 zzso acids and 99 zzso Both clones feature the characteristics of animal zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso putative zzso revealed the zzso characteristics of three zzso bridges, and higher similarity to zzso than to zzso zzso We therefore propose that the typical characteristics of zzso zzso evolved after the divergence of zzso and zzso
