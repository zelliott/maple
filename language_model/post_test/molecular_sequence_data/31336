zzso is the universal zzso acid for initiation of protein synthesis in all known zzso The zzso acid is coupled to a specific zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso In zzso coli, attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be dependent on zzso recognition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso We show here that zzso of the zzso of zzso to zzso or zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso or zzso In addition, zzso carrying these zzso acids zzso in zzso protein synthesis when provided with initiation zzso complementary to the modified zzso These results indicate that the sequence of the zzso of zzso dictates the identity of the zzso acid attached to the zzso zzso in zzso and that there are no subsequent steps which prevent initiation of zzso coli protein synthesis by zzso and zzso The methods described here also provide a convenient in zzso zzso for further examination of the role of the zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso zzso
