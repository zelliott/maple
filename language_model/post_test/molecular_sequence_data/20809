Comparative zzso was performed to identify proteins in the cardiac muscle of zzso zzso in initial response to excessive zzso Sixteen fish were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental zzso The control group was raised in zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso and the experimental group was raised in the same water with sodium zzso at a high concentration of 35 zzso After 3 days, proteins were extracted from the fish cardiac muscle and then were subjected to zzso PAGE zzso The zzso assisted laser zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to identify the proteins that were zzso expressed from the two groups of zzso Average of zzso and 275 proteins detected in the control and the experimental group, respectively, 167 spots were matched and 21 highly zzso expressed proteins were further analyzed by zzso zzso zzso and 15 were identified by zzso These 15 proteins include zzso reverse zzso zzso domain zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 10, and zzso zzso zzso with their previously known functions, these identified proteins seem to be involved in zzso and other functions associated with zzso These results will contribute to our understanding for the effects of zzso exposure on the zzso and zzso functions of zzso and the zzso mechanism of zzso causing zzso in both fish and zzso
