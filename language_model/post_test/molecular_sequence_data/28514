zzso of PG zzso zzso zzso a key zzso zzso in the PG zzso pathway, has been implicated in zzso zzso in humans and dogs in zzso but the molecular control of zzso expression in prostate cancer remains poorly zzso Using the dog model, the specific objectives of this study were to clone and characterize canine zzso and to study the regulation of its transcript, zzso and activity in a canine zzso zzso zzso cell line in zzso The canine zzso zzso was cloned by a combination of zzso library screening and zzso amplification of zzso ends, and shown to contain a zzso region of 28 zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso and a zzso region of zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes a zzso acid protein that is zzso identical to the human zzso The regulation of zzso protein and zzso synthesis was studied in zzso cells cultured in the absence or presence of graded doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso protein and zzso were present at low levels in control cells and were significantly induced after zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso with zzso being the strongest zzso Northern zzso analyses also revealed a significant increase of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso was not dependent on new protein synthesis zzso with zzso 10 zzso but was blocked by zzso inhibitor zzso D (5 zzso suggesting that zzso acts an immediate zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso Thus, this study characterizes for the first time the structure of canine zzso and provides an in zzso model to unravel the molecular basis of zzso expression in zzso zzso
