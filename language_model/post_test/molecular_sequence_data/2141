A zzso duplex DNA, which contains the translation termination zzso zzso in six reading frames and zzso operator sequence of zzso coli, has been zzso This zzso may be useful not only for producing a truncated protein zzso in a zzso but also for the identification of the precise coding region and translation direction of a bacterial gene in the cloned zzso zzso The synthetic zzso was inserted into zzso structural gene in zzso in order to test the in zzso zzso The zzso produced zzso zzso reduced in size, as expected from the zzso site, and rendered the host zzso zzso for zzso Thus, termination zzso and zzso operator in synthetic zzso appear to be functional in zzso
