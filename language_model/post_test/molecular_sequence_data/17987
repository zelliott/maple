zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso were found to differ in zzso on zzso zzso This difference is due to the absence of a functional zzso zzso which is necessary for efficient zzso on zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and DNA sequence analysis of the zzso locus revealed that zzso embraces one open reading frame coding for a zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is directed from left to right, towards the T region, and is strongly induced by the zzso compound zzso We established that zzso and zzso two genes known to be essential for induction of the zzso zzso are necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso is a member of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso for tumor induction by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that such zzso strains must express not only the zzso gene but also the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
