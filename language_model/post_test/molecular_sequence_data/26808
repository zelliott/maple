Although the zzso zzso of the zzso represents the most abundant and ubiquitous zzso in the ocean, very few laboratories have successfully cultured zzso zzso All of the zzso strains isolated thus far have been retrieved from the Oregon coast and the zzso zzso In this study, a modified zzso zzso with prolonged incubation at low temperature was applied in an effort to cultivate major zzso lineages in the East Sea, Western Pacific zzso Five to 10 cells were zzso into each well of zzso plates, followed by the incubation of the plates at 10 degrees C for 4, 8, 20, and 24 zzso Among a total of 35 isolated zzso 18 strains assigned to the zzso zzso were isolated after 8, 20, and 24 weeks of zzso whereas no zzso cells were detected in the samples after 4 weeks of zzso The zzso zzso zzso comprised zzso of the total zzso from the plates incubated for 20 and 24 zzso zzso cultures belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso The results of this study suggest that long-term incubation at low temperatures might prove an alternative for the efficient zzso of new zzso of the members of the zzso zzso
