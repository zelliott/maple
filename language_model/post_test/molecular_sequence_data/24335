We have used comparative sequence analysis to identify an zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso a zzso pathogen of zzso The sequence zzso this element is present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso relative to the zzso genes of other zzso It contains sequences similar to those of the zzso zzso of two previously described zzso zzso (in zzso zzso and zzso zzso although it lacks any recognizable internal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is only the second to be found in a zzso nuclear zzso the previously described zzso zzso occur at the same site in the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The host gene of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a highly zzso zzso zzso protein found as part of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso may be a useful drug target in addressing the zzso infections so prevalent in AIDS zzso
