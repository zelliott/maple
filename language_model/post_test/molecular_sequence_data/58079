Ten human zzso virus 6 zzso strains from different origins were studied using zzso to zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso two zzso zzso gave a positive reaction with the ten strains while three others only reacted with a fraction of these zzso This differential zzso permitted segregation of the ten strains into two zzso zzso groups, designated as I and zzso DNA was amplified from two regions of zzso zzso corresponding to the putative large zzso protein zzso gene and major zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The restriction analysis of amplified products using zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso showed identical patterns among the strains belonging to the same zzso group while zzso zzso and zzso provided distinct patterns among group II zzso The zzso sequence of amplified products was determined and zzso was found to be equal to or greater than zzso within each group whereas it was zzso between both zzso The number of zzso changes was higher when comparing two strains of different groups than when comparing two strains of the same zzso The zzso results of zzso and genetic analyses led us to consider zzso groups I and II as two distinct types of zzso zzso
