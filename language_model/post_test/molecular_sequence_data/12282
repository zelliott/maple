zzso zzso zzso degrades the aromatic acids zzso and zzso via two parallel sequences of reactions that zzso at zzso a zzso of which is zzso to form zzso acid cycle zzso zzso genes zzso zzso required for the complete degradation of zzso via the zzso branch of the zzso zzso have been zzso and a specific transport system for zzso has recently been zzso To better understand how zzso zzso coordinates the processes of zzso transport and metabolism to achieve complete degradation, the regulation of zzso the zzso transport zzso and that of zzso a gene required for both zzso and zzso degradation, were zzso zzso extension analysis and zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso which are adjacent on the zzso are transcribed zzso zzso a zzso zzso of several genes of the zzso pathway, is required for expression of both zzso and zzso and the zzso intermediate zzso zzso both zzso In addition to these expected regulatory zzso expression of zzso but not zzso is zzso by zzso This previously zzso layer of regulatory control in the zzso zzso appears to extend to the first two steps of zzso degradation, since levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were also depressed when cells were grown on a mixture of zzso and zzso The apparent consequence of zzso repression is that cells degrade zzso in preference to zzso These findings indicate that zzso transport is an integral feature of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and that transport plays a role in establishing the preferential degradation of zzso over zzso These results also demonstrate that there is communication between the two branches of the zzso zzso
