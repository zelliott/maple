The zzso zzso is the transforming gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso has revealed that zzso was generated by a large zzso that removed zzso of the zzso of the corresponding zzso In this study we prepared zzso to zzso and found that zzso encodes a 120 zzso protein which is localized in the zzso with a zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies show a striking pattern of brightly zzso zzso in zzso cells similar to that observed with zzso zzso In contrast to zzso which is exclusively zzso the zzso zzso by zzso zzso is localized in both the zzso and the zzso This zzso to the nucleus zzso with the ability of zzso to induce acute zzso zzso the truncated protein zzso by zzso can bind DNA, unlike the full-length zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso is involved in the retention of zzso in the zzso and the zzso of DNA zzso The findings also suggest that a truncated protein zzso by zzso exists in the nucleus of normal zzso
