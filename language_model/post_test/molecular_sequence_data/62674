zzso complement expression and zzso in the brain is hypothesized to contribute to the process of zzso in zzso neurological zzso Previous experiments have shown that the human zzso virus zzso zzso the low zzso production of complement factor zzso in zzso and zzso Since zzso of complement synthesis and zzso in the brain may represent a putative therapeutic goal to prevent zzso damage, we zzso the mechanism of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies using different zzso promoter zzso revealed that zzso activates the synthesis of zzso by stimulation of the zzso This zzso promoter zzso could be measured both in different zzso cell lines and in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter defined the zzso responsive element within the promoter region as a central element for the responsiveness of the zzso promoter towards the influence of zzso A binding site for the zzso factor zzso was identified as important regulatory domain within the zzso responsive element, since a point zzso which eliminates the binding capacity of zzso to this site also zzso the induction by zzso Similarly, the viral proteins zzso and zzso which had also been shown to stimulate the synthesis of zzso exert their effect via the zzso responsive element with binding of the zzso factor zzso representing the critical zzso Our experiments clearly define the mechanism for the induction of complement factors in the zzso brain and reveal a decisive role of the regulator protein zzso for the zzso increase in zzso zzso
