zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso across certain cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate the structure of the zzso in three of the membrane environments most commonly employed in zzso zzso zzso resonance assignments were determined for the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso and confirmed for the zzso in zzso zzso The secondary structure is shown to be zzso in all of the zzso zzso The zzso data were used as a set of restraints for a simulated zzso protocol that generated a family of three-dimensional structures of the zzso in zzso zzso which superimposed best between zzso 4 and zzso For these zzso the mean zzso zzso difference for the backbone atoms is zzso zzso zzso A from the average zzso The calculated zzso structures appear to be zzso with the bend centered at zzso zzso and zzso
