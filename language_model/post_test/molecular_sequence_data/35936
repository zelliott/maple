zzso coli produces a zzso zzso zzso that belongs to a family of peptides that mediate several zzso diseases, including zzso zzso and epidemic zzso in infants and zzso The zzso zzso consists of 18 or 19 zzso acids and is zzso by genes specified on a zzso zzso zzso is induced by specific binding to high affinity receptors that reside on the brush border cell membrane of the small zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso a sequence of events that culminate in the release of fluid and zzso into the zzso zzso These events include the stimulation of particulate zzso zzso and subsequent increase of zzso zzso zzso involvement of particulate protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The release of zzso acid and production of zzso and/or zzso have also been implicated in the action of zzso Evidence indicates that the zzso zzso zzso may be a single zzso membrane zzso
