zzso recognition proteins zzso form a recently discovered protein family, which is zzso from insect to zzso and is implicated in the innate immune system by interacting zzso degrading microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of this family of pattern recognition receptors and is involved in insect Toll zzso We report here the crystal structure of zzso at zzso A resolution, which represents the first example of a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso reveals an overall structure conservation with an L-shaped zzso groove that is likely the zzso zzso core binding site, but further suggests some possible functional zzso between recognition and zzso zzso zzso with sequence analysis, zzso does not contain the zzso zzso zzso found in zzso zzso However, substitution of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso along with an altered zzso zzso zzso assembles a constellation of zzso that resembles a modified zzso zzso The zzso juxtaposition to a zzso zzso and a zzso oxygen zzso along with conservation of the zzso water zzso found in zzso tantalizingly suggests some zzso function for this member of zzso zzso
