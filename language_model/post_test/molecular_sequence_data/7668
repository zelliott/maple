Human acute zzso leukemia cell lines represent valuable tools to investigate distinct steps of the complex regulatory pathways underlying T cell zzso zzso and zzso A case in point are V delta zzso delta 3 and subsequent V delta zzso delta zzso alpha zzso observed in human zzso zzso cells as well as in normal zzso The functional expression of these unusual zzso delta zzso alpha hybrids is almost exclusively prevented by alternative zzso zzso In this report we show that alternative zzso at cryptic zzso donor sites within V elements is not a unique feature of hybrid zzso zzso zzso Among seven V alpha families analyzed by zzso alternatively spliced products were observed in zzso alpha zzso containing V alpha 1 or V alpha 14 zzso In contrast to normal peripheral blood cells and zzso the leukemia cell line zzso expressing functional V alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha transcripts lacked evidence of zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso
