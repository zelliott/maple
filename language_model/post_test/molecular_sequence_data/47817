zzso zzso that are recognized by zzso can be identified through screening of synthetic zzso zzso We have shown that these mimicry zzso share sequence similarity with the corresponding natural zzso and that mimicry sequences can be used for the definition of protein derived zzso zzso from zzso This can be done by either zzso searching or pattern zzso Here we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of zzso searching as an alternative for the generally zzso recognition pattern zzso We show that only for part of the library derived mimicry zzso the degree of similarity to the natural zzso may be high enough for successful zzso searching in small zzso
