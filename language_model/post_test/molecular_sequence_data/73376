zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso joining, and constant gene segments were cloned and zzso zzso sequence analyses of 15 zzso clones from a zzso zzso zzso library identified 7 unique variable gene zzso 5 separate joining zzso and a single constant zzso Based on comparison with human zzso horse variable segments could be grouped into either family 1 of zzso zzso clan I or family 4 of zzso clan II zzso zzso All horse sequences had a relatively zzso 16 base pair zzso segment in framework 3 which was recognized with high specificity in zzso chain reaction by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determining regions zzso had considerable zzso in predicted zzso acid content and length but also included the presence of relatively zzso zzso and several zzso sequences that may be necessary in formation of the beta chain main structure and zzso of zzso sites through interaction with light chain zzso zzso analysis of joining regions revealed the presence of nearly zzso 3' regions similar to those found in human and mouse zzso A single horse zzso constant region zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso comparison of the horse constant region predicted zzso acid sequence with those from zzso other species revealed the presence of 53 zzso zzso with particularly zzso sequences within the third and fourth zzso zzso analysis using a zzso zzso showed closest similarity of the horse zzso zzso constant region gene to human and dog zzso Together, these findings provide insights into the comparative biology of zzso as well as data for additional detailed studies of the horse immune system and investigation of zzso zzso
