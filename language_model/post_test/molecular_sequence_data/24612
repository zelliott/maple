The zzso protein is a unique zzso zzso zzso believed to zzso in zzso It possesses a zzso zzso portion that is rich in positively charged zzso and many zzso zzso In the present study, signal sequences in the zzso zzso were examined for zzso zzso and membrane zzso When the full-length protein was expressed in zzso cells, it localized in the zzso zzso and on the cell zzso Furthermore, the protein was fully zzso When green fluorescent protein was fused after the second zzso or third zzso zzso segment, the fusion proteins were targeted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso pattern was the same as that of fusion proteins in which green fluorescent protein was fused after zzso of zzso In an in zzso system, zzso behaved as a signal zzso that directs the zzso of the following zzso chain and is then processed zzso The next zzso segment zzso halted zzso and eventually became a zzso zzso The zzso zzso segment zzso of zzso also behaved as a signal zzso Cell zzso studies using zzso against the 15 zzso zzso indicated that zzso protein localized in the zzso zzso of rat liver zzso All of the zzso molecules in liver tissue possess an zzso zzso sugar zzso These findings indicate that zzso protein is targeted to the zzso membrane via the zzso signal zzso and is sorted to zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso
