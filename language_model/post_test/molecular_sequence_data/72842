As a result of zzso zzso the zzso gene is fused to a variety of zzso factors in human solid zzso In Ewing tumors zzso can be fused to four different members of the zzso family, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have identified a new member of the zzso family, called zzso which is fused to zzso in a subset of Ewing zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein which contains an zzso DNA binding domain closely related to that of zzso and zzso However, the zzso portion of zzso is only 42 zzso acids long which suggests that zzso is lacking important zzso regulatory zzso contained in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso end of zzso is rich in zzso zzso which may indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso by three zzso and is located on zzso zzso zzso expression was only detected in adult prostate and small zzso but not in other adult nor in fetal zzso thus indicating that zzso has a restricted expression zzso Following a scheme similar to previously described zzso in Ewing tumors, a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso to the zzso DNA binding domain of zzso
