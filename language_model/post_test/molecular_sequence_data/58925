Spreading of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso on zzso requires zzso zzso of zzso B zzso and subsequent exposure of the new beta zzso zzso To further understand the interactions between zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso binding of zzso to zzso zzso was measured with zzso zzso zzso in parallel with zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso zzso in an indirect zzso zzso zzso To accomplish this, large, soluble fragments of zzso were prepared by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso served as the control zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and cells in suspension in a zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso bound only 50% as well to zzso zzso with no significant binding of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D, or zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks beta zzso zzso bound the zzso beta zzso serum zzso zzso zzso but neither a scrambled beta zzso zzso zzso nor zzso of beta zzso beta zzso or beta zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited zzso by the beta zzso zzso and zzso by the B beta zzso zzso but not by free beta zzso zzso or zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited zzso zzso by zzso in a zzso manner; the same zzso of zzso inhibited binding of beta zzso by zzso zzso but not the zzso binding of zzso to zzso These data suggest that in their native zzso zzso B beta zzso sequences are unavailable for binding to zzso and that zzso exposure of beta zzso is required for binding by a zzso zzso mechanism at the new zzso of zzso
