To zzso the function of zzso its zzso in zzso zzso was zzso A specific zzso zzso zzso detected the soluble zzso zzso exclusively in the zzso of rat heart, zzso liver, zzso skeletal muscle, zzso and brain, but not rat zzso zzso proteins in skeletal muscle were also zzso zzso PAGE showed a single zzso protein band zzso to zzso zzso This band also stained with zzso zzso zzso PAGE and zzso analysis indicated that all of the zzso was present in association with zzso of a constant zzso the molecular ratio of zzso to zzso was roughly zzso In addition, all zzso in the zzso zzso was found in association with zzso These results suggest the possibility that skeletal muscle zzso controls the length of zzso zzso
