We have previously characterized the U2 small nuclear zzso zzso gene family of zzso zzso To find out the structural features of upstream and downstream zzso regions that are shared by different zzso genes in higher plants we have isolated the gene zzso a 125 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the cloned gene was demonstrated in zzso transformed tobacco zzso and by transient expression in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that the zzso zzso contains zzso copies of the zzso zzso zzso of upstream zzso regions revealed two elements zzso between all plant zzso genes characterized so far: the sequence zzso zzso region, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso around position zzso The coding regions in all genes are followed by the sequence zzso zzso which may zzso to a termination and/or processing zzso
