zzso zzso modifications zzso are directly involved in protein function and cellular zzso Among them, zzso and zzso are particularly important modifications on proteins located at zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the combined detection using zzso and zzso is limited mainly due to protocol zzso 

In this study, we developed a novel method for both zzso and zzso detection from a single sample zzso in which a titanium dioxide zzso was used to capture the zzso and the zzso solution was processed for capturing zzso zzso using zzso zzso 

By using 1 zzso of protein from kidney tissue zzso from normal and diseased rats, we zzso identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in normal and disease zzso respectively, by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso 

Compared with individual zzso zzso the combined zzso analysis clearly provides more broad implications for zzso related to the pathological status and discovery of zzso zzso Furthermore, the combined protocol thoroughly showed its advantages in enrichment efficiency and biological interpretation compared with current zzso
