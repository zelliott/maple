The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains seven open reading frames with zzso to zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso Based on sequence similarities among putative zzso derived from various zzso zzso we designated the seven putative zzso members as zzso zzso zzso and zzso clusters according to the sequence of their zzso zzso zzso The zzso cluster consists of four members, named zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso genes were zzso expressed in zzso zzso The zzso proteins were characterized with an emphasis on the ability to destroy various zzso the electron zzso and the zzso zzso structure as a zzso zzso All zzso members, as an zzso zzso zzso family, exerted the highest zzso activity toward a zzso zzso using an electron from zzso zzso protein analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are distributed in the zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso are localized in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins showed that the level of zzso in the zzso is comparable to that in the zzso cell, whereas the other zzso members were not significantly detected in the zzso The zzso responses of zzso zzso genes to various zzso stresses and growth environments were zzso Their intrinsic differences in zzso responsiveness and cellular zzso suggest that this large zzso cluster is designed as an zzso strategy to efficiently combat zzso zzso in zzso zzso that perform zzso photosynthesis and zzso zzso
