zzso infection of host cells primarily depends on binding of the virus to a specific cell surface zzso In order to characterize the binding protein for group B zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins of different cell lines were tested in virus overlay zzso zzso A prominent zzso protein with a molecular mass of 100 zzso was detected in various zzso human and monkey cell lines but was not detected in zzso cell zzso The specificity of zzso binding to the zzso protein on zzso human cells was substantiated by binding of all six zzso of zzso and by competition zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso virus did not bind to the zzso zzso zzso A fraction of zzso membrane proteins enriched in the range of 100 zzso showed functional activity by transforming infectious zzso zzso into zzso zzso In order to purify this zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins from zzso cells were separated by zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso followed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso fragments of the zzso protein indicated that this zzso zzso protein is a cell surface protein related to zzso These results were confirmed by zzso of the zzso protein with zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso membrane protein acts as a specific binding protein for the six zzso of zzso
