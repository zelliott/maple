The human C zzso gene expresses two membrane zzso heavy chain zzso which differ in the sequence that encodes their zzso zzso zzso In the long zzso zzso zzso this domain contains a stretch of 52 zzso acids which are absent in the short zzso zzso We have now generated B cell zzso cell lines that express these two zzso and show that both types of zzso form functional B cell zzso receptors zzso Both receptors associate with the zzso zzso as well as with protein zzso that are capable of zzso this zzso Upon their zzso both receptors can activate protein zzso zzso that zzso the same zzso zzso Both zzso receptors also associate with two novel proteins that do not bind to zzso Apart from these similarities, the two zzso show several differences of which some are analogous to the differences between the zzso and zzso First, the zzso is transported to the cell surface at a higher rate than the zzso Second, the two zzso associate with differently zzso zzso zzso the zzso associates with the completely zzso form, whereas the zzso associates with an zzso zzso that is partially sensitive to zzso zzso Third, the zzso of protein zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso is significantly different for the two zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso leads to growth zzso of the B cell zzso whereas signaling through the zzso does not affect the cellular zzso These data show that the two human membrane zzso zzso assemble into functionally distinct zzso receptors which can induce different cellular zzso
