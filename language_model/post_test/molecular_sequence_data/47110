The zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso its own synthesis by binding to a structural element in both its zzso and its zzso The three-dimensional structures of zzso in the free zzso zzso and the zzso bound zzso zzso forms have been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Both protein structures contain four alternating zzso and four zzso segments and adopt an overall zzso that is an zzso zzso zzso representing a unique zzso Three zzso on one end of the zzso sandwich have been mapped as the zzso binding site on the basis of structural comparison, chemical shift zzso and the zzso nuclear zzso effects to the zzso The structural and dynamic comparison of f zzso and b zzso reveals that local dynamics may play an important role in the zzso zzso The fourth zzso in b zzso is longer than in f zzso and is stabilized by zzso zzso The exposed zzso surface that is buried upon zzso binding may provide the energy necessary to drive secondary structure formation, and may account for the increased stability of b zzso
