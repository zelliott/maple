zzso a marine isolate of the zzso zzso was found to produce a new zzso of the zzso zzso The relevant zzso gene zzso was cloned from zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso activity analysis revealed that the optimum temperature and pH for the zzso zzso zzso were around 40 degrees C and zzso zzso was demonstrated to be useful in two aspects: first, as an zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso could be employed in the recovery of DNA from zzso zzso second, as a zzso zzso zzso was explored at the genetic level and used as a reporter in the construction of a zzso signal trap which proved to be a simple and efficient molecular tool for the selection of genes zzso zzso proteins from both zzso and zzso zzso
