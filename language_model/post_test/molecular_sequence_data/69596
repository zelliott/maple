Movement of zzso zzso within infected zzso cells provides a simple model system to study the mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso is required to induce the zzso of host zzso filaments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Cell 68, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso 11, zzso In this study, an zzso deletion zzso within the zzso gene was constructed and introduced into the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso This zzso resulted in a decrease (3 orders of zzso in zzso for zzso In tissue culture cells, the zzso zzso was absolutely defective for the nucleation of zzso filaments and consequently was impaired in zzso zzso zzso raised to a synthetic zzso encompassing the zzso repeat zzso of zzso was used to characterize the expression of the zzso zzso The zzso protein derived from zzso bacteria migrated as a zzso zzso upon zzso whereas the protein from infected cells migrated as three distinct zzso one that zzso with the zzso zzso form and two slightly larger zzso Treatment of infected cells with zzso acid resulted in decreased amounts of all forms of zzso and the appearance of a larger species of zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso from zzso bacteria resulted in conversion of the larger two species to the zzso zzso zzso of infected cells with zzso followed by zzso showed that the largest molecular form of zzso was zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso is zzso during zzso zzso The significance of the zzso modification of zzso is not known, but we speculate that it may zzso the zzso activity of zzso
