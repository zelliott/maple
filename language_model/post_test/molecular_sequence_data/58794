zzso mechanisms involved in the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso transcribed zzso 1 zzso 1) zzso a late step of zzso zzso processing in zzso remain largely unknown, mostly due to the lack of faithful in zzso zzso To identify the minimal zzso signals required for this reaction, we studied the processing of truncated human zzso gene transcripts zzso expressed upon zzso of zzso zzso into cultured mouse zzso We observed that processing at this site was faithfully reproduced with transcripts containing only 60 zzso of zzso zzso and the adjacent 103 zzso of ITS 1, but was abolished or severely altered by further zzso of either zzso zzso this minimal transcript zzso within its zzso zzso part, long sequences complementary to both zzso and zzso small zzso zzso zzso The zzso elements essential for the reaction were studied further by zzso zzso The zzso zzso complementary region in zzso zzso was not required for faithful processing at the zzso zzso 1 zzso Also, processing at this site was not appreciably altered by random substitution of zzso ITS 1 sequences (including the zzso terminal zzso or of the terminal zzso of mature zzso zzso zzso in the zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso zzso including the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not alter appreciably the formation of the zzso zzso 3' end, showing that the zzso zzso was not required for processing at this zzso Two highly zzso zzso zzso elements acted as major zzso signals for processing at the 3' end, the zzso sequence immediately preceding the zzso zzso and the 3' strand of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso zzso zzso restoring the potential for zzso formation, but not zzso zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso at the 3' end of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso may be a zzso factor in the zzso zzso at the 3' end of zzso zzso
