A zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a soil sample from zzso zzso Province, zzso zzso The zzso grew zzso at 30 zzso pH zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso type and zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso and zzso The total polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one unidentified zzso and one unidentified zzso The zzso was zzso zzso acids were not zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis of this strain based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed zzso similarity to recognized species of the zzso zzso The low level of zzso zzso to other species of the zzso zzso and the many zzso properties that distinguished strain zzso from recognized species of this zzso demonstrated that isolate zzso should be classified as representing a novel species of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this novel zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso AB zzso
