A new concept is presented to design and zzso modified zzso in order to extend the range of zzso DNA sequences that can be recognized by zzso via triple zzso zzso The DNA target is composed of adjacent zzso zzso where the zzso sequences alternate on the two DNA zzso zzso zzso triple zzso are formed with each zzso domain of the target zzso The two zzso zzso were joined together via an appropriate zzso between the two terminal bases with either a zzso or a zzso zzso zzso modeling was used to predict the optimal length of the zzso bridging two terminal zzso The interaction of DNA with such a modified zzso containing a zzso linkage was studied by zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso They provide experimental evidence that the zzso does form a switched triple zzso on this extended DNA target zzso The binding of the so-called zzso zzso is enhanced as compared to the two zzso parental zzso which form triple zzso with each zzso domain of the target zzso
