The Mediterranean basin is an area of high diversity and zzso but the age and origin of its zzso are still largely zzso Here we use zzso zzso based on approximately zzso base pairs of the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso I to establish the relationships of 27 of the 34 endemic zzso species of diving zzso in the family zzso and to investigate their level of zzso Using a molecular clock approach, zzso of these species were estimated to be of zzso origin, with four to six of them from the Late zzso ( approximately 100 zzso zzso A second, lower zzso frequency peak was assigned to Late zzso or Early zzso Analysis of the zzso ranges showed that endemic species placed in the tip zzso of the trees are significantly more likely to be zzso with their sisters than endemic species at lower zzso zzso zzso sister species are also significantly younger than zzso zzso in agreement with an zzso mode of zzso and limited subsequent range zzso These results strongly suggest that for some zzso zzso populations were isolated during the zzso long enough to zzso and apparently did not expand their ranges to zzso areas north of the zzso This is in contradiction to observations from fossil zzso in areas further north, which document large range movements associated with the zzso glacial cycles hypothesized to suppress population isolation and zzso zzso
