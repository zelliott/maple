A zzso has been constructed from zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by plaque zzso using the zzso from pea as a zzso zzso The zzso comprises the entire zzso coding zzso A putative zzso signal is zzso zzso analysis based on the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that the zzso gene family represents a separate ancient branch within the zzso zzso zzso It can be shown that the zzso gene family and other distinct branches of the zzso have its zzso origin before the separation of primary zzso This further demonstrates that already very early in evolution, a broad diversification of the zzso zzso led to the formation of the zzso
