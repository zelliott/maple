Two genes zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso 2A have been cloned from a zzso zzso zzso library using a rabbit protein zzso 2A zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso genes are genetically linked on zzso IV and are predicted to zzso zzso each with zzso zzso acid sequence identity to rabbit type 2A protein zzso indicating once again the extraordinarily high degree of sequence conservation shown by zzso from different zzso The two zzso genes show less than zzso zzso acid sequence divergence from each other and while disruption of either zzso gene alone is without any major effect, the double disruption is zzso This indicates that protein zzso 2A activity is an essential cellular function in zzso zzso of type 2A protein zzso activity in zzso strains lacking one or other of the genes indicates that they account for most, if not all, protein zzso 2A activity in the zzso
