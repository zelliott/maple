This study investigated a strategy by which zzso are displayed to engage T zzso A zzso composite containing binding sites was characterized in zzso and explored as an zzso system in zzso The composite consists of two zzso zzso zzso zzso to as zzso and zzso appended with six consecutive zzso at the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the two peptides integrated into a single zzso Prior to zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso adopts a mixed zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso exists predominately in zzso zzso The composite of zzso was found to display zzso using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso T zzso zzso were found zzso displayed on the zzso assembly using zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso as an zzso When mounted with zzso zzso the system was shown to capture zzso cells in a mixed population of zzso zzso were concentrated in the subcutaneous space in mice when zzso with zzso and zzso along with protein zzso and zzso zzso as a zzso We report here the use of zzso peptides to display zzso in zzso the results indicating that the design can be used as a platform for engaging specific zzso of zzso for the purpose of immune zzso
