zzso exert their regulatory potential on gene expression through different nuclear and zzso zzso A direct nuclear approach is the interaction of zzso with specific target sequences of DNA, zzso response elements zzso or zzso zzso can be grouped into perfect and imperfect zzso sequences with the imperfect sequences differing from the consensus sequence in one or more zzso and being less responsive to the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso sequence and the zzso zzso involved can substantially alter zzso zzso In addition, zzso between zzso and other nuclear zzso factors profoundly influences gene zzso Here, we focus on the recent advances in the understanding of the structure of zzso and how zzso are recruited to zzso zzso known target genes for zzso action could help us to understand the potential risks and benefits of the administration of this steroid to zzso
