zzso growth zzso zzso affects cellular zzso zzso and interaction with the zzso zzso primarily through interaction with the type I and type II zzso zzso The type II receptors for zzso and zzso contain putative zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned that shared a zzso zzso domain with the type II zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso alone did not increase cell surface binding of zzso but zzso with the type II zzso zzso caused zzso to bind to zzso zzso which had the size of the type I zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited binding of zzso to the type II zzso in a dominant negative zzso zzso interactions and zzso ratios between the type I and II receptors may therefore determine the extent of zzso binding and the resulting biological zzso
