Previously known zzso zzso of several zzso DNA zzso have now been shown to be zzso zzso that cleave zzso DNA or zzso at the zzso end of a zzso zzso zzso was not coupled to zzso although zzso accelerated the rate of zzso zzso The zzso appeared to gain access to the zzso site by moving from the free end of a zzso extension to the zzso of the duplex, where zzso took zzso zzso zzso arms up to 200 zzso long were zzso from such a zzso Essentially any linear zzso zzso acid can be targeted for specific zzso by the zzso zzso of DNA zzso through zzso with an zzso that converts the desired zzso site into a zzso
