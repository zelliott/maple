A zzso protein was isolated from seminal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso of the zzso protein previously found in the muscle of the zzso body wall, the isolated protein was assigned to the first zzso zzso because of its zzso mobility, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and identical zzso sequence of segments obtained by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso studies with zzso preparations of developing male germ cells revealed characteristic changes of the local distribution of zzso and zzso during zzso These changes were correlated with the zzso transport processes and structural zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso formed a zzso structure in zzso bridges connecting the germ cells to a central zzso during the zzso zzso An zzso zzso reacting with both zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso was concentrated at the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso zzso was also localized in these regions, with intense zzso in the zzso part of zzso and young zzso in which the zzso complex and zzso zzso The zzso zzso further stained the periphery of the zzso This zzso gradually reduced during zzso maturation and covered about half of the length of the nucleus in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso implied a functional significance of this zzso protein for the zzso of the zzso zzso during earthworm zzso
