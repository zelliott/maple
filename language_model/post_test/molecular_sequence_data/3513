zzso zzso 2 is a recently cloned zzso displaying a high degree of sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso the zzso member of the zzso zzso of zzso Whereas zzso is involved in the metabolism of several zzso peptides by plasma zzso of various cells, the zzso properties and zzso functions of zzso are zzso Here we characterize the zzso zzso and zzso specificity of two alternatively spliced zzso of zzso in Chinese zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the two cell lines, both zzso are type II zzso inserted in the zzso zzso as inactive zzso zzso detected by zzso analysis of zzso zzso was zzso and more efficient in the zzso cell zzso The zzso activity of both zzso zzso from zzso cells reveals comparable zzso in terms of model zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was compared with that of zzso regarding zzso of zzso zzso modes of zzso zzso zzso rates and apparent affinities of zzso zzso Although all zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso activity, albeit with different zzso and many peptides were zzso at the same zzso bond by both zzso differences could be observed, zzso in the zzso of zzso hormone and zzso which occurred at different sites and more efficiently in the case of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso in zzso patterns and in tissue distribution indicate that zzso and zzso play distinct zzso roles in spite of their high degree of sequence zzso
