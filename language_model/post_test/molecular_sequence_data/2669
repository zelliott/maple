Numerous zzso structural gene zzso of zzso zzso have been generated by random zzso and zzso characterized zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso All zzso selected by zzso and zzso for altered zzso in the zzso reaction had zzso in the alpha zzso One of these zzso zzso has normal or slightly enhanced zzso stability and enhanced zzso binding affinity but a zzso quantum yield of zzso and dramatically altered stability of the zzso intermediate zzso with a different zzso chain length dependence from that of the zzso zzso To better understand the structural aspects of the zzso binding site in bacterial zzso we have cloned the zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso determined the zzso sequence of the entire zzso zzso and determined the zzso to be zzso resulting in a change of zzso at position 227 of the alpha zzso To confirm that this zzso caused the altered kinetic properties of zzso we reverted the zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso to the zzso sequence and found that the resulting zzso is indistinguishable from the zzso zzso with respect to quantum yield, zzso binding zzso and intermediate zzso zzso rates with zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the cause of the zzso zzso zzso whether the zzso is due to loss of the zzso zzso or to the properties of the zzso zzso we have constructed zzso with zzso zzso and zzso at alpha zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
