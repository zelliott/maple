zzso zzso is an zzso progressive zzso of the zzso retinal zzso zzso and zzso Recently, the zzso gene was isolated and the zzso zzso in the gene were detected in patients with zzso In a previous study, we described a Japanese family with zzso who had a zzso in the zzso zzso In the present study, we performed extensive analysis of the zzso gene in patients with zzso from several institutions in zzso 

Twenty-six patients with zzso and 5 unaffected females from 22 independently zzso families were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene were screened by zzso zzso zzso The DNA fragments suspected of any variations were directly zzso 

Fifteen different zzso including one previously reported zzso were detected in 18 zzso In addition, carrier status was proven in four unaffected females found to be zzso for the zzso zzso 

Fifteen different zzso of the zzso gene were detected in 18 Japanese zzso There were no hot spots for the zzso and no zzso zzso The results show that zzso gene defects cause zzso in Japanese patients, and the zzso in these Japanese patients differed from the zzso reported for zzso patients in Europe, Canada, and America except for zzso and zzso These findings suggest that the zzso occurred independently in the Japanese zzso
