The major surface zzso of zzso zzso referred to as zzso is a zinc zzso of zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso membrane zzso Recent studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso expressed by the zzso insect cell system was zzso as a zzso zzso zzso that required zzso for full zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso Gene 134, zzso To extend these studies, the active site of zzso major zzso was characterized by zzso zzso and the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso was studied using both zzso and cell surface expression zzso To determine whether the proposed active site of zzso major zzso zzso to other well characterized zinc zzso the proposed zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso was changed to zzso Using a transient expression system in zzso cells, expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene resulted in zzso with no zzso zzso activity, whereas expression of the zzso zzso gene resulted in zzso with a level of zzso activity similar to native zzso Thus, the mechanism of zzso zzso activity is predicted to be zzso to that of other well characterized zinc zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso with zzso resulted in removal of the pro region, ultimately generating the mature zzso This processing included the removal of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and occurred by a zzso zzso since the addition of previously activated zzso did not lead to an enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso of zzso is consistent with the zzso switch mechanism proposed for zzso zzso and thus has been zzso from zzso to zzso
