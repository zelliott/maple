Due to the functional zzso between milk and plasma zzso and the molecular zzso between a plasma protein zzso zzso zzso and a milk protein zzso we thought to characterize a zzso sequence in milk zzso A zzso sequence theoretically analogous to zzso was found in human zzso This study compares in 2 species zzso and zzso in zzso (on zzso zzso and in zzso (in an experimental model of zzso zzso relative to zzso the effects of zzso and of a modified sequence zzso In zzso in the zzso while zzso and zzso did not affect significantly the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso had a significant zzso zzso on the guinea-pig zzso zzso and zzso had an zzso effect of similar zzso and zzso a minimal zzso In zzso and in the two species, zzso and zzso had an zzso activity much more pronounced than zzso Additionally, when zzso and zzso were studied together in zzso no more than additive effect could be noticed in the zzso But in zzso in the guinea-pig and even more pronounced in the zzso a zzso activity was zzso These results indicate that zzso a zzso present in the human zzso zzso has, in zzso an zzso activity and, in zzso an zzso zzso The mechanism of action is probably different from that of zzso and is specific of the sequence since a similar zzso sequence loses most of these zzso
