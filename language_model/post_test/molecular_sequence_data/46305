zzso peptides zzso can zzso across the cell membrane and have been extensively studied for the delivery of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso in plants have only recently been zzso We showed that the intact zzso and a zzso zzso protein zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso mosaic virus zzso can penetrate the zzso of plant zzso but are trapped by the zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso derived from the zzso region of the zzso zzso can enter barley zzso and cells of intact barley and zzso zzso An inhibitor of the zzso reduced zzso entry, while treatment with zzso changed the cellular zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso of the green zzso protein zzso into the cell when zzso fused to zzso or when present in trans of zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the sequence known to bind zzso zzso and it can deliver zzso zzso into cells, resulting in viral zzso as well as deliver zzso zzso that can induce gene zzso
