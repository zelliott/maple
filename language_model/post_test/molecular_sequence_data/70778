The zzso zzso zzso protein contains highly zzso zzso acid sequences zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso The NC protein of zzso leukemia viruses contains one NC zzso finger and zzso that were competent in metal binding zzso and zzso packaged zzso levels of full-length viral zzso but were not zzso These studies were extended to human zzso virus type 1 zzso a virus with two NC zzso zzso zzso with combinations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fingers in each position of zzso NC were zzso zzso particles contained the normal complement of processed viral zzso Four zzso packaged roughly zzso levels of zzso zzso whereas the remaining zzso packaged reduced zzso zzso with zzso zzso position NC fingers were replication zzso One interesting zzso containing a zzso zzso finger in the zzso position of NC, packaged zzso levels of viral zzso and showed approximately zzso zzso levels of zzso when examined in zzso zzso cells containing an zzso zzso zzso However, this particular zzso was replication defective in zzso zzso all other zzso were replication defective over the zzso course of the zzso Two long terminal repeat viral DNA species could be detected in the zzso zzso but not in any of the other zzso zzso These studies show that the zzso zzso finger position is more sensitive to zzso than the zzso position with respect to zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso NC zzso finger is required for early infection zzso The evolutionary pressure to maintain zzso NC zzso fingers depends mainly on its function in infection zzso in addition to its function in zzso zzso
