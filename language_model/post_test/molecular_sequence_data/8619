The zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso virus zzso is a type II integral membrane protein that is expressed at the infected cell zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as two zzso zzso proteins shortened at their zzso by either 18 zzso delta zzso or 223 zzso delta zzso zzso acids were constructed and studied in a transient expression system in zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, assembly of zzso delta 18 into zzso was diminished while zzso delta 223 remained in a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that neither zzso was functional at the cell zzso These studies show that the zzso zzso of the zzso protein is essential to its proper folding and assembly into zzso while its zzso 18 zzso acids are essential for the zzso zzso function of the zzso
