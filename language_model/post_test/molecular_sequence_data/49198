The diversity among a set of bacterial strains that have the capacity to degrade total petroleum zzso zzso in soil contaminated with oily sludge zzso hydrocarbon waste from oil zzso was zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compound, and zzso zzso of crude zzso The 150 bacterial zzso which could degrade zzso were isolated from soil samples obtained from diverse zzso regions of zzso All the zzso were zzso characterized and identified with a zzso microbial identification system and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predominated among the 150 zzso obtained from six different geographically diverse zzso Of the zzso 29 strains of zzso zzso were selected for evaluating their genetic zzso This was performed by molecular typing with repetitive sequence zzso zzso with primer sets ERIC zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and unique zzso fingerprints were distinguished by these molecular typing zzso The 29 strains of zzso zzso were separated into 12 distinguishable zzso groups by zzso and into seven zzso patterns by zzso zzso The genetic diversity of the strains was related to the different zzso isolation sites, type of oily zzso and age of contamination of the zzso These results indicate that a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be used as a high-resolution zzso zzso method for zzso zzso diversity among strains of zzso zzso
