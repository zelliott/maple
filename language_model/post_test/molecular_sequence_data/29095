We determined the zzso effects of conditional expression of zzso zzso factor zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso on the time course of zzso expression and lung zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular injury in a model of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Studies were made in mice zzso with the zzso zzso zzso construct zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso was driven by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso expression of zzso in pulmonary vascular zzso that paralleled the zzso zzso zzso of both was evident at 1 h after zzso coli challenge, peaked at 3-6 zzso and returned to zzso level within 48 zzso We observed that increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso migration induced by zzso coli challenge were reversed in a zzso manner following zzso expression in zzso zzso expression also prevented the progression of lung vascular injury and zzso formation following zzso coli zzso Thus the conditional expression of zzso using the zzso promoter can reverse, in a zzso manner, lung zzso zzso and vascular injury induced by zzso zzso The results support the model that initial engagement of zzso zzso enables the further recruitment of additional zzso into lung zzso such that zzso continue to zzso and migrate after zzso coli zzso
