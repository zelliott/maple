The zzso zinc finger is a small independently folded DNA recognition motif found in many zzso zzso which zzso zinc through two zzso and two zzso zzso A database of zzso zinc fingers from 221 proteins has been constructed and a program for analysis of aligned sequences zzso This paper describes sequence analysis aimed at determining the zzso acid positions that recognize the DNA zzso by comparing two types of sequence zzso Using the idea that long runs of adjacent zinc fingers have arisen from internal gene duplication, the conservation of each position of the finger within the runs was zzso The conservation of each position of the finger between zzso proteins from different species was also zzso A correlation of the two types of conservation showed clusters of related zzso zzso One cluster of three positions was found to be especially variable within long runs, but highly zzso between corresponding fingers of zzso zzso these positions are predicted to be the base contact zzso They match the zzso acid positions that contact the bases in the zzso structure determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An adjacent cluster of four positions on the plot may also be associated with DNA zzso This analysis shows that the base recognition positions can be identified even in the absence of a known structure for a zinc zzso These results are zzso to zinc fingers where the structure of the complex is unknown, in particular suggesting that the individual zzso interaction seen in the zzso structure has been zzso in many zinc zzso zzso
