zzso zzso a zzso zzso was shown to be zzso by the participation of a zzso membrane protein zzso To identify the gene zzso zzso peptides of zzso were partially zzso to enable the synthesis of zzso zzso suitable as zzso for the detection of the zzso zzso With this strategy, we identified a zzso region of about zzso 4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso Analysis of the complete deduced protein sequence suggests that zzso is expressed as a zzso with a structure in the zzso region common to zzso proteins and an zzso or zzso zzso structure in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso an additional four open reading frames zzso zzso the four core zzso of an active transport system, zzso were zzso The organization of the zzso gene and zzso in a zzso active zzso structure was demonstrated in Northern zzso and reverse zzso zzso as all zzso zzso detected a common zzso of zzso zzso zzso extension analysis revealed that the zzso initiation site was localized 323 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso character of the zzso protein was confirmed by zzso zzso and strongly suggests that the zzso zzso zzso represents zzso the zzso domain of a zzso transport system in zzso zzso
