The mouse growth hormone zzso zzso protein zzso gene produces several distinct zzso forms through alternative zzso including zzso zzso the zzso growth hormone zzso zzso and the soluble growth zzso protein zzso zzso are also zzso in their zzso regions due to alternative selection of two major zzso untranslated region zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso Here we report the cloning of all mouse zzso coding zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso the most widely expressed zzso The mouse zzso gene contains 11 coding zzso 9 of which are zzso in size and sequence to human zzso zzso zzso The two mouse zzso that do not have zzso in the human gene are designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso located between zzso 4 and 5, encodes an zzso acid segment of the zzso binding domain that is unique to mouse zzso and zzso Analysis by reverse zzso chain reaction indicated that zzso zzso is zzso present in mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso tail and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a single zzso located at least 27 zzso upstream of zzso 2 and at least 12 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso start sites of zzso zzso were mapped and the zzso zzso region zzso The zzso and zzso promoter region are zzso rich, and share a high level of conservation with the equivalent zzso in the zzso bovine and human zzso zzso A zzso motif and several putative zzso motifs are present, and there is no zzso zzso zzso between the mouse sequence and other species is limited to a region of 450 zzso upstream of the zzso due to the zzso of a zzso of a zzso element upstream of the mouse zzso zzso zzso protection zzso were used to confirm that zzso zzso is widely expressed in multiple zzso and is the zzso form of transcript except in the liver during pregnancy, in which zzso zzso is the major zzso
