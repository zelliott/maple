A family of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein has been characterized as temperature sensitive for folding zzso by King and co-workers zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso There is substantial evidence that the zzso zzso alter the folding zzso but not the stability of the final folded zzso Several point zzso are known to cause the zzso zzso most of these occur in regions of the zzso sequence likely to take up reverse zzso zzso it has been hypothesized that the correct folding of the zzso zzso protein requires formation of turns and that the zzso causing zzso zzso interfere at this critical zzso We have tested this hypothesis by study of isolated peptides corresponding to a region of the zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso zzso of the tendencies of zzso and zzso sequences to adopt turn zzso was achieved by the synthesis of peptides with zzso zzso zzso and the use of a zzso exchange zzso We find that the zzso zzso either as a zzso zzso or as a zzso zzso has a zzso greater tendency for its zzso to approach closely enough to form the zzso zzso than do the zzso sequences corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso which have a zzso substitution zzso or zzso A zzso with a zzso zzso for the zzso has a slightly higher turn propensity than does the wild zzso Together with data from nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the oxidized zzso this suggests that a type II beta turn is favored by the zzso zzso Our results on isolated peptides from the zzso zzso protein support the model for its folding that includes reverse turn formation as a critical zzso
