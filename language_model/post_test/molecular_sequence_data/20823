Our aim was to identify an insulin response element zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified a 19 zzso sequence as a putative zzso in zzso zzso zzso 10 using zzso Upon sequencing the zzso region, a novel 5 zzso deletion was identified in Hispanics zzso with a carrier frequency of zzso but not in zzso whites zzso or zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed binding sites for regulatory zzso in muscle cell nuclear extracts with putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using human zzso smooth muscle cell nuclear extract revealed that zzso specifically binds to putative zzso zzso real-time zzso of the 5 zzso zzso the zzso and wild type zzso expressed in zzso and human muscle cells revealed that the 5 zzso deletion was associated with modest reduction in zzso zzso There was also a slight reduction in zzso translation in the deletion zzso Our data suggest the presence of an zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso
