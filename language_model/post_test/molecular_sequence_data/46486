zzso has an important function in degrading zzso components to maintain cellular zzso but is also required during zzso The formation of the zzso zzso requires the recruitment of the zzso zzso proteins to the membrane of the nascent zzso zzso is a highly zzso gene which has been duplicated during zzso zzso In this report we have investigated, in the zzso zzso zzso the functions and zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso is more closely related to the human protein zzso than zzso zzso but not zzso is able to functionally complement the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso is essential for zzso modification and zzso to the zzso During zzso zzso development the two proteins share a similar expression pattern and zzso but zzso is more abundant in the zzso Using genetic tools to either reduce or increase the zzso flux we show that both zzso and zzso are addressed to the zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso of both proteins is modified in several zzso processes when zzso is zzso namely during zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that both zzso and zzso act zzso and are involved in zzso formation and longevity of the zzso
