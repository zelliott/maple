zzso the molecular network underlying zzso zzso and zzso zzso sex determination, including patterns across closely related zzso is crucial to zzso the still enigmatic evolution of sex determining mechanisms in zzso Here we examined the expression of an important gene for sexual differentiation common to both systems, zzso at zzso and zzso temperatures, in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We tested the hypotheses that zzso expression responds to temperature consistently across zzso zzso but is unaffected in zzso zzso and that this differential expression starts no earlier than the onset of the zzso period zzso As expected, zzso expression was zzso insensitive in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso exhibited a differential expression by temperature in zzso zzso the expression pattern differed from other zzso zzso zzso zzso perhaps reflecting divergence of the gene regulatory networks underlying sex determination over evolutionary zzso Most notably, zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso higher at the zzso zzso before the onset of the zzso zzso that in zzso zzso significant zzso effects may occur early in zzso This result may reconcile field observations where temperatures experienced prior to the zzso have an effect on sex ratios, thus challenging traditional zzso zzso zzso the molecular factors that render zzso mechanisms zzso remain unknown, and potential candidates are genes that express zzso before the onset of the zzso zzso shaping or opening the zzso rather those acting once the zzso window has zzso zzso our findings make zzso one such potential zzso
