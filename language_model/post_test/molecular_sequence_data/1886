The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso protein zzso is an important zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso To delineate the functional zzso of the zzso zzso we generated a panel of single and multiple zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes could be broadly zzso into four main groups: Group I zzso zzso genes zzso for both virus production and zzso cell zzso Group II zzso zzso genes did not complement for either zzso cell fusion or infectious virus zzso Group III zzso zzso genes zzso for zzso cell fusion to variable zzso but exhibited substantially decreased ability to complement zzso infectious virus zzso Group IV zzso genes zzso for infectious virus production but had variable effects on zzso cell zzso this group included two zzso that efficiently zzso for zzso but not for zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, certain zzso viruses with zzso in either the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso produced partially zzso plaques on zzso cells in the absence of any other zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso contained zzso that functioned both in infectious virus production and zzso cell zzso Moreover, the data suggested that the zzso role in zzso cell fusion can be functionally separated from its role in zzso zzso zzso and that certain zzso zzso that function in zzso zzso cell fusion are distinct from those functioning in zzso zzso cell zzso
