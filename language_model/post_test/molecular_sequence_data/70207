zzso cells derived from mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit remarkable growth enhancement and cell zzso change in response to zzso zzso These events are zzso through an zzso growth factor zzso zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso reveals that zzso has 215 zzso acids with a signal zzso and scattered regions zzso to zzso growth factor zzso family zzso The biological ability of zzso to stimulate zzso cell growth is inhibited by zzso or zzso More importantly, zzso zzso of zzso can block zzso growth of zzso zzso Upon synthesis under the control of zzso zzso is immediately zzso into the zzso space without zzso zzso At the early phase zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, zzso is mainly associated with the zzso on the cell surface or zzso zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso blocker zzso or zzso results in the zzso of their ability to respond to zzso or zzso indicating that zzso zzso has important roles for condensing zzso on or near the cell surface as well as zzso the biological activity of zzso Then, zzso can bind to the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso cloning indicate that zzso cells predominantly express the zzso zzso 1 with some altered zzso acid zzso zzso of expression zzso of zzso and this zzso form of zzso zzso 1 into zzso zzso zzso cells zzso 6 zzso confirms that a zzso form of zzso zzso 1 is a zzso of zzso These results clearly demonstrate that an zzso mechanism is operating in zzso growth of zzso zzso
