The zzso tumor zzso gene is believed to play an important role in zzso cell death in acute neurological disease and in zzso The zzso signaling cascade is complex, and the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso is cell zzso Using DNA zzso analysis, we have found a striking induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein containing a death domain and interacts with members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family as well as zzso zzso family zzso zzso is induced following direct zzso gene delivery, treatment with a zzso agent zzso and stroke injury in zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to initiate the zzso cascade in zzso Through isolation and analysis of the zzso promoter, we have identified response elements for both zzso and zzso Like zzso zzso is another tumor zzso gene involved in the regulation of zzso including zzso injury zzso We have identified zzso consensus sites in the promoter region, whereas zzso recognition sequences were found in zzso zzso analysis has shown that these consensus sites are also zzso between mouse and human zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso reveal that both zzso factors are capable of binding to putative consensus sites, and zzso reporter zzso reveal that zzso and zzso can activate zzso from the zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso which functions in a broad spectrum of cell types, is a direct zzso target for both tumor zzso zzso and zzso
