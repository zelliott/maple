Early B cell factor zzso is a critical regulator of B zzso gene zzso zzso functions, in part, by binding to regulatory sites of genes required for the zzso and mature B cell zzso These DNA targets include the promoters of the zzso and zzso genes that zzso zzso and one of the components of surrogate light chain, zzso The zzso basis of DNA binding and gene zzso by zzso is poorly zzso The zzso domain zzso of zzso includes a putative zzso motif zzso which we have designated the zzso The zzso is required for binding of the zzso promoter site in zzso but it has not been demonstrated to be important for functional activities of zzso in B zzso zzso we expressed zzso with zzso in the zzso motif or zzso sequences in zzso cells in which zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes is dependent on zzso zzso with zzso that prevent zinc coordination by the zzso did not activate zzso of either target zzso Other zzso affected the sequence preference of DNA binding and zzso inhibited zzso of these zzso Our results demonstrate the importance of the zzso motif in zzso These experiments also confirm that zzso can zzso multiple genes of the early B cell program in zzso cells, which provide a useful zzso zzso for zzso mechanisms involving zzso
