In previous studies, we developed a new method for detecting zzso interactions in zzso using split receptors and zzso zzso zzso are engineered into separate fragments of the split zzso the zzso bond can be formed between the juxtaposed zzso by treatment with zzso and then zzso zzso can be detected on the gel by an zzso mobility zzso In this study, we zzso this method to examine the zzso reactions between native zzso in the ground state and after zzso of zzso In the dark, zzso on zzso segment zzso 3 zzso to zzso on zzso After zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso and the rate of the zzso reaction between zzso and zzso significantly zzso
