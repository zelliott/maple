The zzso of zzso is challenging as these animals demonstrate a limited number of useful zzso characters, therefore several species descriptions are supported by only minor zzso For example, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are separated exclusively by the absence or presence of zzso spines at position zzso zzso were raised on the zzso of these two species, which were often sampled zzso Using an zzso approach, based on genetic and zzso zzso we studied two new Portuguese zzso and compared these with zzso zzso We have determined that the two species must be considered synonymous with zzso zzso the senior zzso Our study showed generally low genetic distances of zzso gene (with a maximum of zzso with specimens displaying both zzso sharing the same zzso and revealed character zzso to be zzso zzso a more detailed zzso and zzso study based on the zzso gene uncovered a new evolutionary line within the zzso which justified the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The new zzso is in a sister group relationship with zzso and is, for the moment, composed of a single zzso
