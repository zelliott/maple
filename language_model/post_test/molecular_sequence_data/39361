The skeleton of the human body is built of cartilage and bone, which are zzso that contain extensive amounts of zzso zzso zzso In bone, zzso mineral zzso forms zzso of the whole weight of the zzso Although the organic zzso of bone consists of numerous zzso zzso of it is composed of type I zzso In cartilage, zzso forms a major fraction of the zzso type II collagen and zzso being the most abundant zzso It is obvious that the high content of zzso components causes zzso problems in the zzso analysis of cartilage and bone, analogous to those in the analysis of zzso proteins present in zzso The massive contents of carbohydrates present in cartilage zzso and zzso in bone, further complicate the zzso However, the development of zzso tools makes them more and more tempting also for research of musculoskeletal zzso Application of zzso techniques to the research of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cell cultures can immediately benefit from the present zzso Here we make an overview to previous zzso research of zzso and zzso samples and evaluate the future prospects of applying zzso techniques to investigate key events, such as cellular signal zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
