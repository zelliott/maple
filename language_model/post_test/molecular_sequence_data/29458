The influence of zzso concentration and temperature on the zzso behavior of zzso solution was zzso The threshold zzso for the different zzso regimes were determined and the different power laws zzso were calculated and compared with those predicted from zzso Different observations and the high values of these zzso within the high concentration region lead to consideration of the presence of zzso interactions as soon as the zzso concentration is larger than the overlap zzso The zzso energy was determined as a function of the zzso zzso and its evolution was compared with theoretical zzso A zzso transition was demonstrated at high zzso
