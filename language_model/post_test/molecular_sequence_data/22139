zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to modify their zzso with zzso acid zzso via zzso while zzso zzso also possesses a general protein zzso zzso zzso responsible for the zzso modification of at least 30 proteins with a zzso containing zzso a zzso of zzso To further define the zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have undertaken functional characterization of zzso zzso zzso pairs, in particular the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pairs zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso pair zzso using zzso zzso zzso The zzso produced by these zzso were identified using zzso zzso at 500 and/or 600 zzso with a zzso cooled probe for optimal zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso and could only be characterized by zzso analysis directly in zzso reaction zzso The zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso as well as a newly identified zzso zzso activity that resulted in the production of both zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to possess only zzso zzso activity generating zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only zzso as zzso producing zzso a precursor in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso producing zzso zzso a precursor used in the production of the zzso zzso component zzso
