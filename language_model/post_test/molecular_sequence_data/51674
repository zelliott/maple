Only two out of the three zzso inhibitor genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in rat liver are tightly controlled by zzso acting mainly at the zzso level, thus making this gene system particularly suitable to study its molecular mechanism of zzso In these studies, we analyzed zzso promoter activities in cultured zzso zzso by zzso or in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter region contains two zzso sites which are functional in intact zzso The more zzso element that maps at positions zzso to zzso and is analogous to the one originally described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Berry, zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso behaves as a weak zzso whose activity is strongly zzso by zzso zzso downstream sequences that contains potential zzso binding protein zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso site is located in the close vicinity of the zzso site between positions zzso and zzso and also requires the first zzso element to be zzso The zzso element appears to contribute more zzso zzso than the zzso one zzso to the overall zzso stimulation of zzso gene zzso Nonetheless, both displayed similar zzso with zzso and zzso effects occurring at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene appears to be due to the presence of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso exert both positive and negative effects on zzso promoter zzso Their zzso action appears to involve sequences located between positions zzso and zzso together with a more zzso half zzso element, whereas their zzso effect is more likely zzso by sequences located between positions zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso zzso and competitor zzso revealed the presence of a major functional zzso site located immediately upstream from the zzso zzso Unfortunately, the regulatory features of zzso gene expression observed in intact cells were completely obliterated by breaking down the cell structure, and could not therefore be studied using zzso zzso
