We have shown that complement factor H zzso interacts with zzso at the level of the sequence zzso zzso contained in the C1 domain of zzso zzso interaction with zzso was evident only after zzso of the zzso complex induced by exposure to zzso We hypothesized that zzso could act as a zzso analog in the interaction with zzso zzso A panel of partially zzso synthetic peptides zzso the zzso portion of zzso was therefore used to compete the binding of zzso to zzso zzso Three sets of peptides that zzso this interaction were zzso These peptides defined a region of functional zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and two regions of interaction zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to this, a zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso and a zzso mouse zzso raised against zzso zzso were shown to recognize zzso in Western blots and zzso respectively, also defining a region of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso These data provide evidence for interaction and molecular mimicry between an zzso structural protein and a negative regulator of the complement zzso We show here that zzso can interact with both zzso zzso zzso suggesting a possible and efficient mechanism of zzso of the complement cascade at the surface of infected zzso
