A gene zzso zzso zzso C zzso designated zzso was cloned from mud zzso zzso zzso zzso A complete zzso zzso zzso was isolated by screening the zzso library of mud zzso liver and using the zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso The full-length zzso gene contains an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso zzso acid protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso this zzso to the size of the protein expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso using zzso zzso It contains all of the characteristic zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso region, and a C2 zzso A zzso search revealed that zzso shares relatively high sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso coli was zzso to apparent zzso by zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso activity to zzso zzso zzso and its activity was zzso which was similar to zzso zzso zzso
