zzso muscle lineage determination is regulated by the zzso regulatory zzso zzso and zzso Previously, we identified a 258 zzso core zzso element 20 zzso zzso of the zzso gene that regulates zzso gene zzso in mouse zzso To zzso the zzso control mechanisms that regulate zzso transcription, we have zzso the entire core zzso using zzso zzso and have tested the zzso activity of zzso zzso using zzso reporter gene expression in transgenic mouse zzso In total, 83 stable transgenic lines representing 17 zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso mouse zzso Eight zzso zzso resulted in a partial or complete loss of zzso activity, demonstrating that zzso is primarily under positive zzso zzso Six of these zzso reduced or abolished zzso expression in all skeletal muscle zzso indicating that zzso of zzso expression in zzso limb and head zzso is zzso in part, by shared zzso zzso Interestingly, however, two adjacent zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a dramatic reduction in zzso expression specifically in zzso at zzso zzso At later zzso zzso expression was absent or greatly reduced in zzso derived muscles including zzso muscles zzso back zzso and zzso muscles of the body wall zzso muscles, abdominal wall zzso In contrast, head muscles, as well as muscles of the body derived from zzso muscle zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were unaffected by these zzso In zzso mice, zzso and zzso zzso expression was eliminated in the body, but was unaffected in the head, yielding an identical expression pattern to the zzso zzso gene in mice zzso for both zzso and zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso and zzso define the core zzso targets for zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
