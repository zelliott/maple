zzso zzso zzso zzso is a persistent zzso of surface and groundwater, and the reasons for its low zzso are poorly zzso Using one of the rare bacterial strains able to grow in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2012, the protein profiles of crude extracts after growth in the presence of zzso and zzso were compared by zzso Ten proteins with molecular masses of 67, 64, 63, 55, 50, 27, 24, 17, 14 and 11 zzso were induced after growth in the presence of zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and internal zzso fragments of the 64 zzso protein were used to design zzso zzso zzso to amplify total DNA by zzso yielding a DNA zzso that was used as a probe for zzso A zzso cloning procedure was performed to obtain a 10 zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso containing seven zzso including a putative regulator, zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the same zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso was related to a zzso of the zzso zzso family, and the zzso protein (55 zzso showed a high similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of these gene products was performed in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso strain was able to degrade an intermediate of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso This is believed to be the first report of the cloning and characterization of a cluster of genes specifically involved in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
