We have examined the binding of nuclear proteins and zzso zzso hormone receptors zzso to the zzso zzso hormone responsive element zzso zzso using a gel zzso mobility shift zzso Four specific zzso complexes were detected after incubation of nuclear extracts zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso DNA zzso This was compared with the zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 and zzso beta 2 each formed a single major zzso complex which zzso with the least retarded complex formed by zzso NE, while zzso beta 1 formed multiple complexes suggesting that it can bind to zzso as an zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso alpha 1, zzso NE, and zzso zzso resulted in not only the zzso complex, but in two additional more greatly retarded complexes containing zzso alpha 1 and zzso with those formed by zzso extract zzso zzso of each of the zzso with zzso from zzso cells, which do not possess sufficient zzso zzso to mediate zzso resulted in formation of a new, more greatly shifted zzso A similar, heat zzso activity which altered mobility of the zzso complex was also present in zzso from zzso zzso zzso At high concentration of NE, all of the zzso bound to zzso was more greatly retarded than in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso alpha 1 at zzso acid 210 prevented additional complex formation in the presence of zzso without affecting DNA zzso suggesting that the zzso of the zzso is essential for interaction with nuclear zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
