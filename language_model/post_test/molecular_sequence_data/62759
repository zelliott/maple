zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso has an important role in regulating the expression of zzso zzso Because zzso acids are produced from cholesterol in liver and many zzso involved in their zzso are zzso expressed in liver, the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso acid production was zzso In mice, zzso zzso acids are zzso with zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso zzso expression exhibited markedly decreased expression of the very long chain zzso zzso gene zzso a mouse candidate for zzso zzso zzso and zzso This was associated with markedly elevated levels of zzso and zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso was found to bind directly to the mouse zzso and BAT gene zzso and the promoter activities were dependent on zzso sites and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso plays a central role in zzso acid zzso by direct regulation of zzso and BAT in zzso
