The zzso zzso zzso zzso to a transcript expressed only in the male germ zzso Its expression is zzso zzso with high levels of transcripts being present during the zzso and zzso stages of zzso The deduced protein is shown to be highly zzso to the zzso translation initiation factor zzso and to other proteins that are also zzso to zzso including the zzso protein zzso By consensus sequence conservation and comparison of secondary structure predictions, putative zzso binding and zzso binding zzso are proposed to be shared by all these zzso Taken together, these results suggest a zzso function for zzso protein similar to that of zzso and suggests its possible role in a key step of the zzso zzso The possible significance of the similarity between the zzso protein and the protein product of the maternal effect gene zzso is also zzso
