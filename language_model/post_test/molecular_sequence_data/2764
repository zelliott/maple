In order to zzso the molecular mechanism of the zzso of rat zzso zzso components in adult rat zzso were isolated and differences in the primary structures of their constituent zzso were zzso The results obtained were as zzso 1) zzso zzso prepared from the zzso of an adult male zzso rat was separated into nine zzso components by means of zzso column zzso each giving a single band on zzso gel zzso 2) Of these zzso six major zzso designated zzso II, IV, zzso VI and zzso were further subjected to zzso zzso to yield their respective constituent alpha and beta zzso 3) zzso mapping and zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the beta zzso confirmed that zzso and II zzso possessed the previously known III beta zzso while zzso zzso VI and zzso zzso contained the previously known II beta zzso 4) The mechanism underlying the zzso of rat zzso was discussed on the basis of these zzso
