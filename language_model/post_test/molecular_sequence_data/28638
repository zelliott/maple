zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region, which lies immediately upstream of the zzso positive regulatory zzso zzso revealed two open reading zzso Based on zzso zzso these genes were similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso heat shock zzso which has an unknown zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were associated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Although levels of the zzso transcript did not increase in response to heat to levels seen with zzso controls, zzso zzso of zzso resulted in changes in zzso cellular zzso and zzso surface zzso in cells grown at 41 degrees C, zzso that zzso may be involved in surface protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso indicated that, despite their proximity to zzso and the structural zzso zzso these upstream genes do not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso
