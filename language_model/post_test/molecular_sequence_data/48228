The zzso zzso zzso coded for a zzso channel that showed increased zzso and a decreased zzso rate as zzso was zzso The relative zzso effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated that a zzso site is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of an zzso truncated zzso zzso which only showed zzso zzso were used to establish the position and nature of this zzso In comparison with zzso and zzso zzso showed a greater relative increase in peak current when zzso was increased from 1 to 100 zzso because the affinity of this site was reduced at low zzso zzso zzso had little effect on the rate of zzso of zzso however, the appearance of a second, zzso component to the zzso curve for zzso indicated that this zzso had increased the affinity of the zzso site by bringing the backbone zzso closer zzso zzso zzso were used to form positively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso charged side groups on the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso binding zzso in the channel mouth and zzso and zzso kinetic zzso zzso The reduced affinity of the site produced by the zzso zzso was probably due to the increased zzso of zzso which changed the relative positions of zzso zzso since zzso modification did not form a zzso site as might be expected if the zzso zzso project into the zzso zzso of the side chain zzso which is similar to the side chain of zzso a zzso zzso in many zzso channels, resulted in an increased peak current and reduced zzso rate, hence a higher affinity binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso occurred more readily from the zzso state confirming that side chains probably rotate into the pore from a buried position when no K zzso are in the zzso In conclusion we were able to show that, as for certain zzso channels in higher zzso groups, the zzso responsible for zzso by zzso is situated just outside the selectivity filter and is represented by the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso Shaker channel, zzso
