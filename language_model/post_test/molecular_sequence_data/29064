The zzso of the band 3 zzso zzso of the zzso membrane is not fully established despite extensive zzso zzso near zzso 743 zzso have been reported to be zzso in some studies and zzso in zzso In the work presented here, we have attempted to establish the zzso of zzso using in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso K do not cleave band 3 at or near zzso in intact red cells, even under conditions that cause zzso on the zzso side of the zzso site zzso in zzso loop zzso In contrast, zzso sealed inside red cell ghosts zzso at zzso as does zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso The transport inhibitor zzso zzso acting from the zzso side, blocks zzso zzso at zzso in zzso zzso by inducing a zzso zzso zzso added to zzso does not prevent zzso at zzso therefore, zzso zzso at zzso in zzso is not a consequence of zzso of zzso or leaky zzso Finally, zzso were prepared from zzso cells expressing the membrane domain of zzso lacking the normal zzso zzso This zzso does not traffic to the surface zzso zzso treatment of zzso containing this zzso produces the 20 zzso fragment, providing further evidence that zzso is exposed at the zzso zzso zzso the actions of zzso on intact cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso cells all indicate that zzso is zzso and not zzso
