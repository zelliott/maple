The biological role of zzso acid differences between the human zzso zzso protein zzso and the human zzso zzso protein zzso was investigated by engineering zzso zzso zzso molecules containing divergent zzso acid sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso acids from zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together, and zzso were zzso for the corresponding zzso zzso zzso acid regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with genes zzso these zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins displayed the same properties of zzso transformation and zzso growth as zzso zzso zzso zzso However, substitution of zzso zzso acids from the 80 zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso for the corresponding zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso the transforming activity of zzso zzso zzso The converse substitution of zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso did not result in transformation by zzso zzso zzso These data are discussed in terms of the structure of zzso proteins and the nature of interactions determining the specificity of zzso zzso
