The expression of two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was studied using zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that transcripts of both genes were rapidly induced following zzso with the zzso pathogen zzso zzso wounding and treatment with the defense regulator zzso zzso zzso In contrast treatment of leaves of zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso and salicylic acid zzso did not induce transcripts of either zzso A zzso clone containing the zzso gene was isolated and 594 zzso of zzso sequence upstream of the translation start was fused in frame to the coding region of the zzso reporter gene and introduced into zzso zzso from the zzso promoter in transgenic plants was determined by zzso zzso and quantitative zzso of zzso zzso In transgenic zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso vascular cells of young leaves, zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of the tobacco plants produced very localized zzso zzso Much more extensive zzso for zzso was observed following zzso of tobacco leaves with zzso of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and the zzso of wound sites with zzso of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of mature leaves with zzso zzso induced zzso activity while treatment with zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso A similar strong induction of zzso activity was measured in young transgenic zzso zzso on zzso while some, but much weaker, induction of zzso activity was observed in zzso treated with zzso The sequence of the promoter contained motifs zzso to putative zzso elements in other plant genes responsive to zzso The zzso gene is the first plant zzso gene shown to be induced by both microbial pathogens and zzso and its promoter will be useful for investigations of signaling processes during zzso infection and for the expression of foreign gene products at infection zzso
