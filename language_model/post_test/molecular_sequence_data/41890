zzso zzso infection with genetically engineered zzso is a way to deliver foreign gene products to various cell populations in culture and in zzso Selective zzso gene expression can be achieved using the zzso zzso zzso promoter regulating expression of a zzso placed in and delivered by a zzso zzso zzso We sought to determine the anatomical specificity and efficiency of zzso gene transfer into the rat brain following placement of virus particles carrying a zzso zzso under control of the zzso zzso The virus zzso was zzso zzso zzso deficient and therefore replication deficient in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso units of virus into the zzso caused a limited number of zzso zzso to express the zzso zzso zzso and protein product 7 days zzso In addition, small numbers of zzso expressing the zzso zzso and protein were found zzso to the viral injection in the frontal cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at these zzso zzso project directly to the zzso injection zzso No other cells within the brains of injected animals expressed the zzso zzso zzso While this zzso zzso zzso was capable of introducing novel functional genetic information into zzso zzso within defined zzso constraints, the numbers of zzso expressing zzso levels of zzso was zzso The calculated efficiency of delivery and zzso expression at 7 days zzso was 1 transgenic zzso per zzso virus particles zzso zzso We conclude that zzso probably is not an optimal promoter for use in gene delivery to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and that the efficacy of gene delivery using other zzso promoters placed at various sites in the zzso viral zzso needs to be zzso
