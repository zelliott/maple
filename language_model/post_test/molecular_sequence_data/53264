Our understanding of the organization of zzso signaling systems at zzso zzso has been aided by the identification of proteins in the zzso density zzso zzso a zzso fraction enriched in structures with the zzso of zzso In this study, we have completed the identification of most major proteins in the zzso fraction with the use of an zzso method based on mass zzso coupled with searching of the protein sequence zzso At least one protein in each of 26 prominent protein bands from the zzso fraction has now been zzso We found 7 proteins not previously known to be constituents of the zzso fraction and 24 that had previously been associated with the zzso by other zzso The newly identified proteins include the heavy chain of zzso zzso zzso a motor protein thought to be involved in zzso trafficking, and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso which is important for bud formation in zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso to fivefold enriched in the zzso fraction over brain zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso shows that it partially zzso with zzso at zzso and is also zzso localized in cell bodies, zzso and zzso zzso has a zzso distribution in cell bodies and zzso with some of the zzso zzso with zzso The results support a role for zzso in transport of materials into spines and for zzso in the formation or maintenance of zzso
