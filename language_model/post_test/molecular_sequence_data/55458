Although over 200 zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso have been reported to date, determining the genetic zzso of many cases of zzso disease is still not zzso Here, we describe the investigations undertaken to uncover the underlying molecular zzso in two unrelated Caucasian patients with suspected zzso disease, who presented with similar symptoms of zzso deafness, zzso zzso zzso marked fatigue and, in one case, retinal zzso zzso and zzso evidence of zzso respiratory chain zzso was observed in the patient muscle zzso and both patients were discovered to zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Clear segregation of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso radioactive zzso confirmed the zzso of this novel zzso in patient zzso However, unusually high levels of zzso zzso within both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patient 1 necessitated further functional investigations to prove its zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated the zzso effect of the zzso zzso on zzso stability, ultimately resulting in decreased zzso levels of fully assembled complexes I and IV, as shown by zzso zzso gel zzso Our findings expand the spectrum of zzso zzso associated with the zzso gene and highlight zzso zzso as an important cause of retinal and zzso auditory zzso
