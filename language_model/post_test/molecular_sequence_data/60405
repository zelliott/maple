Among the recently cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is of special interest for at least two reasons: 1) it is abundant in zzso areas which participate in the control of mood and zzso and 2) some zzso and zzso are potent zzso zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso were performed in order to investigate further the zzso of zzso receptors in the rat zzso zzso at the light and electron microscope levels showed that zzso receptors are mainly confined to the zzso zzso suggesting that they could mediate zzso actions on zzso zzso In some zzso areas, zzso zzso zzso is also associated with zzso zzso with yet unknown zzso Continuous zzso infusion with an zzso zzso for zzso days resulted in decreased zzso zzso zzso of the nucleus zzso and zzso zzso in the social interaction and elevated plus maze zzso Selective zzso zzso zzso are eagerly expected to investigate further the potential implication of these receptors in zzso zzso
