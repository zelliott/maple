zzso cloning of zzso zzso zzso from mouse brain and liver has revealed that zzso of the messages are different between brain and zzso In addition, one of the zzso zzso isolated from liver has been found to possess a zzso different from those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification using zzso specific for altered zzso has confirmed that brain and liver messages possess their own specific zzso Both of the two zzso have been demonstrated by zzso to be present not only in liver but also in brain, indicating both brain and liver zzso possess two types of zzso Although functional properties are not changed by the zzso of zzso and zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of two liver type zzso with different zzso zzso and zzso has been found to result in the increase in zzso of transport without changing zzso These results suggest the tissue specific alternative zzso at zzso of zzso messages and the interesting association of spliced zzso with different zzso
