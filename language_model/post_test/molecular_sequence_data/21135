zzso zzso causing green mold zzso is the most destructive zzso pathogen of citrus fruits zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso collected from packing houses and zzso in zzso China, during 2000 to 2010, were characterized in terms of their zzso zzso The frequency of detected zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso in 2000 to zzso during zzso Only zzso and zzso of the collected zzso zzso belong to the previously described zzso and zzso zzso zzso To determine the resistance mechanism of the zzso and novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were cloned from six zzso and eight zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso A unique zzso zzso was observed in the promoter region of zzso in all zzso zzso examined but in none of the tested zzso zzso Further analysis by zzso confirmed that this zzso was present in all zzso zzso but absent in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso in three zzso zzso were found to be zzso to zzso higher than that in two zzso zzso of zzso zzso Introduction of another copy of zzso ( s ) (from zzso into an zzso isolate decreased the sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso only to a small extent, but introduction of a copy of zzso ( R ) (from zzso dramatically increased the resistance level of zzso zzso to zzso Regarding zzso no consistent changes in either zzso sequence or expression level were correlated with zzso resistance among zzso and zzso zzso Based on these results, we concluded that zzso the zzso family of zzso zzso contains the zzso and zzso zzso in addition to the known gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso resulting from a zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region of zzso is responsible for the zzso type of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
