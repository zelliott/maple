In functional units d and g from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in the presence of zzso zzso showed the occurrence of seven zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso however, did not reveal any free zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso followed by zzso acid analysis and partial sequencing of the zzso peptides showed that six zzso zzso are involved in the formation of three zzso bridges at corresponding zzso The results indicated that the remaining zzso zzso is linked by a zzso bridge to a zzso zzso located two positions further in the sequence zzso zzso d zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso This zzso zzso to one of the three zzso zzso considered to be involved in the coordination of the copper A atom of the zzso copper group of the functional zzso The presence of the zzso bond was further evidenced by an zzso band at 255 zzso and by molecular mass zzso with zzso mass zzso on a zzso zzso from zzso zzso d and on peptides obtained by zzso of zzso zzso zzso d with zzso and zzso Upon sequence analysis the zzso zzso bridge was zzso into zzso zzso and zzso A zzso with a zzso zzso bridge was isolated from zzso of functional units zzso zzso zzso g and h of zzso zzso and unit g of zzso zzso obtained from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso bridge, which was reported previously for zzso of zzso zzso thus seems to be a general feature for functional units of zzso zzso
