Fluorescent proteins are versatile tools for live cell imaging zzso In particular, recent progress was achieved in the development of zzso red fluorescent proteins zzso that show improved properties in respect to maturation and zzso zzso zzso a red fluorescent protein designed especially for the use in zzso proved to be a brilliant label for different zzso zzso Here we report on the synthesis of a humanized version of a zzso zzso zzso which differs in sequence from zzso in four zzso acids and has a zzso usage that is zzso for the application in zzso zzso In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this new zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso was expressed in different mouse cell lines and used to zzso zzso zzso dynamics by live cell zzso
