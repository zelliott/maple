We have determined the zzso sequence of a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso which shares many properties with zzso zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of the protein contains two regions which are zzso to the proposed active sites and binding sites of the plasma zzso and to similar sequences in other zzso acting zzso zzso The zzso zzso is preceded by a typical 18 zzso acid signal zzso The zzso which is released into the culture zzso by zzso zzso is confined to the zzso of zzso zzso
