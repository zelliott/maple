zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso virus strongly linked to the development of zzso an zzso cell zzso frequent in persons with zzso zzso from zzso in B cells is thought to be an important zzso to viral spread to zzso cells during zzso zzso Earlier experiments have zzso a role for the zzso zzso zzso by zzso open reading frame 50 zzso in such zzso since zzso zzso of this protein zzso zzso in zzso infected B zzso Here we have explored several aspects of the zzso structure, and function of this protein bearing on this zzso The zzso gene is expressed very early in zzso zzso before several other genes implicated as candidate regulatory genes in related zzso and its expression can zzso their promoters in transient zzso The protein is extensively zzso in zzso and bears numerous sites for zzso by protein zzso C, zzso of which are potent zzso of zzso zzso The C zzso of the zzso protein contains a domain that can strongly activate zzso when targeted to zzso deletion of this domain generates an zzso that expresses a truncated protein which retains the ability to form zzso with full-length zzso and functions as a zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso infected cells zzso spontaneous zzso from zzso and zzso suppresses viral replication induced by multiple zzso including zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso These results indicate that the zzso gene product plays an essential role in zzso zzso replication and are consistent with its action as a putative molecular switch controlling the induction of virus from zzso
