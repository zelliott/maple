zzso Collins syndrome zzso is an zzso dominant disorder of zzso development, the features of which include zzso hearing loss and zzso zzso The zzso locus has been localized to zzso zzso In the present study we have used the combined techniques of genetic linkage analysis and zzso in zzso zzso zzso to more accurately define the zzso critical zzso zzso zzso and zzso which map to zzso zzso zzso two and one zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of these three markers range from zzso to zzso Twenty-two unrelated zzso families have been analyzed for linkage to these zzso There is strong evidence demonstrating linkage to all three zzso the strongest support for positive linkage being provided by zzso those markers at the locus zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso FISH to zzso zzso and zzso zzso established that zzso lies zzso to zzso This information combined with the data generated by genetic linkage analysis demonstrated that the zzso locus is closely flanked zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso
