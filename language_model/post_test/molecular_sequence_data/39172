Natural killer zzso recognition of target cells and zzso function are controlled by multiple zzso zzso These receptors can transmit either positive or negative signals and belong to the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso One member of the zzso zzso is expressed on the surface of all mouse and human zzso cells and the subset of T cells that mediate zzso zzso In both mouse and human, zzso is a zzso protein and is the zzso for zzso Northern zzso analysis had indicated the existence of zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of novel zzso zzso closely related to the rat zzso Unlike zzso rat zzso cells express zzso corresponding to both zzso zzso and soluble zzso forms of zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso a zzso of 311 zzso acid zzso The zzso protein has characteristics of type I zzso proteins with a zzso acid leader zzso a zzso acid zzso domain, a zzso acid zzso domain, and a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 205 zzso acid zzso without a putative zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso analysis revealed that both zzso and soluble forms of zzso are expressed in zzso zzso zzso
