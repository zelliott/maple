Identification of genes that are specifically expressed in the adult zzso or the fetal zzso is important for the study of genes related to the development of the zzso In this study, a human zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso products of zzso clones from a human zzso zzso library were dotted on a nylon zzso zzso from adult and fetal zzso were zzso and zzso were prepared by a reverse zzso reaction with zzso zzso as zzso The zzso was zzso with zzso of adult and fetal zzso and zzso and zzso of clones were positive, zzso In total, zzso clones were zzso zzso zzso were highly expressed in adult zzso and 139 were highly expressed in fetal zzso Among these zzso a new zzso zzso gene was detected and named zzso zzso was highly expressed in adult human zzso The zzso of zzso contains zzso zzso and the putative protein had zzso zzso zzso This protein is zzso to the six known members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso short form, and brain zzso but was different at the zzso zzso All zzso originate from one zzso and result from both different zzso regions and different zzso zzso lacks the first zzso and contains a second zzso that is lacking in the other zzso zzso is shorter than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but longer than the zzso short form and brain zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso protein has two zzso regions that may be zzso zzso zzso profiles showed that zzso is specifically and strongly expressed in zzso The results of the present study indicate that the zzso gene is zzso expressed in adult and fetal zzso and encodes a membrane protein that may have a function in zzso zzso
