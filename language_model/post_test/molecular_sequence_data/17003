zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso by an zzso hydride transfer reaction that culminates in zzso zzso zzso comparisons of zzso acid sequences revealed that the zzso belongs to the zzso protein family whose three-dimensional fold has not been zzso Here we describe the crystal structure of zzso zzso in complex with zzso refined to zzso A zzso The zzso consists of a zzso fold whose zzso comprise two functional zzso zzso a novel zzso domain whose zzso zzso form a zzso barrel at the zzso interface and zzso a zzso zzso fold that interacts with a single zzso positioned for zzso hydride zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso resides in a zzso zzso on the protein surface and makes contact with a zzso zzso module originating from the zzso zzso zzso data were also collected to zzso A resolution on zzso grown in the presence of zzso The structure revealed that the zzso zzso group interacts with the side chains of zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso leaving group hydrogen bonds to the side chain of zzso and the site of hydride transfer is zzso A from C4 of the zzso The absence of an appropriately positioned water suggested that a previously proposed mechanism that calls for zzso elimination of the zzso intermediate must be zzso A more zzso description of the chemical mechanism is proposed and discussed in relation to the structure and function of zzso
