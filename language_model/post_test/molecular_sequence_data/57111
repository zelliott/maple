We report the zzso zzso and partial zzso acid sequence of a novel zzso zzso inhibitor which is present in extracts from human zzso and in the zzso fraction of the zzso cell line zzso zzso from these zzso exhibited zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This activity was not accelerated by zzso and corresponded to a protein which formed a zzso complex with zzso The complex was stable on reduced sodium zzso zzso gel zzso A zzso and functionally inactive form of the protein was zzso from zzso tissue by zzso on zzso followed by affinity zzso on zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein recognized the inhibitor from zzso cells and zzso zzso Western zzso experiments using the zzso showed that the zzso inhibitor has a molecular mass of 38 zzso zzso acid sequencing was performed on the zzso zzso zzso of peptides resulting from zzso with zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso confirmed that this is a novel inhibitor with significant zzso to the zzso zzso
