zzso variation in the alcohol zzso zzso locus region of the wild rice zzso zzso and its related species was zzso to clarify the maintenance mechanism of DNA variation in zzso zzso The estimated zzso diversity in the zzso locus region of zzso zzso was zzso which was one of the lowest values detected in nuclear zzso of plant species investigated so zzso Tests of neutrality detected significantly negative zzso from the neutral zzso model for the coding region, especially for replacement zzso When each of the zzso zzso was considered, significance was detected only for the zzso domain zzso These results suggest zzso selection in the zzso coding zzso In the zzso tree of zzso species based on zzso variation, cultivated rice zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were included in the cluster of zzso zzso The genetic distance of the zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was as low as the zzso diversity of zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot be classified based on the zzso variation of zzso No replacement divergence between zzso zzso and the other three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso indicating that zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso On the other hand, between zzso zzso and the zzso species zzso zzso replacement changes were detected only in the zzso domain zzso The difference in replacement zzso between the A- and zzso species may be related to zzso changes in the zzso zzso reflecting environmental differences where the species encounter zzso zzso
