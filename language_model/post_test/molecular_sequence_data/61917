zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso DNA zzso contains several zzso regions within the zzso zzso The zzso regions I, II, III, zzso and zzso have been shown to have functional roles in the interaction with zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the role of zzso region VI in DNA replication has remained unclear due, in part, to the lack of a zzso region VI zzso In this report, zzso viruses containing a point zzso zzso within the zzso region VI were zzso These zzso viruses were more susceptible to zzso and resistant to both zzso and zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso the altered drug zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso viruses containing the zzso marker zzso which was integrated within the zzso zzso locus zzso exhibited increased zzso of DNA zzso These data indicate that zzso region zzso together with other zzso regions, forms the zzso active site, has a role in the interaction with zzso and regulates DNA replication zzso The possible effect of the zzso zzso in altering the zzso structure and activity is zzso
