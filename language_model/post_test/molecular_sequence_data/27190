The zzso gene cluster is the evolutionary sister to the zzso zzso zzso the role of the zzso cluster in patterning the zzso axis of zzso animals is well established, and the zzso of zzso zzso clusters is intimately linked to gene regulation, much less is known about the more recently discovered zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and its relationship to zzso has only been described in zzso Conventional zzso models zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso derived with respect to zzso zzso suffering gene loss and cluster zzso 

We provide the first evidence for zzso gene zzso from a zzso zzso animal, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these genes is thus not a sole preserve of the zzso lineage within zzso This zzso zzso cluster is not entirely intact however, with zzso being on the opposite end of the same zzso arm from zzso and zzso From the zzso sequence around the zzso zzso zzso genes the zzso genes are identified, compared with other zzso and the ancestral arrangement zzso 

We relate the zzso of the zzso genes to their zzso and from comparisons with other zzso zzso that a relatively complex pattern of zzso gene expression existed in the zzso zzso which was zzso simplified along several zzso zzso zzso comparisons of the gene content around the zzso genes enables the reconstruction of the zzso surrounding the zzso cluster of the zzso zzso which existed over 550 million years zzso
