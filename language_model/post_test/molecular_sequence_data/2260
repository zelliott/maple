A zzso zzso zzso called zzso is described whose abundance is greatly increased by the tumor promoter zzso zzso both in zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso in zzso We have previously shown induction of zzso in zzso or zzso cell lines by tumor zzso growth factors, and transformation with zzso The zzso zzso appears to be derived from a single copy zzso It encodes the mouse zzso of rat zzso a zzso zzso bone zzso that binds to zzso and zzso cells and to zzso zzso zzso The rat and mouse sequences are zzso identical at the zzso acid level and zzso identical at the zzso zzso Many of the primary structural features are zzso including a run of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso raised against portions of the predicted zzso zzso proteins of apparent Mr zzso both from zzso zzso containing the translation products of zzso zzso and from cell culture medium containing metabolically labeled proteins zzso by zzso zzso The results presented here demonstrate that zzso is identical to a zzso zzso whose level of expression by cultured cells and abundance in human zzso has been correlated with zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in zzso The zzso version of zzso has been given the formal name zzso zzso zzso and the designation zzso
