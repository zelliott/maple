Continuous monitoring of the zzso activity of newly zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso translation system was performed to record folding zzso of this zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso Whereas in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso occurred with a low yield of active zzso and took about an hour, the zzso acquired its native structure immediately upon release from the zzso as seen from the immediate halt of active zzso zzso upon blocking of translation with zzso The nascent zzso was also capable of acquiring the active zzso prior to release from the zzso when its C zzso was extended with a zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso was found to be equally high irrespective of whether this protein was zzso in zzso or zzso translation zzso The data presented demonstrate the fundamental ability of zzso zzso to support effective zzso protein folding in general and zzso folding of zzso proteins in zzso
