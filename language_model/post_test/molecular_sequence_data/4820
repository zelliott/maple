A girl with severe growth zzso had the clinical features of zzso zzso Her serum zzso growth zzso level was completely unresponsive to zzso zzso zzso The serum zzso protein zzso level was below the zzso limit in the patient, but it was normal in her parents and zzso Her parents and brother were normal in their zzso zzso with zzso and direct sequencing of her zzso zzso gene revealed compound zzso zzso The zzso from her mother contained a zzso of G to T in zzso 7 that could introduce a stop zzso in place of a zzso acid at zzso acid zzso Another zzso was found in the zzso in her father and also identified in her zzso It was a C deletion at position zzso in zzso 10 that could introduce a frame shift, thereby causing the production of 20 novel zzso acids zzso instead of the zzso zzso the premature termination at zzso zzso and the subsequent deletion of the C terminal portion of the zzso zzso zzso of her father's zzso and sequencing of its complementary DNA revealed that only the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in his zzso though the mechanism remains zzso These results suggest that neither of the zzso zzso could generate a functional zzso zzso which would be consistent with the patient's severe growth zzso and zzso serum zzso
