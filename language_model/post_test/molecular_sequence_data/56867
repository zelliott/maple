An zzso substance zzso by the zzso zzso and primarily responsible for maternal recognition of pregnancy is zzso zzso zzso zzso a new type I zzso zzso The objectives of this research were 1) to investigate whether zzso distinct genes zzso zzso and other type I zzso in the zzso zzso and 2) to examine expression of zzso and other zzso zzso during zzso zzso Genes for type I zzso were isolated from a zzso library constructed from Day 25 zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Six clones were isolated and zzso from zzso to zzso zzso relative to cap zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso acid sequences demonstrated that four clones were distinct zzso genes and that two zzso defined as zzso and zzso were related type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso was zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso by zzso and type I zzso genes was examined zzso via reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of total cellular zzso zzso extracted from Day zzso zzso Total cellular zzso obtained from Day 75 zzso and adult zzso was also analyzed by zzso coupled with Southern zzso zzso of the zzso reaction products with specific DNA zzso zzso products were zzso in order to confirm primer zzso and zzso corresponding to two of the four zzso genes and to both related zzso clones zzso and zzso were zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso products revealed that of the two zzso genes zzso one was highly expressed on Days zzso and transcripts were zzso zzso on Days 30 and zzso In contrast, the other zzso gene examined was zzso expressed on Days zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso signals revealed that zzso zzso zzso was detected in Day 75 zzso but only zzso detected in zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso zzso was abundant in zzso relative to the other zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate the existence of distinct zzso and related type I zzso zzso The data suggest that these genes display zzso zzso expression and zzso regulation during zzso
