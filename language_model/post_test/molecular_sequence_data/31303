The zzso sequence of the import precursor of zzso b of rat liver zzso zzso has been determined from a zzso zzso clone isolated by screening a rat liver zzso library with a probe zzso The sequence was composed of zzso zzso including a coding region for the import precursor of zzso b and zzso regions of both the zzso and zzso The import precursor of zzso b and its mature zzso deduced from the open reading frame consisted of 256 and 214 zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of 42 zzso acids could be the import signal zzso which serves to direct the protein into the zzso zzso
