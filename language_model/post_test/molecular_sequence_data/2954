In zzso and zzso mobile genetic elements frequently disrupt the highly conservative structures of zzso which are responsible for storage of genetic zzso The factors determining the site for integration of such elements are still zzso Transfer zzso zzso genes are associated in a highly significant manner with different putative mobile genetic elements in the cellular slime mold zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso genes in zzso zzso and probably zzso genes generally in lower zzso may function as zzso landmarks for the integration of different zzso elements in a strictly zzso zzso
