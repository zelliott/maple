zzso zzso are a zzso format for zzso functional protein interactions and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The primary limitations of this technology include the time and cost involved in the production of highly zzso individual proteins for zzso and also the limited stability of functional proteins once zzso In light of these difficulties, zzso protein expression systems are being increasingly used to generate protein zzso in zzso from coding DNA zzso This chapter describes the method DNA array to protein array zzso allowing the repeated zzso of protein zzso directly from a DNA array template using zzso protein zzso Once the DNA templates have been zzso the generation of the protein array involves only simple handling procedures and is relatively time and cost-efficient, and protein zzso can easily be produced zzso zzso as and when zzso The zzso protein array may be used for any downstream applications as for conventionally spotted protein zzso
