zzso zzso cell zzso receptors zzso recognize zzso molecules on target cell surface and transmit an zzso signal to prevent zzso zzso zzso zzso family is composed of multiple receptors whose zzso acid sequences are similar but their zzso specificity is zzso However, it is not clear how diverse the repertoire of zzso zzso is, particularly in a single zzso To address this question, zzso were cloned zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso from a single zzso Twelve different zzso zzso were identified suggesting that the repertoire in a single individual is highly zzso Interestingly, seven of them have hybrid sequences of three previously reported zzso zzso Using an zzso protection zzso it was demonstrated that the zzso transcripts of the hybrid zzso are present in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso Four differently spliced forms of zzso zzso were also identified indicating that the repertoire is diverse in size as well as in zzso zzso zzso sites found in zzso zzso zzso suggest that the differently spliced forms are produced by alternative zzso zzso and that the hybrid zzso may also be generated by alternative zzso of two consecutive genes and/or by zzso mechanism found in zzso genes in B zzso
