The zzso influenza A virus zzso protein contributes to viral zzso and is present in most human and avian zzso Previous synthetic protocols have been improved to provide a synthetic full length zzso type zzso protein that is zzso by the 'Spanish zzso isolate and an equivalent protein from an avian host that is representative of a highly zzso H5N1 zzso zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso Full length zzso different zzso of zzso and a number of fragments of these peptides have been zzso by either the standard zzso zzso synthesis method or by native chemical zzso of unprotected zzso and zzso zzso zzso For zzso chemical zzso made use of the zzso and the zzso zzso located in positions 41 and 42 of the native zzso respectively, to afford a highly efficient synthesis of zzso compared to the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso formation at the zzso acid zzso in position 23 was prevented by specific modifications of the zzso zzso As the native sequence of zzso does not contain a zzso zzso two different zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with appropriate zzso exchanges were zzso In addition to the full length zzso fragments of the native sequences were zzso for comparison of their physical characteristics with those from the zzso human isolate zzso zzso zzso All peptides were analyzed by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The protocols allow the synthesis of significant amounts of zzso and its related zzso
