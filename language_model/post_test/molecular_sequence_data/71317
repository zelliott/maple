The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso revealed that the zzso does not contain zzso of either zzso or zzso However, there were two genes which zzso small heat shock proteins immediately downstream from the zzso and they were transcribed together with zzso as one zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso up to zzso in the simultaneous presence of zzso coli zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with its unique genetic structure and evolutionary features, works as a member of the zzso zzso zzso
