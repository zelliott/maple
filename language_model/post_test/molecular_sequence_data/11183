The zzso of zzso zzso is an zzso open reading frame zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso The translated protein shares zzso zzso with leader zzso I isolated from zzso zzso and 37% zzso with leader zzso I isolated from zzso zzso Five highly zzso regions found in the family of leader zzso I proteins are zzso in zzso zzso zzso The putative membrane zzso of the protein seems similar to that of zzso coli leader zzso I based on the zzso analysis of the predicted zzso acid zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso by probing with zzso specific DNA revealed that zzso is present as a single copy per the zzso A zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso could complement a temperature sensitive zzso zzso of zzso coli strain zzso suggesting that we have identified the functional copy of zzso present on zzso zzso zzso
