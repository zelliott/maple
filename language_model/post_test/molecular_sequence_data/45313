Based upon the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on three zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are at the end of the zzso which is involved in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were made in order to alter the zzso zzso to more closely resemble the sequences found in other zzso and zzso zzso zzso is on a neighboring loop (the zzso and precedes a zzso zzso found to be in a zzso zzso The zzso O atom of zzso is one of the protein zzso for the essential zzso zzso involved in zzso binding and zzso and the zzso is involved in binding the folate zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and this is the only one of the three zzso which retains some zzso zzso The structures of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins have been solved to high resolution, along with the structure of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso proteins remains zzso yet both structures show a large zzso zzso of the zzso in which a zzso zzso has switched zzso to a zzso The structure of the zzso is severely disrupted and as a consequence structural zzso are observed in the zzso zzso joining the two zzso of the zzso zzso binding in the active site is also disrupted by the presence of the zzso side chain at position 51 and by the repositioning of the zzso O atom of zzso and a water zzso is bound in place of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein retains the zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso site remains zzso The zzso is also observed in the structure of the zzso form of zzso zzso maintained in the absence of zzso by a zzso network involving water molecules in the active zzso It is only in the complete absence of water or zzso in the binding site that the zzso switches to the trans zzso
