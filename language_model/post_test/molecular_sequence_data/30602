zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells were found previously to be defective in the synthesis of zzso zzso This appeared to be the result of a zzso in the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Stanley, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we analyzed the steady state levels of zzso zzso lipids in zzso zzso We found that zzso cells are defective in the synthesis of zzso They accumulated a presumed precursor to zzso zzso zzso and used this zzso in the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso lengths of the activated zzso in zzso were the same lengths as zzso in parental zzso zzso cells had increased levels of zzso zzso and decreased levels of zzso zzso compared to parental zzso The zzso in zzso cells was specific for zzso zzso since other aspects of zzso metabolism in zzso cells were the same as in parental zzso We zzso that zzso cells are defective in zzso zzso zzso
