The crystal structure of the human zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso anomalous zzso and refined to an R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso shows no zzso sequence similarity to any functionally characterized proteins using state-of-the-art zzso zzso The structure of zzso adopts a fold similar to that of zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso a protein involved in the recognition of the cap structure of zzso zzso In addition to fold zzso the zzso surface zzso of zzso and zzso show a clear conservation of basic and zzso zzso In the crystal zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are bound within the basic cavity of zzso zzso in a manner analogous to the binding of zzso by zzso Interestingly, the gene locus zzso zzso is located between genes zzso the proteins zzso and zzso both of which are involved in zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso itself may be involved in a zzso process that requires recognition of zzso zzso
