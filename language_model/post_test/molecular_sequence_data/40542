zzso zzso is a pharmaceutical acting as a selective zzso zzso inhibitor and is used to treat depression in zzso zzso and the major active zzso zzso zzso are released to aquatic systems via zzso zzso They have been found to zzso in wild fish, raising concerns over potential zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine effects of zzso zzso including environmental zzso on the zzso axis in sexually mature male zzso We initially cloned the goldfish zzso zzso to investigate tissue and zzso expression of the zzso zzso the zzso target, in order to determine target zzso and sensitive exposure zzso zzso mature male zzso which showed the highest levels of zzso zzso expression in the neuroendocrine brain, were exposed to zzso at zzso and zzso in a zzso exposure before receiving vehicle or sex zzso stimulus consisting of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessed included zzso index, zzso volume, and blood levels of the sex steroids testosterone and zzso zzso function was investigated by measuring blood levels of zzso hormone, growth hormone, zzso gene expression of zzso hormone, growth hormone and zzso hormone and neuroendocrine brain expression of zzso and zzso To investigate changes at the zzso level of the zzso zzso zzso gene expression of the zzso zzso both the zzso hormone zzso and the zzso hormone zzso were measured as well as expression of the growth hormone zzso To investigate potential impacts on zzso zzso gene expression of the zzso marker zzso was measured and zzso samples of zzso were analyzed zzso zzso zzso were measured by expression and activity analysis of zzso zzso as well as liver expression analysis of the zzso marker, zzso After zzso zzso zzso volume significantly decreased at zzso zzso while zzso zzso volume decreased at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso testosterone zzso zzso zzso reductions in zzso hormone and zzso expression were observed with zzso in the zzso and zzso groups, zzso zzso levels and expression of zzso zzso increased with zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso physiology of male fish at environmentally relevant zzso and potential mechanisms are zzso
