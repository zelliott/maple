zzso is known to induce zzso zzso during early development in zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently identified to be a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have studied the role of zzso signaling in the limb zzso by identifying the target zzso We isolated zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso and zzso and examined their expression patterns during chick zzso The zzso gene is expressed in the zzso zzso of the limb bud at stage zzso whereas the zzso gene is expressed zzso in the limb zzso zzso of the zzso gene is confined to zzso and zzso zzso at stage 23, and later confined to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene are found in developing zzso of spinal cord, brain and eye, surface zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso gene is highly expressed in the developing zzso These results suggest that the zzso and their receptors are implicated in the limb development, especially, in differentiation of muscle, skin and zzso
