The potential for two complementary fragments of DNA from a clone from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso sequences with zzso to at least part of functional proteins is zzso One strand contains a sequence with high zzso to zzso a member of the zzso family, and the other strand contains a sequence with some zzso to zzso zzso zzso Overlapping of these two genes on opposite strands has been reported in zzso species, and is now reported for the first time in a bacterial zzso Further investigation of previously described zzso genes demonstrates that it is more widespread than might be anticipated, with all thirty other zzso genes investigated also retaining long sequences zzso at least part of a sequence with high zzso to a zzso zzso zzso
