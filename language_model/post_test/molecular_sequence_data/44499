We have previously characterized the functional zzso elements of the protein C zzso One zzso nuclear zzso zzso site, three zzso sites, and at least two zzso sites have been identified within the zzso zzso zzso unit of this zzso Here we present evidence that either zzso or zzso can cooperate with each other in binding to their zzso zzso The results from the zzso zzso in zzso cells showed a novel synergistic zzso between zzso and zzso Our data further indicate that the unique overlapping of the zzso sites, the specific spatial relationship of the sites, and the zzso zzso all contributed to the synergistic zzso Although zzso itself has a weak zzso effect, it apparently coordinates the zzso complex zzso zzso can zzso enhance the zzso of zzso or zzso Taken together, the zzso interplay of zzso zzso and zzso make a significant contribution to the zzso of the zzso protein C zzso
