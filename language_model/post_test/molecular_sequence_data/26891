We characterized zzso variation at barren zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and tested for trait associations with zzso in both an association mapping population of 277 diverse zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linkage zzso zzso from the quantitative analyses were compared with previous reports of zzso zzso in zzso zzso All three approaches zzso linkage, and zzso detect a significant effect of zzso on zzso zzso Association mapping implicates zzso in an unexpectedly wide range of traits including plant zzso zzso number, leaf zzso and flowering zzso zzso mapping finds a significant interaction effect for zzso number between zzso and other zzso in keeping with previous reports that zzso and zzso double zzso produce fewer zzso The zzso zzso is associated with a reduced zzso branch zone and shows lower expression than the zzso zzso in hybrid zzso zzso zzso consistent with the complete absence of zzso branches in the zzso knockout zzso Overall, these data suggest that zzso variation at zzso affects zzso architecture by modulating zzso transport during zzso and zzso zzso
