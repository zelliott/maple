The pattern of expression of the zzso major zzso complex zzso class I gene is zzso During embryonic development zzso zzso zzso from zzso is poorly zzso In the adult, zzso expression is nearly ubiquitous but zzso regulation occurs leading to different zzso levels in the different zzso of the zzso In zzso studies have shown that most of the regulatory elements controlling zzso gene zzso are located in the zzso region of the zzso However, using fusion zzso in which reporter genes were under the control of 2 zzso of zzso zzso regulatory region, we have previously shown that this region was not sufficient to ensure correct zzso zzso zzso By contrast, a native zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed appropriately both in the adult and in the zzso In order to zzso more precisely the zzso regulatory sequences involved in zzso zzso zzso we have now constructed new transgenic lines containing zzso zzso that were deleted from specific parts of the zzso zzso We show that deletion of either the zzso 3' zzso region or the 5 (out of 7) zzso zzso results in an expression of the zzso which is similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso both in the adult and during embryonic zzso By contrast, deletion of all the zzso or of the two zzso ones abrogates zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal the complexity of zzso regulation and highlight the crucial role of zzso zzso in zzso expression in the living zzso
