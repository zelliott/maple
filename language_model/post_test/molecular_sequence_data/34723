To establish the most common zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from Chilean patients and its relationship with zzso and zzso zzso 

Two hundred and zzso five H zzso clinical zzso were obtained from 79 zzso from Chilean infected patients suffering from gastrointestinal zzso An average of 2-3 strains per patient was isolated and the zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Some zzso were checked by DNA zzso 

The most prevalent zzso zzso in Chilean patients was zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso was scarcely represented zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found most frequently linked to zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso were found more commonly in male and older zzso zzso patients living in cities located North and far South of Santiago, the capital and largest Chilean city, carried almost exclusively strains with the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, patients from Santiago and cities located South of Santiago carried strains with either one or both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Regarding the zzso zzso zzso comparison with zzso sequences revealed that Chilean zzso sequence was identical to those of zzso American, and Colombian strains but quite different from those of Alaska and zzso 

zzso in geographic distribution of the s and m zzso zzso in Chile and a relationship of zzso zzso zzso with zzso were zzso zzso data in part support a zzso origin for the zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso H zzso strain distribution in Spain and zzso
