A strategy based on the use of zzso with one zzso zzso deduced from zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate zzso containing sequences from sunflower stem and root zzso zzso Six different partial zzso coding for the first 48 zzso acids of zzso and zzso terminal sequences were analyzed and found to be members of the zzso zzso which contain a zzso linked to a zzso zzso coding zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso zzso portions of zzso and of the previously reported zzso have been zzso to construct zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso These zzso were tested for their ability to bind to zzso promoters in zzso The expression of a protein containing an active zzso domain, but not capable of DNA zzso exerts a dominant negative effect on the ability of zzso zzso to bind to its target zzso From these experiments, it was concluded that zzso and zzso when zzso form zzso zzso Exchange of zzso zzso and zzso at positions zzso and zzso of both zzso reduces zzso efficiency and allows the formation of zzso suggesting that these zzso are, among others, zzso of the specificity of interaction, most likely through changes in zzso packing interactions at the zzso zzso The results imply that a great number of interacting molecular entities compose this protein zzso which is presumably involved in regulating plant zzso zzso
