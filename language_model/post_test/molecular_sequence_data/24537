zzso a zzso isolated from the culture medium of Group B zzso a zzso zzso targets pathological zzso and zzso tumor growth in mice and zzso zzso also targets zzso lung and adult sheep lung zzso zzso A gene zzso a zzso protein that interacts with zzso was isolated from a sheep lung zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso termed zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso containing zzso express the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also bound zzso The corresponding human zzso zzso was isolated from a human fetal lung zzso library and had a predicted identity to zzso of zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was shown by zzso to be present in the pathological tumor zzso of the zzso breast, zzso and zzso but not in the normal zzso suggesting that the protein may be critical to pathological zzso The zzso gene and/or the zzso protein was not expressed in a variety of normal zzso but was significantly expressed in human fetal zzso consistent with the zzso of Group B zzso infections in zzso Mice zzso with zzso and zzso peptides showed significant zzso of tumor zzso zzso effectively inhibited both the tumor zzso and zzso zzso as evidenced by lack of both zzso and zzso zzso These results and the zzso data suggest a therapeutic potential for the zzso target protein zzso both as a drug target and as a vaccine against zzso
