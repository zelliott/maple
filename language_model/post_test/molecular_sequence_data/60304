The plant hormone zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso activates a select set of early zzso The zzso class of early zzso genes encodes a large family of short-lived, nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and interact with zzso zzso factors zzso via zzso regions zzso in both protein zzso This shared region contains a predicted zzso motif similar to the zzso zzso DNA binding domain, which mediates both protein zzso and DNA zzso Here, we show by circular zzso zzso and by chemical zzso experiments that zzso peptides corresponding to the predicted zzso region of three zzso proteins from zzso zzso contain substantial zzso secondary structure and undergo zzso and zzso interactions in zzso Our results indicate a similar zzso function of the plant zzso domain and suggest that the zzso fold plays an important role in zzso zzso interactions of zzso and zzso proteins to specifically regulate secondary gene expression in response to zzso
