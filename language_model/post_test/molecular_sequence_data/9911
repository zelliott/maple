zzso of zzso from the zzso rep promoter of zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso at various zzso of zzso zzso and sodium zzso When linear and zzso zzso templates were zzso each salt generated a characteristic zzso zzso the salt concentration decreased zzso from a linear template but produced an increase zzso or a zzso response zzso with a zzso zzso In the case of sodium zzso increasing concentration inhibited zzso initiation from both linear and zzso zzso These results are discussed with respect to effects of zzso zzso on DNA zzso
