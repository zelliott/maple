Most living organisms can zzso zzso from zzso zzso in the de zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is basically composed of 10 reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the second step of the zzso We found that the zzso shows weak, but zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso 2 zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso which catalyze the third and sixth steps of the pathway, zzso In addition, the three zzso were similar in zzso acid sequence to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are the members of the zzso zzso zzso This family has been identified through a zzso structure comparison and includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on a multiple alignment of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggests that zzso is more closely related to zzso than to zzso among the three zzso from the pathway, though the three zzso are relatively close to each other within the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the analysis showed that zzso zzso had zzso before the zzso between bacteria and zzso
