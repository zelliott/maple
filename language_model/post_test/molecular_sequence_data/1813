zzso investigations in the spontaneously diabetic zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso rat have identified quantitative trait zzso zzso for zzso zzso The aims of this study were to refine the zzso mapping of a zzso ( zzso identified in zzso 8 of the zzso rat and to define a zzso profile of zzso gene zzso underlying the zzso effects in zzso 

zzso linkage analysis was carried out with zzso 8 markers zzso in a zzso zzso zzso previously used to map diabetes zzso Two zzso strains were designed to contain zzso zzso in the region of zzso transferred onto a Brown Norway zzso genetic background, and a broad spectrum of diabetes zzso were zzso in the zzso 

zzso from zzso mapping suggest that variations in zzso insulin zzso in zzso and in body weight are controlled by different zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso screening in male and female zzso at 12 and 24 weeks revealed the existence of zzso zzso at the locus zzso independently responsible for significantly enhanced insulin zzso and increased levels of plasma zzso zzso and zzso LDL and total zzso zzso zzso detected between the zzso and zzso strains in genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not account for these zzso 

We refined the zzso of the zzso zzso and its zzso characteristics in zzso strains derived for the zzso These zzso strains provide novel models for testing the contribution of a subset of zzso zzso on diabetes zzso and for identifying diabetes zzso zzso
