zzso the complex that triggers the classic zzso of complement, is a zzso assembly resulting from association of a recognition protein zzso with a zzso zzso zzso two copies of the zzso zzso and zzso Early structural investigations have shown that the extended zzso zzso folds into a compact zzso in zzso Recent zzso zzso studies have identified the zzso sites in zzso and zzso and led to a three-dimensional model of the C1 complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have used a mass zzso strategy involving a zzso zzso analysis of protein samples to gain new structural insights into C1 zzso Using a stable chemical zzso we have compared the accessibility of the zzso zzso in the isolated zzso and in zzso The labeling data account for 51 of the 73 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso They strongly support the hypothesis that both zzso zzso interaction zzso which are distant in the free zzso associate with each other in the C1 zzso This analysis also provides the first experimental evidence that, in the zzso form of zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain is partly positioned inside the zzso cone and yields precise information about its orientation in the zzso These results provide further structural insights into the architecture of the C1 complex, allowing significant improvement of our current C1 zzso
