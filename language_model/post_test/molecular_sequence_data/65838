zzso and zzso species are infected by zzso zzso and zzso respectively), which are collectively called zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso In humans, four types of zzso have been described zzso to zzso with three of them having closely related zzso virus zzso named zzso 2 and zzso In this study, our aim was to search for a zzso zzso virus and to document and characterize further the diversity of zzso infections in wild zzso zzso We screened zzso whole blood samples from 13 different zzso species from southern zzso Overall, 93 samples gave zzso zzso or dual zzso zzso profiles, 12 were zzso positive but zzso and 14 were zzso zzso we performed generic and specific zzso to zzso zzso zzso to discriminate the different zzso types, completed with zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequences for zzso and 900 zzso zzso sequences for zzso We show for the first time that zzso zzso and zzso zzso carry both zzso and a divergent zzso We also identified a new zzso lineage in one zzso zzso Finally, we identify relative divergence levels in the zzso zzso suggesting that additional types of zzso should be zzso particularly for the highly divergent zzso strain that we zzso name zzso
