The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso the fourth step in the de zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso is a promising target for drug design in different biological and clinical applications for cancer and zzso The first crystal structure of the class 2 zzso zzso from rat has been determined in complex with its two zzso zzso and zzso These zzso have shown promising results as zzso zzso and zzso zzso A unique feature of the class 2 zzso is their zzso extension, which folds into a separate domain zzso two zzso This domain serves as the binding site for the two zzso and the respiratory zzso acting as the second zzso for the class 2 zzso The orientation of the first zzso zzso is very different in the two complexes of rat zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes a 12 A movement of the first zzso in the first zzso Based on the information from the two structures of zzso a model for binding of the zzso and the zzso important for the interactions could be zzso His 56 and zzso zzso which are fully zzso in all class 2 zzso seem to play a key role in the interaction with the electron zzso The differences between the zzso rat zzso and zzso class 2 zzso exemplified by the zzso coli zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso predicted to interact with the zzso
