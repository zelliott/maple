zzso zzso zzso zzso are a multifaceted group of zzso zzso that are common to zzso zzso The interaction between AM zzso and plant roots is of environmental and zzso zzso zzso the molecular changes within the host plant upon AM zzso zzso is a zzso to a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso zzso display was conducted on leaf tissue of tomato plants zzso and zzso by the AM fungus zzso zzso and five putative zzso regulated zzso were zzso All zzso isolated shared high sequence similarity to known plant zzso zzso screening was initially used to establish whether the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to establish gene expression patterns for all five clones within leaf and root tissue of zzso and zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso regulation was observed for all five zzso zzso within the leaf tissue of zzso plants was observed for 4 out of the 5 zzso with an zzso observed only for zzso zzso specific regulation was observed for several zzso with zzso observed in zzso leaf tissue and zzso observed within zzso root tissue as compared to zzso zzso
