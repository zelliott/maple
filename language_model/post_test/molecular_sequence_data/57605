We report on the sequencing and analysis of a zzso zzso DNA clone that is located between zzso and zzso zzso pairs zzso upstream of the zzso gene and is capable of zzso a class of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso requiring a high level of zzso The upstream zzso zzso of this sequence is novel, the remaining 852 zzso having been reported by other zzso Four new open reading frames zzso have been identified along with putative promoter zzso These zzso which could code for proteins of 7, zzso 11, and 58 zzso in size, have been named zzso 64, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The last three have been named zzso genes on the basis that zzso zzso of each produces a zzso requiring a high level of CO2 zzso each produces a zzso in the CO2 concentrating zzso The putative gene product for the large zzso zzso has three internally repeated regions and also has two possible DNA binding zzso Two defined zzso in the zzso region, zzso zzso and zzso have been more fully zzso The zzso zzso has a drug marker inserted into the zzso zzso and it possesses abnormal zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso deletion of DNA from the same position in zzso to a region closer to zzso This zzso which has previously been shown to lack zzso and have soluble zzso zzso activity, has now been shown to have a predominantly soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were found to possess zzso zzso zzso activities which are below zzso levels, and in the zzso zzso this activity appears to be zzso The results are discussed in terms of the possible interactions of putative zzso gene products in the process of zzso assembly and zzso
