zzso of the mouse zzso data base at zzso trade mark with known zzso zzso resulted in the identification of undiscovered zzso zzso transcripts whose genes reside at a zzso complex on mouse zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and mast cell zzso zzso are new members of this zzso zzso zzso whose zzso acid sequences are zzso identical to each other and to their other 10 family zzso The 13 functional mouse zzso can be subdivided into two zzso based on zzso features in their zzso Of the three new zzso zzso zzso is most widely expressed in zzso zzso is zzso expressed in smooth muscle, whereas zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso and bone zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso zzso is also expressed in mast zzso Although zzso and zzso are zzso zzso when expressed in zzso and insect cells, zzso remains zzso The fact that zzso zzso zzso and zzso possess zzso expression patterns and zzso zzso suggests that each zzso has a unique function in zzso Of the 13 functional mouse zzso genes identified at the complex, 12 have zzso that reside in the zzso region of human zzso zzso The establishment of these zzso pairs helps clarify the evolutionary relationship of the zzso zzso locus in the two zzso This information provides a useful framework for the functional analysis of each zzso using gene targeting and other molecular zzso
