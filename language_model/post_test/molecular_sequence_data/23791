zzso differences among closely related bacteria have been largely ascribed to zzso zzso such as those residing in zzso zzso However, we now report that the differential regulation of zzso genes is the mechanism responsible for the divergence of the enteric bacteria zzso zzso and zzso coli in their ability to make zzso modifications zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso system governing zzso B resistance is induced in low zzso in a process that requires the zzso protein and by zzso in a zzso zzso We establish that zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso B resistance in response to zzso but that it is blind to the low zzso zzso The highly divergent zzso protein is responsible for this zzso as replacement of the zzso coli zzso gene by its zzso counterpart resulted in an zzso coli strain that transcribed zzso genes and displayed zzso B resistance under the same conditions as zzso zzso analysis of natural zzso of zzso coli and zzso revealed that the zzso proteins are zzso within each zzso and that selection might have driven the divergence between the zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso Investigation of zzso function demonstrated statistically different zzso for the zzso and zzso coli zzso in zzso zzso occurring in low zzso Our results suggest that the differential regulation of zzso genes may have ecological consequences, determining the range of niches a zzso can zzso
