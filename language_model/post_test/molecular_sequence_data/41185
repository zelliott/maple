Several zzso bacteria protect themselves against the zzso action of host zzso by producing specific zzso zzso So far, four different families of zzso zzso have been identified including Ivy zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we provide the first zzso description of the zzso zzso Crystal structures were obtained for the zzso zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These structures show that the fold of the zzso family is very distinct from that of all other families of zzso zzso zzso X-ray scattering studies reveal that zzso is zzso in solution as opposed to the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso family shares a highly zzso zzso sequence motif with the zzso and zzso families where it was shown to reside on a loop that blocks the active site of zzso leading to zzso Surprisingly, we found that in zzso this motif is not well exposed and not involved in the zzso zzso Instead, we could identify a distinct cluster of surface zzso that are zzso across the zzso family and are essential for efficient zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso
