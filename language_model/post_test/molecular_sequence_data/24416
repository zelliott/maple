We previously reported that a human analogue of pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 23 zzso zzso 1) was the most active analogue in a zzso zzso mixture and had the shortest chain among the zzso zzso In the present study, we examined a new method of preparing this zzso that is, zzso zzso synthesis employing the zzso method followed by zzso partition zzso zzso using an zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system according to the descending zzso The synthetic peptides were identified by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso in search of activity to improve the in zzso surface activity of a zzso zzso mixture composed of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso in a zzso surface zzso zzso zzso seemed comparable in surface activity with zzso zzso a modified zzso preparation which has been used for the treatment of respiratory distress zzso
