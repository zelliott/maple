A previously zzso zzso virus was identified in the hybrid tobacco species zzso zzso and was named tobacco vein clearing virus zzso after the symptoms associated with its occurrence in this zzso The zzso of zzso are 50 zzso in diameter and are composed of a 45 zzso zzso protein and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Each strand of the zzso is interrupted by a zzso zzso In zzso sequence and arrangement of zzso zzso was most similar to zzso vein mosaic virus, indicating that zzso is a zzso No zzso relationship was detected between zzso and any other zzso including zzso vein clearing virus, which has similar biological zzso In zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso of progeny plants, but was not transmitted by mechanical zzso zzso or zzso zzso to any of seven other zzso zzso zzso DNA of zzso zzso to zzso DNA of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso its male parent, but not to zzso DNA of zzso zzso the female zzso zzso has zzso sequence identity with zzso sequences that are present in high copy number in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso to zzso DNA of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These observations suggest that the zzso form of zzso may arise from integrated zzso elements present in zzso zzso that these zzso were inherited from the male parent zzso zzso and that these elements are related but not identical to zzso elements occurring in other zzso zzso
