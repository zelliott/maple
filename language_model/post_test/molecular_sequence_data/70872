zzso have been obtained of an zzso zzso zzso grown in the presence of a single domain from zzso protein G and a ten zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso from the human pathogen zzso zzso Crystal trials using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone were zzso but the inclusion of a protein G domain provided an additional variable that generated suitable zzso zzso are in space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, beta zzso zzso degrees and a data set has been collected to zzso A resolution using zzso zzso The inclusion of protein G is likely to be of general utility for the zzso of zzso zzso
