We identified a novel gene zzso that zzso a nuclear protein carrying a zzso finger, a zzso domain, and an zzso zzso The zzso domain was found to be sufficient for binding to zzso The zzso region exhibited a high zzso ability, but the full-length protein was inactive due to regions which inhibited the zzso region, including the zzso zzso We examined the expression of zzso during cellular aging and zzso of zzso human zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso through stages of cellular aging and zzso but at the protein level, a shorter form lacking the zzso region appeared as the cells approached zzso These results suggested that zzso was activated by zzso zzso which removed the zzso zzso zzso
