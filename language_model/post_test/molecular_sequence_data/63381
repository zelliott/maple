zzso toxins zzso and zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified and two zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso Here we present the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare it to the structures of other family zzso In contrast to the structure of zzso the zzso zzso turn turn motif is observed in a primed zzso ready for zzso zzso This suggests an impact on the binding mode of zzso and on the zzso zzso The crystal structure explains why zzso of zzso at zzso interferes with the zzso activity of the zzso
