New Zealand zzso zzso mice exhibit a zzso syndrome of zzso zzso zzso and zzso similar to that observed in young diabetes zzso mice on the zzso background zzso Here we show that in zzso this syndrome is accompanied by a marked zzso of the zzso protein in zzso tissue and zzso The promoter region and the complementary DNA of the zzso gene of zzso mice, including its zzso region, are identical with the zzso sequence zzso zzso except that the zzso start is located 5 zzso upstream of the reported zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso mice, zzso mice failed to respond to zzso zzso zzso zzso with a reduction of food zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as detected by zzso appears as abundant in zzso tissue of zzso mice as in tissue from lean zzso Ten zzso zzso are found in the complementary DNA of the zzso zzso resulting in two conservative zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso part of the zzso and one zzso substitution zzso in the zzso domain between the presumed zzso and zzso binding zzso However, these zzso are also present in the related lean New Zealand Black strain zzso fat at 9 weeks: New Zealand Black, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso seems to play only a minor, if any, role in the obesity and zzso of the zzso zzso It is suggested that the main zzso in zzso is located zzso from the zzso zzso or at the level of zzso transport into the central nervous zzso
