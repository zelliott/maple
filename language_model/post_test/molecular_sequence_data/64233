Plant cell walls are composed of a large number of complex zzso which contain at least 13 different zzso in a multitude of zzso This structural complexity of cell wall components is paralleled by a large number of predicted zzso in plant zzso which can be grouped into several distinct families based on zzso sequence motifs zzso zzso zzso Davies zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso Despite the wealth of zzso information in zzso and several crop plants, the zzso functions of these coding regions have only been established in a few zzso To lay the foundation for the genetic and zzso characterization of putative zzso zzso we conducted a zzso and expression analysis on 10 predicted coding regions zzso that are closely related to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso All of these proteins contain the zzso sequence motif zzso zzso that is the hallmark of the zzso domain of zzso a class of animal zzso involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso studies indicate that all zzso genes are zzso Although six of the 10 zzso genes were expressed in all major plant zzso the remaining four genes showed more restricted expression patterns that were either confined to specific zzso or to highly specialized cell types such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso displayed reductions in the Gal content of total cell wall material, suggesting that the disrupted genes zzso zzso in plant cell wall zzso
