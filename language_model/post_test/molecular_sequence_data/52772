Current evidence indicates that zzso of zzso in zzso DNA is restricted to both strands of the symmetrical sequence zzso although there have been sporadic reports that sequences other than zzso may also be zzso We have used a zzso nearest neighbor technique and zzso zzso sequencing methods to investigate the nearest neighbors of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We find that embryonic stem cells, but not zzso zzso have significant zzso zzso at zzso and, to a lesser extent, at zzso As the expression of the de zzso zzso zzso zzso well with the presence of zzso zzso we asked whether zzso might be responsible for this zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in transgenic zzso expressing zzso reveals that zzso is predominantly a zzso zzso but also is able to induce zzso at zzso and at zzso
