zzso family proteins are zzso zzso zzso factors that control many aspects of DNA events such as transcription, zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso In animals several members in this family have been revealed to control gene expression in concert with other zzso mechanisms including zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso Their function in regulating zzso expression in plant has hardly been disclosed before except in zzso Here we identified 40 members of this family in the rice zzso zzso zzso and constructed a zzso tree together with zzso 41 zzso zzso zzso alignment of the zzso zzso regions revealed zzso motifs and blocks in most zzso zzso profile analysis indicates that many rice zzso family genes show a zzso expression pattern and some of them respond to zzso stresses including drought, salt and zzso The results provide a basis for further analysis of their roles in zzso regulation to control rice zzso
