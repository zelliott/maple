Recently, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso group zzso bacteria were described as zzso zzso and group zzso bacteria were described as zzso zzso Over a zzso period 10 strains of a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso that was not partially acid fast and resembled zzso bacteria were isolated from different pediatric patients with ear zzso These previously zzso zzso bacteria exhibited a distinct colony zzso and consistency, had a carbon source zzso pattern distinct from the carbon source zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso had a cell wall based on zzso acid, contained zzso zzso and had DNA zzso contents of 68 to 74 zzso A zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that these clinical zzso are members of the zzso zzso and that they are distinct from zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso evidence we propose a new species, zzso zzso for these Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso group zzso zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
