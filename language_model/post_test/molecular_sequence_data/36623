The release of peptides zzso for a synthetic zzso zzso contained in the zzso of zzso was zzso The zzso release of zzso zzso peptides from rat cerebral cortical slices in zzso was calcium zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso cells also zzso significant quantities of these zzso zzso column zzso of the release media from slices and cells showed two zzso zzso zzso one larger and one smaller than zzso zzso Previous behavioral studies have suggested that zzso has a distinct zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso peptides are released along with zzso and are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso peptides may be zzso or zzso or may be involved in the sorting or transport of zzso
