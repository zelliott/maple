zzso necrosis zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with its receptors distributed throughout many different cell zzso Because of the diverse effects of the zzso it is difficult to clearly define its role in infection and zzso and appreciate its clinical therapeutic zzso We have identified peptides derived from the primary zzso acid sequence of human zzso that have zzso activity, as measured by enhanced zzso and zzso production, and peptides which are both directly zzso for zzso cells zzso in zzso and also prevent zzso binding to zzso zzso However, only one of these zzso peptides was toxic for zzso cells in zzso Our results indicate that the region of zzso acids zzso of human zzso has previously zzso human zzso activity, while peptides encompassing the regions zzso and zzso which are in close zzso as indicated in the recently determined three-dimensional structure of human zzso have in zzso zzso zzso These peptides also slowed zzso growth or induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which activated zzso but which was not zzso for zzso cells in zzso also caused in zzso zzso regression, presumably by zzso zzso with the zzso release of free zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was able to activate zzso in zzso did not possess zzso zzso activity in zzso The zzso peptides described in this report did not elicit zzso activity in cultured bovine zzso zzso cells and as such are devoid of at least one of the potentially lethal zzso of elevated zzso levels in zzso
