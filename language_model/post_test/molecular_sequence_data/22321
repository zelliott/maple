zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso protein with an alpha chain linked to a zzso beta chain without zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso expressed by many cells, is important in cell growth, migration, and formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso of an alpha chain containing an zzso segment and four zzso zzso zzso antagonize zzso zzso Until now, no zzso zzso for generating zzso was zzso Here we show that zzso which are zzso zzso zzso by mast cells, zzso zzso thereby abolishing scatter factor activity while generating an zzso zzso of zzso scatter factor zzso Thus, zzso interferes with zzso directly by destroying active protein and indirectly by generating an zzso The site of zzso zzso lies in the alpha chain on the zzso side of the zzso linking the alpha and beta zzso This site appears to be specific for zzso because zzso does not zzso other zzso zzso such as zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G and zzso zzso generate similar fragments of zzso by zzso near the zzso zzso zzso cell and zzso zzso are zzso during tissue injury, infection, zzso and allergic zzso where they may oppose zzso effects on zzso zzso Thus, zzso possesses an zzso zzso that serves as an Achilles' heel attacked by inflammatory zzso This work reveals a potential zzso zzso for zzso of zzso and generation of zzso zzso
