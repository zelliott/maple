zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso that associate with the zzso zzso and coordinate zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in a variety of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in the zzso Here we report the isolation of human zzso and zzso zzso and the determination of their zzso locations by using a zzso zzso hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping zzso The proteins deduced from human zzso and zzso zzso were composed of zzso and 375 zzso zzso respectively, and had zzso and zzso zzso acid identity, respectively, to their mouse zzso Human zzso and zzso proteins were zzso zzso Human zzso and zzso genes were mapped to the zzso on zzso and zzso regions, zzso zzso of a pair of zzso important genes may provide new clues to the understanding of genetic disorders caused by these zzso zzso
