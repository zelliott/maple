To map the zzso of the lack of zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso reverse zzso zzso to anti human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a variety of zzso zzso zzso were zzso The majority of zzso zzso had an affinity zzso for their natural zzso comparable with that of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but their zzso efficacy was zzso Whereas zzso zzso could be made entirely insensitive to zzso by exchanging the zzso acid sequence 97 through 205 of zzso zzso none of the reverse zzso zzso zzso gained zzso to zzso The zzso acids that are thought to be involved in zzso zzso and that are different from those in zzso zzso have also been introduced in zzso zzso These zzso zzso gained virtually no zzso to zzso or zzso Vice versa, when these zzso zzso acids were replaced by their zzso zzso counterparts in zzso zzso zzso to the zzso was zzso Thus, replacing segments or substituting relevant zzso acids in zzso zzso by their zzso zzso counterparts did not suffice to make zzso zzso sensitive toward zzso and was often accompanied by a decrease or even total loss of zzso zzso It is zzso that, in contrast to the results found for zzso zzso zzso and supported by the crystal structure of zzso zzso there exist significant differences in the structure and/or flexibility of zzso zzso that may prevent zzso from interacting with the zzso zzso
