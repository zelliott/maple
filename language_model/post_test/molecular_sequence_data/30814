Experimental zzso zzso zzso is a T zzso zzso disease of the eye which can be induced in zzso rats by zzso with either human or bovine zzso zzso In previous reports, two zzso zzso sites were found using synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso sequences at zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso of the bovine zzso In this report, a zzso synthetic zzso encompassing zzso acids zzso located near the zzso was found to be highly zzso in zzso zzso The onset of zzso was observed at as early as 8 days when high doses of a zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso was zzso with as little as zzso zzso of zzso per zzso Smaller peptides from this region were also tested for zzso further refining the site to 13 zzso zzso zzso T cell lines were made to this site in two zzso first, by the in zzso selection of a bulk T cell line raised to human zzso with zzso zzso Second, by the in zzso selection of a zzso line from an animal zzso with zzso zzso which zzso to the minimal zzso zzso Both of these lines zzso transferred zzso to zzso rats, further establishing the zzso of this zzso A zzso site distinct from, but zzso the zzso site was also zzso The potent zzso of peptides from this region indicates that it is a major zzso site responsible for zzso induced in zzso rats by zzso with human zzso
