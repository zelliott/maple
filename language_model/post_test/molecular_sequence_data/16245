The zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso of zzso rye and barley zzso were separated by zzso liquid zzso on zzso zzso zzso The peptides obtained were zzso for their zzso acid composition and some also for their zzso acid zzso zzso sequences of peptides from wheat zzso can be grouped into three zzso The first type contains a high amount of zzso and frequently zzso in the zzso zzso A typical partial zzso which occurs repeated in two zzso is zzso zzso of this type are found in zzso zzso The second type is characterized by the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the most frequent sequence is zzso zzso zzso contain sequences of this zzso The third type, which has partial sequences such as zzso zzso to typical peptides from zzso Most sequences of peptides from rye and barley zzso can be divided into two zzso The zzso type shows zzso zzso zzso zzso with X being F or zzso The second type is similar to zzso peptides from wheat zzso except that repeating sequences are less zzso
