Fifty zzso from the zzso London, and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, California, human zzso 22 zzso libraries were isolated, regionally assigned and tested for their ability to detect repeats or single copy zzso The search resulted in nine zzso containing repetitive motifs from the zzso region of zzso zzso An additional 19 zzso that detected single copy sequences in the long arm of zzso zzso 7 in the region zzso and 12 in zzso were mapped more precisely by zzso in zzso zzso Three out of these 19 zzso displayed restriction fragments containing zzso repeats, were zzso and zzso One zzso representing a region coding for an ubiquitous zzso transcript, is localized 600 zzso from zzso and four zzso contained sequences surrounding the zzso gene at zzso zzso long range physical zzso that may be useful for zzso structural zzso of zzso zzso are being constructed from these zzso regionally assigned markers from zzso zzso employing both existing zzso and new bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso
