zzso zzso is localized on the outer membrane of zzso zzso and is one of the zzso factors believed to contribute to the disease state of zzso zzso We demonstrate that protein synthesis of zzso is under genetic control of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso derived from the protein sequence of a zzso zzso fragment, we have cloned the gene for zzso from zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence reveals a G + zzso gene capable of zzso a protein of 910 zzso acids with a Mr of zzso suggesting that zzso is a processed form of a larger zzso In common with some of the genes in the zzso toxin zzso the sequence zzso was found zzso to the zzso initiation zzso At the 3' end, 29 bases after the zzso stop zzso the sequence zzso was found and may have some function in zzso zzso A full-length clone of the gene for zzso carried by the zzso zzso was unable to direct the expression of zzso protein in an zzso coli zzso The generation of zzso products allowed the detection of zzso protein products zzso in zzso zzso
