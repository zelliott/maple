Many nuclear proteins are imported into the cell nucleus by the zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso import zzso In this pathway, a sequence rich in basic zzso in the protein interacts with a zzso complex termed zzso and this, along with the zzso zzso mediates nuclear import of the zzso zzso The zzso nuclear zzso zzso A1 protein contains a novel nuclear zzso zzso termed zzso that does not contain any clusters of basic zzso Very recently, we showed that zzso directs import into the nucleus by a novel protein import zzso distinct from the classical zzso zzso A zzso protein termed zzso was identified as a protein that specifically interacts with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso system were found to be necessary and sufficient for import of zzso proteins in an in zzso import zzso In this report, we provide additional evidence that zzso can interact directly with zzso proteins and also show that it can mediate import of full-length zzso zzso In addition, zzso or a zzso zzso is identified as a second protein component of this novel nuclear import zzso zzso relatives from zzso zzso which likely serve as additional nuclear transport receptors are zzso
