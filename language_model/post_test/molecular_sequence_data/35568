zzso zzso is a major zzso agent of zzso in fish that has a broad range of zzso including in human zzso So far, zzso analyses have focused on the human zzso Here, we compared the draft zzso sequences of two strains of zzso zzso isolated from fish zzso and Europe) with the zzso zzso M isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and Europe have single, circular zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and average G + C contents of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso coding DNA sequences were zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and Europe zzso zzso plot analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso and Europe were closer to zzso zzso M when compared to three other zzso zzso The zzso gene analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso and Europe contained zzso and zzso genes that were not found in zzso zzso M, and lacked 625 and zzso genes found in zzso zzso M, zzso Most of the inserted and deleted genes were classified in the fatty acid, zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso disease, and defense zzso zzso these results provide insights into the zzso diversity associated with variable hosts and zzso
