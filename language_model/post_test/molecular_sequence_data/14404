zzso zzso variation characterizes zzso of zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso that serves as an important experimental model for studying zzso zzso Progress in identifying the zzso basis for clinically and zzso significant differences requires a robust system for describing and interpreting evolutionary subdivisions in this prevalent zzso To develop such a system, we have examined more than 950 zzso collected from around the world and zzso them using three independent sets of zzso DNA zzso sampling 30 zzso distributed across all nuclear zzso as well as the zzso zzso Our studies reveal a zzso pattern consisting of regions in the Northern Hemisphere where a few, highly zzso and abundant lineages zzso elsewhere, and especially in portions of South America are characterized by a diverse zzso of less common zzso that show greater evidence of zzso zzso methods were used to organize the marked genetic diversity of 138 unique zzso into 15 zzso that collectively define six major zzso Analysis of gene flow indicates that a small number of ancestral lineages gave rise to the existing diversity through a process of limited zzso Identification of reference strains for these major groups should facilitate future studies on comparative zzso and identification of genes that control important biological zzso including zzso and zzso
