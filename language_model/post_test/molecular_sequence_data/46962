We have zzso zzso and characterized the zzso expression properties of a fish zzso gene from zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso termed zzso shows a high degree of zzso acid sequence similarity to members of the zzso zzso gene family, which includes the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis suggests that fish zzso is similarly related to all four zzso gene family members, and may represent a descendant of an ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso was mapped to a region on zzso zzso linkage group V zzso zzso known to contain the zzso gene that acts as a tumor zzso of melanoma formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a candidate for the tumor zzso zzso zzso Here we have zzso zzso in both zzso species and have characterized its expression in normal and zzso zzso within control and zzso hybrid zzso A simultaneous zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is strongly implicated in zzso in this system, was also zzso zzso - zzso analyses revealed that both genes were highly expressed in zzso For zzso this result contrasts numerous findings in human tumors including human melanoma in which either zzso zzso zzso or zzso was zzso
