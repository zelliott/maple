zzso of the cellular zzso zzso has been frequently observed in DNA from zzso cells in acute zzso leukemia zzso Ras gene zzso sufficient to mediate in zzso transformation and zzso zzso usually results from point zzso and zzso acid zzso in the 12th or 61st zzso In zzso and the related zzso zzso zzso acid substitution at the 13th zzso has been zzso An activated zzso gene from a 45-year-old patient with zzso was isolated by zzso analysis and subjected to molecular cloning and sequence zzso A point zzso of the 12th zzso zzso to zzso resulting in zzso acid substitution for zzso was zzso In other zzso such as colon cancer, specific zzso zzso occur predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso This predominance has been of zzso value in analyzing large zzso for zzso zzso with techniques that are rapid and zzso such as zzso zzso It had previously been thought that such a predominance for zzso of zzso at zzso 13 existed in zzso however, this study in concert with others underscores the importance of 12th zzso zzso zzso along with 13th and 61st zzso zzso in the molecular zzso of zzso zzso to zzso transition zzso are commonly observed in zzso and may provide insight into potential environmental zzso Addressing all commonly prevalent zzso zzso zzso bears impact in the future design of molecular surveys of the role of zzso zzso in zzso
