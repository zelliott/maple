We have previously developed an zzso to measure DNA zzso pairing activities in crude zzso The zzso zzso In zzso nuclear zzso we detected two major DNA zzso pairing activities: zzso and zzso Here, we present the zzso and identification of zzso as the zzso zzso Because of the zzso status of zzso we studied in addition, the relationships between cell proliferation and zzso zzso We show that transformation of human zzso by zzso large T zzso results in a strong increase of both zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso levels of both zzso and zzso are observed in zzso zzso or zzso zzso at mid zzso or zzso zzso by zzso show higher levels of zzso zzso Moreover, induction of differentiation of mouse zzso line by zzso acid leads to the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity of zzso with the amount of zzso protein detected by Western zzso suggests that the zzso activity could be regulated by zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso and zzso activities are present in normal cells but are connected to cell zzso zzso relationship between cell zzso response to DNA damage and DNA zzso pairing activity of the zzso zzso are zzso
