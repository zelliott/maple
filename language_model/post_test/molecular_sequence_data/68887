Confirmation of a zzso zzso content and of its location within the zzso acid sequence is crucial in investigating the structural integrity of zzso zzso A combination of zzso chemistry and zzso mapping by zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm the presence and map the location of zzso zzso in the primary sequences of zzso zzso growth hormone and human tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso proteins were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso The zzso fragments were separated on a zzso zzso zzso column using a linear zzso zzso The peptides containing the zzso zzso were selectively identified by monitoring with a zzso detector at 215 zzso with the reference wavelength set at 450 zzso zzso peptides could be readily distinguished as zzso zzso zzso relative to the baseline and zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments were then zzso in order to confirm the location of the zzso in the zzso This approach offers the benefits of selectively and rapidly zzso from a single zzso step, the zzso peptides of zzso Furthermore, the use of the labeling zzso renders the zzso peptides more zzso thereby making them easier to separate from zzso zzso
