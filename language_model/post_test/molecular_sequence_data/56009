zzso modification converts zzso zzso zzso into its zzso form and appears to be a necessary precondition for LDL zzso by zzso during foam cell zzso Cellular zzso have been implicated in this zzso We studied the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with human LDL in zzso and found that the zzso zzso of rabbit and man are capable of zzso zzso as indicated by oxygen zzso and by the formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso fatty zzso such as zzso acid and zzso acid were detected in the zzso compartment of various zzso classes after zzso zzso More than zzso of the zzso zzso fatty acids were found in the zzso zzso particularly in the cholesterol zzso whereas only small amounts of free zzso zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso of LDL is not restricted to the zzso compartment but also leads to a zzso modification of the zzso as indicated by changes in the zzso mobility and by the formation of zzso derivatives of zzso acid side zzso The possible biological significance of zzso zzso modification of zzso in the zzso of zzso is zzso
