AMG zzso is an zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso that zzso zzso by preventing the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso with their zzso zzso Although the therapeutic value of blocking zzso has been shown in several models of zzso and zzso the potential benefit of zzso antagonism is less zzso To investigate the consequences of zzso zzso we have developed potent and selective zzso that inhibit the interaction between zzso and its zzso zzso Although selective zzso antagonism has no independent effect in models of zzso diseases zzso and diabetic zzso it zzso zzso zzso in normal juvenile rats and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the activity of zzso zzso seems to be unmasked in some disease models when combined with zzso zzso even in the context of concurrent vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso using AMG zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppresses tumor zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso fails to augment the zzso effect of zzso zzso on tumor zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso retinal zzso In no case was zzso zzso shown to zzso zzso superior activity to zzso zzso or dual zzso zzso or zzso antagonize the efficacy of zzso zzso These results imply that zzso plays a zzso role in promoting zzso zzso and that dual zzso zzso is superior to selective zzso zzso for suppression of zzso in some zzso zzso
