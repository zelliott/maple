zzso zzso of human zzso hormone zzso were expressed in zzso coli harboring plasmids containing synthetic genes under the control of the zzso zzso The level of expression of the gene zzso the truncated zzso zzso was greater than that of the gene zzso full-length zzso but less than that of the gene zzso zzso hormone zzso This may be due in part to the relative efficiency of translation of the zzso as suggested by secondary structure analysis and in part because of enhanced stability of the extended zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and their identity was confirmed by zzso sequencing and zzso acid zzso The zzso of these zzso peptides was then tested in skeletal and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso examining effects on plasma and urine calcium and zzso levels and on urine zzso zzso levels in zzso The zzso extended analogue zzso displayed zzso of the in zzso activity of zzso and was a partial zzso in zzso The peptides zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso and were very weak in zzso zzso when compared to the zzso analogue bovine zzso In zzso zzso and the zzso zzso when zzso at a zzso zzso ratio relative to zzso were each inert, and neither demonstrated zzso activity at these zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
