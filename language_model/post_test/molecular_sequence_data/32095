zzso zzso are specific to primates and abundant in the human zzso Through zzso that create functional zzso sites within zzso zzso these elements can become new zzso in a process zzso zzso It was recently shown that zzso elements are also heavily changed by zzso editing in the human zzso 

Here we show that the human nuclear zzso A recognition factor contains a zzso zzso that exclusively depends on zzso editing for its zzso We demonstrate that zzso editing regulates the zzso in a zzso manner, through both the creation of a functional AG 3' zzso site, and zzso of functional zzso zzso enhancers within the zzso Furthermore, a premature stop zzso within the zzso is eliminated by an exceptionally efficient zzso editing zzso The sequence surrounding this editing site is important not only for editing of that site but also for editing in other neighboring sites as zzso 

Our results show that the abundant zzso editing of zzso sequences can be recruited as a mechanism supporting the birth of new zzso in the human zzso
