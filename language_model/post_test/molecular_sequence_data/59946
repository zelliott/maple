The zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso and fuse zzso charged small zzso zzso and this zzso activity is selectively induced by the presence of zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso in the presence of zzso charged zzso and zinc zzso zzso a zzso change leading to the stabilization of an zzso secondary zzso We attribute the specific action of the zinc zzso to the presence of a consensus zzso zzso located in the zzso functional domain of zzso a recognized zzso motif in many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso mixture (a membrane zzso zzso has been performed and the results analyzed by means of distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics zzso Our results reveal that the zzso chain, including the zzso consensus sequence corresponding to zzso zzso is in a zzso zzso zzso of the chemical shifts of the individual zzso acids in zzso with those recently reported in other zzso indicates that zzso has a structuring capability somewhere between water and zzso zzso The mechanism of action of this zzso zzso is discussed on the basis of its structural characteristics with particular attention to the zzso zzso
