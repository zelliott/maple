Mouse zzso virus zzso a zzso coronavirus known to cause encephalitis and zzso uses zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso However, the expression of these receptors is extremely low in the zzso By zzso screening of a mouse brain zzso library, we have identified a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso Unlike other zzso that are expressed in the zzso it is expressed predominantly in the zzso zzso of the zzso into zzso cells, which lack a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso to infection by some zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso Thus, this is a virus zzso zzso The detection of multiple receptors for zzso suggests the flexibility of this virus in zzso zzso The identification of this virus in zzso zzso The identification of a zzso predominantly expressed in the brain also expands the potential functions of these zzso
