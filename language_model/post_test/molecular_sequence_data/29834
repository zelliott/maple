The primary structures of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso consisting of zzso zzso alpha and beta from the respective seeds of three zzso of zzso beans, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by sequencing the zzso fragments derived from their zzso zzso Major sugar chains of the zzso were also assessed by analyzing zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso alpha and zzso were shown to be composed of 76 and 139 zzso acid zzso respectively, in each zzso The overall zzso acid sequences of the zzso were slightly different from one zzso Furthermore, the sequence of zzso was the same as that deduced from a zzso clone zzso zzso zzso from the common bean zzso zzso zzso It was also revealed that there were two zzso sites in each zzso zzso of the major zzso were estimated to be zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso Each zzso of zzso and zzso had two zzso sites, while the zzso of zzso had only one zzso The major zzso zzso were estimated to be zzso at zzso in each zzso and zzso at zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso
