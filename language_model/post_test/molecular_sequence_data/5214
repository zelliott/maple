In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins belong to the zzso zzso zzso protein family which is thought to have six zzso Each zzso member is required for the early stages of DNA zzso and has a zzso central zzso acid domain containing a putative zzso binding zzso However, the precise molecular functions of zzso proteins are not yet zzso 

We investigated the physical interaction of zzso protein with the other zzso zzso zzso proteins using specific zzso zzso of zzso protein leads to the zzso of all the other members of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We zzso the zzso protein complex by a combination of column zzso The native molecular weight of the zzso complex was estimated by gel zzso to be zzso zzso The zzso fraction contained nearly equal quantities of the six zzso zzso zzso microscope observation showed that the zzso complex has a zzso shape with a central zzso 

We have developed a procedure to purify zzso zzso zzso proteins in a native zzso complex form for the first time, which opens an avenue to further zzso zzso
