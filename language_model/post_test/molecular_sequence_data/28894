To investigate whether or not alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso zzso gene occur in human zzso and whether the presence of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso defects and serum zzso concentration in zzso zzso 

A prospective case control zzso 

An zzso clinic and zzso laboratory at a university zzso 

zzso zzso patients undergoing zzso zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from the zzso zzso and used for reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso pattern was analyzed by zzso zzso using zzso designed to amplify a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso products of zzso zzso were cloned and zzso 

The zzso products showed three kinds of additional bands corresponding to alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 deleted zzso was detected in all patients and inclusion zzso of small extra zzso was detected in zzso zzso of the patients with normal zzso and zzso zzso of the patients with zzso zzso The presence of inclusion zzso was not significantly associated with zzso defects but was associated with a low level of serum zzso On the other hand, zzso 6 deleted zzso was detected in only one patient having a high level of zzso concentration (30 zzso and zzso cell only zzso 

We identified three different types of alternatively spliced zzso of the human zzso zzso However, it is not clear whether or not there is an association between three zzso and zzso zzso
