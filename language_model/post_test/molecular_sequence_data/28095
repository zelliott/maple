zzso a zzso toxin from zzso zzso stimulates zzso in mast cells and enhances zzso activity of several zzso zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso This suggests that this toxin may effect cellular functions through zzso of G zzso In this report, we zzso the effects of zzso on zzso calcium concentration zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation in human zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso up to 35 zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso in zzso in zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso was attained through two discrete processes involving an initial rapid and transient calcium rise followed by a slower sustained zzso The initial but not the second zzso increase was absent in zzso zzso with zzso zzso The second but not the first zzso rise required external zzso The zzso of zzso changes and dependency on zzso calcium induced by zzso correlated with the production of zzso zzso toxin inhibited only the initial phase of zzso zzso The ability of zzso toxin to zzso zzso proteins in zzso membrane was zzso in the presence of zzso Thus, zzso activates zzso C in zzso through two independent zzso The first zzso is similar to that induced by zzso receptors in that the rapid and transient zzso of zzso C is dependent on a zzso zzso zzso zzso The second zzso is delayed, zzso insensitive to zzso zzso and requires zzso zzso
