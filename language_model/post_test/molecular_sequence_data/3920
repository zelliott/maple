The truncated zzso zzso and zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso share little sequence similarity and display structural differences in their zzso regions, suggesting distinct zzso for these zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis was expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso protein exhibiting nearly zzso zzso approximately zzso lower oxygen affinity than zzso zzso of zzso remained associated with the cell zzso and significantly enhanced its zzso in comparison with the membrane zzso of control cells or cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was decreased by washing and restored by adding zzso Additionally, membrane zzso prepared from terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli did not exhibit significant enhancement in oxygen zzso in the presence of zzso suggesting its zzso with the electron transport zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso an experimental model of zzso zzso was observed zzso of total cellular zzso throughout its zzso zzso These results provided evidence for the involvement of zzso with the component of zzso electron transport chain, suggesting that its function may be related to the zzso of oxygen transfer during zzso metabolism of zzso zzso zzso association properties of zzso may thus play a crucial role in zzso oxygen and zzso its availability to zzso zzso tuberculosis (an zzso zzso under the hypoxic conditions of its zzso zzso
