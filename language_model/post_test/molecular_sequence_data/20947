By its direct contact with outer membrane zzso zzso the zzso membrane zzso zzso delivers energy that mediates zzso zzso in zzso zzso This activity has been generally proposed to be the role of zzso in zzso zzso We now report the discovery and characterization of interactions between zzso and zzso binding protein zzso zzso display experiments predicted interaction between zzso and zzso identifying potential binding zzso on each zzso Dynamic light scattering experiments measured a complex of 55 zzso consistent with a zzso zzso The zzso radius of the complex was unchanged in the presence of zzso Surface zzso resonance measured zzso interaction zzso that were independent of zzso and that deviated from a simple binding zzso zzso zzso from intrinsic zzso suggested a multifaceted interaction that was independent of zzso In addition, the presence of zzso did not abrogate subsequent binding of zzso by zzso Taken together, these data support a previously proposed model wherein zzso serves as a scaffold to zzso position zzso for initial binding of zzso and for its subsequent zzso These results substantiate a diverse role for zzso with its multiple zzso interactions in bacterial zzso zzso zzso
