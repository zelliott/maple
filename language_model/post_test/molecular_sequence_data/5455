The sequence of a zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso was zzso This zzso contains two complete zzso designated zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso extend over 828 and zzso zzso zzso They are separated only by 3 zzso and appear to be present in a zzso zzso zzso A typical zzso signal sequence is present at the N zzso of the two deduced zzso The zzso sequence of zzso shows a high degree of identity to the region adjacent to the zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso It also exhibits features characteristic of zzso zzso zzso in that it contains the same pattern of variable and zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso reveals a signature zzso consensus motif zzso characteristic of the class of zzso called zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or both were zzso zzso activity studies of zzso coli clones containing these plasmids showed that both genes are necessary for this activity, whatever their zzso or trans zzso As zzso produces a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso must occur at the membrane zzso
