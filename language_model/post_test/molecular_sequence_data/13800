The molecular epidemiology of a large, multistate outbreak of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Journal of the American Medical Association zzso zzso et zzso zzso Journal of zzso Diseases zzso was examined using new methods to detect small round structured viruses zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and to characterize strains by Southern zzso and zzso sequencing of zzso of a zzso product amplified from the zzso zzso zzso Of 37 stool specimens examined from patients in eight clusters of the multistate outbreak, 32 zzso gave zzso products specific for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso products from the eight clusters were confirmed to have the identical zzso indicating that this large outbreak was attributed to a single strain of zzso In one of the eight zzso five zzso of eight patients had a mixed infection with a second zzso strain that belonged to zzso zzso zzso Of 12 specimens from patients in five other outbreaks and one sporadic case which occurred at the same time as the multistate outbreak, 10 zzso gave products specific for zzso representing four zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sequences of the zzso products from two outbreaks and that of the zzso product from another outbreak were identical to the zzso sequence from the eight clusters and the zzso sequence from the one cluster of the multistate outbreak, zzso These results demonstrate the first application of these methods to enhance our understanding of the molecular epidemiology of zzso and provide answers of public health interest that could not have been obtained using classical zzso methods zzso
