zzso is an zzso zzso expressed by natural killer zzso cells and a subset of zzso T zzso zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso results in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and recruitment and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which in turn suppresses zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso and zzso with the latter lacking the stem zzso We identified three new alternative transcripts of the zzso gene in addition to the originally described zzso zzso One of the zzso termed zzso lacks the portion that encodes the stem zzso zzso associates with both zzso and zzso but zzso associates with the zzso This is probably due to the absence of a stem region in both zzso and zzso zzso is capable of binding zzso and, when expressed in zzso zzso T cells, zzso zzso zzso signals, demonstrating that this zzso is zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso that zzso pair with each other to produce a functional zzso indicates that this may be more than a serendipitous zzso zzso may contribute to the plasticity of the zzso zzso zzso by insuring an adequate zzso zzso
