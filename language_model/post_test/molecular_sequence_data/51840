zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect zzso B virus DNA in the zzso and zzso of nine patients with chronic zzso B after zzso or spontaneous loss of serum zzso B surface zzso Patients were evaluated at intervals ranging from 3 to 67 months after disappearance of zzso B surface zzso zzso was performed using primer pairs from the surface and core gene regions, and surface gene products were zzso Liver tissue was also evaluated by in zzso zzso to assess viral zzso Five of the nine patients had viral DNA zzso in serum by zzso zzso of zzso chain reaction products in serum and liver showed that the DNA levels tended to decline progressively after zzso zzso Six of seven surface zzso patients tested had zzso viral DNA in the liver, and four of the six zzso patients were negative for DNA in serum by zzso None had surface gene zzso zzso Thus, it is concluded that zzso B virus DNA may be zzso by zzso in liver tissue years after the disappearance of zzso B surface zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso B virus DNA in zzso
