The signal recognition particle zzso transport of proteins across zzso zzso zzso requires zzso in a capacity distinct from zzso zzso We defined the role of zzso by a molecular characterization of zzso zzso that accumulate after incubation of zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso zzso displacement of zzso from zzso was zzso both with intact zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was localized to the alpha zzso of the zzso by zzso labeling and by probing zzso blots of the zzso with zzso Analysis of the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso revealed zzso acid sequences that are similar to zzso zzso binding site consensus sequence zzso
