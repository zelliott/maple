A novel zzso zzso termed zzso was cloned and characterized from the human breast cancer cell line, zzso As observed with other zzso zzso is a product of alternative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso and zzso zzso that are commonly found in other family members, but lacks a zzso and zzso zzso The new zzso possesses a unique zzso region that includes a zzso domain that may function as a zzso zzso A zzso zzso version of zzso competes for binding to soluble zzso and zzso fusion proteins with affinities similar to those observed for zzso zzso has a wide distribution in zzso or zzso zzso but in contrast to other zzso it is not present in breast, zzso liver and small zzso zzso of zzso with its zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested that the growth of the zzso cell line might be a result of the zzso stimulation of a growth factor signaling zzso Treatment of zzso cells with an zzso zzso zzso that interferes with the zzso formation of zzso zzso complexes shows a strong growth zzso effect on this cell zzso Moreover, incubation with a zzso fusion protein that zzso zzso zzso also zzso cell zzso These data suggest that the zzso of zzso by zzso cells leads to the formation of a zzso active zzso complex and stimulates the growth of these cells in an zzso zzso
