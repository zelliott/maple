We compared the influences of grazing by the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso on zzso zzso affiliated with the zzso cluster and zzso zzso of the species zzso zzso These bacteria were almost identical in size zzso zzso and zzso zzso on a zzso strain resulted in a reduction of zzso relative to the initial bacterial cell numbers within 20 days, while in comparable zzso experiments with nine zzso zzso no significant decrease of cell numbers by zzso was observed over the period of zzso zzso The differences in zzso mortality between the zzso strains and the zzso strain clearly demonstrated zzso grazing resistance for the investigated zzso zzso this zzso grazing resistance is shared by all nine investigated zzso strains and thus represents a zzso zzso We investigated if an zzso previously observed in an zzso study, was responsible for the grazing resistance of these zzso zzso aiming for removal of the zzso or modification of cell surface proteins of one of the zzso strains by treatment with zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in zzso to zzso higher grazing rates in comparison to the levels for zzso zzso These results indicate the protective role of a zzso cell surface structure in the zzso grazing resistance of the zzso zzso zzso which can be regarded as a zzso zzso
