zzso protein zzso is a widely expressed membrane protein with multiple functions in zzso and zzso zzso Having physically mapped the zzso gene into a zzso zzso covering approximately 1 zzso on human zzso zzso we determined the zzso organization of the zzso established its expression in skeletal muscle, and identified a novel zzso zzso Our expression studies demonstrate expression of zzso protein in the zzso system and the zzso of skeletal muscle cells where its function thus far is not zzso
