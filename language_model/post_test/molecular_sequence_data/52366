zzso zzso membrane proteins are initially zzso with a zzso zzso extension that signals anchor zzso zzso in zzso cells of zzso fusion proteins containing the zzso signal of zzso accelerating factor zzso fused to the zzso of human growth hormone zzso produces both zzso zzso and zzso precursors that retain the zzso zzso Using zzso fusion proteins containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso are retained inside the cell and accumulate in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires the presence of either a functional or a zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins containing only the zzso zzso domain (a component of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso analysis shows zzso of the zzso zzso fusion proteins with both a zzso marker and with zzso a marker of the zzso intermediate zzso Since zzso zzso is zzso to facilitate the transport of proteins to the cell surface, we engineered a zzso site into zzso zzso failed to completely override the transport block, but allowed some zzso zzso to pass through the zzso zzso and acquire zzso H zzso The retained molecules remained zzso H zzso We suggest that the zzso fusion protein is retained in a sorting compartment between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We speculate that a mechanism exists to retain proteins containing an zzso zzso signal as part of a system for quality zzso
