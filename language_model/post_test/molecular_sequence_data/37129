zzso v zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso of the major birch zzso zzso zzso v zzso The zzso v 1 protein belongs to the ubiquitous family of zzso plant proteins zzso which are produced in zzso to various zzso Although the zzso properties of zzso proteins have been extensively zzso their biological function in plants is not zzso The crystal structure of zzso v zzso in complex with zzso has been determined to a resolution of zzso using the method of molecular zzso The structure reveals a large zzso zzso cavity that spans the protein and is partly occupied by two zzso molecules which are bound in tandem and only partially exposed to zzso This finding indicates that the zzso cavity may have a role in zzso the transfer of zzso zzso The structural similarity of zzso and zzso zzso ubiquitous plant steroid hormones, prompted the mass zzso zzso study in order to examine whether zzso can bind to zzso v zzso The zzso analysis of a mixture of zzso v zzso and zzso revealed a specific zzso interaction of zzso v zzso with zzso and zzso Together, our findings are consistent with a general zzso carrier function for zzso v 1 and related zzso zzso The role of zzso transport in zzso proteins may be of crucial importance in the plant defense response to pathological situations as well as in growth and zzso
