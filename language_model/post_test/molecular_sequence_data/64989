The zzso zzso zzso binding protein from the white shrimp zzso zzso zzso is also a high density zzso zzso involved in innate zzso The zzso full length zzso sequence determined was zzso zzso long, and contains a long zzso region with a zzso signal and a zzso zzso The open reading frame is zzso zzso acids long and the zzso zzso of the mature protein is localized in position 198 of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence against zzso detected only significant similarity to zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso muscle, zzso and zzso but not in zzso as determined by zzso We discuss the analysis of the deduced primary sequence in terms of the predicted secondary structure, zzso and zzso motives relevant to its dual roles in zzso and zzso zzso
