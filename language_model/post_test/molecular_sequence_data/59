zzso a giant DNA virus infecting zzso is revealing an increasing list of unique features such as a zzso zzso with numerous genes not found in other zzso a uniquely zzso promoter zzso and a particle of zzso complexity using two distinct portals for zzso delivery and zzso zzso we contribute a further zzso distinctive feature discovered by sequencing a panel of viral zzso produced for probing the structure of zzso zzso All zzso zzso are zzso at a site coinciding exactly with zzso but strongly zzso zzso zzso The analysis of zzso Life Sciences zzso zzso zzso tags zzso confirmed this finding for all zzso genes independent of their zzso zzso and expression zzso The absence of a suitable zzso signal between adjacent genes results in transcripts encompassing multiple zzso in the same or even in opposite zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso are expressed as zzso zzso including an zzso composite zzso To our knowledge, both the nature and the stringency of the zzso zzso defining the location of zzso sites are unique, raising once more the question of zzso evolutionary zzso The precise molecular mechanisms implementing the hairpin rule into the zzso processing of zzso zzso remain to be zzso
