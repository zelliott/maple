zzso zzso activates multiple signaling pathways to enforce cell proliferation in tumor zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is required for the transforming effects of zzso and its zzso is often sufficient to convey zzso zzso However, in some settings zzso zzso triggers a permanent cell cycle arrest with features of cellular zzso How the zzso zzso activates different cellular programs is not well zzso Here we show that zzso zzso predominantly in the zzso during zzso zzso This zzso zzso seems to be dependent on an active nuclear export mechanism and can be rescued by the viral zzso zzso zzso with this hypothesis, we showed that zzso dramatically zzso the expression of the zzso nuclear export factor zzso Also, zzso interference against zzso restored the nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso their escape from zzso Because zzso prevents the transforming effect of zzso zzso our results suggest a tumor zzso function for zzso that operates by means of controlling the zzso of zzso
