zzso and zzso zzso share the zzso family of viral immune evasion proteins that inhibit the surface expression of zzso such as major zzso complex class I zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso family proteins contain an zzso zzso or zzso domain followed by two zzso zzso To examine whether human zzso are functionally related to the viral zzso we studied seven zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso proteins located to zzso zzso and several zzso proteins reduced surface levels of known zzso of the viral zzso zzso Two closely related zzso zzso and zzso reduced surface expression of zzso zzso In the presence of zzso or zzso zzso was zzso and rapidly zzso by zzso whereas zzso molecules lacking zzso in their zzso tail were resistant to zzso The zzso regions containing the zzso domain of several zzso proteins examined zzso zzso formation in zzso suggesting that zzso proteins are zzso zzso The functional similarity of the zzso family and the zzso family suggests that the viral immune evasion proteins were derived from zzso zzso a novel family of zzso zzso zzso that seems to target zzso for zzso destruction via zzso of the zzso zzso
