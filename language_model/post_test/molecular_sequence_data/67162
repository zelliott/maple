zzso zzso has been well studied in the zzso zzso and zzso which have become models for investigation into the zzso zzso To understand the evolution of the zzso system in the zzso comparative analyses of the zzso in zzso other than zzso and zzso are zzso We report the identification of six putative zzso zzso zzso genes zzso in natural populations of zzso zzso an zzso species from a zzso which is closely related to zzso These zzso display striking similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in sequence and zzso Our zzso analysis supports the scenario of differing zzso evolution along the two lineages (The zzso lineage and zzso zzso Our results also argue that the ancestral zzso lacked the zzso gene zzso zzso and that the diversification of zzso predates the separation of zzso and zzso
