The human zzso virus type 1 long terminal zzso zzso contains binding sites for several cellular zzso factors which contribute to zzso gene zzso Our previous studies on the function of the zzso zzso protein suggested that zzso may be an inhibitor zzso zzso To determine whether zzso affects the binding of cellular factors implicated in zzso regulation, zzso zzso corresponding to the binding sites were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from zzso zzso lines that were not zzso or were zzso with zzso zzso We found that zzso inhibited the recruitment of zzso zzso activity in zzso human zzso Additionally, zzso expressing cells were zzso zzso with a zzso in which zzso zzso DNA recognition sequences were cloned downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in this construct was inhibited in zzso cells but not in control zzso These studies suggest that, by zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in regulating zzso gene expression in infected zzso
