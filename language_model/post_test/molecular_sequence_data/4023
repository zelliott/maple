The advent of in zzso DNA amplification has enabled rapid acquisition of zzso zzso We present here an analogous technique for protein zzso in which the coordinated and zzso binding of a target protein by two DNA zzso promotes zzso of zzso linked to each zzso affinity zzso The zzso of two such proximity zzso gives rise to an zzso DNA sequence that reflects the identity and amount of the target zzso This proximity zzso zzso detects zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso amounts of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso without washes or zzso and the mechanism can be generalized to other forms of protein zzso
