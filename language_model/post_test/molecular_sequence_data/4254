To investigate the zzso of male sex determination and zzso development in the zzso plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were isolated from developing flowers by zzso zzso One of the zzso identified, zzso had high DNA and zzso acid sequence zzso to the male sex determining gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso Both genes are expressed in male and not in female flowers, However, they do not share the same expression zzso The zzso gene product is expressed in the zzso zzso of male zzso flowers where it is necessary for zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in the zzso zzso of male white zzso and therefore its gene product cannot perform the same function in sex determination that zzso performs in zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells of white zzso male flowers and of white zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene is also expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso gene (named zzso was also found in zzso zzso The similarity in primary sequence and expression pattern of zzso and zzso indicate that these genes have a zzso role in zzso zzso
