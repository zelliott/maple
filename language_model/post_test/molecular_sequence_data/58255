The zzso hormone zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso act as zzso zzso when they are not occupied by their zzso zzso This zzso function is zzso by proteins called zzso One of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso was originally isolated as a zzso X zzso protein called zzso We have isolated a new potential zzso of zzso that is missing previously described zzso zzso zzso but is similar in structure to the related zzso termed zzso or zzso zzso analysis of the interaction with zzso and zzso demonstrates that zzso contains a new zzso interaction domain, termed zzso in addition to the previously described domain, referred to here as zzso Both zzso and zzso are capable of interacting independently with either zzso or zzso as assessed by the zzso zzso system, by a zzso zzso system, or by direct in zzso zzso zzso with all three approaches confirm that zzso also interacts with zzso X zzso but this interaction is weaker than that with zzso or zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso can interact with several different nuclear hormone receptors via two separate zzso interaction zzso zzso between the interactions observed in the different systems suggest that zzso function may be modified by additional factors present in various cell zzso
