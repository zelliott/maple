Two regions of the primary structure of the small zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and used to design zzso and zzso zzso for the detection and identification of zzso Total cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso sheep and zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso occurred at temperatures ranging from 21 degrees C to 41 degrees C or 51 degrees zzso One probe detected only zzso zzso and another successfully zzso to several members of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso of total cellular zzso was sufficient to yield zzso hybrids in slot zzso zzso The excellent sensitivity suggests that zzso zzso are capable of detecting individual zzso and can zzso low levels of zzso infections not zzso by other zzso The results of this study show that it is possible to zzso the specificity of zzso zzso for zzso zzso or zzso zzso
