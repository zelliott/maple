Proper folding and assembly of zzso zzso involves a zzso progression zzso by a group of protein zzso A through zzso Upon release of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso they are acted upon by each zzso in the folding zzso through a unique combination of protein interaction zzso zzso structures have previously been reported for zzso A and the zzso zzso domain of zzso B zzso Here we report the zzso structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and show that it closely resembles zzso as was recently zzso on the basis of zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso binds partially folded zzso zzso and a putative zzso motif within the zzso domain is identified from sequence and structure zzso Based on modeling of the zzso zzso E zzso domain, we zzso that zzso B and E may associate via their zzso zzso in a manner analogous to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein interaction zzso
