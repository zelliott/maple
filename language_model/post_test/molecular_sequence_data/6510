zzso is a zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso which was predicted to switch specificity from zzso to zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, extracted with zzso zzso by column zzso and zzso by zzso dialysis against buffer containing zzso The zzso protein bound zzso zzso with considerably higher affinity than zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso protein was highly dependent on zzso zzso In contrast, both the wild type and zzso proteins were protected from zzso equally well by zzso and zzso zzso zzso at high zzso The zzso zzso zzso appears to be a valuable zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso for the study of zzso interactions in systems in which multiple zzso are active, although interactions with zzso zzso should be evaluated if they are present at high zzso
