Previously, we have reported that zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso lowers their zzso concentration in several biological zzso We have now tested these zzso for zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to the translation initiation site of zzso protein protect cells from the zzso effect of zzso in acute infection zzso The zzso of zzso is approximately zzso zzso which represents a strong reduction in concentration as compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso In contrast with most reports in the literature, we have observed sequence specific zzso effects with zzso zzso This was particularly noteworthy in zzso experiments performed with zzso zzso presenting zzso in the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso at the target site were sufficient to reduce very significantly the zzso activity of the zzso but did not modify the effect of zzso zzso Unlike free zzso zzso ones do not interfere with virus penetration and/or reverse zzso as demonstrated by zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of viral zzso
