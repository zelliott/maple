We cloned and characterized a novel human member of the zzso zzso protein zzso family named zzso Based on its domain structure, zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which includes zzso center zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso responsive to stress zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the recently published zzso stress response zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso with zzso zzso acid similarity in the zzso zzso The similarity of the zzso zzso domain to zzso is zzso The zzso transcript is zzso zzso and the protein was found in all human, zzso and monkey cell lines zzso An in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso can zzso basic zzso zzso as well as zzso Interestingly, zzso prefers zzso to zzso as a zzso zzso and can use both zzso and zzso as zzso zzso Like zzso zzso is activated by zzso However, a zzso stimulus of zzso activity was not zzso zzso activity does not change upon exposure to several zzso and stress zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso dead protein affects neither the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is part of a novel signaling zzso
