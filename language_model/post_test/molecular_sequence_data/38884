zzso amplification of the zzso repeat in zzso 1 of the zzso gene is routinely undertaken to confirm a clinical diagnosis of Huntington disease zzso and to provide zzso testing for zzso relatives of affected zzso Our studies have detected zzso zzso on the zzso carrying the expanded repeat in three of 91 apparently unrelated HD zzso zzso analysis of these zzso has revealed the same zzso event, leading to the juxtaposition of uninterrupted zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that a zzso region exists in the zzso gene bounded by the zzso and zzso repeats and that caution should be exercised in designing zzso that zzso to the region bounded by these zzso Two of the HD families zzso zzso zzso with expanded uninterrupted zzso repeats at the lower end of the zone of reduced zzso The expanded repeats are zzso unstable in these families, although this instability is within a small range of repeat zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso in these two families zzso only one of which is similar to that reported previously as being specific for new HD zzso Finally, no apparent zzso instability of the uninterrupted zzso repeat was observed in the brain of one of the HD zzso
