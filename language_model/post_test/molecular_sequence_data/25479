zzso is a zzso zzso abundantly expressed in the zzso coli outer zzso Previous investigations have shown the possibility of inserting zzso zzso in cell zzso regions of zzso by zzso DNA techniques without disturbing the zzso and the functioning of the zzso This method proved to be successful for zzso disease virus B cell zzso We have now shown for the first time that zzso can also be used as a carrier zzso for T cell zzso A zzso T cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis was expressed in zzso and tested for recognition by specific T cell zzso zzso and efficient T cell proliferation was found after stimulation with this protein construct in zzso Interestingly, zzso fixation of zzso cells did not abrogate T cell zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso 65 itself, recognition of zzso zzso in the context of zzso appeared to be independent of zzso zzso At the level of zzso T cell responses the zzso in the context of zzso is recognized more efficiently than zzso as synthetic zzso or in the context of the zzso 65 zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso may serve as attractive vaccine carrier not only for B, but also for T cell zzso Furthermore, the possibility for expression of zzso zzso in attenuated zzso zzso strains offers the exciting prospect of new types of live oral vaccines expressing selected combinations of B and T cell zzso
