zzso branching and zzso formation are tightly linked zzso events during the establishment of synaptic zzso zzso formed zzso promote branch initiation and zzso However, little is known about molecular mechanisms that link these two zzso Here, we show that local assembly of an zzso zzso at nascent zzso sites zzso both zzso formation and zzso zzso We further find that assembly of the zzso network requires a direct interaction between the synaptic cell zzso zzso zzso and a key regulator of zzso zzso the zzso regulatory complex zzso zzso zzso tail binds to the zzso using a consensus zzso interacting zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso or mutating the zzso zzso motif leads to loss of local zzso synaptic material, and zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that synaptic zzso zzso which serve as a necessary component for both zzso and zzso branch formation, directly regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso
