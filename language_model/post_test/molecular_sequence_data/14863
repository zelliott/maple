The zzso structures of zzso and zzso confirmed the zzso protein family as a self-contained family of zzso proteins within the zzso of scorpion zzso zzso The zzso which also comprise zzso are zzso active against zzso and zzso zzso Despite high sequence identity, the three proteins showed distinct differences with respect to their biological zzso zzso exhibited a significantly stronger capacity to zzso the zzso membrane of zzso zzso than zzso and zzso zzso it is the only zzso that displays zzso activity and that was zzso active against zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso led to an zzso of bacterial cells that was not observed with zzso Analysis of the molecular surface properties of zzso allowed confirmation of the zzso model as the zzso model for the zzso zzso Besides being zzso active, zzso and zzso in contrast to zzso were able to enhance the repair of zzso nerves ex zzso zzso all three zzso enhanced the viability of zzso zzso cells, extending their functional zzso As zzso appears to be both a functional and structural zzso of zzso and zzso the putative structural correlate responsible for the nerve repair capacity in zzso was located to a cluster of six zzso acid zzso using the sequence similarity of zzso zzso
