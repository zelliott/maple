zzso is a group zzso zzso derived from the mobile twin zzso group I zzso zzso in the nuclear zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is responsible for zzso zzso processing in zzso and in zzso at two internal sites close to the zzso of the zzso zzso open reading frame and is a unique example of a group I zzso with an evolved biological zzso zzso is the smallest functional group I zzso known from nature and has an unusual core organization including the 6 zzso zzso zzso Here we report results of functional and structural analyses that identify zzso elements critical for zzso outside the zzso zzso core zzso zzso from deletion analysis, zzso zzso and zzso structure probing analysis all support the existence of two new zzso named zzso and zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso decreases in the zzso rate, k zzso were observed in disruption zzso involving both zzso These effects were restored by zzso base pairing zzso The possible role of zzso is to zzso the zzso core, whereas zzso appears to be more directly involved in zzso
