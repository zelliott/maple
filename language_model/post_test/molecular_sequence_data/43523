The role of peptides in determining immune responses for both zzso and zzso recognition has been clearly zzso The importance of different regions of the major zzso complex zzso class II zzso in contributing to recognition has been demonstrated by studies involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso These studies have indicated that the zzso region of the zzso class II zzso has a role to play in contributing to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Variation in the importance of different regions of the zzso class II zzso may be dependent on different aspects of this interaction, such as restriction specificity and affinity of the responding zzso zzso and the nature of the bound zzso We demonstrate here that the degree of zzso zzso may be zzso zzso Thus, a series of zzso molecules were generated by zzso the first and second variable region of a particular DR beta 1 zzso with the third variable region of a different DR beta 1 zzso A panel of zzso which expressed these hybrid zzso was then generated and used as zzso cells zzso A panel of zzso zzso clones was generated using the native zzso molecules as the restricting zzso For the majority of restricting zzso zzso zzso and zzso all three variable regions were required for zzso The exception to this observation was zzso which was zzso Such zzso may facilitate the breakdown of zzso through the zzso recognition of other zzso in zzso zzso Such an observation as this may contribute to our understanding of the zzso of zzso arthritis, an zzso disease strongly associated with zzso
