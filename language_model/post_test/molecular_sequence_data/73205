zzso proteins of the zzso zzso factor zzso family are thought to control zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso appears to be a good model that is functionally similar to other members of the zzso The function of zzso in zzso dynamics has been examined using a combination of zzso methods and zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso conditions and at pH zzso zzso binds the zzso forms of zzso or zzso with an affinity two orders of magnitude higher than the zzso or zzso zzso A major property of zzso is its ability to enhance the in zzso turnover rate zzso of zzso filaments to a value comparable to that observed in zzso in zzso zzso zzso increases the rate of propulsion of zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso extracts and shortens the zzso zzso These effects are zzso by the participation of zzso in zzso filament zzso which results in a change in the kinetic parameters at the two ends of the zzso zzso The kinetic effects of zzso are end specific and cannot be accounted for by filament zzso The main functionally relevant effect is a zzso increase in the rate of zzso zzso from the pointed ends, while the rate of zzso from the barbed ends is zzso This large increase in the zzso step of the zzso cycle at steady state is responsible for the increase in the rate of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the function of zzso is not to zzso zzso zzso uses zzso zzso in zzso assembly to enhance filament zzso
