A zzso core particle is composed of two each of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located inside the particle with approximately 47 base pairs zzso of DNA wrapped around the zzso in about zzso turns of a left-handed zzso The path of the zzso is not zzso the DNA is sharply bent, or zzso at positions zzso disposed at a distance of about one and four zzso turns in both directions from the zzso zzso axis zzso as sites zzso 1 and zzso 4 zzso This zzso zzso is considered zzso to other zzso complexes, but its mechanism is not clear zzso in zzso zzso zzso chemical zzso within the core particle has revealed strong binding of each of the two zzso zzso molecules to DNA at a distance of zzso zzso turns either side of the zzso zzso axis zzso zzso zzso In each of these sites, a single flexible domain of zzso was previously shown to contact three points, at about zzso 55 and 65 on one strand and zzso 88 on the complementary zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of each zzso zzso these three locations are closely juxtaposed across the highly compressed minor and major grooves zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso site is zzso embedded in a highly basic cluster zzso which is probably involved in the sharp zzso of the DNA double zzso at the zzso 1 zzso
