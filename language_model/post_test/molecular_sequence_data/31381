In order to investigate the role of the zzso segment in the zzso zzso and structural properties of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, the corresponding gene has been modified at either of two sites using zzso zzso the zzso at position 279 was changed from zzso zzso into zzso zzso and the zzso at position 311 from zzso zzso into zzso zzso The gene zzso at position 279 is not expressed as an active zzso probably because a zzso chain lacking 41 zzso zzso cannot fold and/or assemble under the zzso zzso The gene zzso at position 311 is expressed as an active zzso which has been zzso to zzso The zzso of this protein shows that it has no zzso which confirms that the last nine zzso at the zzso terminal are zzso This zzso has almost the same specific activity and affinities for the two zzso zzso and zzso as intact zzso the zzso by zzso zzso is also very zzso The last nine zzso are thus not important for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso is still sensitive to zzso by zzso or zzso by zzso but its affinity for the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso segment also appears to contribute to the stability of the interactions between zzso the zzso protein is less stable than the wild type towards zzso by heat or zzso zzso
