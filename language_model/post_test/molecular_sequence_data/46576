Vitamin D binding protein zzso is a major carrier protein for the vitamin D zzso but may also play an important role in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene have been reported, including zzso repeat zzso downstream of zzso zzso We have examined the relationship between zzso of the zzso gene and bone mineral density zzso and zzso fractures in a group of 26 men with zzso fractures but no underlying secondary cause of osteoporosis zzso age 64, ages zzso zzso and 21 male control subjects zzso age 65, ages zzso zzso There was no apparent effect of zzso zzso on zzso but there was a relationship between certain zzso of zzso repeats and reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso spine and zzso neck zzso were significantly lower in men with zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso in men with zzso fractures was zzso whereas the most common zzso in control subjects was zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso Plasma zzso was higher in men with zzso zzso than those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients with zzso fractures were found to have higher levels than control subjects zzso zzso zzso Although our study is small because of the relative rarity of idiopathic osteoporosis in men, the results suggest that zzso zzso may have an important effect on plasma levels of zzso bone density and fracture risk in zzso
