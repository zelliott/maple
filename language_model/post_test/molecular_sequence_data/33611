zzso in zzso species are defined by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in recruiting other zzso zzso thus, it is the central component in zzso formation and zzso zzso The zzso proteins in several plant and animal species were found to be under positive selection, which was hypothesized to respond to the rapid changing of the repetitive DNA sequences associated with the zzso Here, we report the expression and evolution of the zzso genes in two zzso rice species as well as their representative zzso zzso zzso Both copies of the zzso genes were transcribed in the two zzso species and showed a zzso expression zzso zzso positive and stabilizing selection of the zzso genes was associated with different zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso evolution of zzso was maintained in the two zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrate that the zzso events did not alter the expression or evolutionary patterns of the zzso genes in the zzso zzso
