The zzso fatty acid zzso from zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso double bond system to a zzso double bond system, creating zzso zzso acid zzso zzso accepted a wide range of free zzso fatty acids as zzso ranging from zzso fatty acids to zzso converting them to fatty acids with two or three zzso double zzso For expression of zzso in zzso the zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso acid zzso was altered for optimal zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso zzso zzso The percentage of zzso of total zzso fatty acids was 8 times higher in zzso transformed with zzso than in cells transformed with zzso zzso was detected in amounts up to zzso of total free fatty acids in zzso transformed with zzso but none was detected in zzso transformed with zzso zzso or zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter or the zzso zzso promoter was transformed into tobacco zzso zzso was only detected in seeds in zzso zzso The amount of zzso detected in zzso fatty acids was up to zzso in free fatty acids up to zzso
