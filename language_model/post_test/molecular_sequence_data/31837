The major goal of this study is to design, zzso and evaluate zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso in an zzso zzso These zzso zzso exhibited excellent zzso and cell zzso as evaluated by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso were added to zzso DNA zzso solution, the zzso interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to the formation of stable zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated zzso higher cellular zzso as compared to unmodified zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso showed efficient protection of zzso from zzso I attack and exhibited zzso higher zzso in comparison with unmodified zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings illustrate that the zzso zzso could be exploited as a potential zzso zzso for efficient gene zzso
