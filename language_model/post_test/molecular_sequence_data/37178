zzso C virus zzso is a zzso zzso virus that encodes a zzso required for viral zzso Although zzso does not replicate through a DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and DNA zzso An X-ray crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso has been zzso and the zzso acids interactions within the zzso pocket were zzso Among these, zzso zzso and zzso were reported to have base stacking interactions and to be important for the unwinding function of zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that specific interactions between the zzso and zzso in the zzso pocket are responsible for the zzso specificity zzso We therefore zzso zzso and zzso to investigate their role in zzso specificity in zzso zzso Replacement of zzso but not zzso with zzso zzso resulted in complete loss of zzso unwinding activity, whereas DNA unwinding activity was largely zzso The loss of unwinding activity was fully restored in the zzso zzso indicating that the aromatic ring is crucial for zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso acid binding activities in the zzso zzso zzso revealed that these activities are not directly responsible for the zzso specificity zzso zzso modeling of the zzso interaction at zzso revealed a putative zzso hydrogen bond between the zzso of zzso and the aromatic zzso zzso This evidence zzso with zzso results suggesting that the zzso bond may play an important role in the zzso unwinding activity of the zzso zzso zzso
