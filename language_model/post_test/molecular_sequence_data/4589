We have identified a zzso zzso that encodes a new zzso of six zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The predicted peptides share the zzso sequence zzso but have different zzso zzso We discuss possible functional roles of these different peptides based upon experiments with zzso as well as results from other zzso Three of the peptides were previously isolated from extracts of zzso zzso zzso and three other are novel zzso The translated product of zzso is a precursor protein containing two main zzso a zzso region containing a series of putative peptides separated by characteristic processing sites and a relatively zzso zzso region with no obvious zzso Although the overall structure of the translated product of zzso is similar to zzso from zzso zzso zzso there is little evidence for zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso At least four different transcripts of zzso have been zzso These transcripts differ in their 3' and zzso untranslated regions, and one of the transcripts predicts a truncated precursor protein which contains only the zzso zzso zzso
