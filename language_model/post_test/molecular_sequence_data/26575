This study examined the zzso relationship and identification of five zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using partial sequencing of a zzso zzso I zzso DNA zzso The sequence analysis data showed that zzso zzso sites out of 628 sites were variable without zzso or zzso Rate of transition zzso were higher than zzso zzso There was a high zzso divergence zzso zzso to zzso in zzso species as compared to zzso sequence divergence zzso for zzso zzso zzso for T zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for T zzso zzso % for zzso zzso The zzso tree, constructed by maximum zzso maximum likelihood and zzso pair group average methods revealed similar results suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had a close relationship to each other while maximum divergence was observed in zzso zzso which was also confirmed by the genetic distance zzso The results indicate that zzso sequencing or zzso is useful in zzso zzso relationship and identification of zzso zzso
