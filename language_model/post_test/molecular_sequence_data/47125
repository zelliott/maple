Six DNA fragments of zzso zzso isolated from nuclear envelopes of zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Analysis of their zzso organization suggests that these fragments are highly specified zzso zzso of a zzso zzso In the evolutionary process, they appear already in zzso and may be zzso for DNA sequences involved in structuring zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In their zzso these fragments have zzso sequences zzso to the repeats of the zzso and LINE families and to the satellite DNA of zzso zzso
