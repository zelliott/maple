zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso transfer from zzso to the zzso group of specific zzso zzso within core zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso have been recently shown to regulate gene zzso within specific zzso To facilitate zzso studies, we have developed two zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso generated in the zzso reactions was continuously measured by using a coupled zzso system with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso or zzso is accompanied by the reduction of zzso to zzso which was measured zzso at 340 zzso The zzso rate zzso with zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso to the first 20 zzso acids of zzso zzso were zzso The resulting rate zzso were not significantly different between the two coupled zzso providing strong validation of these zzso Rate zzso were also determined using the commonly employed radioactive zzso zzso and zzso The zzso to zzso lower values obtained in the radioactive zzso zzso are discussed in terms of the technical problems and limitations of this zzso The coupled zzso should be widely zzso since the production of zzso is common to all zzso zzso regardless of protein zzso
