Three zzso zzso zzso organisms were isolated from stream waters in zzso These strains grew at zzso degrees C but not at 30 degrees zzso One of the three strains was fully compatible with the zzso zzso type strain according to zzso zzso tests, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso Two of the strains closely resembled zzso zzso in zzso analyses and zzso tests, but analysis by zzso verified the presence of two new marker fatty acids zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and ITS region sequences of these two strains differed from those of zzso zzso and other previously described zzso zzso zzso the strains are regarded as new species of zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The chemical, physical and zzso quality of the water reservoirs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso As far as is known, this is the first time that zzso zzso has been isolated from natural zzso The strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been deposited in the zzso as strains zzso and zzso zzso
