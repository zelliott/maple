The cattle pathogen zzso zzso expresses life cycle zzso surface molecules involved in adaptation to different host and zzso zzso Here we report the discovery and molecular characterization of a novel zzso zzso surface zzso that is selectively expressed in the zzso zzso life cycle stage of zzso zzso Culture zzso of zzso but not of zzso culture forms zzso promoted zzso of zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso labeling experiments showed that these zzso culture zzso contained a zzso zzso protein that was not present in zzso from zzso We named this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso library after zzso The zzso gene had a zzso open reading frame that encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted mass of zzso The zzso between the predicted zzso and observed zzso masses may be explained partially by zzso of the zzso which has six potential zzso sites and a predicted zzso zzso Indeed, zzso labeling of zzso with zzso zzso revealed that zzso was a zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso showed that zzso was expressed only on the surface of the zzso stage of the zzso The identification of zzso as a unique component of culture zzso from zzso and that such zzso can zzso zzso ability on zzso suggest that zzso is worth further investigation as an zzso zzso that perhaps allows zzso zzso zzso to adhere to the zzso zzso
