zzso 1 zzso is the target protein in the skin disease zzso zzso in pigs caused by virulent strains of zzso zzso The zzso toxins produced by zzso zzso digest the zzso zzso 1 zzso by a very specific zzso This study investigated the location of single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 1 gene zzso in correlation to the zzso site as well as if the zzso of the zzso is correlated to zzso or resistance to the zzso 

DNA from 32 affected and 32 unaffected zzso with zzso zzso were diagnosed clinically as affected or zzso Two regions of the zzso 1 gene were zzso and zzso of the zzso were zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso sequences and the zzso zzso were determined for the zzso resulting in zzso acid zzso Four of the seven zzso were situated in the motif known to be important for toxin zzso The distribution of the zzso between affected and unaffected animals was zzso 

The study indicated a possible correlation between the zzso of two out of seven zzso found in the zzso zzso 1 gene and the zzso to zzso zzso
