Although the C zzso of zzso I is known to be important in zzso zzso regulation in skeletal muscle, the regulatory function of this region of cardiac zzso I zzso has not been zzso To address this question, the following zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli and zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso 211 zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso 23 zzso and zzso zzso 60 zzso The zzso activity of zzso and the zzso was tested in zzso from which zzso was extracted by exchanging zzso cardiac zzso with zzso zzso causing the zzso sensitivity of the zzso to be zzso zzso of increasing amounts of zzso zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso at zzso 8 caused a zzso zzso of the maximum zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso inhibited this activity to about zzso and 50% of that of the zzso zzso zzso We also formed a complex of either zzso zzso or each of the zzso with zzso zzso the complex into the zzso zzso and measured the zzso activity as a function of zzso We found that the zzso complex only partially restored zzso sensitivity, whereas the zzso complex did not restore any zzso zzso Each zzso zzso deletion zzso was able to bind to zzso as shown by zzso zzso analysis and size exclusion zzso Each zzso also zzso with zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso are essential for full zzso activity and zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso activity in the zzso
