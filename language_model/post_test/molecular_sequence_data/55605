zzso of cultured zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso causes the induction of a novel zzso DNA zzso activity in the zzso of the infected zzso The induction of this activity, early in infection, zzso with the early expression of the zzso zzso zzso open reading frame which possesses significant protein sequence similarity to zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso open reading frame and the zzso zzso zzso open reading frame from the zzso zzso virus were cloned under the regulation of a zzso zzso promoter and expressed in zzso coli as zzso zzso zzso During zzso on sodium zzso zzso gels, the zzso zzso proteins migrate with an apparent molecular mass of 25 zzso The zzso protein zzso generated by expression in zzso coli was zzso in zzso and, following a subsequent zzso step, displayed the ability to zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso DNA zzso with the subsequent formation of zzso zzso The viral zzso like all other characterized zzso DNA zzso is active in the presence of high zzso of zzso is zzso inhibited by zzso and does not display any zzso zzso Attempts to zzso the zzso zzso gene of zzso virus by targeted zzso of a dominant zzso zzso selection marker or direct zzso of a zzso zzso were zzso unsuccessful demonstrating that, unlike the zzso DNA zzso described for zzso the zzso zzso is essential for virus zzso
