zzso results in a zzso shift in zzso zzso Y zzso and zzso hormone zzso expression in the adult male zzso It is hypothesized that the zzso rise in zzso is responsible for the zzso decline and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also leads to a decrease in circulating zzso attributed to both reduced zzso release and peripheral zzso zzso Although zzso zzso output is suppressed in the zzso zzso we report zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are increased, while zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and 5 zzso is zzso as determined by real-time reverse zzso zzso A shift in the expression of zzso zzso zzso to favor zzso synthesis and release may be due, at least in part, to a decline in zzso negative zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we compared zzso and zzso response to zzso zzso zzso in normal male rats and rats with isolated zzso zzso zzso dwarf rats zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in zzso and zzso levels were less than zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso however, the rise in zzso zzso levels was not accompanied by a fall in zzso zzso as observed in zzso normal zzso In fact, zzso zzso levels paradoxically rose in the zzso zzso to zzso of fed zzso At the zzso level, zzso did not alter zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso but did stimulate the expression of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso of fed controls, zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso changes in zzso expression of zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso are zzso zzso In addition, these results argue against the theory that the negative association of zzso and zzso expression observed following zzso represents a simple zzso relationship and suggest that zzso either directly or zzso mediates the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
