A zzso derived from zzso acid zzso blocks human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection and fusion of zzso cells with cells expressing zzso envelope proteins zzso and zzso suggesting an effect on virus zzso This compound did not block infection by a zzso D zzso strain zzso or zzso fusion zzso by the zzso envelope zzso The genetic basis of drug resistance was therefore addressed by testing envelope zzso derived from zzso and a zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso A drug-resistant zzso was observed for all zzso bearing the zzso of zzso zzso while the origins of zzso and of the membrane anchor and zzso zzso of zzso had no apparent zzso The envelope gene of a zzso zzso fully resistant to the zzso effect of zzso was cloned and zzso Its product differed from the parental sequence at two positions in zzso with changes of zzso 22 to zzso zzso and zzso 84 to zzso zzso the zzso being zzso In the context of zzso zzso the zzso substitution was sufficient for drug zzso zzso in two different systems, differences in zzso were associated with sensitivity or resistance to zzso zzso of zzso can affect the zzso structure of zzso and zzso and the accessibility of zzso to zzso agents such as zzso zzso However, a direct effect of zzso on a zzso target must also be envisioned, in agreement with the blocking of apparently late steps of zzso zzso This compound could be a valuable tool for zzso studies of zzso
