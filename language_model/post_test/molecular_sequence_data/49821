zzso greasy grouper zzso zzso nervous necrosis viruses zzso protein zzso a virus zzso zzso was detected in both zzso and zzso of infected cells of Asian sea bass zzso and zzso cells of zzso and zzso with zzso To study its zzso zzso zzso of protein alpha with 338 zzso was fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso gene and was detected in zzso cells in the absence of other viral zzso In both zzso and zzso cells, protein alpha was found to zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein alpha indicated that zzso 43 zzso acid zzso were required to import zzso protein into the zzso Further deletions within the 43 zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso localized to the zzso suggesting that the 20 zzso acids from 14 to 33 of protein alpha were the domain of zzso zzso To further determine the zzso targeting zzso deletion zzso within the 20 zzso acids of protein alpha were zzso It was found that the deletion of zzso zzso or zzso prevented the zzso of zzso fusion proteins into the zzso demonstrating that zzso contain the signal required for zzso zzso A similar distribution pattern of zzso of protein alpha and its deletion zzso in zzso and zzso cells suggested that zzso zzso of protein alpha zzso constitute a zzso zzso signal that functions in both fish and zzso zzso
