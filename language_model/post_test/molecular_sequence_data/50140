As part of a program to discover improved zzso zzso family 12 zzso zzso zzso we have studied the zzso diversity of several zzso 12 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from the zzso zzso zzso zzso by only 14 zzso acids zzso sequence zzso but is much less zzso zzso The bacterial zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso shares only zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso and is much more zzso zzso Each of the 14 sequence differences from zzso zzso zzso were introduced in zzso zzso zzso to determine the effect of these zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso Several of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to have increased stability, and the differences in apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso ranged from a zzso degrees C increase to a zzso degrees C zzso The least stable recruitment from zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso the zzso substitution was recruited from the more stable zzso zzso zzso zzso and this zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to have a zzso zzso degrees C higher than wild zzso Thus, the buried zzso at position 35 was shown to be of critical importance for zzso stability in this structural zzso There was a zzso range in the specific activities of the zzso zzso on zzso The most and least stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were fully zzso Because of their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a continual increase in activity over the temperature range of 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C, whereas the less stable zzso zzso zzso zzso wild type and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed a decrease in activity at the highest zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined and compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All of the structures have similar zzso zzso but provide detailed insight into the nature of the stability zzso These results are an example of the power of zzso recruitment as a method for identifying zzso important for zzso
