zzso of zzso differentiation involve zzso of a set of zzso specific genes and zzso of cell proliferation in zzso zzso Previous studies revealed that bone zzso protein zzso and zzso acid zzso play important roles in the differentiation of peripheral sympathetic zzso such as the synergistic induction of responsiveness to specific zzso zzso In the present study, while trying to clarify the mechanism of the zzso we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shows no similarity to other known zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso making up the zzso family, are zzso Individual zzso genes have distinct regulatory mechanisms of expression within the nervous zzso In zzso brain, zzso is expressed from earlier zzso stage, zzso zzso and widely expressed in various zzso layers and zzso of the adult animal, while zzso and zzso were zzso from zzso and expressed in rather limited regions in a complementary zzso During the course of zzso development of sympathetic zzso zzso is induced from earlier embryonic stage and further increased toward adult stage, while zzso expressed from earlier stage is replaced by zzso expression which increases zzso in accordance with the action of zzso and zzso Furthermore, when expressed in zzso cells, all three zzso family proteins suppressed the cell cycle zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso family members in the development of the nervous system are zzso
