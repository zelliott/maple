To investigate the molecular zzso status of the Korean zzso zzso zzso zzso and Japanese zzso zzso zzso we determined partial sequences of the zzso zzso b gene of twelve Korean zzso and zzso Japanese zzso and compared them with those of the major lineages of zzso species including two other zzso species and two other zzso zzso The Korean zzso examined possessed two zzso with only one zzso difference between them, while the Japanese zzso showed slightly higher sequence diversity with five zzso zzso distances and molecular zzso trees indicated that there is considerable genetic divergence between the Korean zzso and zzso zzso (the Chinese zzso zzso and Shields zzso but virtually none between Korean and Russian zzso The Korean and Russian zzso may therefore be distinct from the Chinese zzso The data highlight the importance of conservation of the zzso populations of these regions, and the need to reconsider the zzso status of Korean and Russian zzso Our study also clearly demonstrated sufficient genetic distance between zzso and zzso to justify their assignment to separate zzso Of the three species of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso zzso than to the Japanese zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is a distinct zzso zzso data on zzso genetic variation in the Japanese zzso are also zzso
