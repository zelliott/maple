Both soluble zzso and zzso zzso zzso occur along the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Released zzso was zzso as a 67 zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso and zzso stability zzso life 10 zzso at 62 degrees zzso are different from the previously isolated soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stable at 62 degrees zzso Two zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso have been cloned using zzso based on consensus sequences of zzso and having as templates a zzso library prepared from total zzso zzso extracted from zzso One zzso codes for a zzso that has a predicted zzso sequence and was defined as zzso The other, after being cloned and zzso results in a zzso zzso with a zzso value and zzso stability like those of native soluble zzso This zzso was defined as zzso and, after it was used to generate zzso it was zzso at the zzso zzso and at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso structure and sequence alignment with zzso support a proposal regarding the zzso modulating the zzso value of the zzso zzso
