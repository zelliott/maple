Human zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso believed to have a protective role against bacterial zzso Little is known about the zzso relationships of zzso or its mechanism of zzso In this study we describe the structure of zzso analyze its interaction with model zzso and relate them to the zzso activity of the zzso The structure of zzso determined by zzso zzso reveals a compact central core with disorder at the N and C zzso The core comprises a zzso and a zzso zzso that are braced by zzso bonds between zzso and zzso and further stabilized by a network of hydrogen zzso zzso studies show that zzso membrane binding is governed by zzso zzso which are sensitive to zzso zzso zzso studies show that the zzso region of zzso is irrelevant for membrane zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso and core regions zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso reveal that the zzso activity of zzso zzso with membrane zzso Interestingly, the native and reduced forms of zzso have similar membrane affinity and zzso activities; this suggests that zzso bonds are not essential for the zzso zzso This study reveals that zzso has a novel fold for a zzso and suggests that although zzso exhibits zzso activity under zzso conditions, there is likely to be another zzso role for the zzso
