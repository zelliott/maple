If the table of the genetic code is rearranged to put complementary zzso zzso it becomes apparent that the code displays zzso mirror symmetry with respect to two zzso different modes of zzso zzso These modes involve distinct classes of zzso zzso zzso I and zzso with recognition from the minor or major groove sides of the zzso zzso zzso We analyze the zzso pairs complementary to the face-to-face zzso zzso Taking into account the zzso zzso on either side zzso and zzso we consider the risk of zzso confusion and subsequent erroneous zzso in the ancestral coding zzso This logic leads to the conclusion that zzso precursors of zzso zzso had the same two complementary modes of zzso zzso This surprising case of molecular mimicry zzso shows a key potential selective advantage arising from the zzso of zzso into two classes, zzso is consistent with the hypothesis that the two zzso classes were originally zzso by the complementary strands of the same primordial gene and zzso provides a zzso zzso between the classic genetic code, embodied in the zzso and the second, or zzso zzso code that is embodied mostly in the zzso stem and is directly responsible for proper zzso zzso
