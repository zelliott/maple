The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso containing genes involved in zzso zzso was zzso zzso generated by in zzso zzso were used to map and characterize the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso functions are tightly clustered within a zzso stretch of DNA zzso with the gene order of zzso The zzso and zzso genes are transcribed zzso The zzso protein deduced from the zzso sequence has a molecular weight of zzso zzso is a basic protein with 354 zzso acids of which 72 are basic and 38 are zzso The zzso protein consists of only 59 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso Unlike the zzso proteins of the zzso zzso which are all basic zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein containing 13 zzso and 8 basic zzso zzso The zzso protein is required in both zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso is only required in zzso zzso A zzso zzso region, including three perfectly zzso zzso found in 15 zzso zzso of the zzso family that have been zzso was also found in the zzso zzso zzso
