zzso of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso a zzso protein that regulates the activities of the zzso zzso and zzso is activated by serum growth zzso zzso zzso experiments have revealed several regions of zzso regulatory sequences involved in the response of the zzso zzso gene to zzso One area is in the vicinity of the promoter, consisting of a zzso binding site zzso at zzso for zzso factor zzso and an adjacent 24 zzso region of zzso symmetry that contains a zzso zzso A second is an upstream region zzso to zzso that acts as an zzso when linked to a zzso promoter, and contains a consensus zzso binding site (at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed differences between nuclear factors in mouse zzso cells that bound to the zzso zzso site and a consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso site is a zzso motif that binds zzso zzso translated in zzso and is an effective competitor for binding of nuclear zzso factors to the consensus zzso but in addition it binds factors that do not associate with the consensus zzso The zzso zzso motif and the zzso symmetry region zzso expression from a zzso zzso promoter in an additive fashion, and competition experiments showed that excess copies of these factor binding sites reduced expression from a reporter zzso driven by the zzso zzso Our data show that binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso factors are involved in the regulation of zzso transcription, which suggests that the coordinated induction of zzso zzso and zzso may be achieved through the actions of a shared set of nuclear zzso zzso However, the properties of the zzso zzso motif likely reflect an additional type of zzso regulation restricted to zzso
