zzso zzso composition has been noted to vary in different zzso and with the zzso and zzso status of the zzso Until now these investigations were performed either by zzso zzso or by column zzso In this report we described an zzso method to evaluate the percentage of zzso and zzso in different rat zzso zzso we applied the method to determine if a shift in zzso composition is zzso in human zzso zzso compared to normal kidney zzso In all of our specimens we were able to detect a shift toward zzso in the zzso zzso We discuss a possible role for the detection of the shift in zzso composition as a possible marker to discriminate between normal and zzso zzso
