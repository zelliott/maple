zzso of a large panel of zzso to a target DNA could be used to determine the sequence of that zzso The inherent ambiguity of the reconstruction limits the length of DNA that can be zzso by such an zzso Here I show that constraining the reconstruction by assuming that the target DNA contains an open reading frame allows longer zzso to be zzso In the case of ideal zzso using mixed zzso zzso the amount of DNA that can be zzso is extended from 700 bases to zzso zzso This is sufficient to sequence substantial portions of most zzso zzso and suggests that zzso zzso could be a practical method of generating large amounts of sequence data from zzso zzso
