To investigate the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso gene in idiopathic zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso report zzso were constructed, and the activity of zzso promoter was zzso A zzso software was used to analyze the sequence upstream of the zzso start site of rat zzso zzso which was subsequently verified with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was analyzed in zzso cells zzso with zzso small interference zzso and zzso expression zzso 

The zzso region of rat zzso gene contains two potential binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both confirmed that zzso can directly bind with site zzso As shown in zzso cells, expression of zzso may be enhanced with zzso of zzso whilst zzso expression of zzso can zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso can directly regulate the expression of zzso gene through a zzso binding site in the limb of rat zzso
