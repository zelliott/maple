zzso express zzso and Pol proteins by translation of zzso zzso viral zzso For some zzso transport of zzso viral zzso to the zzso is zzso by small regulatory proteins such as human zzso virus zzso while other zzso contain zzso transport elements in their zzso that allow transport without zzso In this study, we found that the zzso zzso sheep zzso zzso encodes within the zzso gene a zzso factor zzso necessary for the synthesis of zzso protein from zzso viral zzso zzso of zzso sequences from a zzso zzso expression zzso zzso abolished its ability to produce zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso synthesis could be restored by zzso of an zzso expression zzso zzso zzso analysis localized the zzso activity zzso to the putative zzso signal zzso and a signal zzso expression construct showed zzso zzso Two other zzso mouse zzso tumor virus zzso and human zzso zzso type K, zzso analogous factors zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso from doubly spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing identified alternate internal zzso events in the zzso end of zzso zzso that could signify analogous doubly spliced zzso zzso and zzso clones expressing two of them also showed zzso zzso The predicted zzso proteins contain motifs similar to those found in zzso Rem and other analogous zzso regulatory zzso Interestingly, in most cell lines, zzso expression plasmids with zzso deleted showed normal transport of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso however, in zzso cells zzso modestly enhanced export of zzso viral zzso zzso zzso labeling experiments with zzso indicated that zzso zzso is required for the synthesis of viral zzso zzso Thus, in most cell lines, the zzso function of zzso is to facilitate translation of zzso viral zzso
