The zzso zzso zzso MA zzso has been shown to inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso cells and liver zzso This zzso can thus be used to identify the critical zzso of the zzso region involved in the zzso zzso Using overlapping zzso peptides representing the zzso region of zzso the zzso recognized by MA zzso was shown to contain sequences from both the zzso and zzso regions, thus indicating that the zzso domain is zzso zzso To further characterize the primary structure of the zzso domain on the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso library and a zzso solid phase zzso library were used to analyze the fine specificity of the zzso zzso MA zzso Several zzso were identified with the zzso zzso library, the majority of which possess a central motif with at least three identical zzso present within the native zzso zzso No significant consensus sequences were found when these zzso were compared to the zzso zzso zzso identified using the zzso zzso library also contained a similar zzso All zzso zzso and a single zzso from the zzso zzso library zzso with zzso zzso particles containing the zzso region for binding to MA zzso Mouse zzso raised against four zzso from the zzso display library reacted with zzso particles containing zzso zzso The data show that the structure of the zzso zzso around the zzso zzso motif in the zzso region may have a functional role in binding zzso to cellular zzso and that the central motif identified in zzso of this region may offer a novel strategy target for the improvement of existing zzso B vaccines which, at present, are mostly devoid of zzso zzso
