A zzso zzso study was performed on 22 zzso zzso zzso bacteria from dairy zzso zzso zzso were retrieved from raw milk, one from a filter cloth and four from grass, straw or milking zzso These latter four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso above 70 % with zzso zzso zzso zzso but showed discrepancies in characteristics with the original species description, so an zzso description of this species is zzso According to zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso zzso experiments, the remaining 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso represented one single species, most closely related to zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso rods that grew zzso at zzso zzso The cell wall zzso type of strain zzso the proposed type strain, was zzso based on zzso zzso Major fatty acids of the strains were zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso and major polar lipids were zzso zzso and some unidentified zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso properties allowed discrimination from other zzso species of the zzso zzso and supported the description of the novel species zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the proposed type zzso
