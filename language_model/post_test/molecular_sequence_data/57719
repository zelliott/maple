To demonstrate the zzso cellular and zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors in rat brain, we generated zzso zzso that recognize the zzso zzso of individual zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and a region highly zzso in zzso zzso and zzso On zzso zzso detect distinct proteins with zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso in zzso of rat zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso zzso are distributed abundantly and zzso within zzso cell bodies and processes in cerebral cortex, zzso zzso zzso system, thalamus, zzso and zzso The precise patterns and cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are unique for each zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso express zzso and zzso zzso many zzso zzso zzso zzso in cerebral zzso are selectively zzso for zzso In zzso the cellular zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in this region, zzso zzso with many zzso zzso but is only present in a minor proportion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with most zzso zzso within the zzso zzso In several brain regions, zzso show zzso zzso Within the zzso cortex, cell bodies and processes of zzso zzso express intense zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells show zzso zzso but no evidence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are localized within cell bodies, zzso and zzso spines of specific zzso of zzso and, in the case of zzso and zzso in some populations of zzso This investigation demonstrates that individual zzso zzso zzso zzso are distributed zzso in the brain and suggests that specific zzso and zzso cells selectively express zzso receptors composed of different zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of all zzso zzso zzso within individual cells may not be obligatory for the functions of this zzso zzso in zzso
