Genes zzso a light chain and an zzso region (a variable region and a zzso domain of a heavy zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with specificity for human zzso zzso zzso were fused to a DNA segment coding for the signal zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso coli cells zzso an expression zzso containing these genes downstream of a zzso promoter were able to zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso When the cells were cultured at 37 degrees C and the zzso zzso zzso concentration was 1 zzso zzso zzso production of functional zzso was very low zzso 200 zzso culture and zzso less than 90 zzso zzso In order to zzso functional zzso production, we examined the influence of culture conditions zzso temperature and the zzso zzso on zzso of the zzso It was found that a zzso higher amount of zzso zzso could be produced at 30 degrees C using zzso zzso zzso as compared with standard zzso Under these optimal conditions, functional zzso accumulated in the zzso and culture medium for 10 h after induction and the total production level was found to reach approximately zzso zzso zzso
