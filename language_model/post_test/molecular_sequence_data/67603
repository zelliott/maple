The advantages of gene zzso or zzso are obvious in genetically modified zzso crops, and several different zzso methods are zzso Using zzso peptides for multiple gene transformation is considered to be a good method to meet a variety of zzso In our experiment, the zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso and the zzso ( 2 ) zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso were connected by a 2A or zzso zzso zzso 2A is a zzso from the zzso disease virus zzso that has zzso zzso zzso is a zzso from zzso zzso seeds that has a recognition site and is zzso by a zzso zzso is a hybrid zzso that contains the first 9 zzso acids of zzso and 20 zzso acids from zzso We used the zzso zzso to construct four coordinated expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two single gene expression zzso zzso and zzso were used as zzso The six expression zzso and the zzso zzso were transferred into tobacco by zzso zzso zzso and 529 zzso were zzso zzso detection and zzso detection data demonstrated that the transgenic zzso possessed good zzso resistance and zzso zzso The two genes in the fusion zzso were expressed zzso The plants with the genes linked by the zzso zzso showed better zzso resistance and zzso tolerance than the plants with the genes linked by zzso The expression level of the two genes linked by zzso was not significantly different from the single gene zzso Key message The expression level of the two genes linked by zzso was higher than those linked by 2A and was not significantly different from the single gene zzso
