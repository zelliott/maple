We report here a novel family of zzso coupled zzso zzso which is extraordinarily zzso among zzso zzso This family, designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso consists of at least three members, termed zzso zzso and zzso zzso members share zzso zzso acid identity with each other and show relatively high similarity to previously known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence identity between human and rat zzso is zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso while the zzso sequence is surprisingly completely identical between the zzso Furthermore, zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and zzso are 94 and zzso identical to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso members are predominantly expressed in the brain regions and zzso zzso zzso hybrid analysis localized zzso zzso and zzso genes to different human zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso The high sequence conservation and abundant expression in the central nervous system suggest the existence of undiscovered fundamental zzso systems consisting of zzso family members and their zzso zzso
