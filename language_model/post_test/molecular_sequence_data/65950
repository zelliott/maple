Despite the widespread presence of the zzso fold in most living organisms, only zzso zzso have been employed as model proteins in zzso studies so zzso This work introduces the first zzso and kinetic characterization of a zzso zzso that is, the zzso form of the zzso domain of zzso zzso from zzso zzso This bacterial zzso has a widely different sequence but nearly identical structure to its zzso zzso We show that zzso is a zzso zzso protein with moderate stability at room temperature zzso Delta G degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso known to date, as it zzso about zzso to zzso more rapidly than its zzso zzso zzso zzso whale zzso and soybean zzso zzso a compact kinetic intermediate zzso with significant zzso zzso Additionally, the single zzso zzso in the native H zzso becomes locked into a fully zzso environment within 6 zzso suggesting that this zzso and its closest spatial neighbors complete their folding at zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is a bacterial zzso that shares the general folding scheme zzso a rapid burst phase followed by slower zzso zzso of its zzso zzso but displays an overall faster folding and a kinetic intermediate with some fully zzso zzso This study supports the view that the general folding features of bacterial and zzso zzso are preserved through evolution while kinetic details zzso
