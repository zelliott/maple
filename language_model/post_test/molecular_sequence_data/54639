Heavy agricultural losses are closely related to attacks by zzso and zzso such as bacteria and zzso Among them, the fungus zzso zzso can cause gray mold in more than 200 different species of plants, and is considered a challenging problem for zzso zzso are commonly used to control this pathogen because they are zzso and easy to zzso However, the continuous use of zzso may promote the selection of resistant zzso and can also cause profound contamination in zzso zzso to find alternative strategies to solve these problems, several studies have focused on searching for plant proteins and peptides with zzso activities zzso With this in mind, this report shows the isolation and characterization of two novels zzso proteins from flowers of rosemary pepper zzso zzso zzso with 10 and zzso Isolation was performed by using an zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso indicated that isolated proteins were able to inhibit zzso zzso development, but were not effective against all bacteria zzso Moreover, zzso sequences indicate that both proteins showed sequence zzso with zzso R proteins with a lower molecular mass, suggesting possible protein zzso Data reported here could help in the development of zzso products for crop protection against zzso zzso in the near zzso
