A fraction of zzso contains a differently spliced gamma chain called zzso which presents itself mainly as zzso with the common zzso chain as zzso zzso The zzso chain differs from the zzso chain in its zzso and has important functional implications for zzso The presence of the zzso chain zzso zzso and zzso activity, influences zzso architecture, and eliminates a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels with zzso and zzso zzso have been reported, indicating that the functional effects of zzso zzso may contribute to the pathology of zzso This review summarizes the key zzso aspects of this interesting zzso of zzso and discusses inconsistencies in current zzso
