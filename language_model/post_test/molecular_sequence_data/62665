The zzso rolling circle zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso of replication zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso DNA in a zzso zzso A new zzso and procedure for zzso zzso and zzso of the protein has been zzso zzso zzso as a zzso in solution, as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicated that the protein has an estimated content of around zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso transitions of the protein showed an irreversible change in the zzso when the temperature was raised above 35 degrees C, indicating that the protein zzso a zzso change that could account for the relatively high optimal temperature of the zzso zzso
