zzso are zzso releasing zzso and eggs zzso but many species are zzso because of a zzso system in zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso coat zzso zzso consisting of 12 zzso growth zzso repeats, plays a key role in zzso recognition during zzso zzso We discovered that the amount of zzso of the zzso mature zzso is markedly higher than that of the zzso immature zzso and that the zzso mature zzso become zzso by acid treatment, which is able to release the zzso from isolated zzso zzso In addition, zzso is strongly inhibited by the zzso of zzso with zzso from a different individual, but not from the same individual, and the number of zzso zzso bound to zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso A sequence analysis of zzso disclosed that several zzso acid zzso in a restricted region are zzso at an individual level, with no identical sequences among the 10 individuals zzso Furthermore, zzso DNA analysis revealed that the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and each zzso is highly zzso among zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that multiple gene zzso or amplification of this region might have taken place during zzso It was also found that diversity in zzso sequences is derived from zzso DNA zzso probably zzso by crossing over and specific zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a candidate zzso recognition zzso in the zzso interaction of the zzso zzso zzso
