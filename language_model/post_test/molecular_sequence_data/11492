Several laboratory strains of zzso bacteria are known to be able to zzso nitrate in the presence of zzso although the zzso advantage gained from this process is not entirely zzso The contribution that zzso nitrate zzso makes to the environmental nitrogen cycle has not been zzso As a first step in addressing this question, a strategy which allows for the isolation of organisms capable of reducing nitrate to zzso following zzso growth has been zzso zzso such strains have been isolated from three zzso and a freshwater zzso and shown to comprise members of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso All of these strains expressed a nitrate zzso with an active site located in the zzso zzso Twenty-two of the strains showed significant rates of nitrate zzso in the presence of oxygen when zzso with zzso electron zzso Also isolated was one member of the zzso zzso zzso which was likewise able to zzso nitrate in the presence of oxygen but appeared to express a different type of nitrate zzso In the four environments zzso zzso bacteria capable of zzso nitrate zzso were isolated in significant numbers zzso to zzso per g of soil or zzso and in three cases were as abundant as, or more abundant than, zzso bacteria capable of zzso Thus, it seems likely that the zzso of nitrate and oxygen may indeed make a significant contribution to the flux of nitrate to zzso in the zzso
