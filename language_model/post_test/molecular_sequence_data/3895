Two decades of research have not established whether tropical insect zzso are dominated by specialists or zzso This zzso our understanding of species coexistence in diverse rainforest zzso Host specificity and species richness of tropical insects are also key parameters in mapping global patterns of zzso Here we zzso data for over 900 zzso species feeding on 51 plant species in New zzso and show that most zzso species feed on several closely related plant zzso Because zzso zzso are dominant in tropical zzso zzso zzso are probably rare in tropical zzso Furthermore, even between zzso distant zzso zzso communities typically shared a third of their zzso These results do not support the classical view that the coexistence of zzso species in the zzso is a consequence of finely divided plant zzso zzso models of tropical diversity should instead be zzso Low host specificity of tropical zzso reduces global estimates of zzso diversity from 31 million zzso 1) to 4 6 million zzso This finding agrees with estimates based on zzso collections, reconciling an order of magnitude zzso between extrapolations of global diversity based on ecological samples of tropical communities with those based on sampling regional zzso
