zzso strains of zzso Valley fever zzso virus collected over a period of 38 years and isolated from diverse localities in Africa and from various hosts zzso animal and zzso were investigated by zzso followed by sequencing of the zzso protein coding zzso This region was chosen to zzso zzso because, in contrast to the N zzso the zzso protein differs in various zzso and there exists an zzso virus zzso zzso in which zzso of the zzso zzso is deleted, suggesting that this sequence is under a weak selective zzso zzso data indicated that percentage divergence among zzso ranged from 0 to zzso at the zzso level and from 0 to zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso gene revealed two major zzso Egyptian and zzso This led to the establishment of the zzso between strains and insights into the zzso zzso the function of which is still zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences indicated that the zzso zzso are zzso as are several motifs representing potential zzso zzso
