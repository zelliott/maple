In order to zzso the molecular characteristics of Japanese encephalitis zzso virus in Okinawa, 23 strains of zzso virus isolated in a zzso span were zzso for the 240 zzso of the zzso junction region and 111 zzso of the E gene region and compared with those of reference strains isolated in mainland zzso The results of zzso analysis showed that although all the zzso zzso showed more than zzso zzso in the zzso sequence in each region, they were zzso divided into two groups: the old group zzso zzso and a new group zzso zzso On the other hand, in a comparison with reference strains in mainland Japan, the zzso zzso showed more than zzso zzso sequence zzso in both regions, indicating that the zzso strains belong to the same zzso as that of zzso strains in mainland zzso The zzso zzso of the old group was relatively higher than that of the new zzso Among the 14 strains in the new group, 13 strains were isolated from mosquitoes collected from a pig farm from 1986 through zzso These strains showed higher zzso divergence than the old group zzso isolated from mosquitoes and zzso zzso collected at several sites, in both zzso A zzso substitution at the position 1920 in the E gene was identified in three zzso This substitution generated an zzso sequence capable of serving as an attachment site of zzso
