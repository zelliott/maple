The natural environment places its resident zzso under stress, which may often result in adaptation by the zzso in order to increase the probability of zzso One such mechanism that has been zzso involves zzso which encodes a zzso factor that is known to enhance survival upon exposure to zzso The present work aimed to examine the genetic zzso of zzso in a selection of zzso zzso subspecies environmental zzso with an automated zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso The results indicated that sequence variation does occur and that these changes are mainly located in two zzso at the center and near the end of the coding zzso The zzso was generally at the zzso level, although one strain zzso zzso did demonstrate significant differences in zzso zzso
