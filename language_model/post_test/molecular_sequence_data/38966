zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso signal zzso through zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso gene expression required for mating and zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso apparently play similar roles during zzso zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of the first zzso protein from a true zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein with a zzso zzso identical to those of other zzso zzso with greatest similarity to zzso zzso and zzso lack the zzso induction domain found in budding zzso zzso but have zzso zzso finger zzso not present in the other zzso zzso A zzso strain is sterile and zzso neither zzso tissue nor zzso bodies zzso However, the development of sexual zzso zzso cells is zzso zzso growth, zzso and the differentiation of zzso asexual zzso cells zzso and zzso are normal in the deletion zzso Northern analysis of key regulators of the asexual and sexual zzso cycles support the observation that although zzso function is restricted to the sexual cycle, cross regulation between the two zzso pathways zzso Our results further suggest that while several classes of related proteins control similar zzso events in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso significant differences must exist in the regulatory zzso
