zzso is a textbook example of a small regulatory zzso zzso that acts on a zzso target zzso through imperfect base zzso Discovery of zzso as a zzso zzso of the major zzso coli zzso zzso established the paradigm for a meanwhile common mechanism of zzso zzso through zzso zzso of a zzso binding zzso However, whether zzso regulates additional genes has remained unknown for almost three zzso Here, we have harnessed the new zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso to validate newly predicted targets of zzso in zzso We show that the zzso zzso end of zzso acts by seed pairing to repress the zzso of global zzso regulator zzso and zzso protein zzso while a second targeting region is also required to regulate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso targets zzso at both the zzso binding site and deep within the coding zzso zzso binding in the coding sequence of zzso decreases zzso stability through zzso the use of a native zzso E site zzso to the short zzso zzso Altogether, this study assigns the classic zzso zzso to the growing class of zzso regulators that use diverse mechanisms to impact multiple zzso
