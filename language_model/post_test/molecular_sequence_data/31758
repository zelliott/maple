Globally, about zzso of pregnant women are persistently infected with the zzso C virus zzso zzso transmission of zzso occurs in zzso of zzso and accounts for most new childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso are vital in the clearance of acute zzso infections, but in the zzso of infections that persist, these cells become functionally exhausted or select for zzso viruses that escape T cell zzso Increased zzso replication during pregnancy suggests that zzso immune tolerance mechanisms may further impair zzso zzso limiting their selective pressure on persistent zzso To assess this possibility, we characterized circulating viral zzso during and after consecutive zzso in two zzso This revealed a loss of some escape zzso in zzso class I zzso during pregnancy that was associated with emergence of more fit zzso zzso selective pressure was zzso after zzso at which point escape zzso in these zzso again predominated in the zzso and viral load dropped zzso zzso the viruses transmitted zzso were those with enhanced fitness due to zzso of escape zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso changes of pregnancy reduce zzso selective pressure on zzso class I zzso thereby zzso vertical transmission of viruses with zzso zzso zzso
