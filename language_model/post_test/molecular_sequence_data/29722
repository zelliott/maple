The zzso zzso protein zzso is a nuclear protein that regulates alternative zzso In addition, it plays a role in the zzso during infection by some viruses and functions as a positive zzso of zzso B virus zzso zzso Thus, it presumably contains a nuclear export signal zzso Using a zzso export zzso in zzso cultured cells, we have shown that the zzso 25 zzso acid zzso of zzso function as an autonomous zzso with zzso zzso being important for its zzso Unlike the zzso zzso A1 zzso this zzso is zzso from the nuclear zzso zzso which spans the entire zzso 60 zzso of zzso The zzso zzso cannot be shown to bind to zzso or zzso cellular receptors known to export proteins from the nucleus, and it functions in the presence of zzso B, a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso deleted of its zzso unlike wild type zzso does not stimulate the export of zzso B virus zzso zzso the zzso zzso is a functionally important domain of this zzso protein that zzso an unknown export zzso
