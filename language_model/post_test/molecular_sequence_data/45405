The Baja California populations of zzso zzso a widespread species in Western North America ranging from British Columbia to southern Baja California, are characterized by extensive geographic zzso We performed zzso and historical demographic analyses on zzso zzso of the zzso b zzso gene of 110 individuals representing 28 populations to determine the relative influences of current and historical processes in shaping the present distribution of genetic diversity on the Baja California zzso zzso from this area were zzso in a zzso with three zzso zzso Two of these groups are from Baja California Sur and another is from California and Baja zzso The estimated date for the split of these groups, between zzso zzso fits with previously proposed hypotheses of zzso due to different zzso zzso although successive population fragmentation and expansion due to zzso zzso during zzso zzso cannot be zzso Historical demographic analyses detected signs of past population expansions, especially in the southernmost zzso With respect to populations north of this region, two older zzso were identified, one with zzso mainly distributed in central California, and the other corresponding to the northern half of the species range, in what apparently is a zzso pattern in the Pacific coast of North zzso Based on the zzso between zzso and available zzso data indicating that these species have a long independent evolutionary history, we propose to consider the three major zzso as distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
