We looked for the zzso transition at position zzso of zzso in 150 patients, most of them with diagnosed or suspected zzso disease, to assess the specificity of this zzso for the zzso zzso to define the clinical spectrum associated with the zzso and to study the relationship between percentage of zzso in muscle and clinical zzso Our results confirm the high correlation between the zzso transition at position zzso and the zzso syndrome, but they also show that this zzso can be associated with other zzso including zzso syndrome, zzso or zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The absence of the zzso in four typical zzso patients suggests that other zzso in the zzso zzso or elsewhere in the zzso DNA, can produce the same zzso
