Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from developing pumpkin zzso zzso zzso that show significant zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fusion protein of clone zzso converted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein oxidized zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previously cloned zzso zzso revealed additional zzso activity of zzso zzso of this gene were identified in zzso and zzso of the developing seed by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and localized in zzso root zzso zzso and zzso center by in zzso zzso zzso of the previously cloned zzso zzso from pumpkin seeds was localized in zzso and in zzso of zzso ground zzso and zzso of the zzso However, transcripts of the recently cloned zzso zzso from pumpkin zzso were found all over the zzso and in zzso of the inner seed coat at the zzso zzso Previously cloned zzso zzso zzso molecules were specifically identified in zzso zzso Finally, zzso molecules of the zzso and zzso genes were found in the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were localized in zzso of zzso zzso and inner cell layers of the root zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were found in all zzso of the zzso except the root zzso These results indicate zzso zzso pathways operating within the developing zzso
