The zzso family (including the zzso zzso is a diverse family of zzso zzso found in all zzso of life, with different members transporting different zzso We used sequence and zzso analysis of zzso 1 and 2 of zzso family members to identify a zzso zzso extending the previously defined zzso zzso zzso The analysis showed that in addition to being highly zzso in both sequence and zzso zzso 1 and 2 contain a significant number of polar zzso and are predicted to be buried within the protein interior, with at least some faces packed closely against other zzso This suggests a significant functional role for this region and we tested this by mutating polar zzso in zzso 1 and 2 in the zzso zzso zzso All zzso made, even those removing only a single zzso group, had significant effects on zzso Many zzso abolished transport without affecting plasma membrane expression of the zzso zzso suggesting a functional role for these zzso Different zzso faces appear to have different roles, with the most severe effects being zzso to two interacting faces of zzso 1 and zzso Our results confirm the predicted importance of zzso polar zzso in zzso 1 and 2 and suggest that transport of zzso by zzso is dependent on a network of polar and aromatic interactions between these two zzso
