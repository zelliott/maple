A new molecular zzso based on a rapid DNA extraction zzso zzso and zzso to a specific probe in a zzso zzso plate format was used to detect zzso zzso in zzso fluid zzso The sensitivity of the zzso was determined to be 10 to 100 organisms with zzso zzso reference zzso zzso testing with different bacteria capable of producing pneumonia showed no zzso In a prospective study, zzso zzso zzso obtained from patients with pneumonia were investigated with the zzso zzso and compared to zzso Twelve positive samples were detected with the zzso zzso Seven of them were subsequently confirmed by zzso All patients with positive zzso results zzso Application of the zzso zzso described may lead to safe and early diagnosis of zzso zzso in patients with zzso
