zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is known both to interact with zzso and to alter membrane structure and zzso To determine the structural requirements for these two aspects of zzso action, we constructed several zzso of the zzso and characterized them using Swiss zzso cell zzso The effects of these peptides were measured on: zzso zzso stimulation of zzso activity by zzso gamma S and zzso and zzso the membrane zzso activities, zzso zzso and zzso zzso strongly inhibited all the above activities and caused membrane zzso zzso of one zzso zzso by zzso at either the zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in peptides which selectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso with no or very slight zzso zzso Introduction of additional zzso zzso to zzso led to the opposite zzso Thus, zzso modulating and membrane zzso actions of zzso appear to be not necessarily linked, and may be zzso
