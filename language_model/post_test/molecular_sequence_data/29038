In zzso zzso is essential for disease resistance zzso by a structural subset of resistance zzso proteins containing a zzso site, zzso and zzso similarity to animal Toll and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not required by zzso proteins that possess an zzso zzso motif zzso zzso Using zzso gene zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso in resistance specified by structurally distinct R genes in transgenic zzso zzso Resistance against tobacco mosaic virus zzso by tobacco zzso a zzso zzso was zzso Two other R zzso zzso (a protein zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso respectively, a bacterial and viral pathogen did not require zzso These data, together with the finding that expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are similarly zzso lead us to conclude that recruitment of zzso by zzso proteins is zzso zzso between zzso plant species in resistance against zzso zzso and viral zzso We further demonstrate that zzso is a useful approach to dissect resistance signaling pathways in a genetically intractable plant zzso
