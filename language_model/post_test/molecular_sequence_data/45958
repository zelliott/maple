zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso techniques based on energetic zzso with a surface or gas zzso zzso One noticeable difference between zzso and SID is that SID does not require a collision gas for zzso zzso and is, therefore, directly compatible with the high vacuum requirement of zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso zzso the introduction of collision gas into the zzso cell for zzso zzso dramatically shortens the acquisition time for zzso experiments, suggesting that SID could be zzso for zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso We demonstrate for the first time the utility of SID combined with zzso zzso for protein zzso zzso zzso of standard proteins were analyzed using a hybrid zzso zzso mass zzso with SID and zzso zzso SID zzso of zzso zzso and doubly charged peptides were obtained using a zzso target mounted at the rear zzso plate of the zzso zzso The broad internal energy distribution deposited into the precursor zzso following collision with the diamond surface allowed a variety of fragmentation channels to be zzso by zzso zzso and sequence zzso produced by SID of zzso peptides were used to improve the statistical significance of database zzso zzso identification MASCOT scores obtained using SID were comparable or better than scores obtained using sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conventional zzso zzso technique in zzso zzso
