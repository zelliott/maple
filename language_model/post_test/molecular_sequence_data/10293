It is believed that zzso plasmids are incapable of zzso since they have to maintain their copy number and this is one of the differences between plasmids and zzso as zzso To examine whether a zzso zzso zzso is incapable of zzso DNA zzso we constructed a zzso that carries both the zzso origin zzso 13, 173 zzso and its truncated origin zzso 32, 56 zzso in the same zzso This zzso yielded two smaller plasmids in the presence of zzso an zzso zzso We showed that zzso can bind to the zzso 13 but not to zzso 32 which lacks the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso DNA replication from zzso 13 and zzso at zzso 32, then the same zzso is used for zzso of replication from the zzso 32 zzso zzso is likely to be a unique zzso that zzso DNA replication like a phase zzso
