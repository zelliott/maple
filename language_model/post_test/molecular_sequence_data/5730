We have determined partial sequences of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso type strain including the regions analogous to the zzso zzso region of the zzso coli zzso zzso The deduced zzso and zzso acid sequences of the determined regions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were identical to the corresponding regions of the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso We examined 40 clinical strains of zzso zzso isolated from patients with urinary tract infection for zzso to zzso acid and zzso Based on the zzso acid and zzso zzso these zzso were divided into 19 zzso strains zzso of zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso strains zzso of zzso acid, 400 to zzso 800 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We zzso five zzso and 21 zzso strains for zzso in zzso and zzso The five zzso strains had zzso acid sequences in zzso and zzso identical to those of type zzso Of the 21 zzso zzso three zzso of zzso acid, 400 to zzso 800 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso had a single zzso acid change at the position equivalent to zzso in the zzso coli zzso protein and no zzso in zzso one zzso of zzso acid, zzso 800 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso had a single zzso acid change at zzso in zzso and a single zzso acid change at the position equivalent to zzso in the zzso coli zzso zzso two zzso of zzso acid, zzso 800 zzso zzso of zzso 25 zzso had double zzso acid changes at zzso and zzso in zzso and no zzso in zzso and 15 zzso of zzso acid, zzso 800 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso had double zzso acid changes at zzso and zzso in zzso and a single zzso acid change at zzso or zzso in zzso This study suggests, that in clinical zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso is a primary target of zzso that only a single zzso acid change at zzso in zzso is sufficient to generate high-level resistance to zzso acid and to decrease zzso to zzso and that the zzso of zzso acid changes in zzso and the simultaneous presence of the zzso zzso play a central role in developing high-level resistance to zzso
