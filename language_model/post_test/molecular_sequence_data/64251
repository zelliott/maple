zzso virus is the zzso agent of a zzso fever endemic in west zzso The zzso zzso of zzso virus encodes the zzso precursor zzso a zzso zzso the viral zzso L and a small protein Z (11 zzso Here, we analyze the role of Z protein for virus zzso We have recently shown that expression of Z protein in the absence of other viral proteins is sufficient for the release of enveloped zzso zzso In this study, we examined particles zzso into the zzso of a zzso Z zzso zzso cell line by electron zzso The observed zzso zzso particles did not significantly differ in their zzso and size from zzso virus zzso zzso of two zzso zzso within Z which are known to drastically reduce the release of zzso zzso had no effect on the cellular zzso of the protein nor on its zzso Furthermore, we present evidence that Z interacts with the zzso We assume that Z recruits zzso to cellular zzso where virus assembly takes zzso We conclude from our data that zzso virus Z protein plays an essential role in zzso virus zzso
