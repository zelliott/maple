zzso and bulk, important zzso fiber properties, are thought to be related to differences in the protein composition of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that the zzso has a higher proportion of zzso and zzso than the zzso While there is some evidence for the differential expression of genes between these cell types in the zzso this has not been demonstrated zzso in the mature zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso disruption to obtain relatively pure zzso of both cell types, the zzso high sulfur protein family was found to be present in higher zzso in the zzso This significant finding provides an explanation for the higher zzso content reported in the zzso This represents an advance in our understanding of protein expression variation in the zzso and zzso and how this relates to key physical and mechanical properties of zzso zzso
