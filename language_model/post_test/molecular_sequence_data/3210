Using in zzso analysis we studied a novel family of repetitive DNA sequences that is present among both zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso but absent from zzso or zzso This family is characterized by direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 zzso zzso by similarly sized zzso zzso To appreciate their zzso structure, we will refer to this family as the clustered regularly zzso short zzso repeats zzso In most species with two or more zzso zzso these zzso were flanked on one side by a common leader sequence of zzso zzso The direct repeats and the leader sequences were zzso within a species, but dissimilar between zzso The presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso are mobile zzso Four zzso zzso genes were identified in zzso zzso that were absent from zzso zzso The zzso genes were invariably located adjacent to a zzso zzso indicating that the zzso genes and zzso zzso have a functional zzso The zzso gene showed motifs characteristic for zzso of the zzso 2, and the zzso gene showed motifs of the zzso family of zzso suggesting that these genes are involved in DNA metabolism or gene zzso The spatial zzso of zzso and zzso genes may stimulate new research on the genesis and biological role of these repeats and zzso
