A zzso zzso cell line zzso which expresses only the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso substitution at zzso zzso was zzso These cells showed typical characteristics of zzso when they were cultured at 32 degrees zzso In this process, zzso recovered the zzso zzso function and the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes was zzso However, no significant changes were detected in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the existence of other genes associated with zzso Genes zzso by zzso were screened by the zzso differential display zzso One of the zzso genes was identified as the zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha is also a zzso zzso Upon the zzso the cells developed the zzso and the zzso of zzso similar to those of the cells treated with zzso a drug that affects zzso The zzso associated with zzso of zzso alpha by zzso may be a cause of the cell zzso On the other hand, the function of zzso zzso is not so clear despite the fact that zzso cells showed a significant increase of the zzso zzso gene during the early stage of zzso The zzso zzso system was used to identify zzso zzso zzso One is a zzso c zzso c) zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso from an extract of human zzso cell line that expressed high levels of zzso zzso zzso activity was also increased by zzso in this cell zzso The pattern of changes in zzso activity was closely reflected by the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associate physically with each other in zzso and that zzso of zzso by binding to zzso zzso zzso by zzso may be associated with zzso These two new zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may cooperate to induce zzso in this cell zzso
