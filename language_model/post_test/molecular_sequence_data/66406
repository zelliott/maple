While the role of zzso as a zzso protein is well established, its potential functional zzso in smooth muscles and zzso zzso are zzso We used a zzso zzso array to search for which zzso of the human zzso zzso unit encompassing zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso muscle zzso zzso profiling of adult smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified alternatively spliced zzso zzso encompassing 80 to about 100 zzso These zzso code for parts of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions, allowing the truncated smooth muscle zzso zzso to link zzso bodies together with thick zzso zzso with the array data, Western zzso studies detected the expression of approximately 1 zzso smooth muscle zzso in adult smooth muscles, reacting with selected zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with these zzso located smooth muscle zzso in the zzso of cultured human zzso smooth muscle cells and in the zzso media of intact adult bovine zzso Real time zzso studies suggested that smooth muscle zzso are expressed from a promoter located 35 zzso or more upstream of the zzso initiation site used for zzso muscle zzso driving expression of a zzso zzso coding zzso for the anonymous gene zzso followed 3' by zzso zzso Our work showed that smooth muscle and zzso muscle zzso share in their zzso zzso regions binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso zzso screens using zzso zzso zzso identified prey clones coding for zzso and zzso from smooth muscle, and zzso zzso and zzso from skeletal muscle zzso libraries, zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso domain can link zzso and zzso together in the periphery of the zzso bodies in a fashion that is zzso in smooth and zzso zzso
