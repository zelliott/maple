We have found that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso specifically inhibit growth zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells in a zzso manner, whereas zzso has no zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso blood vessel formation in the chicken zzso membrane zzso It is sufficiently potent to effectively suppress basic zzso growth zzso zzso zzso after systemic administration in zzso Further, zzso significantly zzso the growth of zzso Lewis lung zzso in zzso zzso and zzso nude mice without zzso In zzso Lewis lung zzso cells are completely insensitive to zzso zzso at high zzso that significantly inhibit zzso cell zzso This finding supports the conclusion that zzso zzso Lewis lung tumor growth by suppression of zzso zzso
