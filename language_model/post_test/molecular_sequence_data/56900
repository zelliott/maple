An zzso zzso zzso was generated and selected in a fusion of zzso myeloma cells with zzso derived from zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso designated as zzso was assessed by competitive zzso for binding to zzso structurally zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a marked preference for the zzso zzso Competitive zzso zzso performed with zzso and zzso indicated that the zzso zzso was essential for zzso recognition and zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso The zzso detection limit in the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso ranged from 1 to 16 zzso A dot zzso test was developed which was sensitive for the zzso of zzso amounts of zzso DNA deposited on zzso filters and applied to the zzso detection in human zzso of target zzso
