The zzso zzso zzso zzso a particularly large diversity of zzso networks, ranging from the elaborate and stable zzso zzso and zzso bodies to very dynamic zzso cortical or zzso zzso Their organization and individual cycle of zzso are well known and extensive zzso studies of the zzso modifications in the various zzso systems have been zzso However, in order to better understand the zzso of these multiple and diverse zzso zzso it seemed necessary to characterize the zzso gene zzso We show that P zzso possesses four zzso and three zzso and we report the cloning and sequencing of two zzso zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso which code for very similar zzso differing only by their unusual zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso and zzso zzso sequencing of the two other zzso suggests an absence of any further zzso zzso In an attempt to study the expression of alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso were raised against the twelve zzso zzso acids corresponding to the deduced zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso was studied on blots of soluble zzso and in zzso and compared with that of other well characterized zzso zzso The molecular data show that in zzso like in other zzso zzso diversity does not arise from zzso zzso zzso The zzso data indicate that the native zzso sequences are predominantly detected in transient or nascent zzso zzso and lead us to zzso 1) that the zzso zzso absent in zzso and in most zzso species, has no intrinsic functional zzso and 2) that zzso modifications do not seem directly instrumental in the geometry and functions of zzso zzso
