zzso of human and mouse zzso sequence at the border of the major zzso complex zzso class II and class III regions revealed a locus zzso six zzso with zzso to the zzso gene family and the location of a previously described zzso zzso basic protein zzso We named the new locus zzso for zzso zzso class II zzso The six zzso zzso of the zzso locus zzso a small zzso zzso acid sequence (which may be a signal zzso two zzso zzso a small zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and a further two zzso zzso In zzso an additional zzso gene zzso is situated adjacent to zzso zzso studies of the zzso locus in mouse showed that it is expressed in a range of gut zzso We demonstrate that like many other genes from the zzso zzso is zzso in a selection of diverse zzso zzso In the light of the newly discovered zzso we revisit and discuss the possible origin of the zzso gene zzso
