Liver zzso from rats zzso with various zzso of zzso zzso exhibit very different abilities to catalyze the zzso of N zzso zzso by zzso and zzso with formation of zzso and nitrogen zzso Treatment of rats with zzso a classical zzso of zzso zzso leads to a spectacular zzso increase of the activity found for zzso rats, while induction by zzso causes a much lower increase of this activity and induction by zzso or zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso of zzso as zzso and zzso strongly inhibit zzso zzso whereas zzso an inhibitor of other zzso zzso was without zzso These data show the particular ability of zzso of the 3A zzso to catalyze the second step of the zzso of zzso by NO zzso zzso This zzso between zzso and zzso is further substantiated by a protein sequence comparison which shows that a zzso acid segment present in all zzso exhibits a strong similarity with the sequence mainly responsible for zzso binding in zzso which is well zzso in all zzso This segment contains all the structural factors which are thought to be crucial for zzso binding in zzso
