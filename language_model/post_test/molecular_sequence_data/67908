In the present study, the second nuclear internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in mainland China was zzso zzso and assessed for zzso the zzso and zzso zzso relationships of zzso in the order zzso The zzso containing zzso zzso was obtained from 24 zzso zzso zzso from eight epidemic provinces in mainland zzso The length zzso were observed among these zzso zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso variations in zzso sequence were zzso among zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analyses using the maximum zzso and maximum likelihood methods revealed that the zzso zzso sequence is not a suitable marker for studying zzso and zzso variation in zzso zzso However, zzso analysis of zzso in the order zzso indicated that the zzso zzso sequence provides an effective molecular marker for studying zzso zzso relationships among zzso in this zzso
