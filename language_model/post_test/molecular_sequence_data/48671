A zzso zzso protein was cloned and characterized from the Chinese shrimp zzso zzso and named as zzso The results indicated that the full length zzso of zzso zzso had an open reading frame zzso a zzso of 220 zzso acids with one zzso domain, six zzso zzso and one key motif zzso The theoretical molecular weight and zzso of mature protein was zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed varied identity of zzso 34, 31 and 30 % with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was expressed highest in zzso of normal shrimp, and it's expression was zzso in zzso and zzso post white spot syndrome virus zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed higher zzso activity against zzso bacteria than against zzso bacteria and zzso And the zzso activity of zzso could be completely inhibited by zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggested that zzso might play an important role in shrimp immune and would be helpful to better understand the innate immunity mechanism of zzso
