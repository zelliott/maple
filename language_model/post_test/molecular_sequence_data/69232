An essential component of the transmission process at zzso zzso is the removal of zzso from the synaptic zzso This is achieved by powerful transport systems which have a high affinity for zzso and exhibit a novel zzso to zzso zzso zzso situated on zzso zzso zzso zzso directly from the synaptic zzso In concert, zzso situated on zzso cells maintain a low zzso zzso zzso thereby establishing a diffusion zzso favoring movement of zzso out of the synaptic zzso Maintenance of a low zzso zzso concentration also serves to protect zzso from the zzso action of zzso Despite the zzso importance of the zzso zzso little information has been available on their molecular zzso This zzso however, has begun to be bridged with the recent cloning of three species of zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this review is to zzso the results of these three cloning successes, to compare and contrast the three novel zzso and to zzso in the light of these recent zzso information from previous zzso
