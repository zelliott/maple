zzso DNA fragments zzso the ability to zzso zzso as sole carbon source zzso were mobilized by means of zzso zzso from strain zzso zzso identified as zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso at a frequency of zzso per transferred zzso The mobilized DNA integrated into the recipient zzso or was recovered as zzso prime zzso Three zzso prime plasmids were transferred from zzso zzso to zzso coli and back to zzso zzso without modification of the zzso The transferred zzso DNA segments allowed metabolism of zzso zzso 3- and zzso and zzso Genes involved in zzso degradation were identified on the prime plasmids by zzso zzso and by gene zzso zzso prime plasmids were transferred to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso genes were expressed in those zzso Transfer of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed the recipient to zzso zzso Other zzso prime plasmids were obtained from zzso by selection on zzso and zzso as carbon zzso zzso zzso sequence data demonstrated that the in zzso transfer of zzso was achieved between bacteria belonging to two different branches of the zzso
