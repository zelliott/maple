The zzso protein zzso is required for zzso In this study, we have characterized two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are similar to zzso zzso An essential function for the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain was revealed using deletions and randomly generated zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso domain zzso in zzso cells revealed defects in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was localized to peripheral and internal zzso structures, and zzso zzso studies found the protein associated with a large, zzso zzso zzso Finally, an zzso zzso domain was mapped to the final eight zzso acids zzso in the zzso protein zzso Based on these and other data, we propose that the zzso zzso proteins are essential components of an zzso complex that may act at multiple stages in the zzso zzso
