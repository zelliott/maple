zzso of a series of zzso zzso human zzso clones with zzso zzso zzso cells and a series of recall zzso revealed that two of four clones tested proliferated in response to zzso zzso One was restricted by zzso and the other was restricted by zzso These results provide further evidence that many zzso T cells have a primary zzso specificity and zzso on zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso comparison of the zzso and zzso DR molecules for these clones revealed that the regions predicted to contact the T zzso zzso and thereby to determine zzso are identical in sequence for zzso and zzso and differ by one zzso between zzso and zzso The DR beta zzso that differ between zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso are predicted to contribute to zzso zzso This implies that these zzso T cells may be specific for zzso peptides that are bound by zzso and not by the zzso DR products, seen in a zzso zzso These zzso clones also zzso on zzso and zzso molecules and on a zzso hybrid class II zzso zzso zzso zzso These reactions are discussed in terms of zzso zzso zzso Thus these data suggest that in certain zzso combinations zzso may resemble zzso recognition of fragments of zzso zzso that are bound by zzso but not by zzso major zzso complex zzso
