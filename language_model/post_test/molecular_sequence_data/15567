zzso to zzso zzso zzso stress depends on the zzso of an integrated signal zzso zzso known as the unfolded protein response zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein that suppresses cell zzso Here we have investigated the role of zzso in the zzso zzso expression suppressed zzso activity in fly and mouse models of zzso zzso zzso cells displayed zzso of the zzso stress sensor zzso leading to increased levels of its downstream target zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso target zzso This zzso was associated with the formation of a stable protein complex between zzso and zzso decreasing its zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso increased the zzso activity of primary B cells, a phenomenon regulated by zzso Our results suggest a role for zzso in early zzso responses against zzso stress that contrasts with its known downstream function in zzso
