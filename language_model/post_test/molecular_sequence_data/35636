zzso B zzso zzso is modified by a zzso editing reaction zzso to zzso changing a zzso zzso to a zzso stop zzso zzso and producing zzso zzso in zzso liver and zzso zzso and age-related changes in zzso zzso editing were studied using two mouse strains with different aging processes zzso with a normal aging process and zzso with an accelerated aging zzso During growth of both zzso the proportion of zzso zzso zzso decreased from zzso in the fetal liver at the 17th day of gestation to zzso in the liver of mature 2-month-old zzso zzso increase in the proportion of zzso zzso zzso was observed from the age of 18 months in the zzso zzso In the zzso strain, zzso zzso in the liver continued to increase from the age of 10 months to zzso The profiles of zzso and age-related changes in the proportion of two serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed the extent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the extent of zzso zzso editing in the small zzso were not observed in either zzso A slight expression of zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction in the zzso stomach, and zzso and zzso change in the extent of editing was observed in the zzso These correlated changes in zzso zzso editing and serum zzso proteins suggest that zzso editing may be one mechanism involved in the regulation of zzso zzso in biological development and in zzso zzso An zzso decrease in the extent of zzso zzso zzso editing and increases of the proportion of serum zzso protein were observed in zzso zzso
