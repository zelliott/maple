In all fields of molecular biology, researchers are increasingly challenged by experiments planned and evaluated on the basis of zzso acid and protein sequence data generally retrieved from public zzso Despite the wide spectrum of available Web-based software tools for sequence analysis, the routine use of these tools has zzso particularly because of the elaborate and zzso ways of data zzso zzso and zzso Here we present a Visual zzso Microsoft Word zzso the zzso zzso Suite zzso available at the zzso Software Library zzso The zzso software aims to manage and zzso a wide range of sequence analyses and zzso using an integrated text editor environment including zzso zzso Its independence of sequence formats enables zzso to be used as a pivotal application between other software tools for sequence analysis, zzso zzso and zzso
