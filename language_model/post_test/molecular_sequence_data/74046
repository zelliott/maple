The zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso region from individual zzso specimens was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The reaction amplified the entire zzso region of the zzso zzso gene cluster using zzso that zzso to the 3' zzso of the small zzso and the zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso products from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The zzso zzso gene was identified following comparative alignment of the zzso zzso sequence and a zzso zzso gene zzso The ITS regions from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared by restriction zzso analysis and zzso restriction zzso length zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso restriction zzso sizes were confirmed from sequence zzso ITS amplification followed by zzso zzso enables rapid and clear differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
