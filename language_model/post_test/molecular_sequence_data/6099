zzso analysis of peripheral primitive zzso tumors zzso has demonstrated a consistent primary zzso change characterized by a zzso zzso zzso In the central nervous system zzso most frequent of which are the zzso zzso the most prevalent zzso abnormalities include deletions and unbalanced zzso The recent cloning of the zzso zzso has revealed the fusion of the human zzso gene on zzso zzso with a gene zzso on zzso zzso and permitted detection of fusion zzso zzso genetic analysis for the presence of zzso fusion transcripts by the reverse zzso chain reaction has recently been applied to peripheral zzso In the present study, we analyzed eight central zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction for zzso fusion zzso The tumors included six zzso of the zzso one zzso zzso of the frontal lobe and one zzso of the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis in all eight cases failed to reveal a zzso zzso indicating that this is not a zzso zzso of the central zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso fusion transcripts provides a novel zzso tool in the differentiation of central versus peripheral zzso
