zzso zzso is a water channel expressed at the zzso plasma membrane of kidney zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso was isolated and encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso expressed in zzso large zzso eye, urinary zzso skin, and gastrointestinal zzso The mouse zzso gene was zzso and zzso zzso mice were generated by targeted gene zzso The growth and zzso of zzso zzso mice were zzso normal except for zzso zzso deletion had little effect on zzso or zzso protein expression but decreased zzso protein expression particularly in zzso zzso zzso consumption in zzso zzso mice was more than zzso greater than that in zzso litter zzso and urine zzso zzso zzso was much lower than in zzso mice zzso zzso After zzso administration or water zzso the zzso zzso mice were able to concentrate their urine partially to approximately zzso of that in zzso zzso zzso water zzso of cortical zzso zzso zzso measured by a spatial filtering zzso method, was zzso reduced by zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that the residual concentrating ability of zzso zzso mice was due to the inner zzso zzso water channel zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso The zzso mice had greater impairment of zzso ability than did the zzso zzso zzso Our findings establish a form of zzso diabetes zzso produced by impaired water zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso may thus provide zzso targets for drug discovery of zzso zzso
