A novel zzso method was recently developed which identifies zzso groups of zzso involved in strong zzso and zzso zzso The method is based on zzso zzso zzso at zzso groups as long as these groups are not protected from zzso Our recent studies of zzso and zzso regions protected in active zzso are zzso initiation state of zzso as well as two zzso states in zzso and zzso states were zzso Only one zzso group of zzso which was two positions upstream of the decoding zzso was zzso protected in zzso complexes, whereas this group and the zzso groups in the zzso sequence were protected in the initiation zzso No protection was observed downstream of the decoding zzso On the contrary, numerous zzso zzso of zzso were protected by the zzso The zzso protection patterns significantly varied between two zzso simultaneously bound to the zzso The protection pattern of an individual zzso was not significantly affected by zzso The data indicate that both zzso molecules are tightly bound to the zzso whereas zzso is fixed predominantly by two zzso via zzso zzso A possible zzso mechanism is zzso
