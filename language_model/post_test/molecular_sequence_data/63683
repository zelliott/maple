The identification of genes underlying complex traits is a challenging task, and there are a limited number of confirmed genes that influence human complex zzso In particular, few genes involved in complex diseases related to immune response, such as infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases, have been zzso Recent advances in zzso technology lead to the depository of millions of zzso zzso zzso into public databases, and zzso are considered powerful tools in the search for genes involved in complex zzso A number of zzso methods are available, and two critical points are to select the zzso required for a comprehensive analysis and to perform association analyses that avoid statistical biases because of population zzso This chapter describes a way to take advantage of the mass of known zzso and to evaluate zzso association between zzso and zzso related to diseases, with special emphasis on innate immunity zzso After zzso relevant aspects of genetic zzso I describe how to obtain zzso data from zzso zzso an zzso sequence containing zzso with zzso select zzso on the basis of population frequency and functional information explore zzso data in the zzso database focused on innate immunity genes evaluate the association of zzso with quantitative zzso by using zzso trait zzso Tests zzso evaluate the association of zzso with zzso and quantitative zzso by using zzso Association Tests zzso All the procedures use publicly available servers and free statistical programs for academic zzso
