The zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli contains the genes for zzso and zzso and is feedback regulated by the zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso binding site on zzso zzso and the zzso zzso target site on zzso zzso zzso share similar proposed secondary structures and contain some primary sequence zzso Several zzso zzso in the binding region of zzso zzso were constructed and their effects on binding were zzso For in zzso analysis, a filter binding method was zzso For in zzso analysis, a conditional expression system was used to zzso a zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso binding region, which leads to specific zzso of the synthesis of zzso and zzso Changes in the shared region of the zzso zzso zzso binding site produced effects on zzso binding similar to those found previously in analysis of corresponding changes in the zzso zzso zzso target zzso The results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso interacts with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by recognizing similar features on both zzso
