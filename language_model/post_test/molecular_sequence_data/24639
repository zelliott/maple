zzso screening of an zzso zzso library enabled the identification of a novel zzso zzso (for zzso of zzso zzso that can zzso zzso shoot formation when zzso in zzso root zzso Neither callus induction nor root formation was affected by zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso factor with an zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso also greatly increased the efficiency of shoot zzso from root zzso in the presence of zzso with a shift in the optimal zzso concentration required for this zzso The effects of zzso zzso on shoot zzso are synergistic with those of zzso zzso of zzso cannot induce callus formation or root formation, suggesting that its effects are specific to shoot zzso In zzso zzso plants, zzso expression was induced by zzso zzso transcript levels also increased zzso during shoot zzso from root zzso most probably in response to zzso in the zzso zzso This transient increase occurred after the acquisition of competence for zzso and before shoot formation, which is consistent with the zzso effects of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may regulate the induction of shoot zzso after the acquisition of competence for zzso
