To investigate the hypothesis that zzso zzso I zzso zzso are responsible for the zzso of highly zzso responsive zzso in patients with apparent primary zzso zzso 

From 107 British patients with clinically diagnosed primary zzso zzso seven patients were identified with an excellent response to zzso zzso All six zzso of the zzso gene were zzso in these patients to identify zzso 

Three novel zzso zzso were identified in two zzso One patient was a compound zzso with zzso carrier zzso The clinical zzso of patients with and without zzso zzso was zzso 

These findings show that a proportion of patients with apparent primary zzso zzso and a good response to zzso drugs have zzso zzso and therefore have a zzso of zzso responsive zzso The difficulty in distinguishing clinically between patients with and without zzso underscores the importance of considering the diagnosis of a zzso responsive zzso in all such zzso
