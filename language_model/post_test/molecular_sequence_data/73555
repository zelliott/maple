It is quite important to know the exact zzso and function of zzso protein zzso zzso identified as the gene product of zzso dystrophy, the most prevalent disease with zzso disorders among muscular zzso To investigate the zzso of zzso we raised a zzso zzso against a synthetic zzso chosen within the deduced sequence of zzso This zzso detected both a zzso zzso protein and a soluble zzso protein on Western blots of human zzso By using this zzso for zzso studies of both zzso human skeletal muscle fibers and mature zzso cultured muscle zzso we can now demonstrate by zzso laser scanning zzso that zzso is localized mainly in the zzso By zzso zzso it was determined that zzso is a zzso protein localized mainly in the terminal zzso of the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of the zzso zzso of zzso This finding is quite important for clarifying the zzso basis of zzso dystrophy, which might be due to a zzso of calcium zzso
