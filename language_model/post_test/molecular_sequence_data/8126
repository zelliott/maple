Based on zzso analysis, zzso zzso involving band zzso occur in zzso of zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso The zzso gene is located in this zzso band and is activated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene appears to be involved in the development of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of zzso zzso in pediatric ALL patients and to correlate gene expression with ALL zzso None of 53 zzso zzso was positive for zzso zzso however, Northern zzso and zzso analysis revealed that four of 12 zzso zzso showed expression of the zzso In order to assess whether zzso expression is present in other pediatric zzso we examined a panel of 20 tumor cell lines established from solid tumors and zzso but none of them showed expression of zzso Using our zzso method we confirmed that zzso expression is not zzso in normal zzso These findings indicate that zzso expression in pediatric ALL is exclusive to zzso and does not occur in zzso zzso The frequency detected by molecular techniques was significantly higher than the frequency reported in the literature based on zzso zzso These results support the notion that zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene is a crucial step in zzso zzso
