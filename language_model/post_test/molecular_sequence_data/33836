In order to investigate the genetic bases of the zzso syndrome zzso that causes abnormal fruit softening and juice loss in apples, an zzso approach was zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso High levels of activity of zzso zzso a zzso acting on the zzso component of the cell walls, were found in individuals exhibiting the zzso zzso in a segregating zzso The expression levels of the previously zzso apple zzso gene zzso are higher in fruits from plants consistently showing zzso zzso and high zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso regulated in distinct zzso contexts and appears to be independent of zzso Thus, it is likely to be controlled by zzso zzso mechanisms associated with fruit zzso The use of zzso approaches has allowed the identification of a novel contributor to the zzso zzso in apple and it has been possible to overcome the problems posed by the unavailability of zzso lines to dissect the genetic bases of a complex zzso trait in woody perennial zzso
