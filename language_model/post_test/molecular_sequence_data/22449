zzso a member of the zzso zzso cassette family of zzso encodes zzso zzso protein 6, a putative zzso zzso expressed primarily in the liver and to a significantly lower extent in other zzso zzso in zzso result in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso tissue disorder with variable zzso zzso To examine the zzso regulation and zzso expression of this zzso we cloned zzso zzso of human zzso promoter and developed a series of zzso zzso linked to zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso in a number of cultured cell lines of diverse origin identified a specific zzso sequence zzso which zzso high level of expression in zzso zzso cells, zzso liver zzso The functionality of the promoter fragments was confirmed in zzso by tail vein injection followed by zzso reporter zzso Testing of selected zzso revealed that transforming growth factor zzso zzso while tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity in zzso zzso The responsiveness to zzso was shown to reside primarily within an zzso zzso site at zzso to zzso The expression of the zzso promoter was also shown to be markedly enhanced by zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso expression zzso in zzso zzso cells, which are devoid of zzso zzso Furthermore, four additional zzso factors, with their zzso sequences present in DNA, were shown to bind the zzso promoter zzso by zzso zzso zzso the results indicate that human zzso displays zzso gene zzso which can be modulated by zzso zzso These findings may have implications for zzso expression of zzso and acquired diseases involving zzso in the zzso zzso
