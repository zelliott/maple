zzso zzso zzso channels are zzso zzso of individual zzso Eight different zzso zzso zzso have been identified in which the zzso domain zzso located on the zzso N zzso zzso and controls the assembly of both zzso and zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso are able to form zzso with members of the silent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain contains two zzso A and B box, which presumably determine zzso specificity by preventing incompatible zzso to zzso In contrast, little is known about the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and silent zzso zzso contain a fully zzso and zzso charged sequence zzso in this zzso that is lacking in the other zzso zzso these zzso in zzso by mutating them to zzso did not affect the gating properties, but reduced the current density zzso However, charge reversal zzso zzso strongly reduced the current density of these zzso zzso zzso channels and zzso confirmed the reduced expression at the plasma zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso using zzso zzso showed that the latter was not due to impaired trafficking, but to a failure to assemble the zzso This was further confirmed with zzso zzso The corresponding zzso substitution in zzso prevented its zzso interaction with zzso These results indicate that these zzso (especially the first one) in the zzso box zzso of the zzso domain are required for efficient assembly of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
