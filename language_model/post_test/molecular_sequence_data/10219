To measure the proportion of cases of zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso method was used to analyze 227 unrelated patients with dominant or zzso zzso for zzso in the zzso gene and an overlapping set of 315 unrelated patients for zzso in the zzso gene zzso patients with other known zzso zzso zzso bands revealed by zzso were studied further by zzso chain zzso direct zzso sequencing and, where possible, by zzso analysis in the families of the index zzso 

Four index patients were found to have zzso as a result of one of four dominant zzso in the zzso zzso two of which are zzso Four other index patients were found to have zzso zzso as a result of the combination of zzso zzso in both the zzso and the zzso zzso with one of the zzso zzso being zzso The zzso cases all had the same zzso zzso (the zzso change zzso but each had one of three different zzso zzso The authors were unable to determine through zzso analysis whether three other changes encountered in the zzso gene and five in the zzso gene were zzso 

The authors found zzso in the zzso gene as a cause of dominant or zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso gene as a cause of zzso zzso No cases of zzso caused by zzso zzso alone have been discovered thus zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso genes are zzso causes of zzso together accounting for only a few percent of patients in the United States and zzso
