A reddish orange zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil during a study of the bacterial diversity of a cold desert of the Indian Himalayas and was studied by using a zzso zzso The zzso had zzso and zzso properties consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % sequence zzso respectively), whereas the sequence similarity values with respect to the other zzso species with zzso published names were between zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso of strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso % and that with zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of the strain is zzso zzso The above data in combination with the zzso distinctiveness of zzso clearly indicate that the strain represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
