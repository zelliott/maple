The structure of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was determined by zzso and sequencing zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene was structurally similar to other zzso zzso genes and comprised three zzso and two zzso zzso of the mouse zzso gene was found only in cardiac tissue as determined by zzso protection zzso zzso of zzso was 31 zzso downstream from a consensus zzso box as determined by primer extension analysis of cardiac zzso Comparative DNA sequence analysis identified several DNA elements with potential zzso regulatory zzso Comparative zzso acid sequence analysis showed that the zzso portion of the mouse and rat zzso precursors was more zzso than the zzso zzso sequence that constitute the zzso zzso zzso The zzso processing site zzso generating zzso zzso was highly zzso among all zzso precursors and was identical to the consensus site of zzso a zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso gene was mapped using zzso zzso DNA and a zzso chain zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso to mouse zzso 4 near the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso No zzso event between zzso and zzso was evident in the 39 zzso zzso and zzso strains zzso This physical linkage between the two zzso zzso genes expressed in cardiac tissue may be important for their zzso zzso
