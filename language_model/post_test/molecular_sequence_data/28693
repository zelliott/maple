Little is understood about the role of zzso zzso binding proteins in zzso zzso although there is a clear need for them based on the strict folding requirements of the zzso We have identified a zzso of zzso binding proteins whose members are required for different stages of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is composed of five individual families zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that all possess the zzso zzso a zzso zzso binding domain with zzso zzso The zzso zzso members associate with zzso that are consistent with their distinct roles in zzso zzso and suggest the mechanisms by which they zzso
