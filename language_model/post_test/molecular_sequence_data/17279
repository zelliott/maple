zzso species adapt well to hostile zzso which are often subjected to rapid zzso In these bacteria, the outer membrane plays an important role in the sensing of environmental conditions such as zzso In previous studies, it has been shown that in the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso changes its channel size according to the growth conditions and could affect outer membrane zzso Studies of the zzso properties of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso generated similar zzso The presence of a zzso or zzso cluster in the central zzso region is not essential for channel size zzso These findings suggest that zzso could adopt two alternative zzso in the outer membrane and that folding is zzso In contrast, no difference according to growth temperature was observed for structurally different outer membrane zzso such as zzso from the zzso zzso family of specific zzso Our results are consistent with the fact that the decrease in channel size observed at low growth temperature is a particular feature of the zzso zzso in various zzso and zzso zzso species isolated from diverse ecological zzso The ability to reduce outer membrane zzso at low growth temperature could provide these bacteria with zzso zzso
