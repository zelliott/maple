zzso zzso larvae cause internal zzso in domestic and wild animals characterized by subcutaneous zzso Their differentiation is usually performed at species level based on the zzso of third stage zzso The recent release of the whole zzso of zzso zzso and the retrieval of a 102 zzso zzso region occurring between zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso genes represented the foundation for this zzso The zzso region and the two zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso of the most diffused zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso variations in zzso size (from 20 to 102 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences allowed a genetic discrimination of the examined species providing information instrumental to a rapid molecular identification of zzso zzso
