The zzso of the designed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly interacts with zzso zzso The zzso is oriented parallel to the membrane surface under zzso conditions, but zzso at zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso activities against zzso coli and zzso zzso the zzso does not, however, lyse human red blood cells at zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso are 2 orders of magnitude more pronounced at pH 5 when compared with pH zzso Although zzso association at low pH is reduced when compared with pH zzso the release of the zzso zzso from large zzso zzso or zzso zzso is more pronounced at pH values where zzso adopts an orientation along the membrane zzso The zzso release experiments thereby parallel the results obtained in zzso zzso Despite a much higher degree of association, zzso release activity of zzso is significantly decreased for zzso charged zzso zzso differences in the interactions of zzso with zzso or zzso zzso also become apparent when the mechanisms of dye release are zzso The results presented in this paper support models in which zzso activity is caused by zzso membrane zzso rather than pore formation by zzso peptides in zzso zzso
