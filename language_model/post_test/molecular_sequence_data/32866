The zzso zzso of zzso zzso which interrupts the termination zzso of the zzso zzso is shown to belong to a zzso subset of bacterial group II zzso that share a large zzso at their zzso zzso and a peculiar genetic zzso Some of these zzso are inserted zzso right next to, or very close to, a stop zzso while others are located immediately 3' of, or close to, an initiation zzso After zzso zzso zzso which target zzso zzso zzso this is the second instance of a genetically specialized lineage of bacterial group II zzso Both the members of zzso zzso and the relatives of zzso stand in contrast against the rest of group II zzso in that features other than sequence must be used in target zzso Among other specialized characters that could unite the two zzso are: zzso the presence, next to the zzso zzso site, of zzso zzso structures incompatible with the active fold of the group II zzso and zzso the likely involvement of the zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso
