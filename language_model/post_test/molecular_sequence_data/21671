zzso is a special type of cell division present in all organisms that reproduce by sexual zzso It ensures the transition between the zzso and zzso state and allows zzso production through zzso zzso and zzso number zzso In this paper, we describe a technique for the isolation of zzso zzso male zzso From this cellular material, it was then possible to develop large-scale zzso studies using zzso zzso and thus to obtain an overview of genes expressed during zzso zzso The expression profiles were studied with either stringent statistical criteria or by performing zzso Both methods resulted in gene clusters enriched in zzso genes (from zzso to zzso Analysis of these data provided a unique set of genes that will be pivotal to further analysis aimed at understanding the zzso zzso
