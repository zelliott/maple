zzso breakage syndrome, caused by zzso in the zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso instability disorder characterized by cancer zzso zzso isolated from zzso breakage syndrome patients display increased levels of spontaneous zzso aberrations and sensitivity to zzso zzso Here, we have investigated DNA double strand break repair pathways of zzso zzso including single strand zzso and zzso zzso in zzso breakage syndrome patient zzso We used recently developed zzso zzso zzso to measure the efficiency of DNA double strand break zzso Both single strand zzso and zzso zzso processes were markedly impaired in zzso cells, and repair proficiency was restored upon zzso of full length zzso zzso Despite the observed defects in the repair efficiency, no apparent differences in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso Furthermore, comparative analysis of junction sequences of plasmids recovered from zzso and zzso cells revealed increased dependence on zzso zzso DNA repair process in zzso zzso
