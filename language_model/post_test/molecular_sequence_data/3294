We previously reported the sequence of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso To clarify further the characteristics of zzso zzso we have zzso an zzso zzso to reveal the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and possesses a standard set of zzso zzso zzso Its gene arrangement is not identical to any other zzso zzso gene arrangement reported so zzso Three of the 19 zzso regions longer than 10 zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso long, and their sequences are nearly zzso suggesting that zzso of these zzso regions occurred in an ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene arrangements of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that 17 zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso are adjacent to zzso zzso A majority (15 zzso zzso of their counterparts is found in two zzso gene clusters of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso (17 zzso zzso may have spread over the zzso and this may have been coupled with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso likelihood analysis of zzso protein genes supports the zzso zzso + zzso + zzso but fails to zzso the relationships among zzso zzso and three zzso zzso
