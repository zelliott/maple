The regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression by zzso zzso zzso was investigated in the human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso zzso levels in a zzso manner, by up to 50% versus control cells within 24 zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso effect of zzso Using zzso analysis with a zzso construct containing the zzso zzso zzso promoter fused to the zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso reporter zzso we showed that the zzso activity was decreased to 50% when zzso zzso cells were incubated in the presence of zzso The zzso effect of zzso was still maintained when zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso promoter was linked to the zzso reporter zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene expression following zzso zzso treatment is zzso by gene elements located between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
