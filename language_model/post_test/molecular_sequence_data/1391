Plasma zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso has been associated with cardiovascular disease and zzso The regulation of zzso expression remains largely zzso however, and we studied its zzso and zzso zzso in a cultured cell zzso In transient zzso of a zzso cell line zzso the published sequence cloned upstream of a zzso reporter gene produced minimal activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends was used to identify a novel zzso start site that is located 233 zzso downstream zzso of the published site and that produced a zzso increase in zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Analysis of the novel zzso promoter identified zzso and zzso zzso sites, as well as the zzso metal response element and zzso response zzso zzso was identified as a strong zzso regulator of zzso zzso in part through the presence of the zzso zzso site, leading to an almost zzso increase in expression levels after 24 h compared with zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We also investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso showed a trend toward increased zzso These results demonstrate the presence of a novel functional zzso start site for the human zzso gene with a promoter regulated by zzso and identify unique zzso zzso of zzso zzso
