A convenient way to study zzso zzso zzso proteins by means of suitable model systems has been zzso As a model zzso the oxidized B chain of insulin has been chemically modified by either zzso zzso or zzso and the extent, sites, and structure of modifications were assessed by zzso mass zzso A reduction step, using either zzso or zzso was also studied to stabilize the zzso zzso From the data gathered, it appeared that zzso when added at the beginning of zzso dramatically influenced the zzso modifications in terms of the addition mechanism zzso base formation instead of Michael zzso but also of the zzso acid zzso modified zzso zzso acid instead of zzso zzso However, by reducing the zzso species at the end of the reaction with zzso the zzso zzso obtained in the product zzso scan experiments become more stable and thus, easier to interpret in terms of origin and mechanism zzso With regard to zzso induced zzso we have observed that zzso addition under reductive conditions led to an extensive modification of the zzso zzso Moreover, as confirmed by zzso collision followed by collision induced zzso zzso experiments on selected precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso were first observed on the zzso zzso and further on zzso zzso On the other hand, compared to the native zzso no significant changes in zzso fragmentation patterns zzso and y zzso series) were observed whatever the basic site modified by the zzso
