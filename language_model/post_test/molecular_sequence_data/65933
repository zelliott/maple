In the induction of an immune response, zzso on zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso T cells that express the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show data mimicking this zzso by using zzso zzso with a zzso protein that is comprised of the zzso domain of zzso zzso and the zzso portion of human zzso When tested in zzso zzso strongly increased the zzso proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso T zzso The effect of zzso was dependent on the presence of both zzso and zzso When injected into mice, zzso enhanced the capacity of zzso to expand the number of zzso and zzso T zzso The effect on cell numbers in zzso also depended on zzso zzso binding because reduced expansion was observed in zzso zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso complex gained zzso activity toward a number of zzso zzso When mice bearing the zzso zzso tumor zzso were treated, the presence of zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso Thus, a zzso with zzso enhances the activities of zzso in zzso and in zzso that may be useful in the treatment of zzso
