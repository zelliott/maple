A battery of zzso directed against different portions of the precursor to zzso hormone zzso as well as to the mature zzso were characterized zzso in two zzso zzso experiments were used to determine the zzso recognized by each zzso zzso microscopic zzso was then used to define the zzso zzso that contained reaction product when tissue was incubated with these zzso These latter observations helped to determine if the zzso recognized the zzso as part of the intact precursor or only after it had been zzso from parent zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso precursor is routed from the rough zzso zzso through the zzso apparatus to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that initial zzso and processing of the zzso precursor begin in the cell zzso These zzso should be useful in the future in determining changes in processing of precursor in animals that differ in zzso zzso
