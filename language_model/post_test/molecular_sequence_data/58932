zzso genes zzso zzso factors involved in the genetic control of normal development and zzso as well as in zzso zzso To begin to assess the possible role of zzso genes in zzso cell zzso we surveyed initially for expression of zzso genes in the zzso cell zzso 

This was performed by zzso using zzso zzso zzso to the zzso sequence to generate partial zzso which were cloned and zzso 

Using this method, expression of 14 members of zzso genes were detected in zzso zzso All of these expressed genes zzso to previously identified zzso genes located within the zzso B, C, and D zzso We further examined the expression of these zzso genes in different human zzso cell lines by using whole zzso slot zzso and Northern zzso zzso One of the sequences corresponding to the human zzso zzso gene is zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso prostate cell lines relative to the normal zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso gene zzso may participate in zzso progression in zzso zzso
