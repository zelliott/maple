Type X collagen is a zzso short chain, zzso collagen that is expressed exclusively by zzso zzso at the sites of zzso zzso The distribution and pattern of expression of the type X collagen gene zzso suggests that zzso altering the structure and synthesis of the protein may be responsible for causing zzso forms of zzso We investigated whether zzso within the human zzso gene were responsible for causing the disorders zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by analyzing the coding regions of the gene by using zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso By this approach, seven sequence changes were identified within and zzso the coding regions of the gene of the affected zzso We demonstrated that six of these sequence changes were not responsible for causing these forms of zzso but were zzso in zzso The sequence changes were used to demonstrate zzso segregation between the zzso locus and zzso and zzso in nuclear zzso This lack of segregation suggests that zzso within or near the zzso locus are not responsible for these zzso The seventh sequence change resulted in a zzso substitution in the zzso domain of the zzso and was identified in only two zzso individuals from a single zzso zzso analysis in this family was inconclusive, and the significance of this substitution remains zzso
