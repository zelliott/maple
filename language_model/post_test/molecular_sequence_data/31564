zzso an iron transport zzso is a clinically important zzso in diseases such as zzso zzso Current diagnostic methods for zzso levels lack quantitative zzso suggesting the need for alternative approaches like zzso with zzso peptides as internal zzso Besides zzso zzso zzso peptides are also generated by a method called zzso where peptides are expressed from DNA in the presence of heavy isotope zzso After evaluation of the expressed zzso this study compares zzso levels obtained by synthetic peptides versus zzso peptides as internal zzso zzso levels obtained by both internal standards give zzso or nearly zzso uncertainty values and are near zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso Close agreement between the two methods suggests that the quantitative values are zzso Using zzso and synthetic peptides in parallel gives a refined focus on method development, and the resulting methods should be zzso to other clinically relevant zzso
