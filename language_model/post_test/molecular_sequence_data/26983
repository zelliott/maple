zzso are rare tumors in zzso zzso A zzso in a young child may be due to sequence zzso in genes that are known to cause these tumors ( zzso zzso zzso An 11-year-old boy with a zzso was treated with zzso and the tumor zzso We studied the patient and his family for genetic causes of this zzso No zzso were present in the coding sequence of zzso and zzso A novel zzso substitution zzso zzso was identified in zzso 3 of zzso We also found an additional zzso zzso that incorporated the entire zzso 3 of the gene (210 zzso in the patient's zzso The same zzso was present with lower intensity in some of the control individuals who were not zzso zzso zzso 3 harbors an zzso stop zzso and its incorporation is predicted to result in a prematurely terminated zzso We conclude that a novel zzso variation was identified in a young boy with zzso and six of his relatives who did not present with zzso or other zzso related zzso This novel zzso variation may be associated with low zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso is suggested to be zzso because it is associated with lower zzso levels in the cells of these patients, but its consequences may be zzso by a variety of factors including changes in zzso and translation of the zzso zzso
