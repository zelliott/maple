Members of the transient zzso potential zzso zzso channel family mediate diverse sensory zzso processes in both zzso and zzso In particular, members of the zzso zzso have distinct zzso roles in zzso and zzso zzso is zzso to have a function in noxious cold sensation and zzso Here we show that zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso specific defects in zzso behaviors related to zzso responses and zzso zzso is expressed and functions in sensory zzso required for these zzso behaviors, and contributes to neural responses of these cells to touch, particularly after repeated mechanical zzso Furthermore, mechanical pressure can activate zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso encodes an zzso channel that can be activated in response to mechanical pressure and is required for zzso zzso function, suggesting a possible role in zzso zzso or zzso
