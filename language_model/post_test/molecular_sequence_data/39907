zzso zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso is a widely known highly contagious zzso zzso disease that is transmitted zzso A new zzso zzso zzso resembling zzso zzso was recently isolated from three American donkey zzso at routine testing for zzso The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize a strain of zzso zzso from the zzso tract of a zzso zzso samples for culture of zzso zzso were taken from zzso zzso zzso and penile sheath of a 3-year-old zzso of the zzso breed when it was routinely tested for zzso A small zzso rod was isolated, but the colony appearance, the slow growth rate and the results in the zzso zzso test differed slightly from those of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene was therefore performed and zzso analysis demonstrated that the sequence of the strain zzso zzso represents zzso zzso and that the strain is identical with the Californian zzso strain zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain had a low zzso of zzso zzso zzso but a high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has thus for the first time been isolated from the zzso tract of a zzso with a natural zzso To determine the zzso of zzso zzso it will be important to conduct further experimental zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso genes was shown to be a reliable tool for differentiation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso as well as for identification of these zzso
