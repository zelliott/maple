We have characterized a novel zzso gene of zzso zzso defined by zzso trap strain zzso of Brand and zzso zzso We show that transcripts of the gene accumulate within zzso zzso and persist within developing muscles, strongly suggesting that the zzso protein is involved in muscle cell determination and zzso zzso sequences reveal that the zzso protein is similar to zzso zzso identity over 210 zzso zzso a protein essential for mouse zzso and zzso zzso identity over 162 zzso zzso a zzso tumor suppressing protein of the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso gene resides within the zzso zzso zzso and describe its physical zzso Finally, we have used the zzso which we have named zzso zzso zzso to identify a family of closely related zzso zzso
