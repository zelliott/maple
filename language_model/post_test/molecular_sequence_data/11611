The zzso zzso gene products share an zzso acid sequence and a secondary structure, including a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso group zzso gene products zzso and zzso zzso that they represent a gene family with related zzso As zzso zzso gene products are thought to function as zzso zzso by zzso zzso structure, zzso might be expected to have similar zzso Here we have analyzed the function of zzso and found that zzso acts as a zzso zzso via its target DNA zzso zzso Interestingly, this binding sequence is found within regulatory or zzso regions of various zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting diverse functions of zzso as the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso has tumor zzso activity, in contrast to zzso which has been defined as a zzso
