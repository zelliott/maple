The development of rapid zzso protocols for amplification of rearranged zzso gene sequences has greatly facilitated the identification of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso zzso of false negative results with this approach has been a constant and unresolved zzso To assess the reliability of a previously published framework region 3 zzso zzso for detection of zzso zzso gene zzso we compared the zzso and Southern results in a series of 44 NHL and zzso of B cell lineage showing a zzso in Southern analysis with zzso DNA and zzso with a zzso joining region zzso zzso zzso regions were amplified using DNA extracted from clinical specimens by zzso using fluorescent zzso consensus zzso zzso to zzso regions within the variable zzso and the joining zzso gene zzso The zzso products were size separated on a high resolution zzso gel and analyzed for zzso by exact size determination and zzso zzso in an automated DNA zzso With commonly used DNA zzso zzso zzso junctions were identified in zzso samples zzso However, in the remaining eight cases zzso with zzso clearly demonstrated B cell zzso which were also zzso on zzso analysis, zzso could be demonstrated by zzso only with the zzso zzso DNA zzso In four of these zzso zzso junctions sequence analysis was performed which showed a point zzso in one and a single zzso deletion at the 3' zzso of the primer target site in the other zzso In the remaining two cases no primer zzso could be zzso Thus we conclude that the marked improvement of the zzso rate of zzso zzso junctions was achieved at least in part due to the ability of zzso DNA zzso to remove mismatched bases at the 3' zzso of the zzso with respect to the target during the first amplification zzso Our results suggest, that zzso is the DNA zzso of choice for amplification of zzso junctions with consensus zzso and zzso
