zzso of zzso is associated with restricted replication of human zzso virus zzso but the mechanism for its protective effect remains zzso If this advantage depends upon zzso zzso recognition of zzso zzso zzso transmission of escape zzso within these zzso could zzso its protective zzso However, if the zzso advantage is largely zzso by selection for zzso viral zzso within zzso zzso such as zzso in zzso then the transmission of such zzso could facilitate viral control in the zzso zzso We assessed the consequences of zzso zzso on replication capacity, viral control, and clinical outcome after vertical transmission in 13 zzso zzso We found that expression of zzso was associated with exceptional control of zzso during zzso even when zzso within zzso and most other zzso zzso were zzso zzso the natural zzso of zzso In contrast, most zzso infants born to zzso mothers progressed rapidly to zzso The presence of zzso led to a zzso reduction in viral zzso as demonstrated by in zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences from individual mothers and zzso Associated zzso zzso within zzso were observed to reverse this impairment and to influence the propensity of zzso to zzso after transmission to zzso zzso Moreover, primary failure to control zzso was observed in one infant to whom multiple zzso zzso were transmitted along with zzso These parallel in zzso and in zzso data suggest that zzso zzso its advantage primarily by driving and maintaining a zzso zzso in zzso
