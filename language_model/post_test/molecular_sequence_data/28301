The zzso in X zzso diseases are frequently heterogeneous, and yet only a small fraction can be detected by Southern zzso We therefore adapted the chemical zzso method of Cotton et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Campbell, zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 85, zzso and the zzso chain reaction to rapidly scan for point zzso in X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This simple zzso mapping method identified different mismatch sites in zzso chain zzso liver zzso from five unrelated zzso zzso zzso The predicted sequence zzso was confirmed by DNA sequencing in all five patients and indicated a likely zzso zzso in four of these zzso In one zzso zzso zzso patient a sequence zzso compatible with a zzso zzso was zzso One family was studied in zzso zzso detection was performed by chemical zzso of amplified zzso DNA and verified by zzso zzso zzso This zzso scanning approach is simple, sensitive, and zzso to many genetic zzso
