We have determined the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso coli and of zzso zzso This structural information enabled us to investigate the expression and organization of the zzso zzso The proteins coded by each of the putative zzso zzso were identified by zzso appropriate DNA fragments and by analyzing the zzso zzso in zzso A structural comparison of the gene products was zzso The zzso zzso zzso molecules produced in zzso and the internal zzso initiation sites were identified by Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso A comparative analysis of the different zzso and zzso control elements within the two zzso reveals a remarkable preservation for most of them except for the zzso region between the first zzso and second zzso structural genes and for the zzso zzso of zzso at the end of the zzso Overall, the zzso structure is very compact and its expression appears to be regulated at several zzso
