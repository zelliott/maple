To determine whether nuclear zzso sequences provide a useful means for assessing the structure of populations of zzso zzso we compared zzso among copies of an internal transcribed zzso zzso sequence within individual ticks to the zzso between zzso At least zzso of the zzso zzso this sequence vary among the copies present within individual zzso zzso diversity in each of two ticks is nearly half as great as that reported between ticks from geographically disparate zzso Because individual ticks retain ancestral zzso zzso variation does not accurately reflect descent relationships among these zzso zzso single copies of zzso zzso therefore does not permit assessment of the zzso relationships among the zzso zzso ticks in eastern North zzso We recommend caution in future zzso and emphasize the importance of procedures designed to ensure that the many zzso copies of the zzso zzso have been sufficiently zzso by concerted evolutionary zzso Such zzso measures will make certain that zzso trees based on these gene sequences reflect the zzso zzso of the biological zzso
