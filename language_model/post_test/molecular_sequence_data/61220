zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso of all 20 zzso from completely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals a complex evolutionary zzso zzso examination of the domain architecture of zzso using sequence profile searches delineated a network of partially zzso zzso that is even more elaborate than previously zzso Several unexpected evolutionary connections were identified, including the apparent origin of the zzso of bacterial zzso from the HD zzso of zzso a domain shared by bacterial zzso and the B zzso of zzso zzso zzso and another previously zzso domain that is zzso in a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a family of zzso zzso of domain zzso and multiple alignments resulted in the zzso of zzso derived characters, such as extra zzso or zzso most of the zzso zzso These zzso partition sets of zzso with the same specificity into two or more distinct and apparently zzso zzso In conjunction with cluster analysis and a modification of the zzso zzso this zzso was used to zzso the likely root position in zzso zzso The zzso of the resulting rooted trees for most of the zzso zzso are compatible with the evolutionary zzso zzso zzso the earliest radiation event separated bacteria from the common zzso of zzso and zzso as opposed to the two other possible evolutionary scenarios for the three major divisions of zzso For almost all zzso zzso however, this simple scheme is zzso by displacement of some of the bacterial zzso by their zzso or, less zzso zzso zzso zzso of ancestral zzso zzso genes by bacterial ones, presumably of zzso origin, was observed for three zzso In contrast, there was no convincing evidence of displacement of zzso zzso by bacterial zzso zzso of zzso genes by zzso counterparts is most common among zzso and symbiotic bacteria, particularly the zzso in which 10 of the 19 zzso seem to have been displaced by the respective zzso genes and two by the zzso zzso Unlike the primary radiation events between the three main divisions of life, that were readily traceable through the zzso analysis of zzso no consistent large-scale bacterial zzso could be zzso In part, this may be due to additional gene displacement events among bacterial zzso zzso is presented that, although zzso gene loss might have contributed to the evolution of some of the zzso this is not a viable alternative to horizontal gene transfer as the principal evolutionary phenomenon in this gene zzso
