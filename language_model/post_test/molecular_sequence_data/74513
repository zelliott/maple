Although many zzso strains used as zzso are believed to zzso host immune responses, the molecular zzso of the components of such zzso zzso directly involved in immune zzso process are largely zzso We aimed to assess the function of zzso zzso of the cell wall of zzso zzso strain zzso as a possible immune zzso which regulates zzso production by zzso A gene survey of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso down a unique cluster of 10 zzso most of whose predicted zzso acid sequences had similarities to various zzso to known proteins involved in zzso of zzso or zzso zzso from other zzso acid zzso Gene knockout zzso of eight genes from this cluster resulted in the loss of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and extreme reduction of zzso zzso in the cell wall zzso indicating that at least these genes are involved in zzso of zzso cell wall zzso By adding zzso zzso cells to mouse zzso cell lines or to mouse zzso cells, the production of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was more zzso than by zzso zzso In addition, these zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso production by zzso zzso mouse zzso cells, while zzso cells significantly suppressed the zzso production of zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that this cluster of genes of zzso zzso zzso which have been named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso determine the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cell wall and that this zzso zzso is the relevant immune zzso which may function to reduce excessive immune reactions during the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso
