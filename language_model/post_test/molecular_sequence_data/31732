zzso mediate diverse functions from zzso to zzso zzso and are unusual zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso because of their large size and zzso zzso The current model for zzso zzso which involves interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to describe differences in zzso selectivity and the zzso of multiple zzso zzso In the present study, we show in zzso zzso zzso that the highly zzso zzso zzso motif located zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso couples zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed large differences from zzso to complete loss of function that could not be correlated with the specific zzso zzso affinity or zzso or a specific zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso motif does not influence zzso zzso but molecular dynamics simulations suggested that this motif dictates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso motif enables diverse zzso functions by controlling zzso between zzso and zzso and further propose that the repertoire of zzso functions is best described by a zzso ensemble model in which a network of long-range coupled indirect interactions mediate zzso zzso
