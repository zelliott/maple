zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a 142 zzso acid protein originally isolated from rabbit zzso using zzso of zzso zzso as an zzso zzso is composed of an zzso domain of unknown function zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso acid zzso resulting from the zzso of 5 zzso acids from the zzso of zzso inhibited zzso tissue factor generation, zzso oxide production and zzso release by zzso Mice treated with zzso or zzso were significantly protected from zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso were highly active, other fragments of zzso including zzso with a truncated zzso did not exhibit zzso and zzso zzso Both peptides had broad zzso activity against both zzso bacteria such as zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso sensitive and resistant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned a zzso family protein from human zzso The cloned zzso zzso 140 zzso acid zzso Human zzso zzso was highly zzso to that of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind zzso inhibit zzso tissue factor generation by zzso zzso and protect mice from zzso zzso This zzso exhibited zzso activity against both zzso and zzso zzso We zzso that zzso and the derived peptides bind to zzso and alter the capacity of zzso to initiate zzso zzso zzso In this regard, zzso may act as host defense protein against infectious diseases, and have therapeutic potential for zzso and zzso zzso
