zzso zzso family 97 zzso zzso is a unique zzso family that contains zzso and retaining zzso Of these, zzso zzso and zzso zzso entry zzso derived from zzso zzso have been characterized as an zzso zzso zzso and a retaining zzso zzso Previous studies on the three-dimensional structures of zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso acts as an acid catalyst and that zzso and zzso function as the zzso base in the zzso zzso However, zzso lacks base zzso but possesses a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso in zzso is the zzso catalyst based on the results of crystal structure analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison between zzso and zzso indicated that zzso of zzso in zzso is located at a position zzso identical with the zzso water zzso of zzso which attacks on the zzso carbon from the zzso zzso zzso is poised for zzso attack on the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of the zzso and the activity is rescued by an external zzso zzso zzso That is, zzso functions as a zzso zzso The multiple zzso acid sequence alignment of zzso 97 members indicated that almost half of the zzso 97 zzso possess base catalyst zzso at the end of zzso 3 and 5, while the other half of the family show a zzso zzso zzso at the end of zzso zzso The different positions of functional groups on the zzso of the zzso which seem to be due to zzso of the functional zzso during evolution, have led to divergence of zzso mechanism within the same zzso
