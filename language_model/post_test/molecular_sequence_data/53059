Exposure of isolated zzso to 30 zzso zzso which is a zzso for all high affinity zzso zzso for 30 zzso resulted in the zzso of such zzso into zzso zzso cells but not zzso zzso as zzso by zzso for zzso Further incubation of such loaded zzso in zzso media, in the absence of zzso resulted in the slow release of accumulated zzso from the zzso cells and its zzso into populations of zzso and bipolar zzso This result indicates that after initial transport into zzso cells, reversal of direction of transport of zzso and thus by zzso zzso by zzso readily zzso zzso released by zzso cells was strongly accumulated into cone zzso which are known to express zzso and into rod zzso which we demonstrate here to express the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso bipolar cells, which express zzso also exhibited avid zzso of zzso We conclude that the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is responsible for most of the initial zzso clearance in the zzso after its release from zzso However, some zzso is also returned from zzso cells, to zzso expressing zzso and zzso albeit at a slow zzso These data suggest that the role of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso may be to facilitate a slow process of recycling zzso back from zzso cells to zzso after its initial clearance from zzso regions by zzso
