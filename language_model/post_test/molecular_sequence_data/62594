Previous studies have established the existence of zzso zzso zzso virus, human zzso virus type 2 zzso and laboratory strains of zzso However, whether zzso viruses may also exist in zzso patients has remained zzso We have recently reported the isolation of viruses from an AIDS patient that were able to zzso zzso cells independent of zzso using zzso as a zzso Using a similar approach, here we examined viruses from 12 randomly selected patients zzso from the AIDS Research and zzso Program, National Institutes of Health) for the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from infected zzso cells from the viral zzso of 7 of 12 zzso The zzso zzso were able to zzso primary zzso cells as well as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and blocking zzso or zzso zzso had no effect on infection of zzso zzso zzso two of the seven zzso zzso but not their parental bulk zzso induced zzso and caused acute death of infected zzso zzso Some of the zzso zzso were also able to zzso zzso cells that were negative for zzso zzso and common zzso zzso suggesting a novel entry mechanism for these zzso The zzso zzso were derived from adults and children infected with zzso A, B, and zzso Although no common motif for zzso independence was found, novel sequence changes were observed in critical areas of the envelopes of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso patients can frequently harbor viruses that are able to mediate zzso infection of zzso zzso In addition, this study also provides evidence of primary zzso zzso that are zzso inducing and acutely zzso for zzso zzso
