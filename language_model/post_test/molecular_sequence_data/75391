zzso zzso proteins with three main sites of zzso the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso Although the exact zzso function of most zzso products is not zzso several of them are known to be involved in signal zzso A role in gene regulation through DNA binding has been suggested for a recently isolated member of the group of zzso acting at the nucleus, zzso The zzso of the putative zzso protein is similar in sequence to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso which forms its minimal zzso zzso zzso binds to specific sites whose consensus sequence is highly similar to the recognition sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso Like zzso zzso binds to promoter elements of specific genes and activates their zzso Because of the similarity between the recognition sites for zzso and zzso we examined the possibility that zzso could be the product of the zzso zzso The experimental results reported here indicate that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso
