In zzso coli, the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso at position 516 in zzso zzso during assembly of the zzso zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso bound to zzso at zzso A resolution and to zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso consists of an zzso domain connected by an extended zzso to the central and zzso zzso zzso and UMP bind in a zzso between the central and zzso zzso near the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain shows structural similarity to the zzso protein zzso Despite only zzso zzso acid identity, the other two zzso are structurally similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso including the position of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that all four families of zzso zzso share the same fold of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso
