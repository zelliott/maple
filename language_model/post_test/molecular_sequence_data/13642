Within the native zzso alpha zzso b beta 3, the zzso of the zzso domain of the beta 3 zzso has a significant influence on the availability of the zzso zzso that defines the A1 and zzso zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso to either zzso or zzso alpha zzso zzso beta 3, fail to bind to the zzso zzso loop within zzso in native beta 3 unless this sequence is maintained in a proper orientation by two zzso human beta 3 zzso By comparing zzso binding to zzso beta 3 molecules composed of segments of human, zzso and avian sequences expressed by zzso zzso cell lines, we have found that neither region alone is sufficient for full expression of the zzso One zzso that most zzso to zzso lies within beta zzso and a second zzso sequence is located within beta zzso Proximity of the zzso sequence to the zzso loop in native beta 3 is confirmed by the fact that both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for beta zzso completely inhibit the binding of rabbit zzso zzso specific for the sequence beta zzso zzso zzso zzso from all of the 7 donors selectively bind to the zzso within the native zzso of beta zzso However, in one of the seven donors, roughly zzso of the zzso binds exclusively to zzso zzso beta 3, and not to either zzso zzso beta 3 or zzso zzso zzso beta zzso This zzso zzso cannot be zzso by zzso to intact zzso or to native alpha zzso zzso beta 3 zzso The zzso relevance of this exceptional type of zzso zzso is zzso but the presence of zzso with this specificity only in an zzso subject suggests that the zzso may well be presented on a zzso form of beta 3 in zzso Regardless, our results indicate that the zzso domain of the native beta 3 zzso associates with zzso beta 3 zzso and the zzso recognized by a majority of zzso zzso is a sensitive indicator of correct zzso structure within this region of beta zzso
