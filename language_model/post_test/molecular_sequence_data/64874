Limited information is available on the activity of zzso drugs against human zzso virus type 2 zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso strains to guide their use in treatment or zzso We evaluated the zzso activity of 16 approved drugs and one experimental drug, zzso against two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two strains of zzso zzso and zzso and two strains of zzso zzso virus zzso that contain the reverse zzso zzso or envelope zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso in a zzso zzso Drug zzso was measured conventionally by the zzso zzso and results were zzso as fold changes in 50% effective concentration zzso relative to the zzso for zzso zzso The zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso reverse zzso inhibitor zzso retained full activity against all six viruses except for zzso and zzso that showed low-level resistance to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be active against some zzso or zzso zzso However, a significant reduction in zzso was seen with zzso against zzso zzso and with zzso against zzso zzso All viruses except for zzso showed a zzso decrease in zzso for the zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating high-level zzso zzso a zzso zzso was active against zzso and zzso a finding consistent with the use of the zzso zzso by these zzso but was inactive against zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was active against zzso but had reduced zzso activity against both zzso and zzso strains predicting little therapeutic value against these zzso These findings support the use of zzso zzso but not zzso for treating zzso persons or for prophylaxis against zzso and zzso The clinical significance of the low-level resistance of zzso and zzso to some zzso is zzso zzso zzso such as zzso show promising zzso therapeutic zzso Both zzso and zzso could be used for prophylaxis against zzso
