During zzso zzso zzso virus zzso infections, the zzso zzso host zzso protein zzso zzso the turnover of host and viral zzso Although the zzso zzso from zzso type 1 zzso strain zzso and zzso strain zzso are zzso zzso zzso strains generally shut off the host more rapidly and completely than zzso zzso In a previous study, we identified three regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids 1 to zzso 208 to zzso and 365 to zzso that enhance the activity of zzso when zzso for the corresponding portions of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results have been extended through the analysis of more than 50 zzso zzso of zzso in which selected zzso zzso acids were introduced into an zzso background and zzso zzso acids were introduced into the zzso zzso The zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso were found to contribute dramatically to the greater activity of the zzso zzso as did the zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso The substitution of six zzso zzso acids between zzso 210 and 242 enhanced the zzso activity to a lesser zzso In most cases, individual zzso or the substitution of combinations of fewer than all six zzso acids reduced the zzso activity to less than that of zzso The results pinpoint several zzso zzso acids that are largely responsible for the greater activity of the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, several spontaneous zzso that abolish zzso zzso activity were zzso
