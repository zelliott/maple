An zzso zzso nuclear factor that binds tightly to a sequence motif zzso shared by many zzso zzso promoters was zzso to zzso by DNA sequence affinity zzso zzso of the zzso factor, which we term zzso showed a simple pattern zzso a zzso zzso with Mrs of 18,000 and zzso We confirmed that these species account for zzso activity by zzso the zzso from sodium zzso zzso gels and zzso the appropriate binding zzso Using the zzso zzso we mapped seven zzso sites that are dispersed across the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is flanked by at least two zzso zzso One site is centered at zzso zzso zzso (with respect to the zzso cap zzso A zzso site is located downstream of the zzso zzso addition site, at zzso zzso We mapped five zzso sites near the zzso zzso zzso The strongest site was centered at zzso zzso Four additional sites were centered at zzso zzso zzso to the binding site of a factor present in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the second intervening zzso and zzso
