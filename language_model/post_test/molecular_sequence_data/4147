Emerging evidence has implicated a potential role for zzso receptors in zzso and zzso One of the main target structures of zzso receptors on zzso and zzso pathways is the prefrontal zzso zzso As zzso zzso plays a key role in regulating zzso functions, we examined the effect of zzso receptors on zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso produced either an enhancement or a reduction of zzso currents in zzso zzso which are both zzso by anchored protein zzso A zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso leads to current enhancement or reduction respectively in zzso expression systems, we found that zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, altering zzso zzso levels can change the direction of the dual effect, switching enhancement to reduction and vice zzso In addition, increased zzso activity in zzso slices elevated the zzso zzso level, changing the enhancing effect of zzso receptors on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso currents zzso to a zzso These results suggest that zzso receptors can zzso zzso zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso levels that are determined by zzso zzso This zzso provides a unique and flexible mechanism for zzso receptors to zzso regulate synaptic transmission and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
