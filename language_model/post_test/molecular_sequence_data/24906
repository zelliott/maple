Recently we described the novel zzso gene zzso whose corresponding transcripts were restricted to the zzso zone III of broad bean root zzso To characterize zzso on the protein level, zzso zzso were generated using the zzso zzso zzso protein produced in zzso coli by employing the zzso expression zzso These zzso recognized zzso proteins isolated from indeterminate zzso of different zzso plants, but also from zzso zzso of zzso max and from zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso zzso was localized to the zzso of infected cells in the zzso zone of broad bean zzso Due to the zzso of the zzso sequence to that of the zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein was tested for zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso it could be demonstrated that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso acid sequences of the putative zzso zzso sites of the zzso 18 zzso from Lens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso We propose that zzso is a member of a novel family of zzso proteins in zzso
