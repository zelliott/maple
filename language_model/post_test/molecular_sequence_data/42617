We have been interested in determining how zzso cells generate and maintain their characteristically polarized zzso of membrane zzso Our efforts to date strongly indicate that the polarized transport in zzso cells may be due to a set of discrete targeting zzso often found on a membrane zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, these zzso are widely distributed and are not specific to proteins expressed in polarized zzso They also appear to function in controlling polarized transport along both the zzso and the zzso (or zzso zzso zzso for zzso transport have been characterized and, like the zzso domain signal used by plasma membrane receptors for zzso at zzso pits, they often involve a critical zzso zzso Although the zzso and coated pit signals may also be zzso they are not zzso The zzso and zzso transport zzso are also zzso zzso Although a single protein may contain one or more signals specifying zzso zzso zzso of these signals appears to reveal a zzso that directs efficient zzso zzso Given that the sequence zzso responsible for polarized transport are not restricted to zzso cells and are related to zzso commonly zzso in all cells, it is possible that zzso cells contain zzso zzso and zzso pathways that are responsible for zzso transport from the zzso to the plasma zzso The presence of two zzso pathways might zzso a high degree of plasticity to zzso cells, allowing them rapidly to begin assuming a polarized zzso in response to zzso stimuli without requiring the synthesis of zzso zzso transport zzso
