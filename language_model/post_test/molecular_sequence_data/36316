The influence of different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso on gas phase sequence performance has been zzso These zzso zzso have been classified as either high retention zzso and zzso or low retention zzso zzso based on their ability to bind proteins during zzso from zzso zzso yields, repetitive yields, and extraction efficiency of the zzso zzso acid derivatives have been compared for several standard proteins that have been either zzso or loaded onto zzso zzso by direct zzso These results show that the major differences in initial sequence yields between zzso arise from differences in the amount of protein actually transferred to the membrane rather than zzso zzso In contrast to several previous observations from other laboratories, more tightly bound proteins do not sequence with lower initial yields and initial yields are not affected by the ratio of surface area to zzso The stronger binding on high retention zzso zzso does not adversely affect zzso of difficult to zzso or very zzso zzso acid zzso Several zzso zzso especially zzso are actually recovered in dramatically higher yield on high retention zzso compared with either zzso or glass zzso At the same time, the protein and zzso binding properties of high retention zzso will frequently improve the repetitive yield by minimizing sample extraction during the zzso zzso zzso protein binding together with improved zzso yields offer substantially improved sequence performance when high retention zzso zzso are zzso
