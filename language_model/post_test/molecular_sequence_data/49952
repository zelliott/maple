The flowers of the zzso plants ornamental tobacco zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produce high levels of zzso during the early stages of zzso In contrast to the zzso seed zzso these floral zzso are produced as precursors with zzso zzso of 27 to 33 zzso acids in addition to a typical zzso signal zzso and central zzso domain of 47 or 49 zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso flowers lack the zzso domain, suggesting that it is removed during or after transit through the zzso zzso zzso electron zzso has been used to demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is deposited in the zzso In addition to the eight zzso zzso zzso that define the plant zzso family, the two zzso zzso have an extra pair of zzso that form a fifth zzso bond and hence define a new zzso of this family of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is predominantly flower specific and is most active during the early stages of flower zzso zzso transcripts accumulate in the zzso cell layers of zzso zzso zzso and styles, consistent with a role in protection of the zzso zzso against potential zzso The floral zzso inhibit the growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso providing further support for a role in protection of floral zzso against pathogen zzso
