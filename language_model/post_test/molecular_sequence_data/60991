zzso factor zzso is the most common zzso found in patients with zzso syndrome zzso To study the genetic origin and the mechanisms acting behind its generation we have characterized and zzso the zzso zzso genes used by 10 zzso zzso zzso derived from peripheral blood of six female patients with zzso We compared the structure of the zzso zzso zzso genes with those obtained previously from zzso arthritis zzso patients and healthy zzso donors zzso zzso and zzso were each used by four zzso zzso one clone was zzso by zzso family gene and one by zzso family zzso This distribution frequency was different from that observed in zzso where zzso was the dominant family, followed by zzso Eight different zzso zzso genes zzso the clones and all of these genes were seen previously in zzso and/or zzso zzso Five clones rearranged to zzso four rearranged to zzso and one to zzso in contrast to zzso from zzso and zzso where zzso was most frequently zzso D segment use and zzso structure were zzso Interestingly, three out of four zzso clones used the zzso gene zzso that was seen frequently in zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was very much lower than seen in zzso and zzso zzso All the zzso zzso clones except three were in or very close to zzso zzso This indicates that there is little role for zzso zzso and a zzso zzso reaction in the generation of zzso from peripheral blood in zzso
