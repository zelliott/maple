Coral reef zzso are renowned for their diversity and zzso Their immense ecological success is due to a symbiotic association between zzso hosts and zzso zzso algae, known as zzso These algae are zzso and the zzso association is based on nutritional zzso Maintenance of such an intimate cellular partnership involves many zzso between the zzso To better characterize symbiotic relationships between a zzso host and its zzso zzso we conducted a large-scale zzso study on a symbiotic sea zzso zzso zzso in which the two tissue layers zzso and zzso can be easily zzso 

A single zzso library was constructed from symbiotic tissue of sea zzso zzso zzso in various environmental conditions (both normal and zzso We generated zzso high quality zzso which were assembled into zzso unique sequences zzso zzso were zzso and sorted according to their putative origin zzso zzso or zzso We identified many new repeated elements in the zzso of most animal zzso suggesting that these elements potentially have a biological role, especially with respect to gene expression zzso We identified genes of animal origin that have no zzso in the zzso starlet sea zzso zzso zzso zzso but in other symbiotic zzso and may therefore be involved in the zzso relationship in zzso zzso zzso of protein domain occurrence in zzso zzso with that in zzso zzso demonstrated an increase in abundance of some molecular functions, such as protein binding or zzso activity, suggesting that these functions are essential for the symbiotic state and may be specific zzso 

This large zzso of sequences provides a valuable resource for future studies on symbiotic interactions in zzso The comparison with the closest available zzso the sea zzso zzso zzso as well as with zzso zzso from other symbiotic zzso provided a set of candidate genes involved in zzso molecular zzso Altogether, these results provide new molecular insights that could be used as a zzso for further functional zzso zzso
