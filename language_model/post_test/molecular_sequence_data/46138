While advances in tandem mass zzso zzso steadily increase the rate of generation of zzso zzso standard zzso approaches for zzso identification recently seemed to be reaching the limit on the amount of information that could be extracted from zzso zzso However, a closer look reveals that a common limiting procedure is to analyze each spectrum in isolation, even though high zzso mass zzso regularly generates many zzso from related zzso By zzso on this zzso we show that, similarly to the alignment of protein zzso unidentified zzso zzso can also be aligned for the identification of modified and unmodified zzso of the same zzso Moreover, this alignment procedure can be zzso for the accurate grouping of multiple modification zzso of the same zzso Furthermore, the combination of shotgun zzso with the alignment of zzso from overlapping peptides led to the development of zzso zzso zzso - similarly to the assembly of DNA reads into whole zzso zzso we show that assembly of zzso zzso enables the highest ever de zzso sequencing zzso while recovering nearly complete protein zzso We further show that shotgun protein sequencing has the potential to overcome the limitations of zzso protein sequencing approaches and thus catalyze the otherwise zzso applications of zzso zzso in studies of unknown zzso
