To investigate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene in patients with zzso zzso type zzso 

zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells of the eight zzso with zzso who were diagnosed by urine and blood zzso By zzso and direct sequencing, all 11 zzso and their zzso sequences of the zzso gene were zzso zzso search was also performed in some of their family zzso 

Among the eight patients diagnosed by zzso zzso seven patients belonged to classical zzso One patient, however, was zzso who was admitted to the hospital because of suffering from zzso cerebral zzso The zzso gene zzso were identified in all the eight zzso with zzso five of them had compound zzso zzso while the other three zzso only one zzso zzso zzso nine different zzso of the zzso gene were identified in the eight zzso four of them were novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso gene zzso are identified in 8 patients with zzso in mainland China, including one adult patient with late zzso Four novel zzso of zzso gene are found which expanded the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso
