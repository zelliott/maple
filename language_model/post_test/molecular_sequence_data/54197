A zzso column study was conducted to investigate the long-term effects of zzso zzso on the abundance and activity of the indigenous microbial community and zzso bacteria in contaminated soil from a former manufactured gas plant zzso zzso zzso six pore volumes of a 20 zzso zzso solution were introduced into the column, followed by simulated groundwater for 500 zzso zzso samples were collected from the surface of the soil bed and along the column length immediately before and after zzso injection and up to 500 days following zzso Exposure to zzso led to a zzso to zzso reduction in total bacterial zzso zzso zzso severe zzso of zzso zzso (as a measure of general microbial zzso and a decrease in community zzso However, relatively rapid recovery of both bacterial gene abundance and activity was observed within 30 days after zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also inhibited but did not recover until 100 days zzso Known zzso bacterial groups decreased to below detection limits throughout the column, with recovery times from 100 to 500 days after zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso biological processes with zzso zzso is possible, although recovery of specific contaminant zzso may occur much later than the general microbial community zzso Furthermore, the use of total bacterial quantity or zzso measures of activity as a surrogate for the recovery of contaminant zzso may be inappropriate for evaluating the zzso of chemical treatment with subsequent zzso
