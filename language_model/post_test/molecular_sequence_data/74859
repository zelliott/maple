Members of the transforming growth zzso zzso growth differentiation factor 9 zzso and bone zzso protein 15 zzso have crucial roles in primary zzso growth in zzso To initiate investigations into their significance in zzso zzso we set out to clone and zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso their patterns of gene expression during the zzso zzso cycle in the European sea bass zzso zzso Sea bass zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso long, coding for zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso respectively, and were most similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso By Northern analysis, sea bass zzso and zzso zzso transcripts were detected in the zzso only of the zzso zzso and their sizes were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed high levels of zzso and zzso expression in the zzso during primary zzso growth and zzso zzso to zzso with a significant decline at the onset of zzso zzso and remaining low until the beginning of new zzso growth zzso There was a highly significant positive correlation zzso between zzso and zzso gene expression in individual zzso The high levels of zzso and zzso zzso transcripts in the zzso especially during the zzso growth period suggest an important role for these factors in early primary zzso growth in the European sea zzso
