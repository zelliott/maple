zzso zzso K zzso zzso consisting of approximately 70 zzso acid zzso are present in a variety of zzso zzso Among these are zzso proteins zzso which are important regulators of zzso stability and zzso regulation in zzso All zzso contain three different zzso zzso and recognize zzso with high affinity and zzso To reveal the molecular basis of zzso recognition, we have determined the crystal structure, at zzso A resolution, of zzso zzso domain in complex with a zzso DNA sequence zzso corresponding to one repeat of the zzso strand of human zzso zzso The domain assumes a zzso zzso fold in a zzso zzso The zzso interface could be studied in unprecedented detail and is made up of a series of direct and zzso hydrogen bonds between the protein and the DNA, revealing an especially dense network involving several structural water molecules for the last 2 zzso in the core recognition zzso Unlike published zzso domain structures, the protein zzso without zzso zzso yielding new insights into the zzso properties of different zzso zzso A zzso platform, an interesting feature found in some zzso zzso was identified, evidently for the first time in zzso
