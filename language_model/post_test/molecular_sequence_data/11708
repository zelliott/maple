The purpose of this study was to examine the cardiac zzso and zzso after zzso zzso and the effect of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso on the gene zzso zzso zzso in rats was produced by zzso of the coronary zzso zzso (10 zzso was administered orally to rats from 1 day after zzso zzso At 1, 2 and 3 weeks after zzso zzso blood pressure and heart rate were measured, and the heart was zzso The left zzso was measured for zzso size and weight, and then the total zzso from the zzso left zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso left zzso were measured by Northern zzso zzso The weight of the zzso left zzso was significantly increased 3 weeks after zzso This was completely prevented by zzso zzso zzso levels for zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso collagen types I and III and transforming growth zzso 1 zzso 1) in the zzso left zzso were increased by a factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, 1 week after zzso There was no increase in zzso zzso zzso at 1 and 2 weeks, but it was increased by a factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso On the other hand, there was no change in zzso zzso during the 3 zzso zzso significantly suppressed the increased gene expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at all time points, and also suppressed the expression of zzso at 2 and 3 zzso However, zzso failed to inhibit the expression of collagen I and III zzso at 1 and 3 zzso These results show that zzso zzso causes a rapid shift of zzso to fetal zzso and a rapid zzso of collagen genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso following zzso zzso
