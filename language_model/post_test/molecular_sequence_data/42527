zzso zzso zzso zzso from cell culture zzso have been found to contain viral DNA that is the result of partial reverse zzso within the virus zzso Our data supported these observations and further indicated that the ratio of zzso zzso to viral DNA was approximately zzso for the zzso zzso zzso region and zzso for the gag zzso We have shown that, in the absence of zzso large amounts of zzso viral DNA can be zzso within intact zzso zzso indicating that this phenomenon is not dependent on zzso of the viral zzso zzso viral DNA synthesis also occurred in zzso zzso incubated at 37 degrees C in zzso human zzso zzso including seminal zzso blood zzso breast milk, and zzso zzso In zzso zzso infection zzso in which zzso DNA synthesis was initiated in zzso zzso by prior incubation with zzso zzso demonstrated that virus particles so treated had an increased infectious zzso over zzso zzso when incubated with target human T zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso DNA synthesis may occur in zzso and may impact on the efficiency of zzso and zzso virus zzso If so, this phenomenon should prove to be an important target for zzso therapeutic zzso
