The zzso are a large family of cell zzso molecules consisting of zzso associated zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso the zzso of a novel human zzso zzso designated zzso The zzso zzso encodes a mature protein with a large zzso zzso domain that contains an zzso of zzso zzso and is linked by a zzso domain to a short zzso domain of 24 zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein shows the typical structural features of zzso zzso and is similar to a distinct group of zzso from zzso zzso However, it differs from most zzso zzso by an incompletely preserved zzso zzso zzso The human zzso gene was localized to bands zzso on zzso 15, and its transcripts were found in a variety of zzso but predominantly in bone, cartilage, cardiac muscle, and skeletal zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso in small zzso
