We encountered three clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso which were susceptible to zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso antibiotics but which were resistant to them in the presence of zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso was used to further investigate the antagonism between zzso and zzso zzso zzso antibiotics induced bacterial synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso in association with decreased zzso activities of zzso A zzso zzso zzso that included the genes that control for zzso zzso resistance was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso analysis suggested that a zzso element containing a gene zzso zzso was located downstream from a truncated zzso zzso The DNA sequence between zzso and a zzso element was zzso The zzso hybrid structure was zzso into the zzso zzso and the typical sequences for the termination of zzso were not found between these zzso We deduced that antagonism of zzso by zzso antibiotics in isolate zzso involved zzso of the zzso gene under the influence of the system regulating zzso zzso
