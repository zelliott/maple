The zzso in the zzso zzso zzso family have various zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso specificity in relation to their structures is largely unknown because no zzso zzso complex has been zzso zzso also called alkaline zzso zzso is a zzso family member that may have important implications in zzso and cholesterol zzso The sequence of zzso is zzso similar to that of the closest zzso member, but zzso has no activity against zzso In this work, we predict the three-dimensional structure of zzso by zzso modeling using a recently zzso zzso from zzso Using the model, we studied the zzso specificity of the zzso by zzso The model generated explains the functional changes in previous zzso studies and zzso the structural basis for the lack of activity toward zzso An effort to shift the zzso specificity from zzso zzso to zzso was not successful but revealed a zzso zzso that increased activity toward zzso In conclusion, this is the first study to predict the structure of a zzso zzso and its zzso specificity by molecular zzso The information may be helpful in understanding the functional differences of zzso zzso
