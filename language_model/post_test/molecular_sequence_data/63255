In this study, we used zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso surface capture zzso to characterize zzso T cell responses against the zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso from the major birch zzso zzso zzso v 1, in both healthy and allergic zzso We could detect zzso v zzso T cells in the zzso of 20 birch zzso allergic patients, but also in 9 of 9 healthy individuals zzso Analysis at a zzso level revealed that zzso zzso T cells from healthy individuals zzso zzso and zzso in response to the zzso whereas cells from allergic patients are bona fide zzso cells zzso mostly zzso some zzso but no zzso as zzso by patterns of zzso produced by T cell zzso A fraction of zzso v zzso cells isolated from healthy, but not zzso individuals also expresses zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3, indicating that they represent regulatory T zzso In this model of seasonal exposure to zzso we also demonstrate the tremendous dynamics of T cell responses in both allergic and zzso individuals during the peak zzso season, with an expansion of zzso v zzso precursors from zzso to zzso among circulating zzso T zzso zzso vaccines should be designed to zzso such naturally protective zzso T cell responses observed in healthy zzso
