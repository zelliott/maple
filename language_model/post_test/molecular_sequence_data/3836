zzso strains from most zzso zzso studied to date have been found to carry the zzso gene cluster zzso zzso zzso and zzso on a zzso an organization unique among zzso Here, however, we demonstrate a classical zzso location of the cluster in zzso zzso strain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The genes that flank zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso appear to be adjacent in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso a strain carrying a zzso zzso We propose that the presence of a zzso zzso predates the diversification of symbiotic zzso and that the zzso location observed in zzso zzso strain zzso arose by a transfer of the zzso genes from a zzso to the zzso
