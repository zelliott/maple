zzso zzso can induce artificial modifications such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on proteins due to the temperature and the alkaline pH buffers used during zzso The amount of these artificial modifications is directly zzso to the incubation time of protein samples in the zzso buffer and, more important, in the zzso buffer where the peptides are completely zzso zzso To minimize these artificial zzso we focused on minimizing the zzso zzso time by maximizing zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso by the complete removal of zzso which is a known zzso zzso from the zzso zzso As a result, near complete zzso zzso was achieved on reduced and zzso zzso gamma molecules in zzso The protein zzso fragments and their modification products were analyzed and zzso by zzso liquid zzso mass zzso using an zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The reduction and zzso reaction time was also minimized by monitoring the zzso of the reaction using a high-resolution zzso mass zzso Using this zzso zzso zzso zzso method, little zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso product was observed and cleaner zzso maps were obtained due to less zzso zzso and fewer zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was also improved significantly compared with conventional zzso zzso zzso
