zzso is a zzso protein that may be important in linking zzso to the plasma zzso Recent cloning of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a protein highly zzso to zzso and zzso We have cloned and zzso the human zzso zzso and found the predicted zzso acid sequence for the human protein to be nearly identical to those predicted for zzso in the two other zzso By Southern analyses of Chinese zzso zzso human zzso cell hybrid DNA and of zzso products derived from hybrids, the coding gene zzso was mapped to zzso Fluorescence zzso in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso further localized this gene to band zzso However, zzso amplification with zzso zzso on the hybrid DNA panel yielded an zzso very similar DNA sequence that was further characterized by direct sequencing of zzso zzso This sequence represents a truncated version and the respective locus zzso was assigned to zzso Furthermore, by employing a different set of zzso a third sequence was found that was zzso identical to the zzso sequence but contained termination zzso and seemed to lack zzso This zzso zzso was mapped to zzso by Southern and zzso zzso
