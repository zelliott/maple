On sensory zzso zzso of zzso receptors gated by zzso zzso contributes to chronic zzso We explored the possibility that zzso zzso may arise from zzso of an zzso signal zzso controlling zzso zzso In view of the structural modeling between the zzso region zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso C zzso domain of the zzso zzso we investigated how zzso might regulate zzso zzso Using zzso cells and the in zzso zzso zzso we observed that zzso directly zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and strongly inhibited zzso zzso On mouse zzso sensory zzso the role of zzso was tightly controlled by the zzso level of nerve growth factor, a known zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso cells zzso zzso zzso responses, confirming zzso zzso zzso The present study provides the first demonstration of an original molecular mechanism responsible for negative control over zzso zzso function and outlines a potential new target for zzso pain zzso
