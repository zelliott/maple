In this study, we studied systematically the prevalence of zzso in foods from various parts of South zzso zzso strains were characterized by zzso and zzso repetitive zzso consensus zzso chain reaction zzso to provide data support for effectively tracing the source of zzso and controlling food zzso 

In total 400 unique food samples were collected from retail markets in South China, including meat product zzso frozen product zzso seafood zzso mushroom (54), ready-to-eat food zzso vegetables zzso dairy zzso Food samples were examined by qualitative method according to national food safety standard zzso and most probable number zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was figured out when all isolated strains were characterized by zzso using slide zzso zzso We also applied zzso for genetic diversity analysis of zzso zzso 

Of the total 400 food samples, 75 zzso tested positive for zzso The results showed that zzso value of zzso zzso positive samples below 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso were belonged to 9 groups and 29 different zzso zzso Derby and zzso zzso were the two zzso zzso The isolated strains were further zzso by zzso The results revealed 96 strains including 93 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were divided into 15 zzso groups and generated 56 zzso according to the similarity zzso of zzso which suggested various zzso of zzso 

The overall prevalence of zzso was high, however lower contamination level in foods from cities of South zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso fingerprints database of zzso from food samples in South China were preliminarily zzso zzso present in foods were zzso and zzso zzso
