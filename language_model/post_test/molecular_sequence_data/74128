zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that are well adapted to various zzso are known to reproduce normally by true zzso Although they consist of zzso lineages and lack effective genetic zzso they are characterized by some level of genetic zzso To reveal the zzso contribution to overall genetic zzso the most straightforward and conclusive way is the direct detection of zzso events in pedigree zzso Earlier we selected from zzso library of zzso zzso two zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso In this study, these two zzso were analyzed to detect possible de zzso zzso in zzso zzso offspring of 49 zzso zzso mothers and in 147 offspring of 50 zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso offspring at both zzso and in zzso zzso offspring at the zzso zzso There were a total of seven zzso events in the germ lines of four of the 49 zzso zzso mothers at the zzso zzso yielding the zzso rate of zzso events per germ line zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has shown that most zzso occur via deletion or zzso of single zzso repeat being identical in all offspring of the zzso This indicates that such zzso emerge at the early stages of zzso In this study we characterized single highly unstable zzso containing locus in zzso zzso species zzso zzso Besides, we characterized various types of zzso zzso of this locus found in the zzso zzso offspring of the first zzso Our data has shown that zzso zzso at highly unstable zzso can make a significant contribution to population zzso of zzso zzso
