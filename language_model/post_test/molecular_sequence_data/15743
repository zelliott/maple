zzso is an zzso protein that forms the zzso complex with zzso and zzso to constitute an zzso zzso for zzso zzso and degradation of the zzso are critical for zzso entry to the cell cycle, and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso have been clearly associated with zzso although the functional significance of the latter is still zzso Here we show that zzso zzso B zzso interacts with and directly zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso by zzso triggers zzso complex formation and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso is drastically impaired in its ability to promote cell proliferation and zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso triggers zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and we attribute a specific role to zzso zzso in the positive regulation of cell zzso Finally, we demonstrate that high levels of zzso of zzso correlate with the zzso zzso of zzso in human cancer zzso Our results therefore define a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso
