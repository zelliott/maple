The literature as well as databases are ambiguous about the exact start of human zzso zzso possibilities for the initiation of the mature protein are zzso These three zzso of zzso different in the exact initiation of the mature protein zzso zzso or zzso were expressed in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence instead of the zzso zzso zzso All three zzso zzso were zzso but the processing by the zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso showed correctly processed material but also a zzso species of higher molecular weight indicating incomplete processing of the zzso pro zzso zzso did not yield any correctly processed zzso instead only the zzso pro form was found in the culture zzso Only zzso led to zzso correctly processed zzso zzso sequencing of this material revealed a start at zzso the first two zzso acids zzso have been removed by a so far unknown zzso Thus expression of both zzso and zzso as zzso zzso fusion proteins resulted in the very same mature zzso however, the ratio of correctly processed molecules was significantly higher in the case of zzso The expression of an zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso leads to about 50% correctly processed molecules and 50% zzso forms which contain part of the pro zzso at the zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso between the pro zzso and the start of the mature zzso led to correct processing and elimination of all high molecular weight zzso observed in earlier zzso
