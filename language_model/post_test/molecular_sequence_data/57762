The role of zzso proteins zzso in zzso was examined in the budding zzso zzso zzso and in the fruit fly zzso zzso In zzso cells, the major protein responsible for zzso is zzso zzso In cells carrying zzso in the zzso 100 zzso zzso 104, growth is normal at both high and low temperatures, but the ability of cells to survive extreme temperatures is severely zzso The loss of zzso is apparently due to the absence of the zzso 104 protein itself because, with the exception of the zzso 104 zzso no differences in protein profiles were observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso found in zzso cells at high temperatures suggest that the cause of death may be the zzso of zzso zzso No differences in the rates of protein degradation were observed between zzso and zzso zzso This, and genetic analysis of cells carrying multiple zzso 70 and zzso 104 zzso suggests that the primary function of zzso 104 is to rescue proteins from zzso rather than to degrade them once they have been zzso zzso cells do not produce a protein in the zzso 100 class in response to high zzso In this zzso zzso 70 appears to be the primary protein involved in zzso Thus, the relative importance of different zzso in zzso changes from zzso to zzso
