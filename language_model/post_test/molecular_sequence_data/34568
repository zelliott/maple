zzso head blight zzso caused by zzso zzso is a destructive disease of wheat and zzso It causes economic losses due to reduction in both yield and zzso Although zzso resistance has been well documented and resistant zzso have been developed to reduce zzso and severity of zzso there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in plant resistance against the infection and spread of zzso zzso In the current study, zzso displays of proteins extracted from wheat zzso infected with zzso zzso were compared with those from zzso zzso with sterile zzso Fifteen protein spots were detected that were either induced zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso infection of zzso of zzso a resistant zzso These proteins were identified by zzso zzso zzso with an zzso function such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso or induced 5 d after zzso with zzso zzso indicating an zzso burst of zzso inside the zzso infected by zzso An zzso cycle is likely involved in reduction of zzso zzso of proteins with highest similarity to zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso differed following zzso infection in susceptible and resistant zzso A zzso protein zzso was also zzso in zzso zzso In addition, a zzso protein zzso 3 zzso was zzso in zzso zzso which is in zzso with a previous study that analyzed transcript zzso
