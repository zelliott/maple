The complement proteins zzso and C4 have an internal zzso Upon zzso on the surface of a target cell, the zzso becomes exposed and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso groups, thus allowing zzso deposition of zzso and C4 on these zzso The two human C4 zzso zzso and zzso which differ by only four zzso zzso have different binding zzso zzso binds more efficiently than zzso to zzso groups, and zzso is more effective than zzso in binding to zzso zzso By zzso zzso the four zzso in a zzso clone of zzso were zzso The zzso were expressed and their binding properties zzso zzso with a zzso zzso at position zzso showed zzso binding properties, and those with zzso acid, zzso or zzso at the same position were zzso These results suggest that the zzso is important in catalyzing the reaction of the zzso with water and other zzso zzso zzso When zzso with other zzso zzso this reaction is not zzso and the zzso becomes apparently more zzso with zzso zzso This interpretation also predicts that the stability of the zzso in zzso and zzso upon zzso will be zzso We measured the time course of zzso and binding of zzso to zzso and zzso The lag in the binding curve behind the zzso curve for zzso is significantly greater than that for zzso The zzso rates zzso of the zzso in the activated proteins were estimated to be zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso These results indicate that the difference in zzso rate of the zzso accounts, at least in part, for the difference in the binding properties of zzso and zzso
