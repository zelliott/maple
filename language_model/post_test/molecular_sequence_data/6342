T cells zzso zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso are thought to represent a local host response to the zzso However, tumor progression in the presence of this T cell zzso suggests that the zzso may be functionally zzso To address this issue we determined whether response to stimulation of zzso from 25 patients with NHL through the T cell zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was intact, since zzso of these receptors is important for proliferation and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate defects in response to stimulation via zzso and the zzso in zzso cells from patients with NHL that were not observed with T cells from the peripheral zzso zzso showed minimal proliferation to zzso and only modest proliferation to zzso alone or when combined with zzso Moreover, zzso production in zzso was impaired since stimulation through the zzso complex did not induce zzso for zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The functional zzso of these cells may be linked to altered zzso through the zzso since an abnormal zzso zzso pattern was detected in zzso after stimulation with zzso
