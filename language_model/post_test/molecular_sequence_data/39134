The mouse has become the premier zzso system for the identification of the genetic basis of both zzso and zzso disorders, as well as the understanding of complex diseases with zzso and zzso zzso The similarity between human and mouse genetic disease is sometimes striking, while in other cases the zzso are less zzso The ability to genetically map and then clone single gene disorders zzso and the emerging technologies that will allow the economical identification of the zzso controlling quantitative traits further demonstrate the utility of the mouse as a model for gene zzso Additionally, the ability to genetically manipulate the mouse through zzso and gene targeting allows for the testing of hypotheses regarding specific gene function and their role in zzso The utility of the mouse extends beyond being just a gene discovery tool to provide zzso zzso It can also be used for the development of animal models, and the testing of compounds in specifically constructed transgenic and knockout strains to further define the target and zzso of a therapeutic zzso
