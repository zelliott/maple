In this study we mapped the zzso domain of human zzso protein zzso and characterized its zzso zzso zzso zzso competition zzso demonstrated preferential binding of zzso to zzso and zzso but not to zzso The zzso zzso is bound with high affinity whereas zzso zzso or zzso show low affinity to zzso Furthermore, zzso binds to zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso mapping showed that the zzso domain of zzso is represented by an zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is reminiscent of the zzso motif zzso found in one family of zzso zzso The isolated zzso domain is capable of zzso binding to the zzso element zzso of human zzso virus type 1 in zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated a zzso and zzso zzso transition of a synthetic zzso carrying the zzso zzso domain of protein zzso zzso carrying a zzso that destroys the zzso zzso do not bind zzso
