zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso lining of blood vessels is critical for tumor cells to grow at original or zzso zzso zzso of tumor cell zzso can be an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the zzso of certain tumor zzso However, no data exist on how inclusion of the zzso motif in the zzso sequence influences tumor cell zzso and subsequent zzso In this study, in zzso and in zzso zzso were used to evaluate how a panel of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso motif influenced zzso of zzso melanoma zzso The results showed that a zzso zzso named zzso containing the zzso motif and a full zzso modification backbone could inhibit zzso melanoma cell zzso on a culture plate or on a plate coated with various zzso In zzso data revealed that zzso melanoma cells zzso with zzso and zzso injected into mice formed fewer tumor colonies in zzso zzso This effect was related to the zzso motif and the full zzso modification backbone and enhanced by the existence of the zzso zzso Additional in zzso data showed that survival of zzso mice in the zzso group was significantly zzso subcutaneous melanoma developed much more slowly, and lung dissemination colonies formed much less often than in mice zzso with zzso melanoma cells zzso The effect was zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may exert an integrated zzso zzso
