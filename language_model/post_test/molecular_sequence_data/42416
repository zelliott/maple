zzso of zzso by various inflammatory stimuli has been shown to play a pivotal role in septic and zzso tissue zzso To further zzso the mechanisms modulating the zzso zzso we assessed zzso production induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso receptors of human zzso on several days during zzso and after zzso zzso of septic patients isolated on days zzso after the diagnosis of zzso showed a zzso more than twofold increase in specific binding of zzso at 1, zzso and 240 zzso zzso plot analyses revealed that this increase in specific binding was due to an increase in the number of low- and zzso zzso receptors with no changes in zzso zzso On days zzso after the onset of zzso the zzso of zzso receptors on circulating zzso was followed by zzso zzso Likewise, zzso from patients with trauma that was not complicated by zzso bound significantly more zzso than zzso from zzso However, the increase in zzso receptors was less than that in septic zzso and returned earlier to zzso In accordance with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso obtained from patients with zzso or after trauma on days zzso and days zzso respectively, produced significantly more zzso zzso upon stimulation with zzso However, after stimulation with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of protein zzso C, these cells released less zzso zzso than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
