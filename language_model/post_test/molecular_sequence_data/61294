All flowering plants produce zzso zzso from Met and have a separate mechanism to convert zzso back to zzso The functions of zzso and the reasons for its zzso with Met are not zzso In this study, by using the zzso zzso collection method together with mass spectral and zzso zzso we established that zzso is a major constituent of the zzso sap moving to wheat zzso The zzso level in the zzso ( approximately zzso of free zzso zzso was zzso that of zzso indicating that zzso could contribute approximately half the sulfur needed for grain protein zzso Similarly, zzso was a prominently labeled product in zzso zzso obtained by zzso treatment of detached leaves from plants of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were given zzso zzso clones for the zzso that zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences revealed the expected zzso domain ( approximately 300 zzso at the N zzso plus an zzso zzso region sharing significant similarity with zzso and other zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has a previously zzso but often major role in sulfur transport in flowering plants and that evolution of zzso synthesis in this group involved a gene fusion zzso The resulting zzso zzso is unlike any other known zzso
