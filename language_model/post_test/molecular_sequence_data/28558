The effects of zzso zzso and related compounds occur via the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a member of the basic zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A single zzso gene has been identified in zzso whereas many fish species, including the Atlantic zzso zzso zzso possess two distinct zzso genes zzso and a novel form, zzso A mouse zzso protein closely related to zzso and designated zzso zzso zzso is induced by zzso and zzso the zzso activity of the zzso To determine whether zzso is the zzso zzso of fish zzso and to investigate the mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso function, we cloned an zzso zzso in zzso zzso with high sequence identity to the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso We show that in zzso expressed zzso proteins from human, zzso and zzso all fail to bind zzso or zzso In transient zzso experiments using a zzso reporter gene under control of zzso response zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso function of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso or zzso zzso but its expression is not altered in a population of fish exhibiting genetic resistance to these zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter contains three putative zzso response zzso Both zzso and zzso activated zzso of zzso driven by the zzso promoter, and zzso could repress its own zzso Thus, zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso and zzso are distinct zzso members of an zzso gene family; these three zzso zzso genes descended from a single zzso zzso
