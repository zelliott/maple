An zzso zzso against the protein product of the zzso zzso gene was used to select an enriched library of zzso target zzso zzso DNA was zzso by zzso zzso using zzso zzso from zzso of mouse zzso at zzso day zzso zzso was done by colony zzso with zzso zzso filter zzso zzso and gel mobility shift zzso zzso sequencing identified a 910 zzso DNA fragment, containing a consensus zzso binding site, and identical in 640 zzso at 3' end of the clone to the promoter of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso zzso Rose, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments were performed to see if a correlation could be found between the expression patterns the zzso and the zzso zzso Using a 120 zzso zzso zzso as probe, zzso expression was detected mainly in the zzso of 15 day mouse zzso a pattern which is similar to that of the zzso gene at this stage zzso zzso Holland, zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso 25 zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso In conclusion, data presented here suggest that the zzso gene is a candidate target of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
