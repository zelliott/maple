To establish a renewable source of zzso zzso zzso for diagnostic tests, gene sequences for the viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned into zzso expression zzso and the zzso viruses used to zzso zzso insect zzso Cell zzso examined by zzso demonstrated zzso proteins corresponding to the expected sizes of native zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was produced efficiently in quantity and zzso into empty zzso as shown by density zzso in a zzso step zzso The zzso protein was zzso and used as an zzso in zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared to a standard zzso zzso based on whole viral zzso the zzso gave a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso in detection of zzso zzso in 138 patients suspected of zzso zzso No zzso specimens were zzso zzso detection yielded a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed in zzso insect cells can substitute for zzso zzso virus in standard zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso and zzso with comparable zzso
