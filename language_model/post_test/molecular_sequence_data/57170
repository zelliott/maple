A DNA zzso called DNA zzso zzso was zzso from zzso cells to apparent zzso The zzso and its zzso zzso zzso activities zzso in zzso zzso with two zzso of 110 and 90 zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The DNA zzso was markedly zzso by DNA zzso with a zzso zzso A DNA zzso with a zzso fork structure was less zzso although it was more active than zzso without a zzso The zzso of unwinding is zzso with respect to the zzso DNA to which the zzso was zzso The zzso activity also required a zzso zzso protein zzso for unwinding zzso The stimulation by zzso was zzso all zzso tested, such as human zzso zzso T4 gene 32, and zzso coli zzso zzso the DNA zzso activity to a varying extent in the presence of a fork zzso With long duplex zzso zzso 500 base zzso the presence of a fork substantially zzso the DNA zzso activity in the presence of zzso coli zzso Human zzso zzso the DNA zzso activity to the greatest extent zzso zzso with a zzso containing a fork compared with zzso without a zzso DNA zzso activity required zzso zzso and could be supported by all eight zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso in unwinding were 28 and 48 zzso zzso In general, zzso zzso were better zzso than zzso zzso The properties of this DNA zzso make it a candidate for a DNA zzso zzso in human zzso
