The zzso gene of zzso coli was recently identified on the basis of its ability to complement the only zzso requiring zzso acid for growth that had been described to date: strain zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso van zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report experiments of zzso zzso of the zzso gene which demonstrate that this gene is essential for the zzso of zzso acid, one of the specific components of cell wall zzso A special strategy was used for the construction of strains with a disrupted copy of zzso because of a limited capability of zzso coli strains grown in rich medium to zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene product was zzso and identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso (the zzso gene zzso catalyzing the subsequent step in the zzso for zzso zzso appears to be an zzso of the zzso zzso
