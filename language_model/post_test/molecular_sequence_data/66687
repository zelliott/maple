The zzso of zzso C virus zzso particles is considered to be composed of the mature form zzso of core zzso zzso to zzso involves zzso of the zzso domain of the precursor form zzso of core protein by signal zzso zzso zzso a cellular zzso embedded in the zzso zzso zzso Here we have addressed whether zzso maturation to zzso is a prerequisite for zzso particle zzso in the zzso zzso zzso structural proteins were expressed by using zzso zzso Forest virus zzso in zzso cells or zzso zzso in insect cells, because these systems have been shown to allow the zzso of zzso budding events and the isolation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of core protein by either an zzso inhibitor or zzso core zzso not only did not prevent but instead tended to facilitate the observation of viral buds and the recovery of zzso zzso zzso although maturation to zzso was only partially inhibited by zzso in insect cells, zzso was the only form of core protein found in zzso zzso Finally, newly developed zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso are more stable than zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso of core protein is zzso for zzso budding but decreases the stability of the viral zzso We propose a model in which zzso is the form of zzso core protein committed to virus zzso and zzso by zzso occurs during and/or after virus budding to zzso the zzso to subsequent zzso in a new zzso
