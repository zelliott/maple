zzso are a family of zzso adhesive proteins that are widely expressed in zzso Five distinct gene products, designated zzso through zzso and cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso have been zzso With the exception of zzso the structure and location of zzso genes have been determined in the human and/or mouse zzso In this study, the structure and location of the zzso zzso gene and the location of the human zzso gene are zzso The zzso zzso gene is approximately zzso zzso in length and includes 22 zzso zzso zzso analysis of progeny derived from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice indicates that the zzso gene is tightly linked to the zzso locus on zzso zzso zzso zzso The human gene maps to zzso 5 in band zzso by in zzso zzso to human zzso zzso The zzso promoter is similar to promoters of some zzso growth control, and other zzso genes in that it contains multiple zzso box sequences and lacks a zzso zzso The presence of multiple zzso sequence motifs is consistent with zzso expression in muscle and bone zzso
