We describe a new plant zzso DNA zzso virus, a zzso isolate originating from the zzso bean in zzso We applied rolling circle amplification zzso to extensively copy the individual circular zzso of the zzso zzso By sequence analyses of more than 208 individually cloned zzso zzso we obtained a representative sample of eight zzso swarms of circular zzso each about 1 zzso in zzso From these zzso DNA populations after zzso we zzso consensus sequences of the eight DNA components of the virus zzso Based on the distinctive molecular and biological properties of the virus, we propose to consider it a new species of the zzso zzso and to name it zzso bean zzso stunt virus zzso zzso a representative clone of each of the eight zzso for transfer by zzso plasmids of zzso zzso into zzso zzso plants, we zzso the development of the typical zzso disease zzso Moreover, we showed that the virus thus produced was readily transmitted by two different zzso zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso This represents the first zzso of a fully infectious and zzso zzso zzso from its cloned zzso and provides compelling evidence that the zzso of a zzso zzso is typically comprised of eight distinct DNA zzso
