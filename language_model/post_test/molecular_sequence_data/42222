zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso zzso One class was deficient in zzso nitrate zzso activity but retained a zzso nitrate zzso zzso Using zzso marker rescue it was shown that in one such zzso zzso the zzso was inserted in the zzso nitrate zzso beta zzso structural gene zzso zzso in order to be consistent with the nomenclature of the zzso coli major nitrate zzso zzso The translated sequence zzso of 106 zzso zzso from around the point of zzso zzso showed approximately zzso zzso acid identity with the beta zzso of the zzso coli nitrate zzso Under zzso growth conditions zzso zzso the zzso nitrate zzso activity allowing zzso growth with nitrate as electron zzso A regulatory link was zzso between the presence of the zzso nitrate zzso and expression of the zzso nitrate zzso This is the first demonstration of full zzso in an zzso possessing only a zzso nitrate zzso
