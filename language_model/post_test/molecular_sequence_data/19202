The aim of this work was to shed some more light on factors influencing the effectiveness of delta zzso zzso of structured zzso zzso An zzso that zzso to the zzso region X of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as representative zzso zzso Only a few sites susceptible to zzso zzso were identified in these targets using a zzso library of zzso zzso in which the region responsible for zzso interaction was zzso On the other hand, the targets were fairly accessible for binding of complementary zzso as was shown by zzso DNA libraries and zzso H zzso Moreover, the specifically acting zzso zzso the targets precisely but with unexpectedly modest zzso To explain these zzso six model zzso molecules were zzso in which the same seven zzso long sequence recognized by the delta zzso was always single stranded but was embedded into different zzso structural zzso These molecules were zzso with differentiated rates, and the corresponding zzso values were in the range of zzso zzso thus they differed almost zzso This clearly shows that zzso of structured zzso might be much slower than zzso of a short zzso zzso despite full accessibility of the targeted regions for zzso zzso possibilities of zzso zzso which are necessary to occur on the zzso reaction zzso seem to be responsible for these zzso Their zzso which was evaluated in this work, should be taken into account while considering the use of delta zzso for practical zzso
