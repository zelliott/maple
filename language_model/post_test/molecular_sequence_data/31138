Four independent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected to characterize their zzso zzso acid analysis of zzso K and zzso K zzso peptides appeared to suggest that the zzso recognized by zzso zzso and zzso is located in the zzso 44 peptides of zzso and that of zzso and zzso is located in the zzso 69 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with two synthetic peptides indicated that zzso recognized an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and could be distinguished from zzso which recognized an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The differential zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso itself, was characterized by the particularly high zzso of zzso and almost no zzso of zzso with the natural zzso of zzso in zzso This may be explained by differences in the zzso zzso of their zzso The zzso zzso was useful for zzso of zzso in zzso while zzso was found to be most suitable for zzso zzso of tumor zzso
