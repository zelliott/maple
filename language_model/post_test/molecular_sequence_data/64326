A zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a tidal flat in zzso This zzso grew well at zzso degrees C, with optimum growth at 30 degrees zzso zzso zzso grew zzso in the presence of 2 % zzso it did not grow without zzso or in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso simultaneously contained both zzso and zzso as zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The major fatty acids in strain zzso were zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was 42 zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso sequences showed that strain zzso falls within the radiation of the cluster that is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence similarity between strain zzso and the type strains of zzso species were zzso zzso On the basis of zzso properties and zzso data, strain zzso should be placed in the zzso zzso as a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
