Using an elaborate set of zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene displays a dynamic pattern of gene expression during zzso The zzso portion of the zzso protein is processed to generate a zzso signaling zzso belonging to the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso This zzso the zzso zzso is able to influence the zzso fates of responsive cells in a zzso zzso Here we examine the sequence level organization of a significant portion of the zzso locus in zzso zzso and use zzso comparisons with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to explore the molecular evolution of the zzso Our zzso analysis identified significant selective constraint on both the zzso and zzso acid zzso As expected, zzso comparison of protein coding sequences shows that the zzso zzso region is highly zzso However, the central portion of the protein is also zzso while the zzso third is quite zzso zzso of zzso regions reveals significant stretches of zzso identity in the 3' untranslated portion of zzso 3 and in the zzso between zzso 2 and zzso An examination of zzso sequences representing five classes of zzso transcripts indicates that these transcripts zzso the same zzso
