The human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso a set of cellular genes that regulate cellular growth and zzso We describe two lines of evidence that zzso repression does not require cellular protein synthesis but instead involves direct interaction with a cellular zzso First, zzso zzso protein zzso an zzso promoter in the presence of zzso of protein zzso as shown by cell zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso protein strongly zzso zzso in zzso from promoters of the zzso zzso human zzso and rat insulin type zzso zzso in zzso is zzso and an zzso zzso containing only the zzso 80 zzso is sufficient for strong repression both in zzso and in zzso By use of a series of zzso zzso deletion zzso the zzso repression function was found to require two zzso sequence zzso one within the zzso zzso N zzso and the second within a portion of zzso region 1 zzso These zzso have been reported to possess binding sites for several cellular zzso regulators, including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso The in zzso zzso system described here provides a powerful tool for the further analysis of molecular mechanism and the possible role of these cellular zzso
