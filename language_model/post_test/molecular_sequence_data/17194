zzso experiments are conducted to test whether a zzso zzso zzso folds so quickly that the process is no longer limited by a zzso zzso This protein is very stable and zzso simple, needing merely to zzso zzso while having an zzso folding rate of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso These properties make it likely to attain the elusive zzso zzso limit, at which a series of zzso can be zzso To measure the zzso zzso in the absence of zzso we apply zzso and zzso zzso The stability and its zzso dependence for the hydrogen bonds in the central part of protein equal the values calculated for zzso zzso zzso their closing and opening rates indicate that these hydrogen bonds are broken and reformed in a single cooperative event representing the folding transition from the fully unfolded state to the native zzso Additionally, closing rates for these hydrogen bonds agree with the zzso zzso folding rate observed near the melting zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso where zzso approximately zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso approximately 6 zzso folding remains cooperative and zzso Given that this prime candidate for downhill folding fails to do so, we propose that protein folding will remain zzso for proteins that fold zzso
