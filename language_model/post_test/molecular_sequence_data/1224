The zzso gene correlated with fertility transformation in the zzso sensitive zzso male sterile rice zzso zzso zzso zzso a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to amplify a zzso about zzso zzso in zzso upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel mobility shift zzso characterized two fragments zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso promoter that could be involved in its zzso zzso When these two deletion fragments were used as probe respectively, a retarded band appeared in the nuclear extracts of fertile zzso rice under short day zzso Whereas no retarded band was shown in the nuclear extracts of sterile zzso rice under long day zzso Competition zzso indicated that the factors in the retarded bands binding to these two fragments were the same zzso factor zzso rice factor, zzso The binding affinity of zzso was affected by zzso and was higher in zzso rice than that of zzso zzso
