Recent studies have shown that DNA zzso goes through the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso However, it is still unclear how the target regions for zzso are distinguished within their zzso zzso Here we show that the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has the ability to direct local zzso around its binding sites, the zzso response elements zzso during zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of the differentiation process that forms a zzso zzso complex on zzso and activates the expression of zzso zzso The complex is zzso zzso on zzso and zzso proteins zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso locally by their ability to bind to the zzso zzso thereby inducing zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that a zzso zzso factor complex can, through its zzso zzso serve for zzso proteins as a landmark to identify sites of DNA zzso
