zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder associated with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the molecular zzso present in the zzso genes of zzso patients have previously been determined in several Slavic zzso little is known regarding the molecular basis of zzso in the zzso populations of the former Soviet zzso zzso card samples from zzso classical zzso patients residing in the zzso Republic were examined by a combination of zzso zzso gel zzso and direct sequence zzso Twelve patients were of zzso zzso five were of Russian zzso and four were of mixed zzso and Russian zzso Two of the zzso patients were zzso sharing one zzso zzso The single major zzso identified in this study was zzso zzso zzso 3, which was present on zzso or zzso of all zzso zzso of Slavic origin, but on only zzso or zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso This result suggests that this zzso was introduced into central Asian populations during the eastward expansion of zzso across the zzso zzso A significant influence of zzso peoples on zzso can be zzso from the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c and zzso all of which are relatively common among Turks or have been observed in Mediterranean zzso Together, these zzso are present on zzso or zzso of all zzso zzso in ethnic zzso Surprisingly, the common zzso zzso zzso zzso a was also present in zzso as was the delta zzso zzso found previously only in zzso Thus, some direct or indirect gene flow from zzso into zzso seems zzso Finally, the complete absence of zzso zzso previously observed in Oriental populations suggests that there was little gene flow into zzso from Eastern zzso
