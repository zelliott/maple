We have used zzso zzso and zzso as representative ring zzso products resulting from zzso interaction with DNA zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso as models for zzso fragmentation zzso We have shown that zzso zzso and the zzso products zzso and zzso acid, as well as zzso sites, are strong blocks to DNA zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso is not a block to any of the zzso zzso For zzso zzso termination sites were observed opposite the putative zzso whereas for the zzso products, the termination sites were primarily one base prior to the zzso These and other data have suggested that zzso zzso codes for an A, and that a base is zzso inserted opposite the damage, whereas when a base is inserted opposite the zzso zzso it is removed by the zzso zzso activity of DNA zzso zzso Despite their efficiency as blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso at low frequency in certain specific sequence zzso When the model zzso were introduced individually into zzso biologically active DNA, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso sites were all lethal zzso having an zzso efficiency of 1, whereas zzso was zzso Thus the in zzso studies predicted the in zzso zzso When the survival of biologically active zzso DNA was examined in zzso zzso coli cells where the block to replication was released, no increase in survival was observed for DNA containing zzso or zzso sites, suggesting inefficient bypass of these zzso In contrast, zzso acid survival was slightly zzso and zzso DNA containing zzso zzso was significantly zzso When zzso induction by unique zzso was measured using zzso hybrid DNA containing an zzso coli target zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be inefficient as zzso zzso suggesting that in zzso as in zzso they primarily code for zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso acid were efficient zzso zzso with zzso acid being about zzso more effective than zzso zzso which have approximately the same rate of zzso induction as zzso sites from zzso zzso analysis of the zzso resulting from these zzso products shows that the zzso produced are both zzso and sequence context zzso The possible roles that bypass efficiency and zzso zzso might play in zzso are zzso
