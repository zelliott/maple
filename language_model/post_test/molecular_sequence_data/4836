In humans, the 30,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso is a dominant zzso zzso of the zzso blood group zzso To date, an zzso protein has been found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Related to the 30,000 zzso zzso zzso protein are two zzso of 50,000 zzso the human 50,000 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein from zzso zzso The function of all these proteins is not sufficiently zzso Here we characterize a zzso clone zzso zzso a putative 57,000 zzso zzso from the marine sponge zzso zzso which shares sequence similarity both to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The sponge zzso protein comprises 523 zzso zzso zzso analysis hints at the presence of ten zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso signal sequence is missing, suggesting that the first zzso domain of the sponge zzso protein acts as a zzso zzso The sponge zzso zzso like the human zzso lacks the zzso motif which is characteristic of the 30,000 zzso zzso In addition, the zzso profile of the sponge zzso protein is of a similar size and shape as that of human zzso This data indicates that the zzso and its structurally related zzso zzso which are highly zzso in humans, share a common ancestral zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
