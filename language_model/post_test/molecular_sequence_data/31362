An A to G transition zzso at zzso pair zzso in human zzso DNA zzso has been identified as the cause of zzso The zzso alters the T zzso C loop of the zzso gene and creates a zzso restriction site, providing a simple molecular diagnostic test for the zzso This zzso was present in three independent zzso zzso and absent in 75 controls, altered a zzso zzso and was zzso All zzso patients and their zzso maternal relatives had between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and showed an age-related association between zzso and zzso This suggests that a small percentage of normal zzso has a large protective effect on zzso This zzso provides molecular confirmation that some forms of zzso are the result of deficiencies in zzso energy zzso
