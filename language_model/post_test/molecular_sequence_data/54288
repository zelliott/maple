The main objective of this study was to identify the genes causing zzso in a rice zzso the zzso of which were zzso Three populations were employed to map the genes for zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso was controlled by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were fine mapped to an approximately zzso region and an approximately zzso region on the short arms of zzso 11 and 12, zzso Both regions were within the duplicated segments on zzso 11 and zzso They possessed a highly similar sequence of 38 zzso at the locations of a pair of duplicated genes with protein sequences very similar to that of zzso in zzso that are required for the processing of zzso zzso These genes are likely the candidates for zzso and zzso zzso profiling was used to compare the expression patterns of zzso in the duplicated zzso zzso profiling indicated that the duplicated segments had been undergone concerted evolution, and a large number of the zzso within the duplicated segments were functionally redundant like zzso and zzso
