The strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso to zzso from complex culture broth by a novel, rapid and simple three-step protocol including zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the only zzso step zzso The molecular mass of the zzso was determined to be zzso Da by zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing identified 35 zzso acid zzso as being identical to the zzso sequence of zzso A, a zzso from another zzso zzso zzso These zzso strains produce zzso that display small differences in molecular mass and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso shared significant zzso with zzso X, one of the two zzso peptides produced by zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso preparation permitted confirmation of the zzso spectrum previously established with a crude zzso It displayed a zzso mode of action on zzso after an extremely rapid zzso to the target zzso Two zzso zzso were only zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be produced zzso Ethanol not only zzso specific zzso production but also prevented zzso of the zzso molecules to the producer cells upon prolonged zzso The latter result supports the hypothesis that the apparent zzso of zzso observed during the stationary phase of batch zzso is due to zzso
