zzso human zzso growth factor I zzso is efficiently expressed and zzso from zzso zzso using a zzso zzso leader to direct zzso However, approximately zzso of the zzso was in a zzso form, the remaining materials being zzso zzso When the zzso material was subjected to zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso it gave two zzso peaks, I and zzso Upon reduction, zzso zzso I and II zzso to one zzso zzso This suggests that zzso I and II result from different zzso structures, and the zzso feature of each peak results from other zzso Different zzso structures between zzso I and II were also suggested from the near zzso circular zzso of these zzso Only the peak II was biologically active, indicating that peak II has the correct zzso zzso zzso A affinity zzso of the zzso peak II zzso showed binding of the zzso with an earlier zzso retention time, indicating that it was zzso zzso analysis of zzso peptides suggested that zzso was the site of zzso zzso zzso was used to convert zzso to zzso This substitution reduced, but did not eliminate zzso zzso suggesting additional zzso zzso The site of zzso addition was consistent with the model that zzso occur on zzso zzso acids near zzso zzso in zzso
