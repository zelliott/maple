zzso acid zzso zzso is zzso as a type I membrane zzso and targeted to zzso via the plasma zzso Its zzso tail zzso a zzso signal for rapid zzso zzso in zzso canine kidney cells results in direct sorting to the zzso cell surface, rapid zzso and delivery to zzso In contrast, a deletion zzso lacking the zzso tail is delivered to the zzso plasma membrane where it accumulates before it is slowly zzso A zzso zzso in which the zzso tail of zzso is fused to the zzso and zzso domain of the zzso sorted zzso is sorted to the zzso plasma zzso A series of zzso and substitution zzso in the zzso tail was constructed and comparison of their polarized sorting and zzso revealed that the zzso for zzso sorting and rapid zzso reside in the same segment of the zzso zzso The zzso factors decoding these signals, however, tolerate distinct zzso indicating that different receptors are involved in sorting at the zzso network and at the plasma zzso
