zzso of split zzso is one of the zzso zzso of zzso and, as such, is required for normal segregation of neural and zzso cell zzso zzso observations indicate that the zzso locus is in fact a gene complex zzso a cluster of related genes and that other genes of the region are also required for normal early zzso Three of the genes of the complex were known to zzso zzso zzso proteins and to be transcribed in nearly identical zzso Here, we show that four other genes in the vicinity also zzso zzso proteins and, during zzso zzso three of them are expressed in the same zzso We show by zzso transformation that these three genes are also necessary to allow zzso development of the zzso zzso
