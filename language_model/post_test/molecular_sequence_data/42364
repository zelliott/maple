zzso zzso is a zzso zzso specific inhibitor of zzso zzso an zzso involved in the metabolism of zzso peptides including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The observation that this inhibitor causes a pronounced decrease in blood pressure after intravenous infusion into zzso rats posed the question of the mechanism of this zzso zzso It was suggested previously that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso converting zzso zzso and that this function can account for the zzso response to the zzso We present here evidence that zzso has no intrinsic zzso zzso The previously observed zzso is shown to be dependent on zzso of the zzso bond in the inhibitor by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a contaminant of some zzso zzso
