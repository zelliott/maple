The full-length zzso of zzso segment A of three infectious zzso disease zzso two attenuated strains zzso and zzso and one virulent field strain zzso was amplified in a single step by reverse zzso chain reaction, cloned into zzso Easy zzso and zzso The full length of cloned segment A contains zzso zzso which includes two partially overlapping open reading fragments zzso zzso and zzso flanked by zzso and 3' zzso zzso These strains shared high sequence identity with each other either at the zzso or deduced zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highly related to two attenuated zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso was closely related to two other virulent zzso zzso and zzso zzso of four zzso acids at positions zzso 279, zzso and zzso a common feature of attenuated and most virulent zzso were also observed in these three zzso Two major zzso zzso were zzso in the three zzso however, there are two zzso acid zzso at positions 280 (N to zzso and 290 zzso to zzso in the second minor zzso peak for all three zzso which might have a critical influence on zzso Two zzso acid zzso near the zzso zzso site were identified in virulent strain zzso which might be involved in increasing the zzso of the zzso zzso analyses indicated that these three Chinese strains are most closely related to some European virulent strains but are distinct from very virulent infectious zzso disease virus and zzso zzso
