The relative zzso of zzso and a complex mixture of zzso aromatic zzso zzso produced as zzso of manufactured gas plant zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity were determined in the zzso zzso The zzso values for the induction response were 78 and 65 zzso for zzso and the zzso mixture, zzso Analysis of the zzso mixture indicated that zzso and other compounds containing four or more rings and which are known to induce zzso activity were only present as trace components of this zzso A comparison of the zzso induction zzso of zzso and the zzso mixture showed that the mixture was approximately zzso times more potent than expected based on its zzso content zzso This induced zzso activity could significantly increase the metabolism of the zzso zzso and thereby zzso the overall zzso of the zzso The apparent synergistic activity of the zzso mixture was further investigated by comparing the activities of this mixture and zzso for several other zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso responses including zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso levels, zzso transformation of the rat zzso zzso zzso to a complex which binds to a zzso responsive element, zzso induction of zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells, and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cell zzso response to both T zzso and independent zzso in zzso zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso induction and zzso transformation activities and zzso effects, the zzso mixture was approximately zzso times more potent as an zzso zzso zzso than expected based on its zzso zzso The synergistic activity was lower zzso for the zzso response in zzso zzso The reason for the synergistic effects of the zzso mixture were not due to contamination of the mixture by zzso and related compounds and the results suggest that the enhanced potency of the mixture is due to unknown interactions between the individual zzso present in the zzso
