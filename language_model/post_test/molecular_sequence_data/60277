The rate of conversion of zzso zzso to the zzso product zzso zzso is a key factor in zzso We have developed methods to zzso zzso zzso and soluble and zzso zzso products during the tissue factor induced zzso of whole zzso zzso zzso generation zzso occurs prior to visible zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso with factor zzso zzso At this time zzso is mostly in solution along with high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso of zzso is virtually complete (5 zzso prior to the release of zzso a process that does not occur until after zzso zzso zzso is detected still attached to the zzso throughout the time course demonstrating release of only low levels of zzso from the zzso After release of zzso a zzso zzso removes the zzso zzso resulting exclusively in zzso zzso by the zzso time zzso This process is inhibited by zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso are activated simultaneously with zzso zzso The initial zzso is a composite of zzso I and zzso already displaying zzso zzso prior to the formation of zzso II with zzso remaining mostly intact followed by the selective degradation of zzso to zzso zzso
