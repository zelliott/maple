zzso zzso channels zzso are zzso zzso channels that are members of the zzso zzso zzso family and are zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso in the central nervous system have a zzso role in synaptic transmission and are involved in cell injury induced by zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso function is regulated by zzso zzso We provide here evidence that this regulation of zzso function is tightly linked to channel zzso zzso zzso zzso with a similar time course as it changes zzso function, whereas zzso whose function is not modified by zzso is not zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso part of the zzso loop, between a highly zzso sequence and a sequence that is critical for zzso zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This channel domain controls the zzso zzso and zzso the pH dependence of zzso zzso It zzso a zzso change during zzso which renders the zzso site zzso to zzso in zzso zzso
