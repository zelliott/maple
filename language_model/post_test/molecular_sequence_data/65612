The presence of zzso and zzso in adrenal tumors and their role in adrenal zzso has never been investigated, even though the adrenal zzso seems to be a preferential site of infection by these viruses and adrenal steroid hormones have been shown to activate their zzso We examined in a large series of normal adrenal zzso zzso zzso and adrenal tumors zzso the presence of zzso and zzso sequences and gene zzso which were detected in a high proportion of both normal and zzso adrenal samples zzso viruses were found in zzso normal zzso zzso benign adrenal tumors and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and BK virus were more frequently found in zzso adrenal tumors, whereas zzso especially zzso virus and human zzso were more frequently detected in functioning benign zzso tumors, often as zzso Moreover, tumors from patients with severe zzso frequently showed zzso zzso at high viral zzso copy zzso Our study suggests that the adrenal zzso could be a zzso of infection for these viruses and that hormone overproduction by the adrenal zzso could represent a trigger for virus zzso On the other hand, these viruses could also contribute to adrenal cell proliferation and zzso
