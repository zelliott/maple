The entire zzso zzso cluster zzso gene zzso from the producer zzso zzso zzso was identified on six overlapping zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In total, zzso zzso of DNA from these zzso was zzso and the analysis revealed 49 complete open reading frames zzso These zzso include genes responsible for the formation and attachment of four different zzso originating from at least three different pools of primary zzso Also in the zzso gene zzso four zzso were detected that resemble putative regulatory and export zzso Based on the putative function of the gene products, a model for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso gene zzso experiments, and culture extracts of these zzso were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso zzso of zzso zzso was clearly zzso in the zzso strain but was not zzso in the zzso zzso This indicated that indeed the zzso gene cluster had been zzso
