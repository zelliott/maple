A zzso zzso of the zzso F3 zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed for investigation as a zzso tumor imaging zzso For this purpose, we custom zzso a modified F3 zzso analog zzso incorporating a zzso zzso zzso for zzso attachment of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence studies conducted with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed distinct membrane and nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated high tumor specific zzso in melanoma cancer zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso in nude mice whereas a similarly labeled control zzso did not show any tumor zzso These results were also confirmed by ex zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso was zzso by a zzso approach in zzso overall zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso studies conducted with zzso displayed a zzso increase in its cell zzso at 4 h when compared to zzso zzso imaging studies with zzso in tumor bearing nude mice showed clear zzso of zzso zzso on systemic zzso These studies demonstrate a potential utility of F3 zzso zzso for tumor imaging with PET or zzso zzso
