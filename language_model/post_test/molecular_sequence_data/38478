Here we report the peculiarities of molecular evolution and divergence of zzso zzso clusters of the zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso tandem zzso It was suggested that zzso and zzso clusters affecting male fertility are the amplified derivatives of the unique zzso gene zzso zzso the putative zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso The putative zzso evolutionary intermediate was detected on the Y zzso as an zzso outside of the zzso zzso The zzso shows extensive zzso to the zzso zzso but contains several zzso diagnostic zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso and a 3' zzso site of the first zzso typical of the zzso zzso The zzso looks like a zzso carrying a drastically damaged zzso open reading frame zzso The putative zzso ORF, as compared with the zzso one, carries numerous synonymous zzso leading to the major zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso evolved on the Y zzso under the pressure of zzso zzso zzso sequencing shows that the efficiency of concerted evolution between adjacent repeats is zzso times as high in the zzso zzso cluster on the X zzso as that in the zzso zzso zzso judging by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
