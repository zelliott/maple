zzso fish store lipids among several zzso primarily as zzso zzso Upon zzso demand, stored zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this study, two distinct zzso zzso zzso were isolated, zzso and zzso from zzso tissue of rainbow zzso The full-length zzso designated zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso respectively, and share zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the two zzso derive from zzso genes that may have arisen during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were zzso zzso both in terms of distribution among zzso as well as in terms of abundance within selected zzso of juvenile zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the brain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, and white muscle, but were most abundant in the red muscle, liver, and zzso zzso zzso zzso was more abundant than zzso zzso in the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was more abundant than zzso zzso in the zzso Short term zzso (4 weeks) increased zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso but only zzso zzso levels increased in the liver and the red zzso During a prolonged fast (6 weeks), there was continued zzso of zzso and zzso zzso levels in the liver and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso fat declined, zzso with depletion of zzso fat zzso zzso fish reduced zzso expression to levels seen in continuously fed zzso These findings indicate that the pattern of zzso expression is consistent with the diverse zzso storage pattern of fish and suggest that distinct mechanisms serve to regulate differential expression of the two zzso in zzso and during a progressive zzso
