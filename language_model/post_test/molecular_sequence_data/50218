zzso to the discovery that zzso can have site specific zzso activity, there has been a great deal of interest in the design and testing of zzso zzso zzso as both surrogate genetic tools and as therapeutic zzso We have been developing zzso zzso or zzso with target specificity for zzso zzso and have been exploring chemical synthesis as one method for their zzso To this end, we have chemically zzso and zzso analyzed zzso zzso consisting of DNA in the zzso portions, and zzso in the zzso core of zzso type zzso zzso of DNA for zzso in the various stems of a zzso zzso have been analyzed in zzso for kinetic zzso One of the zzso zzso used in this study, which harbors 24 bases of DNA capable of zzso interactions with an zzso gag target, but maintains zzso in the zzso center and in zzso II, has a zzso greater zzso value than the all zzso zzso This increased activity appears to be the direct result of enhanced product zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso in which zzso II (which divides the zzso zzso is comprised of DNA, exhibited a marked reduction in zzso activity, suggesting that DNA in this region of the zzso can impart a negative effect on the zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso into human zzso are more stable than their zzso zzso zzso zzso turnover and stability in the absence of a significant effect on zzso make zzso zzso favorable candidates for therapeutic zzso
