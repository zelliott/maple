Butterflies of the zzso zzso have served as the basis for numerous studies in insect zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso work on relationships among major lineages in the zzso has been limited and zzso We have zzso zzso zzso of DNA from the zzso zzso zzso I and II genes zzso and zzso for 23 zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in order to assess the potential of these genes for use in zzso zzso and to examine patterns of gene evolution across a broad zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid variation is distributed zzso both within and between zzso zzso features of the proteins are not always reliable zzso of zzso In a combined analysis, these sequences support a nearly fully resolved zzso within zzso and species groups, though higher level relationships among species groups require additional zzso The most noteworthy findings are that neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso belongs in the zzso group and that the zzso zzso is zzso with respect to the zzso zzso We leave relationships among members of the zzso species group as a zzso These two protein coding zzso particularly zzso show excellent performance in resolving relationships at the level of species and species groups among zzso We strongly endorse a similar approach for future studies aimed at these zzso
