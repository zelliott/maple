zzso stimulation of zzso zzso leads to zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso and of zzso zzso that in their zzso form serve as zzso sites for zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso is poorly zzso We have investigated zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso using a cell line with zzso zzso expression and by characterizing in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and of zzso zzso by zzso After zzso induction zzso zzso complexes and reduced zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso from zzso cells and of the receptors zzso in zzso by zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso sites of the zzso differed and revealed that the regulatory zzso was not a preferred site for zzso zzso When zzso of synthetic zzso peptides was zzso the selectivity was zzso indicating that zzso acid sequence surrounding the zzso sites is the major zzso of zzso This notion is supported by the observation that the poorly zzso zzso and zzso in contrast to other analyzed zzso sites, are surrounded by basic zzso acid zzso at positions zzso and zzso relative to the zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso and may lead to zzso rather than general zzso of zzso
