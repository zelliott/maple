We have analyzed the function of individual elements of the zzso I zzso zzso in transgenic zzso This zzso zzso comprises three functional zzso one of which (the B zzso plays a dual zzso Within the context of the zzso the B element contributes to appropriate zzso cell zzso However, when separated from the other zzso zzso the B element selectively directs zzso in zzso cells of transgenic zzso This zzso activity is normally suppressed by an upstream zzso zzso The B element binds a novel zzso factor, and similar zzso elements are present in other pancreatic zzso both zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that a principal role of this zzso element and its associated factors is to activate many pancreatic genes as part of the program of pancreatic determination prior to the divergence of the zzso and zzso cell zzso
