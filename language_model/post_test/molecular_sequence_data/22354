zzso gene zzso allows zzso control of gene zzso zzso is guaranteed by small zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso derive from longer zzso zzso zzso molecules that are zzso to zzso in the nucleus and are transported by zzso 5 zzso 5) to the zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso which are zzso molecules similar in structure to zzso VA zzso are also transported by zzso 5 to the zzso where they zzso Here we show that small zzso derived from VA zzso zzso similar to zzso can be found in zzso zzso VA zzso processing to zzso requires neither viral replication nor viral protein zzso as evidenced by the fact that zzso zzso can be detected in cells zzso with VA zzso zzso are efficiently bound by zzso 2, the zzso of the zzso zzso complex, and behave as functional zzso in that they inhibit the expression of reporter genes with complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso affects efficient zzso production, indicating that zzso are required for virus zzso Thus, zzso zzso could represent a novel mechanism used by zzso to control cellular or viral gene zzso
