zzso is one of several factors that may affect the level of zzso of zzso products in zzso In plants engineered to zzso zzso proteins to the zzso compartment of leaves, the degenerative activity of zzso residing in leaf zzso fluid zzso could be critical to achieving the expected zzso zzso We zzso a structural analogue zzso of the zzso protein zzso B and compared the zzso of both proteins to degradation in zzso by IF extracted from leaves of various zzso The zzso of the two proteins in the various IF extracts ranged from 3 zzso to zzso zzso with the analogue zzso displaying the longer zzso in IF from nine of 10 zzso Overall, the zzso of zzso averaged zzso times greater than that of zzso zzso Analysis of the peptides produced by zzso activity in potato zzso indicated that the zzso lower degradation rate of zzso was associated with the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso 11 of zzso zzso These findings point to the possibility of tailoring zzso protein genes to reduce the rate of protein degradation in a particular target zzso
