In zzso zzso complexes termed zzso complex 1 zzso and zzso complex 2 zzso function as major regulators of cell growth, metabolism and zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso component zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso and is essential for zzso zzso X-ray crystal structures of the zzso domain of zzso and of its human zzso zzso have been zzso The structures show that the zzso of zzso and zzso both have the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso with known zzso structures suggests a putative binding site for zzso
