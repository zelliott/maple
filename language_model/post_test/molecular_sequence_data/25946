The zzso data from studies with zzso zzso to zzso the 27 zzso component of the zzso zzso indicated that the region containing 8 tandem repeats of the sequence zzso is an zzso zzso In one case, the entire zzso repertoire of an zzso recognized zzso within this zzso Three zzso zzso corresponding to the predicted zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and reacted with three different zzso zzso in order to map zzso sites in the intact zzso These zzso yielded positive reactions with a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was not in a zzso maximum but derived from the repeat zzso The same zzso gave little or no reaction with other peptides zzso 38 and zzso both of which were in a zzso zzso In addition, an zzso to zzso 37 reacted strongly with both the zzso zzso and the intact zzso zzso 37 also blocked the binding of zzso to zzso in competition zzso zzso the shorter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso versions of zzso 37 were zzso and both reacted with zzso 37 serum and also with each of the three zzso zzso In these reactions and in competition zzso the zzso and the blocking ability increased in proportion to the length of the zzso Based on these data, it was concluded that the repeat region of zzso is the site of one or more continuous zzso zzso The data also suggest that the repeat region is exposed on the surface of the folded protein and probably occur as a mobile, random zzso
