The zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial to the positive selection of zzso T cells in the zzso The zzso zzso or the zzso alpha beta zzso the interaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with major zzso complex zzso class zzso by binding to the class I zzso Here we report the crystal structure at zzso A resolution of a complex between zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso which is associated with zzso zzso binds one zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and also zzso zzso A flexible loop of the zzso domain zzso zzso is clamped between the zzso region zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso in the classic manner of an zzso interaction, zzso the binding of a second zzso zzso The position of the zzso domain is different from that in zzso zzso being most similar to that in the zzso complex, but no zzso change extends to the zzso surface presented for zzso zzso Although these shifts in zzso may provide a synergistic zzso of zzso the binding of zzso to zzso is clearly consistent with an zzso contribution from zzso to zzso zzso
