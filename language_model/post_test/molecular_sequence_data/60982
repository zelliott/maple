To study human zzso 8 zzso transmission between individuals and in zzso we developed a system for genetic zzso of zzso strains based on variation in the zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso H zzso zzso Using this system, we zzso nearly the entire zzso gene zzso zzso two segments of the zzso gene zzso reading frame zzso totaling zzso zzso and a zzso segment of the zzso gene zzso reading frame zzso from blood and tissue samples obtained from 40 human zzso zzso and zzso individuals, including those with zzso zzso primary zzso lymphoma, or zzso zzso The zzso collection was assembled from individuals living in diverse geographical locations, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda, and zzso As reported by others, zzso was the most variable zzso with up to zzso variation at the zzso sequence level and up to zzso variation at the zzso acid sequence zzso Despite this extensive sequence variation, the zzso zzso acid sequence contained 14 zzso zzso sites, suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were highly zzso in most cases differing by zzso in zzso zzso zzso was the most useful gene for strain discrimination, but the other genes enabled the discrimination of strains with identical zzso zzso zzso from diverse geographic locations were infected with four different zzso zzso strains did not strictly segregate by continent of zzso The majority of zzso strains from the United States and Europe were relatively closely zzso whereas some strains identified from Uganda and Australia were zzso zzso zzso I strains were the most common and were found on three zzso zzso sequences were found in specimens obtained from different body sites and at different times from the same zzso
