The rat liver zzso zzso cell zzso 105 has been zzso to be involved in liver zzso Recently, it was shown to exist in two zzso that differ in the length of their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso Flanagan, zzso zzso Hixson, and zzso zzso Lin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso and zzso function have been zzso To study the possible roles of these zzso during liver development, we have used both complementary DNA zzso and zzso zzso to examine their zzso and spatial zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed low zzso levels of a zzso zzso at zzso days zzso which increased dramatically at birth and remained at least zzso higher than fetal levels in zzso and adult zzso Additional zzso zzso species of zzso and zzso zzso were detected after zzso zzso levels of cell zzso 105 zzso in cultured adult and fetal zzso were comparable to in zzso levels, respectively, and were not influenced by treatment with transforming growth factor beta or by culture zzso zzso in cell zzso 105 protein demonstrated by zzso analysis correlated with the zzso increases, suggesting that regulation of cell zzso 105 expression is largely zzso during zzso zzso of the long and short zzso remained relatively constant after zzso zzso zzso zzso localized both zzso primarily to maturing zzso zzso zzso of zzso during liver zzso The long zzso could not be detected in fetal liver in zzso prior to 20 days, however, suggesting that specific roles may exist for these molecules during zzso
