zzso fever is a zzso viral disease prevalent mainly in tropical zzso As the clinical manifestations of dengue are not very unique, laboratory diagnosis is crucial in identifying cases of dengue zzso zzso of dengue infection based on the identification of zzso zzso has emerged as a practical and reliable means of diagnosing dengue zzso We recently developed a customized zzso dengue zzso protein zzso that can specifically detect the zzso G zzso class of zzso zzso in patient zzso Using this strategy, we have now created another dengue zzso zzso zzso with specificity for the zzso class of zzso zzso A synthetic gene zzso the zzso protein was expressed as a zzso protein fusion in zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso in a single affinity zzso step to obtain yields of approximately 15 zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso protein was used to develop an in-house zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tested using a panel of zzso patient zzso characterized using the commercially available zzso Duo rapid strip test from zzso zzso The zzso zzso results showed that the zzso protein not only recognized all zzso samples identified by the zzso test but also identified samples missed by the latter zzso We also successfully adapted the zzso protein to a rapid strip test zzso This approach of creating customized zzso coupled to zzso in zzso coli and simple zzso offers a promising alternative option to dengue diagnosis with the potential to circumvent the drawbacks of the whole virus zzso commercial zzso
