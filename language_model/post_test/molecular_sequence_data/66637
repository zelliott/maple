zzso transport of zzso is known to be a key mechanism for zzso trafficking of zzso zzso which is a member of zzso gene family, encodes two transcripts by utilizing different zzso start zzso In the zzso the full-length transcript zzso is expressed in the primordial germ cells in the zzso and is later expressed predominantly at the zzso phase of zzso in both male and female germ zzso The shorter transcript zzso is only expressed in the germ cells in the adult zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso mediates the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso 9 zzso a cargo of human zzso This finding is consistent with the progressive zzso of zzso in the nucleus of the zzso germ cells after the onset of zzso zzso Following zzso zzso of zzso activity in the fetal zzso fewer germ cells are found to progress to the zzso stage of zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso is zzso Our findings strongly zzso a zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso that accompanies zzso differentiation of the mouse germ zzso
