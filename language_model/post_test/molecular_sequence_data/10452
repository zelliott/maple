The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso is the smallest known naturally occurring active protein zzso element zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso underwent a complex series of events including zzso removal of 222 zzso acids that zzso most of the central zzso domain, and zzso addition of a zzso of unrelated zzso This naturally occurring genetic zzso is a representative characteristic of the zzso The deletion process removes the zzso motifs involved in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso represents a structural requirement, as its zzso resulted in failure to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso thus provides a paradigm for a minimal protein zzso zzso
