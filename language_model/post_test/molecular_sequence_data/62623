zzso zzso provides a rapid way to clone a zzso zzso Transfer DNA zzso of zzso zzso has been proven to be a successful tool for gene discovery in zzso and rice ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the generation of zzso independent zzso zzso rice zzso The zzso zzso pattern in the rice zzso was investigated, and an initial database was constructed based on zzso zzso sequences amplified from randomly selected zzso zzso rice lines using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of zzso zzso zzso zzso 92 showed long zzso integration zzso together with zzso Another 55 sequences showed complex integration of zzso into the rice zzso Besides direct integration, zzso sequences and zzso (one to several zzso of zzso were observed between the zzso right border and other portions of the zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso regions of the rice zzso was zzso zzso sites mapped onto rice zzso were scattered in the zzso Some zzso zzso were observed in the zzso generation of the zzso zzso zzso Our zzso population will be useful for studying zzso integration patterns and for analyzing gene function in zzso
