zzso is one of the major zzso in cellulosic zzso and understanding the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso will potentially help us design strategies to produce cellulosic biomass better suited for zzso zzso Although a number of genes have been shown to be essential for zzso zzso genes involved in the zzso of zzso have not yet been zzso Here, we report the comprehensive genetic and functional studies of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and demonstrate their involvement in the zzso of zzso during secondary wall zzso It was found that the zzso genes were expressed in cells undergoing secondary wall zzso and their expression was regulated by zzso a zzso master switch of secondary wall zzso The zzso proteins were shown to be localized in the zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso of a suite of single, zzso triple and quadruple zzso zzso revealed a significant reduction in the secondary wall zzso and the stem mechanical strength in the quadruple zzso zzso but not in other zzso Further chemical and structural analyses of zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in the amount of zzso groups on zzso In addition, the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso acid side chains was altered in the zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrate that the four zzso zzso genes function zzso in the zzso of zzso during secondary wall zzso
