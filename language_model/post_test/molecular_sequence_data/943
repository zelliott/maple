zzso zzso toxin 1 zzso and toxin 2 zzso two novel zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso were zzso from the zzso of the scorpion zzso zzso Their zzso acid sequences differ only in 1 zzso out of 28 zzso 16 zzso to zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso Despite a slight difference in zzso both toxins increased binding of zzso to skeletal zzso zzso at zzso zzso but had no effect on cardiac or liver zzso Their zzso effect was zzso and was zzso by zzso zzso zzso toxins also increased binding of zzso to the zzso zzso suggesting that a direct zzso interaction mediates the effect of the zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso release from zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner and induced the appearance of long lived zzso states in skeletal zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso structural modeling reveals that a cluster of positively charged zzso zzso to zzso is a prominent structural motif of both zzso A similar structural motif is believed to be important for zzso of zzso by zzso A zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Walker, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is likely that zzso zzso toxins and zzso A bind to zzso by means of zzso interactions that lead to massive zzso changes in the channel zzso The different affinity and structural diversity of this family of scorpion peptides makes them excellent zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso that trigger the channel to zzso
