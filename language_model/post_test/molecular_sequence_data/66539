Human zzso zzso encodes several zzso coupled zzso such as zzso zzso We determined the zzso gene sequence from clinical zzso obtained from 17 Human zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso Two types of clinical specimens were zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso from 12 patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from five patients with zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences between clinical specimens and several zzso reference strains showed that zzso were clustered at both ends of the zzso The zzso observed at the zzso were observed at some sequences whereas the zzso observed at the zzso lead us to define five patterns of zzso These patterns were equally distributed among zzso obtained from zzso or zzso of zzso zzso For each clinical zzso the zzso zzso was zzso There was no genetic association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The comparison of the results of the present study and those published from sequences obtained from children with zzso zzso disease zzso 2002) demonstrates that two motifs appear zzso either in zzso protein sequences obtained from zzso patients zzso 4) or in zzso protein sequences obtained from patients with zzso zzso infection zzso zzso zzso The appearance of these patterns of zzso in other clinical context needs to be zzso
