zzso clones zzso the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso have been isolated from a stage 42 zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are similar to the zzso and avian zzso The two zzso share a common zzso zzso zzso These are 49 and 9 zzso long for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This suggests a zzso organization similar to the zzso and avian zzso with two promoters and alternative zzso The zzso expression of the zzso zzso was studied by Northern zzso and zzso protection and their spatial expression analyzed by in zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso can be detected in the developing zzso from the end of zzso and accumulate rapidly in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene can also be detected in animal cap zzso which have been induced to form zzso derivatives by exposure to zzso A or zzso However, unlike other zzso zzso neither transcript from the zzso gene can be detected in embryonic or adult cardiac muscle, their expression being restricted to zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that expression of the zzso gene provides a sensitive and specific marker for skeletal muscle zzso zzso expression of zzso factors in animal caps zzso the expression of the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso like its zzso and avian counterparts, is a regulatory target for members of the zzso family of zzso zzso
