zzso together with zzso gives rise to genetic variation in zzso Here we leverage the recent mixture of people of African and European ancestry in the Americas to build a genetic map measuring the probability of crossing over at each position in the zzso based on about zzso million crossovers in 30,000 unrelated African zzso At intervals of more than three zzso it is nearly identical to a map built in zzso At finer scales it differs significantly, and we identify about 2,500 zzso hotspots that are active in people of West African ancestry but nearly inactive in zzso The probability of a crossover at these hotspots is almost fully controlled by the zzso an individual carries at zzso zzso zzso We identify a zzso DNA sequence motif that is enriched in these zzso and is an excellent match to the predicted binding target of zzso zzso common in West Africans and rare in zzso Sites of this motif are predicted to be risk zzso for zzso zzso zzso in individuals carrying these zzso More generally, this map provides a resource for research in human genetic variation and zzso
