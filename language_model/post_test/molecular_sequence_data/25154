The distribution of zzso zzso tracts in the zzso of a variety of zzso was studied by in zzso zzso The probe for these studies was a zzso zzso sequence obtained from a mouse zzso library constructed with DNA prepared from a restriction zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and two-dimensional gel analysis of zzso of this sequence indicated that it is capable of adopting a triplex zzso in zzso In zzso zzso with this probe to the zzso of ten different zzso species revealed a highly zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso These tracts are found throughout the zzso arms and in some zzso they are zzso producing a zzso zzso However, at the resolution of the light microscope these tracts appeared to be absent from the zzso regions of all zzso examined except those of zzso The zzso distribution of these tracts to the zzso arm regions implies an organizational or functional role for this repeat zzso It is unlikely that the 56 zzso sequence type contributed to the formation of the triplex DNA structure previously detected in zzso zzso of zzso
