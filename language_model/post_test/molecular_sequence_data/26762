zzso has two different zzso zzso zzso and sheet zzso We previously identified an important regulator of the zzso of sheet zzso zzso which was named zzso calcium zzso protein zzso However, little is known about its counterpart in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso shares significant sequence similarity with a group of zzso proteins zzso that participate in zzso zzso transmission, but the relationships between the two zzso which are zzso in sequences but disparate in function, have not been studied zzso Here, we identified an zzso calcium zzso protein and an zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso and zzso zzso Studies of zzso indicated that it was a counterpart of zzso in zzso that might function similarly in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso showed that unlike previously identified zzso zzso was not only expressed in the nervous system but could also be detected in zzso system cells, such as the zzso cells of the mantle zzso Additionally, its expression patterns during zzso and zzso development did not zzso with zzso zzso These phenomena indicated that zzso might play more general roles than just in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that they were quite different in their zzso modification and zzso and that they were controlled under different zzso regulation systems, consequently obtaining disparate expression zzso Our results also implied that zzso and zzso might come from a common zzso through gene zzso and zzso
