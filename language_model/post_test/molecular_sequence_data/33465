zzso T cell zzso using zzso zzso is a viable treatment for patients with cancer and requires participation of zzso zzso and zzso T zzso Here, we assessed the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells following adoptive transfer in patients with zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso for ex zzso zzso zzso cell generation, we show that three monthly treatment cycles of peripheral blood T cell zzso and zzso zzso selectively modulated zzso T zzso immune responses that correlated with diminished serum zzso tumor marker levels and enhanced patient zzso One patient remains zzso another patient survived long-term for nearly 16 months with zzso disease and two patients expired within 3-5 months following final zzso Although zzso from all patients showed elevated zzso zzso activity following therapy, such responses did not correlate with therapeutic zzso zzso survivors showed elevated levels of systemic memory zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cells when compared to that of zzso levels and similarly treated short-term zzso Such cells zzso different levels of zzso and zzso that resulted in progressively lower systemic zzso memory T cell ratios that further correlated with zzso zzso Lastly, these patients showed elevated levels of zzso T cells expressing the zzso and zzso zzso receptors and the zzso zzso associated with zzso cell zzso We suggest that effective zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso differential levels of systemic zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso that influence long-term tumor immunity in zzso cancer zzso
