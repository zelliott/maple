We recently described the derivation of a dengue zzso 2 virus zzso that exhibited a host zzso zzso it was severely impaired for replication in cultured zzso cells zzso zzso zzso virus had selected zzso in zzso sequences predicted to form a 3' zzso structure zzso that is zzso among all zzso zzso The zzso constitutes the downstream terminal zzso zzso of the 3' zzso region in zzso zzso Here we report the introduction of these same zzso changes into the analogous region of an infectious DNA derived from the zzso of a zzso dengue zzso 1 virus zzso strain Western Pacific zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso exhibited a host zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso zzso virus was attenuated in a monkey model for dengue infection in which zzso is taken as a correlate of human zzso In spite of the markedly reduced levels of zzso that it induced in monkeys compared to zzso zzso was highly zzso In addition, zzso monkeys retained high levels of zzso zzso in serum and were protected from challenge with high doses of the zzso parent for as long as 17 months after the single zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were each detected after a total of 24 days in zzso cell zzso Complete zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso and that of a zzso virus, zzso revealed that zzso the zzso zzso contained no additional zzso upstream from the zzso compared to the zzso parent zzso and zzso the zzso zzso contained de zzso zzso consistent with our previous hypothesis that the zzso in zzso replication in zzso cells was at the level of zzso zzso A strategy for the development of a zzso dengue vaccine is zzso
