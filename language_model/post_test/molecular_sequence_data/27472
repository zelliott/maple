zzso of the zzso class I chain related molecules A and B zzso on tumor cell surface can signal the immune zzso zzso for tumor immune zzso However, zzso was found to be shed by tumors in cancer patients, which zzso regulates host immunity and promotes tumor immune evasion and zzso The mechanisms by which tumors shed zzso are not well understood although diverse groups of zzso are suggested to be zzso The functional complexity of these zzso makes them zzso therapeutic targets for zzso zzso zzso Here we identified an zzso acid zzso motif in the zzso domain of zzso that is critical for the interaction of zzso with zzso to enable zzso zzso in this motif prevented zzso shedding but did not interfere with zzso recognition of zzso Our study suggests that the zzso motif is a feasible target to inhibit zzso shedding for cancer zzso
