An zzso shuttle zzso zzso carrying a bacterial zzso zzso target gene zzso was treated with zzso zzso aromatic zzso and the number of zzso bound zzso zzso per zzso was zzso The plasmids were zzso into human cell line zzso allowed to zzso and the progeny plasmids rescued and zzso for the frequency of zzso zzso The agents tested were the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso With each agent there was a linear increase in the frequency of zzso zzso as a function of the number of DNA zzso formed, reaching zzso 15 to 25 times higher than the background frequency of zzso zzso zzso When compared on the basis of zzso formed per zzso zzso which forms its principal DNA zzso at the zzso position of zzso was approximately four times more zzso than zzso which binds principally at the zzso position of zzso This difference in zzso effectiveness may reflect intrinsic differences in the nature of the zzso and their location in the DNA zzso but it could also reflect a difference in the rate of removal of particular zzso by zzso zzso repair since the zzso host cell line excised zzso zzso from zzso DNA at least three times slower than zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and DNA sequencing analysis of zzso derived from zzso plasmids showed that the majority zzso involved zzso zzso or altered gel mobility zzso zzso In contrast, the majority of those derived from zzso plasmids were base zzso DNA sequencing of 86 unequivocally independent zzso derived from zzso zzso and 60 from zzso zzso indicated that zzso to zzso contained a single base zzso zzso had two base zzso and zzso had small insertions or deletions (one or two zzso The majority zzso of the base zzso in zzso from zzso or zzso zzso were zzso mainly zzso Each zzso produced its own spectrum of zzso
