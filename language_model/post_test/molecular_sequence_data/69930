Two zzso of bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were established in cell free medium from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso appear similar to zzso organisms reported previously from various zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis, however, placed them within the gamma subdivision of the zzso zzso distinct from most members of the zzso which align with the alpha zzso zzso multiple zzso plasmids are zzso by zzso and zzso suggesting that the two zzso are zzso zzso mapping analysis showed that one of the zzso plasmids is present in high copy number and is at least 80 zzso in zzso A zzso zzso zzso which contains the broad host range zzso replication origin, was used to zzso bacterial zzso The zzso zzso was transformed, and it expressed zzso zzso resistance to the antibiotics zzso zzso and zzso Transformation of these zzso may provide a novel means for expressing zzso genes within zzso zzso
