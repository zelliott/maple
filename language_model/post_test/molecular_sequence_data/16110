The in zzso zzso of tobacco mosaic virus zzso begins with the specific recognition by the viral coat protein disk zzso of an internal zzso zzso zzso known as the assembly origin zzso This zzso sequence contains a putative zzso structure zzso 1), believed to be the target for disk binding in assembly zzso which has the characteristic sequence zzso exposed as a single strand at its zzso We show that a zzso zzso sequence encompassing loop 1 is sufficient to direct the zzso by zzso coat protein disks of a zzso zzso zzso This zzso sequence and structure, which is sufficient to elicit zzso assembly in zzso was explored by zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso identified zzso that appear to effect assembly via a zzso in zzso structure, rather than by a direct effect on coat protein zzso The binding of the loop 1 zzso zzso sequence to coat protein disks was shown to be due primarily to its regularly repeated G zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are equally effective at initiating zzso indicating that the other bases are less functionally zzso However, substitution of the sequences zzso zzso or zzso reduced the assembly initiation rate, indicating that C zzso are zzso for zzso Two additional zzso sequences within the zzso zzso zzso both of the form zzso may play subsidiary roles in disk zzso zzso structure plays an important part in permitting selective zzso recognition, since altering the zzso folding close to the zzso of the loop 1 stem reduces the rate of disk zzso as does zzso the stem zzso Whereas the zzso sequence making up the hairpin does not in general affect the specificity of the zzso interaction, it is required to present the zzso signal sequence in a special zzso zzso for this are zzso
