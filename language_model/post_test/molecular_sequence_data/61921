Although the zzso structural zzso zzso and zzso can spontaneously zzso to form zzso zzso currently available methods for production of zzso particles capable of zzso reporter plasmids into zzso cells are technically demanding and relatively zzso In this report, we describe a simple zzso cell zzso method for efficient zzso production of zzso gene transfer zzso carrying reporter zzso Using bovine zzso type 1 zzso and human zzso type 16 as model zzso we have developed a system for producing zzso zzso stocks with zzso of several billion zzso units per zzso zzso of these zzso requires both zzso and zzso and zzso can be prevented by zzso zzso The stocks can be zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso procedure that is substantially more effective than standard cesium zzso zzso zzso Although earlier data had suggested a potential role for the viral early protein zzso we found that zzso protein expression did not enhance the zzso production of zzso zzso It was also possible to zzso reporter plasmids devoid of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso production efficiency was significantly influenced by the size of the target zzso being zzso Use of zzso target plasmids resulted in zzso zzso yields that were higher than those with target plasmids closer to the native zzso size of zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso assembly of zzso structural proteins around zzso reporter plasmids is surprisingly zzso and may be driven primarily by a size discrimination zzso
