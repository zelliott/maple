A part of the zzso gene containing a zzso group I zzso was amplified by zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from the cloned zzso product was efficiently zzso in zzso under zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library and the zzso sequence of a zzso portion was zzso The zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso group I zzso and a zzso 3' zzso In addition, three open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso The predicted protein sequence of zzso which is located zzso upstream from zzso on the opposite zzso shows zzso zzso acid identity to that of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso L of zzso zzso zzso
