Typically during human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection, a nearly homogeneous viral population first emerges and then zzso over time due to selective forces that are poorly zzso To identify these forces, we conducted an intensive zzso study of viral genetic changes and zzso immunity in one subject at zzso or zzso time points during his first 3 years of infection, and in his infecting partner near the time of zzso zzso peptides covering zzso acid sites zzso to be under positive selection were powerful for identifying zzso zzso zzso zzso Positive selection and zzso resulting in escape from zzso occurred across the viral zzso We detected 25 zzso zzso including 14 previously zzso Seven new zzso mapped to the viral zzso zzso emphasizing zzso as a major target of zzso One-third of the selected sites were associated with zzso zzso escapes from zzso Most of these resulted from replacement with zzso acids found at low database zzso Another one-third represented acquisition of zzso acids found at high database frequency, suggesting potential zzso of zzso zzso sites recognized by the immune system of the zzso partner and zzso toward improved viral fitness in the absence of immune targeting within the zzso A majority of the remaining selected sites occurred in the envelope protein and may have been subjected to zzso immune zzso zzso a majority of the zzso acids undergoing selection in this subject appeared to result from zzso zzso selection, confirming zzso as a dominant selective force in zzso zzso
