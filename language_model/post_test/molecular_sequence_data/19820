zzso are an elite group of proteins containing a rare zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso incorporation of zzso requires a zzso zzso sequence zzso element, a zzso structure located in the zzso regions of zzso zzso Here we report identification of a zzso form of zzso element in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of humans and domestic zzso This zzso has a zzso sequence in the zzso site in place of zzso previously considered zzso Using a combination of zzso and molecular techniques, we show that zzso and zzso possess both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso element supported zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells and did so more efficiently than the natural zzso zzso elements zzso In addition, zzso type I and type II zzso elements zzso into the zzso forms were functional but zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso We carried out zzso searches for both zzso and zzso forms of zzso elements in zzso and detected five zzso zzso including one coding for a previously zzso zzso designated zzso and two containing the zzso form of the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso elements were not detected in zzso and zzso As a practical outcome of the study, we developed zzso a zzso for convenient expression of zzso in zzso zzso It contains an zzso gene and the most efficient tested zzso zzso an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
