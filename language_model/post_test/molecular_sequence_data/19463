zzso to the synthesis of model compounds based on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were developed using specially designed zzso derivatives of zzso antibiotics to study the zzso and topography of the nascent zzso chain in the zzso zzso A method for selective zzso of zzso at the zzso group of zzso was developed, which involves preliminary zzso of zzso The reaction of the zzso zzso of the zzso with cesium zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso led to the corresponding zzso derivatives of zzso The protected peptides zzso zzso and zzso were condensed with the zzso group of zzso
