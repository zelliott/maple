The folate zzso zzso type alpha may be distinguished from zzso by its higher affinity for the circulating folate zzso zzso zzso and its opposite zzso for reduced folate zzso Previous studies showed that a single zzso to zzso substitution at position 49 of the mature protein sequence is responsible for the functional divergence of zzso zzso zzso Zheng, zzso Wang, zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso however, the results also indicated that the minimum requirement for conversion of zzso to the functional equivalent of zzso should include zzso acid zzso downstream of zzso 92 in addition to zzso of zzso To pinpoint those zzso zzso zzso zzso including progressively shorter segments of zzso downstream of position 92 as well as selected point zzso were zzso zzso substitution of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso Ala, zzso and zzso respectively, zzso the zzso binding characteristics of zzso The results also exclude a role for other zzso in zzso in determining its functional zzso A zzso model of zzso based on the three-dimensional structure of the chicken zzso protein is used to show the position of zzso 49, 104, and 166 in relation to the zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso
