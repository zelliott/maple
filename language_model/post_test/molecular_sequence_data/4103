zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso differentiation and is genetically downstream of the zzso signaling zzso Similarly, a mouse zzso of zzso zzso is required for the proper formation of hair, a zzso zzso zzso Here, we provide zzso evidence that zzso encodes a nuclear DNA binding protein zzso that binds to DNA sequences similar to those that zzso binds to, further supporting the notion that zzso and zzso are genetically and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we show that the zzso promoter is activated by the zzso zzso factor 1 zzso complex, a zzso of zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso is a zzso target of zzso signaling during hair zzso in mice, and that the zzso link in zzso zzso regulatory pathways has been zzso between mice and zzso
