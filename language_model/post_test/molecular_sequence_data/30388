zzso is an zzso protein that serves as an electron transport intermediate for zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso vitamin D, and zzso acid zzso We cloned and characterized the human zzso gene family, which includes two expressed genes and two zzso zzso analysis of this gene family revealed that it encodes only one protein zzso The expressed genes were assigned to zzso 11 and zzso to zzso 20 and 21 by identifying zzso zzso from each gene segment and zzso them to DNA from zzso hybrid zzso The zzso lacked zzso and contained numerous zzso including zzso zzso and substitution which rendered them zzso They were zzso and zzso zzso to the expressed zzso yet they were only zzso zzso with each zzso The zzso nature, higher diversity among themselves, and distinct zzso location of the zzso suggests that they arose by independent, zzso zzso
