By using zzso zzso zzso we define the positions of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso of zzso zzso II zzso relative to promoter DNA within the human zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the interface between the largest and second-largest zzso of zzso forms an extended, approximately 240 A channel that interacts with promoter DNA both upstream and downstream of the zzso zzso By using electron zzso we show that zzso zzso promoter DNA by the equivalent of approximately 50 zzso Together with the published structure of zzso the results indicate that zzso wraps DNA around its surface and suggest a specific model for the trajectory of the wrapped zzso
