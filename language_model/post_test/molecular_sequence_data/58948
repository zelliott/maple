zzso DNA zzso sequence variation was examined in zzso Swedes and zzso by zzso amplification and restriction zzso About zzso of the zzso were zzso within 10 zzso zzso zzso I, J, K, M, zzso zzso zzso W, and zzso suggesting that the identified zzso could zzso virtually all European zzso Because both zzso segments of the zzso control region were previously zzso in the Tuscan samples, the zzso zzso and control region sequences could be zzso Using a combination of zzso restriction site changes and control region zzso zzso the distribution of the zzso was surveyed through the published restriction site zzso and control region sequence data of zzso This supported the conclusion that most zzso observed in Europe are zzso and that at least some of them occur at varying zzso in different zzso zzso The zzso of almost all European zzso variation in a number of well defined zzso could provide additional insights about the origin and relationships of zzso populations and the process of human colonization of Europe, and is valuable for the definition of the role played by zzso backgrounds in the expression of pathological zzso zzso
