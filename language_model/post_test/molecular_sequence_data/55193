A substantial increase in the speed of the optical response of genetically zzso fluorescent protein zzso sensors zzso zzso zzso was achieved by using the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A potential zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso The zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was used to create an zzso zzso sensor called zzso By replacing the zzso with a zzso zzso pair, a new zzso zzso sensor was zzso with fast off zzso zzso However, the signal was small zzso zzso zzso sensors using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated Zahra and Zahra 2, exhibited fast on and off zzso within zzso of the time zzso observed with the organic zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso sensor shifted the zzso dependence to more negative zzso but did not noticeably affect the zzso of the optical zzso
