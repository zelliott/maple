The zzso soil zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso via a unique zzso A full molecular characterization of zzso zzso in this zzso was accomplished by the following zzso zzso A zzso DNA segment with a gene cluster zzso all nine zzso was cloned and zzso zzso two zzso zzso were discovered, and zzso three zzso were found, completing the zzso unknown part of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso In contrast to all zzso of the zzso zzso family, the latter two zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso catalyzing reduction of zzso to zzso was zzso and shown to contain a zzso bound zzso zzso one zzso and two zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso family, mediates zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso reduction of the latter to zzso is zzso by a member of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to form zzso After the action of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso and zzso zzso family pair of zzso zzso zzso and zzso completes the zzso Genes corresponding to the first three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in nine zzso
