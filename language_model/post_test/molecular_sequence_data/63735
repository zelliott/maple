zzso 1 zzso is involved in zzso zzso of a variety of zzso into active derivatives and plays an important role in zzso We previously reported that a single zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene associates with the responsiveness to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose activity is achieved by zzso To identify relevant functional zzso we zzso the zzso promoter region ( approximately zzso in 100 Japanese zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and one zzso zzso were identified, among which seven zzso and one zzso residing between zzso and zzso were in almost complete linkage zzso zzso zzso They consisted a minor and a major zzso the zzso zzso of which were zzso and zzso zzso The minor zzso possessed two putative zzso binding sites while the major zzso did not have any zzso binding zzso The minor zzso had a higher zzso and zzso binding activities than the major zzso zzso The original zzso was in high linkage zzso with these zzso zzso zzso and well agreed with the efficacy of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso binding site variation in the zzso promoter is functional, and are good candidates for the zzso studies of zzso zzso
