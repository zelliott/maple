Efficiency of zzso of mechanically injured skeletal muscle is more pronounced in zzso mice, as compared to other laboratory strains in which zzso properties of skeletal muscle are zzso zzso Previously, we zzso that a small number of genes might differ between zzso and other mouse zzso and would be responsible for this variation in the efficiency of skeletal muscle zzso The results of initial experiments demonstrated that zzso mice have a unique form of the zzso zzso zzso which partly influences efficiency of skeletal muscle repair, and that other genes were also zzso To identify other candidate zzso differences were sought within the zzso paired zzso gene zzso between zzso and other laboratory mouse zzso Southern zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso mice share a zzso zzso which differs from all other laboratory strains zzso This zzso is most likely due to sequence differences within the zzso of a zzso zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso and zzso mice also share the same zzso properties of mechanically damaged skeletal muscle as zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso mice lack the zzso type of zzso and zzso belong to a different mouse zzso these studies suggest that structural zzso in the zzso of a zzso gene may be implicated in the effectiveness of renewal of damaged skeletal muscle of the limb in the mature zzso
