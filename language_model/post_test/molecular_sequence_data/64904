Twenty-five zzso strains isolated from zzso samples for zzso zzso and zzso zzso manufactured by eight different bakeries in northern Italy were zzso zzso was performed by the simplified identification method zzso zzso and zzso identification zzso the zzso system from zzso zzso and the zzso system from zzso zzso zzso diversity was investigated by randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso and zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso of the internal transcribed zzso between zzso and zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso zzso was the zzso species zzso of zzso whereas the remaining strains zzso were related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification systems based on zzso analysis proved to be unreliable to identify zzso from zzso Either zzso or zzso restriction analysis showed to be suitable for the identification of species, but could not be used to differentiate among the zzso at the strain zzso zzso of the ITS region permitted a consistent zzso of the zzso zzso
