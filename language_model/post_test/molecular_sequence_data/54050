To investigate the interactions between zzso and nuclear zzso we produced zzso maternal lineages by transferring the zzso between the zzso of two mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso A total of 43 different zzso exist in the zzso zzso region of zzso between B6 and zzso zzso zzso were reconstructed by zzso using a zzso from a zzso stage zzso of one strain and an zzso zzso from a zzso stage zzso of the other zzso zzso volumes of both types of zzso were detected in zzso stage zzso However, the zzso from the zzso strain became biased in the zzso regardless of the source of the nuclear zzso The zzso zzso population was very high in most of the zzso examined but was relatively low in the brain and the zzso An age-related increase of zzso zzso was also observed in the zzso The zzso zzso in the reconstructed zzso and in the zzso collected from zzso mice showed a different segregation pattern during early embryonic zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso has a zzso advantage over B6 zzso during embryonic development and zzso regardless of the type of nuclear zzso
