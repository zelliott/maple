Small zzso zzso carry out a variety of functions in zzso cells, and in multiple species they can travel between cells, thus serving as signaling zzso In zzso multiple small zzso have been found to circulate in the blood, although in most cases the targets of these zzso and even their functions, are not well zzso zzso are small zzso zzso zzso with poorly characterized functions, best known because they make up part of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue zzso In surveying small zzso present in the serum of healthy adult humans, we have found zzso fragments of lengths 27 zzso and zzso zzso derived from the zzso of specific zzso and generated by zzso within a predicted internal zzso Many of the zzso from which these fragments are derived were previously zzso only as zzso or predicted zzso These zzso fragments make up a large proportion of all small zzso (including zzso present in human zzso They are also present in zzso are not present in zzso or zzso and circulate as part of a complex with a mass between 100 and 300 zzso Mouse serum contains far fewer zzso fragments, possibly reflecting the much greater copy number of zzso genes and zzso in zzso The function of the zzso fragments is at present unknown, but the processing and zzso of specific zzso to produce zzso fragments that circulate in stable complexes are consistent with a signaling zzso
