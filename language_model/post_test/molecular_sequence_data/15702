The discovery that zzso zzso are zzso as zzso precursors and share many features has zzso the development of several zzso approaches for identifying new zzso genes in various animal zzso Many of these approaches rely heavily on conservation of sequence within and between species, whereas others emphasize zzso methods to screen hairpin candidates for structural features shared with known zzso zzso The identification of animal zzso targets is a particularly difficult problem because an exact match to the target sequence is not zzso We discuss the most recently devised zzso for zzso and target zzso We do not discuss plant zzso because their varying sizes and structural characteristics pose different problems of identification and target zzso
