Little is known about the mechanisms that determine zzso of proteins to the plasma membrane in zzso zzso The length of the zzso zzso and association of proteins with zzso zzso have been proposed to play a role in sorting to the cell zzso Here, we report that zzso an zzso integral membrane protein involved in cell fusion during zzso zzso requires zzso for cell surface zzso In cells lacking zzso zzso a zzso involved in the initial step of zzso zzso was not zzso and accumulated in late zzso zzso A zzso protein lacking zzso motif was zzso to the zzso and accumulated in late zzso in zzso zzso zzso of this protein could be restored by addition of a zzso acid portion of an zzso sequence from zzso Our data suggest that zzso functions as a sorting zzso for cell surface delivery of zzso
