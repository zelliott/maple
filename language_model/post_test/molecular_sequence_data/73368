A point zzso in the zzso of human zzso zzso has been recently identified in zzso II of zzso zzso zzso The zzso results in a substitution of zzso by zzso at position zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells results in an zzso of zzso in the zzso intermediate compartment and the zzso zzso similar to the zzso in zzso II zzso zzso An interesting feature of the zzso substitution is its location in a region of the zzso zzso that shares striking similarities with the zzso zzso and other functionally related zzso such as human zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso We speculated that the zzso substitution in these highly zzso regions may result in a comparable zzso Here we examined this hypothesis using zzso zzso as a reporter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at position zzso in the zzso region of zzso to zzso results in a protein that is neither transported to the zzso nor zzso zzso but accumulates in the zzso intermediate compartment and zzso as a zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso in zzso zzso We propose that the zzso and zzso zzso (in zzso and zzso zzso generate structural zzso that are recognized by a control zzso operating beyond the zzso in the intermediate compartment or zzso
