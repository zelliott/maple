Intermediate zzso structures such as zzso zzso and zzso attachments are thought to play a crucial role in different biological processes like zzso zzso trafficking and viral zzso In the present study, we provide evidence that zzso mixing of large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso and of zzso zzso is inhibited by external addition of zzso zzso to zzso containing zzso in their zzso zzso Leakage experiments confirm that zzso enhances the stability of the lipids zzso The temperature dependence of the two processes as well as the complementary shape of zzso and zzso suggest that the zzso interaction is involved in the fusion zzso and stabilization of the zzso
