We previously reported the association of elevated levels of the zzso zzso factor, zzso binding factor zzso in breast cancer cells with the specific zzso function of zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, we investigated regulation of the human zzso gene by zzso in breast and zzso zzso Two zzso binding sites zzso within the zzso promoter were zzso In all cells, breast and zzso active zzso modifications were present at these zzso DNA harboring this region was zzso and levels of zzso zzso and protein were zzso Nevertheless, zzso of zzso zzso and protein and zzso cell death were observed only in breast cancer cells depleted of zzso We proposed that increased zzso binding to the zzso promoter in breast cancer cells, by comparison with zzso cells, may be mechanistically linked to the specific zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso In this study, we show that zzso binding was enriched at the zzso zzso in breast cancer cells and zzso in contrast, binding of other zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso was generally increased in zzso cells and normal breast zzso Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso in breast cancer cells, zzso elevated levels of zzso support preferential binding of zzso to the zzso zzso In this context, zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso influences of positive regulatory zzso depletion of breast cancer cells from zzso therefore results in the zzso of zzso and zzso
