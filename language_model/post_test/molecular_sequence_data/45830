The zzso rabbit zzso zzso a and b zzso display a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso with structural similarities to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to play a role in zzso growth but not to be essential in zzso zzso Here we report that the knockout of zzso start zzso almost prevented zzso induction upon zzso zzso of viral DNA onto rabbit zzso The scarce warts induced showed very slow growth, despite sustained expression of E6 and zzso zzso This points to an essential role of zzso in disturbing zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, we found that zzso zzso with the zinc zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso three proteins as yet unrelated to viral zzso or cell zzso zzso zzso also zzso with these proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly localized to the zzso apparatus and the early zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso We showed that zzso and zzso formed a complex and that zzso disrupted this zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso increased zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and both the zzso and the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso Competition experiments with a zzso truncated zzso protein showed that zzso interaction was required for zzso zzso Our data identify zzso zzso as a key player in zzso induction and unravel novel cellular targets for inducing the proliferation of zzso
