The put sites of zzso zzso increase the zzso of zzso and thereby promote the expression of viral genes that are located downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules that have traversed a put site are converted to a zzso form by the put zzso We analyzed the structure and function of put transcripts by determining the effects of put zzso on zzso zzso and by probing zzso and zzso put zzso with zzso zzso The results support the prediction that the secondary structure of the active transcript consists of two hairpin stems that are separated by a single zzso zzso The identity of bases in certain zzso and internal zzso is important for activity, while that of most bases in the terminal zzso is zzso Many bases in the stems can be replaced with little or no effect on activity provided that zzso is zzso
