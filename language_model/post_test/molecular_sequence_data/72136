zzso are zzso membrane proteins that zzso zzso zzso to the outer membrane of zzso zzso In zzso coli, major zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which show high sequence zzso In response to high zzso of the zzso zzso is expressed at the expense of zzso zzso Here, we study zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso in an attempt to establish why zzso is best suited to function at high zzso zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso has been determined to a resolution of zzso A by molecular replacement with the model of zzso The structure of zzso closely resembles that of the search zzso The zzso structure is composed of three hollow zzso zzso beta barrels, each zzso a separate zzso Most insertions and deletions with respect to zzso are found in the zzso that zzso towards the cell zzso A characteristic zzso zzso in loop 4 contributes to the zzso zzso At the pore zzso the replacement of an zzso by a zzso zzso does not alter the pore profile of zzso in comparison with zzso because of the different course of the zzso zzso as characterized in zzso zzso and zzso zzso resembles zzso with decreased zzso and increased zzso selectivity in comparison with zzso 

The zzso structure suggests that not an altered pore size but an increase in charge density is the basis for the distinct zzso properties of this zzso that are relevant for its preferential expression at high zzso zzso
