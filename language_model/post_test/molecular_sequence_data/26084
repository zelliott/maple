We chemically zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso and surveyed a scanning zzso process as well as sequences within a zzso transcript acting in the zzso reaction in zzso The zzso transcript contained the sequences of the first zzso first zzso and a major part of the second zzso of the human zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso could zzso effectively to the target site in the zzso during the zzso zzso A zzso complementary to the donor zzso zzso site completely inhibited authentic zzso and activated an upstream cryptic donor zzso A zzso complementary to the branch site inhibited normal branch formation and greatly reduced subsequent generation of the spliced zzso Six other zzso complementary to zzso in the zzso or the zzso region between the donor and branch sites had no significant effect on the zzso zzso These observations suggest that an extensive scanning of the present zzso across the six regions tested is not essential for the zzso zzso We propose that a short zzso zzso provides a practical and convenient method to examine zzso sequences of zzso The advantages of this method in comparison with zzso zzso or deletion are zzso
