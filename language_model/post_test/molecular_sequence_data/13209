The gene transfer efficiency of human zzso stem cells is still inadequate for efficient gene therapy of most zzso To overcome this problem, a zzso zzso zzso system for gene therapy has been developed for gene therapy of zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso zzso containing the human zzso zzso zzso and the human small cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso was controlled by the long terminal repeat zzso of the zzso zzso leukemia zzso The zzso zzso marker was placed downstream of the zzso zzso and its translation was enhanced by inclusion of the long zzso untranslated region of zzso virus internal zzso entry zzso zzso zzso cells were created by multiple zzso zzso to create zzso producer zzso The zzso zzso has a high zzso and can drive expression of zzso and the cell surface zzso zzso simultaneously in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso skin zzso These zzso cells have been successfully separated from zzso cells by zzso cell zzso based on cell surface expression of zzso zzso and sorted zzso zzso cells showed higher zzso zzso activity than the zzso population, demonstrating coordinated expression of both zzso zzso from zzso patients were zzso and sorted for zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity was zzso The zzso sorted zzso zzso had a marked increase in zzso activity zzso compared with virgin zzso zzso zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was accomplished and zzso cell sorted zzso zzso generated zzso all of which zzso were zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso generated zzso zzso units, zzso units zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrating their ability to differentiate into these zzso lineages in zzso The zzso sorted zzso raised the zzso zzso levels in their progeny cells zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso this demonstrates the development of high zzso zzso zzso zzso that allow isolation of zzso zzso zzso and cells that have been metabolically zzso
