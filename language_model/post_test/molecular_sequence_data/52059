The influence of zzso on zzso injury in patients infected with zzso C virus was examined by analysis of the relationship between zzso zzso activity and the amount of zzso C virus zzso in sequential serum samples from I zzso patient with acute zzso C and 3 zzso patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso analysis by the zzso method indicated that the quantity of zzso C virus zzso in the serum affected the disease activities of acute and chronic zzso C through their natural clinical courses in all these zzso The zzso sequence zzso the putative envelope region of the viral zzso in the patient with acute zzso C was zzso Blood samples taken serially at 2 times of zzso of the zzso revealed 2 zzso zzso resulting in changes of predicted zzso acid zzso This finding suggests that zzso zzso in the envelope region of the viral zzso may be responsible for the zzso zzso injury attributed to recurrence of zzso in patients with zzso zzso From these aspects, the serial divergence of the virus zzso in infected individuals, especially in the region zzso the viral envelope zzso may possibly play an important role in developing chronic infection of zzso C zzso
