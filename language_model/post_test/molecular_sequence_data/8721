In the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso are zzso linked via a zzso bond in both humans and zzso transgenic zzso Studies based upon fluorescent labeling of free zzso zzso have suggested that zzso zzso of the 4 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the most likely candidate to form a zzso bond with zzso However, other recent studies using truncated zzso molecules suggest that zzso the terminal zzso of zzso may be implicated in the binding to zzso In order to definitively show which of zzso zzso zzso is essential in interacting with zzso we have used zzso restriction zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso to convert zzso and zzso to zzso within separate zzso pair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice containing the normal or zzso zzso zzso were created, and the zzso association of zzso zzso with zzso was assessed in mice transgenic for both zzso and zzso Analysis by zzso and zzso revealed that zzso but not zzso was essential in the formation of the zzso bond between zzso and zzso in zzso
