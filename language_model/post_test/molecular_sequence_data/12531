Lyn is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso that can readily undergo zzso in zzso The site of zzso is zzso which zzso to the consensus zzso site of other zzso family zzso zzso The rate of zzso is zzso indicating that the reaction follows an zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso of a zzso zzso by Lyn following zzso occurs with a zzso decrease in zzso but no significant change in zzso suggesting that zzso zzso the zzso constraint that prevents binding of the zzso zzso to the active site of the zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso that has previously been shown to bind to the zzso zzso 2 zzso domain of zzso family zzso zzso with high zzso we found that zzso results in a significant decrease in accessibility of the Lyn zzso domain, indicating that zzso changes in the protein zzso domain induced by zzso can be zzso to the zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso plays an important role in regulating Lyn by modulating both its zzso activity and its interaction with other zzso zzso
