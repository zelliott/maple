The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined for zzso zzso zzso receptors were expressed in zzso insect cells or in human embryonic kidney cells and were metabolically labeled with zzso zzso The zzso zzso alpha zzso was not labeled whereas the zzso zzso zzso was labeled after incubation with zzso The zzso labeling of zzso was eliminated by treatment with zzso indicating that the labeling was due to zzso at a zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to demonstrate that zzso of zzso occurs at two zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso domain of the zzso A comparison of the zzso properties of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso currents produced by the zzso zzso zzso were indistinguishable from those of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was a better zzso for protein zzso C than the zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso may not zzso zzso channel function directly but instead affect function indirectly by regulating the zzso state of the zzso
