zzso DNA zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso has been analyzed for its primary structural zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso DNA zzso has a high degree of zzso with that of DNA zzso I from zzso coli and retains many of the zzso acid zzso that have been implicated in the zzso zzso and DNA zzso activities of that zzso zzso with sequences of zzso I and zzso DNA zzso was used to identify regions possibly involved in the high zzso of this zzso Further, zzso acid sequence comparisons of zzso DNA zzso with a large group of DNA zzso previously shown to exhibit little similarity to zzso I indicate certain sequence segments are shared among zzso related DNA zzso These shared regions have been implicated in the zzso zzso function of zzso I, which suggests that the zzso zzso of all these zzso may be zzso zzso
