A novel zzso zzso zzso was previously identified and characterized in the zzso zzso zzso and found to mediate resistance to cadmium zzso zzso six zzso of zzso were identified in zzso zzso Here, we describe two zzso zzso which is metal zzso and zzso which is zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso contain open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso predicted zzso integral membrane zzso which are similar to zzso zzso expression is induced by zzso cadmium, mercury, and zinc exposure as well as by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is zzso expressed at a high level in zzso zzso and expression is not affected by these zzso Both zzso and zzso are transcribed in zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso In addition, zzso is transcribed in developing zzso Like zzso zzso is targeted to zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso expression does not render zzso zzso more susceptible to cadmium zzso however, there is a significant decrease in their lifespan in the absence of zzso Although zzso in which zzso and/or zzso expression is knocked down accumulate fluid in the zzso space, exposure to zzso conditions did not significantly affect growth or reproduction in these zzso These results suggest that zzso expression is required for optimal viability but does not function in zzso
