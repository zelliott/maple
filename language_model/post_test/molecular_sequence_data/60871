The zzso zzso directed against the zzso P proteins zzso zzso are known to react mainly against zzso localized within the common zzso sequence of the three zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to investigate the opportunity to select short zzso peptides of this common zzso sequence to detect the zzso the location of the zzso recognized by zzso proteins zzso zzso of systemic lupus zzso patients zzso was zzso zzso and zzso techniques using extracted or zzso entire or zzso zzso showed that zzso of the zzso zzso were directed against the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso recognized by the zzso zzso are located not only within the zzso sequence common to the three proteins but also within the zzso sequence of the zzso or zzso zzso The other zzso zzso zzso zzso did not react with all three proteins but with some of them, and showed the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They recognized zzso located in the region of the zzso sequence of the protein but not common to the three zzso In addition two out of the six zzso zzso produced by zzso of mice using the zzso protein did not react with the zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso protein or with the zzso sequence of the three zzso In conclusion, this study showed that the zzso zzso in zzso patients are not only directed against zzso within the zzso sequence shared by the three zzso zzso P zzso In view of these data it seems necessary to be cautious in using only a zzso zzso of zzso P proteins in tests performed to detect zzso zzso in human zzso
