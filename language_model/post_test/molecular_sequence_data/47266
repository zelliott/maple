zzso zzso plays an important role in a wide range of biological activities, including differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells into mature zzso At the onset of zzso zzso a set of zzso differentiation primary response zzso genes are zzso including the zzso for zzso In order to examine the molecular nature of the mechanisms by which zzso activates the immediate early expression of zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso A novel zzso response element, zzso zzso to which a zzso protein complex is bound, has been identified on the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was also zzso via the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso binding sites of the zzso promoter, identified as zzso elements in zzso liver cells were found, however, to play no role in zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is shown not to be necessary for zzso zzso by zzso or zzso in liver zzso It appears, therefore, that immediate early zzso of zzso is regulated differently in zzso zzso cells than in zzso liver zzso This indicates that distinct zzso control elements participate in cell zzso induction of zzso by members of the zzso zzso zzso
