Resistance of melon zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso spot virus zzso is inherited as a single zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso described to date zzso zzso except for the zzso strain described here, are able to overcome the resistance zzso by zzso Analysis of zzso of susceptible zzso and resistant zzso melon zzso zzso with zzso or zzso indicated that the resistance trait zzso by this gene is expressed at the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso has a high zzso identity with the sequences of other zzso zzso with the exception of its zzso zzso region zzso where less than 50% of the zzso are shared between zzso and the other two zzso zzso completely zzso to zzso zzso zzso transcribed from a full-length zzso zzso clone were infectious and caused symptoms indistinguishable from those caused by the parental viral zzso This zzso clone allowed generation of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso through the exchange of the last 74 zzso of their coat protein zzso open reading frames and the complete zzso Analysis of zzso of susceptible and resistant melon zzso zzso with zzso zzso clearly showed that the zzso zzso zzso resides in the exchanged zzso The zzso of the zzso of both zzso are zzso therefore, the zzso zzso likely consists of the zzso sequence zzso We also demonstrated that this zzso region contains the zzso for the unique ability of the isolate zzso to zzso zzso hosts zzso zzso and zzso zzso
