zzso zzso rot of zzso zzso lettuce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an emerging disease in zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso are suspected to play an important role in the zzso zzso from infected zzso collected from 14 commercial zzso in zzso yielded 149 zzso that were characterized zzso which included zzso zzso zzso zzso tests by both injection and zzso of lettuce, zzso zzso FAME analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequencing, as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a fluorescent pigmentation and were associated with the zzso zzso Fifty-five of them induced an zzso zzso reaction in tobacco zzso zzso The other 43 fluorescent zzso were most probably zzso bacteria and about half of them were able to cause rot on potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the genetic diversity of the zzso zzso rot zzso The delineated zzso patterns matched quite well with zzso zzso defined on the basis of colony appearance and variation in fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence analyses allowed most of the fluorescent zzso to be allocated to zzso and they belonged to either the zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group, or the zzso zzso zzso In particular, the zzso allocated to this latter group constituted the vast majority of zzso zzso and were identified as zzso zzso by zzso zzso They were demonstrated by zzso tests on zzso lettuce to induce the zzso rot disease and could be zzso from zzso of zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso associated with one sample that showed an zzso zzso rot were identified as zzso zzso
