In mouse zzso zzso germ line cells initiate expression of specific genes at subsequent zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is first expressed in zzso zzso in primary zzso and encodes a protein that acts as a zzso To identify zzso zzso factors that control expression of the zzso gene in zzso we performed a zzso zzso screening with a zzso promoter sequence as bait zzso This screening resulted in the identification of mouse zzso as a candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the basic zzso zzso family of zzso factors, and mouse zzso shows zzso zzso acid sequence identity with human zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso interacts with a zzso zzso site that is present in the zzso zzso By using northern zzso zzso and in zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso was detected only in zzso with the highest expression level in primary zzso and round zzso The highest level of zzso protein was found in primary zzso at the zzso stage of zzso zzso where the protein zzso with zzso active zzso
