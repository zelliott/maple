The zzso zzso response after primary zzso infection is delayed relative to the zzso zzso T cell response and the initial decline in plasma zzso Because nearly all zzso infections result in zzso it would be zzso to study cases where zzso zzso production commenced zzso This was done in subject zzso an individual treated during early infection and in whom a rapid zzso zzso zzso response was detected after therapy zzso as rebound zzso declined and remained below 1000 zzso zzso of blood for over zzso zzso This zzso zzso were capable of reducing the zzso of his rebound virus by zzso logs in zzso at a time when rebound zzso was zzso and zzso zzso T cells were zzso suggesting that zzso zzso played an important role in the early control of zzso The rebound virus did not exhibit an unusual zzso that might explain its high sensitivity to zzso by zzso zzso zzso escape occurred within 75 days and was proceeded by zzso zzso production to the escape zzso and subsequent zzso zzso escape was not associated with a significant rise in plasma zzso perhaps due to increasing zzso T cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a growing number of zzso over time, suggesting ongoing viral evolution in the face of potent zzso immune zzso We zzso that an early effective zzso zzso response can provide long-term clinical benefits despite zzso zzso
