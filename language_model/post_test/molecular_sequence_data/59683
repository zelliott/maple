zzso acid zzso is the zzso component of zzso zzso a zzso produced by the plant zzso zzso zzso In the present study we have determined the zzso sequence of a zzso DNA zzso involved in zzso zzso Analysis of the sequence revealed four complete open reading frames zzso designated zzso to zzso and one incomplete zzso zzso all transcribed in the same zzso The predicted translation products of zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso to zzso carrier zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso respectively, which are required for zzso zzso zzso was zzso its sequence was confirmed, and it was zzso in zzso coli to yield a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 6 zzso
