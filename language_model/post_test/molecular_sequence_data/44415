The zzso pattern zzso was extended to permit the detection of all zzso zinc fingers and their parent proteins in the recently completed sequence of the zzso zzso Additionally, a new computer program was written that extracts other zinc binding motifs zzso zzso zzso overlapping with the classical zinc finger pattern, from the found set of zzso zzso zzso The complete and correct detection of all fingers is a prerequisite for the zzso of the zzso zinc finger proteins in functional zzso The detected 53 zzso zzso zinc finger proteins do not contain finger clusters with 10 or more repeats, as is frequently found in higher zzso Only three proteins contain four or more fingers in a zzso Moreover, nearly all 27 zzso proteins with tandem zzso of two or three finger zzso can be classified into nine zzso with high sequence conservation in their finger zzso in particular of their DNA recognition zzso These results and application of the recently elaborated zzso recognition rules suggest that the zzso proteins belonging to the same zzso may recognize identical or very similar DNA zzso
