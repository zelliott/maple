An zzso strain zzso was isolated from marine zzso of Abu zzso Bay, on the western zzso of Alexandria, zzso The zzso was zzso and zzso It produced beige to zzso aerial zzso brown zzso zzso and straight to zzso zzso but no specific spore zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis and zzso markers were consistent with zzso of strain zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as polar zzso zzso of the zzso series from zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso fatty zzso the principal fatty acids being zzso : 0 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the zzso zzso of strain zzso respectively showing zzso and zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso however, moderate zzso zzso values between these two species and strain zzso (44 and 60 zzso zzso showed that strain zzso could be clearly separated from zzso These data, together with distinct zzso traits, led to the conclusion that this isolate represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
