zzso differential display was applied to three small cell lung zzso zzso cell lines, six zzso cell lung zzso zzso cell lines, and three normal lung zzso to identify genes zzso expressed between lung zzso cells and normal lung zzso and between zzso cells and zzso zzso We isolated five zzso expressed zzso two that were novel and three that were already zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso symbol zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso A were expressed in normal lung zzso but not in lung zzso cell lines, whereas zzso zzso symbol zzso and zzso were expressed in lung zzso cell lines but not in normal lung zzso The remaining zzso zzso II, was expressed at a lower level in zzso than in zzso and normal lung zzso These genes were also zzso expressed in primary lung zzso One of the two novel zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso to the zzso zzso The other, zzso encodes a protein with a putative zzso binding site zzso These data provide basic information necessary to understand the differences in gene expression profiles between lung zzso and normal lung and between zzso and zzso Further characterization of these genes will help to clarify the molecular mechanisms of human lung zzso
