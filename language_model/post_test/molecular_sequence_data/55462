zzso species of the spotted fever group zzso are subjected to repeated zzso to the host complement system through zzso infections of zzso and tick zzso The serum complement machinery is a formidable obstacle for bacteria to overcome if they endeavor to endure this zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that that the zzso agent of Mediterranean spotted fever, zzso zzso is susceptible to zzso killing only in the presence of specific zzso zzso We have also shown that in the absence of particular zzso zzso zzso zzso is resistant to the effects of serum zzso We therefore hypothesized that the interactions between zzso complement regulators and zzso zzso outer zzso proteins are critical to mediate serum zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso specifically interacts with the soluble host complement zzso factor zzso zzso of factor H from normal human serum renders zzso zzso more susceptible to zzso and membrane attack complex deposition and to zzso zzso We identified the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso as a factor H zzso and further demonstrate that the zzso zzso is sufficient to mediate resistance to the zzso properties of human zzso Taken together, these data reveal an additional function for the highly zzso zzso surface cell zzso zzso and suggest that the ability to evade zzso clearance from the zzso circulation is a novel zzso attribute for this class of zzso
