During zzso zzso zzso immature zzso differentiate through a zzso intermediate into two functionally distinct mature T cell zzso helper T cells expressing zzso and a major zzso complex zzso class zzso T cell zzso zzso and zzso T cells expressing zzso and and zzso class zzso zzso The mutually exclusive expression of zzso and zzso is maintained in the periphery during expansion of these mature T cell zzso To zzso the mechanisms controlling zzso and zzso expression on zzso zzso and mature peripheral T cells, we have examined the expression of human zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso of transgenic zzso Our analyses demonstrate that sequences contained within or closely linked to the human zzso gene are sufficient to zzso the appropriate regulation of human zzso expression on all zzso and mature peripheral T cell zzso Specifically, appropriate zzso regulation was dependent on two sets of zzso one contained within a zzso restriction zzso located zzso zzso upstream of the human zzso zzso and the other present within or immediately zzso the zzso zzso sequence analysis identified the zzso restriction zzso as the likely human zzso of an zzso found 13 zzso upstream of the mouse zzso zzso initiation zzso The human zzso transgenic mice provide a useful system for the identification and characterization of additional sequence elements that participate in human zzso gene regulation and for the zzso of regulatory mechanisms governing the zzso program zzso the maturation of the zzso and zzso peripheral T cell zzso
