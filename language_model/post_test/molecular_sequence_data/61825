The zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso potential of zzso cells and to the recruitment of zzso during zzso It consists of three structurally zzso zzso with the zzso domain D3 attached to cell zzso through a zzso zzso zzso is susceptible to an zzso processing removing the zzso domain D1 and generating truncated zzso membrane species, thus modulating zzso zzso zzso or truncated zzso can be also released from cells via zzso zzso by zzso and/or by yet unidentified zzso Using a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso cell line and isolated blood zzso we show by protein zzso and flow zzso that the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso G cleave zzso within the zzso zzso zzso while in addition zzso G is highly efficient in zzso the C zzso of zzso The combination of zzso G and zzso provided by zzso zzso results in zzso cooperation leading to the release from zzso cells of a truncated zzso species resembling that previously described in pathological body zzso Using mass zzso analysis, the zzso fragmentation of synthetic peptides mapping the zzso zzso and D3 zzso zzso identifies potential zzso sites for each zzso and suggests the existence of a mechanism regulating the zzso zzso zzso Finally, isolated or combined zzso and zzso G drastically reduce the capacity of cells to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso are thus endowed with high potential for the regulation of zzso expression and function on inflammatory zzso
