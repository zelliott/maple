zzso interactions allow the zzso X zzso zzso to bind to zzso DNA as a zzso or a zzso and to participate in zzso the effects of a variety of hormones on gene zzso Here we report a systematic study of the zzso state of zzso in the absence of a DNA zzso We have used zzso under zzso conditions and chemical zzso to show that in solution, zzso alpha forms zzso as well as zzso The zzso zzso governing zzso and zzso formation were estimated by zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso are formed with a high affinity and that at protein zzso higher than about 70 zzso zzso will constitute the zzso zzso zzso formation may provide an additional level of the regulation of gene zzso zzso by zzso
