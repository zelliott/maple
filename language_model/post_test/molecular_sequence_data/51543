The main objective of the present investigation was to understand the molecular events involved in the genesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were induced in zzso rats with a single injection of zzso zzso zzso have been identified zzso in the colon and are hypothesized to represent zzso zzso In order to understand the molecular events involved in the early stages of colon cancer, zzso DNA from zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso specific for the detection of point zzso in zzso 12 of zzso The zzso identified was a G to A transition resulting in the substitution of the zzso acid zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso This zzso was present in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The identical zzso was also identified in zzso tissue while no zzso could be detected in normal zzso zzso For further confirmation of these results, the presence of the zzso zzso protein zzso was detected in zzso zzso by zzso This investigation provides the first identification of a zzso point zzso in zzso zzso zzso
