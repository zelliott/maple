A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from deep seawater of the East Sea, South zzso zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso often with unequal ends, suggesting a budding mode of zzso The strain had an absolute requirement for sea zzso and tolerated up to 20 % zzso sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used as growth zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso The major fatty acid was summed feature 7 zzso : zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that this strain was affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso zzso zzso and those of type strains of members of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso values between strain zzso and the type strains of members of the zzso zzso were low zzso zzso zzso and zzso differences support assignment of strain zzso to the zzso zzso as a representative of a novel zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
