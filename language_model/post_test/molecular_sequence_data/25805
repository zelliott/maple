Class I genes of the zzso zzso major zzso complex zzso were examined by Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso At least three distinct zzso of zzso class I genes were zzso which we have designated zzso B, and zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso regions zzso the zzso zzso suggested that zzso genes are zzso of mouse zzso D, zzso and Q genes and that zzso genes zzso to mouse zzso zzso The zzso genes appeared similar to mouse zzso zzso The number of unique genes in each zzso cloned from an individual zzso zzso were 20 for zzso 13 for zzso and 2 for zzso Three zzso clones showed zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Six zzso clones remained zzso as they did not zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso B, or C zzso The zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso class I gene zzso was found to be similar to that observed between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso (or zzso zzso similarity of zzso 5 was found to be zzso between zzso class I genes and their zzso zzso
