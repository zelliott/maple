The synthesis of zzso factors in zzso zzso is controlled by a regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of genes coding for zzso toxins and zzso is zzso while zzso of zzso protein genes is zzso by zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso also seems to stimulate translation by an independent zzso In this report we show that in a zzso lacking zzso the rate of zzso zzso production relative to the cellular concentration of zzso zzso was reduced zzso as compared with the zzso zzso A zzso zzso between the zzso end of zzso and the zzso untranslated region of the zzso transcript suggests a direct interaction between the zzso A complex of zzso and zzso zzso was demonstrated in extracts of total zzso from the zzso strain, and also with in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso binding site of the zzso transcript is blocked by zzso zzso zzso with zzso prevents this zzso zzso and makes the zzso zzso accessible for translation zzso This is, to our knowledge, the first example of an zzso zzso that stimulates translation of the target zzso
