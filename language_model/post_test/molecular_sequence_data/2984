Fusion of the zzso envelope with the target cell membrane is a critical step of zzso entry into the target zzso The zzso envelope zzso zzso plays an important role in the fusion of viral and target cell zzso and serves as an attractive target for development of zzso fusion zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains three important functional regions, zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso repeats zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region is composed of zzso zzso zzso that are essential for the initial penetration of the target cell zzso zzso and zzso regions consist of zzso zzso which have the tendency to form zzso coiled zzso During the process of fusion of zzso or zzso cells with zzso cells, zzso zzso into the target cell membrane and subsequently the zzso and zzso regions change zzso and associate with each other to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso and zzso regions, designated zzso and zzso respectively, have potent zzso activity against zzso fusion by binding to the zzso and zzso regions, respectively, to prevent the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may also bind to zzso thereby blocking its zzso into the target cell zzso One of the zzso zzso which is in the phase III clinical trials, has potent in zzso activity against zzso infection and is expected to become the first zzso zzso fusion zzso drug in the near zzso However, this zzso zzso fusion inhibitor lacks oral availability and is sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso it is essential to develop small molecular zzso zzso fusion zzso having a mechanism of action similar to the zzso One of the approaches in identifying the zzso is to use an zzso zzso to screen chemical libraries for the compounds that potentially block the interaction between the zzso and zzso regions to form a zzso zzso zzso In combination with zzso molecular zzso techniques, the first active zzso zzso fusion inhibitor targeting zzso zzso was zzso Other potential candidates of zzso zzso fusion zzso have also been identified using different zzso It is expected that both zzso and zzso zzso fusion zzso will be developed as new classes of zzso drugs, which will be used alone or in combination with zzso reverse zzso and zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso infection and zzso
