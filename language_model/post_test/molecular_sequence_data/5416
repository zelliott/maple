The zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are required to maintain stable expression patterns of zzso genes and other target genes throughout zzso Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel mouse zzso zzso zzso in addition to the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies show that zzso interacts with the mouse zzso zzso zzso and is a new member of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso fusion proteins mediate a five- to tenfold repression of zzso integrated reporter zzso carrying zzso binding sites, demonstrating that these proteins are zzso zzso The zzso gene is localized on zzso 11, in close proximity to the classical mouse zzso tail short zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice display anemia and transformations of the zzso skeleton reminiscent of zzso observed in mice with zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a candidate gene for zzso and zzso
