zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso respiratory chain of zzso coli and functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso I binds all the zzso metal centers, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and serves as a reaction center of the zzso zzso This work focuses on the functional and structural roles of 14 charged zzso acid zzso that are zzso in zzso I of the zzso terminal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by neutral zzso acid zzso did not affect the zzso activity and zzso properties of the zzso zzso In contrast, genetic zzso tests indicated that replacements of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused loss of a diagnostic peak for zzso zzso b in the 77 K zzso difference zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso affected the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specifically eliminated the zzso center from the zzso complex, whereas the zzso zzso did not show significant zzso on the zzso metal centers even though it was still zzso Based on these findings and recent zzso studies on zzso c zzso we discuss the possible roles of the zzso charged zzso acid zzso in zzso I of the zzso terminal zzso
