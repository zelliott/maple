In zzso species, zzso has been mapped genetically to a single zzso zzso In this region, there are two closely linked genes coding for the S locus zzso zzso and S locus zzso zzso zzso They appear to comprise the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are thought to recognize an unknown zzso component on the incompatible zzso and the gene zzso this zzso component must also be linked to the zzso and zzso zzso To further our understanding of zzso the zzso region carrying the zzso and zzso genes has been zzso The physical region between the zzso and the zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso line was zzso and a search for genes expressed in the zzso revealed two additional S locus genes located downstream of the zzso zzso Because these two genes are novel and are zzso at other S zzso we designated them as zzso and zzso (for S zzso genes 1 and 2, zzso The zzso gene is S locus specific, whereas the zzso gene is not only present at the S locus but is also present in other parts of the zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is only zzso in zzso of zzso plants and is zzso regulated during zzso development, whereas the zzso gene is expressed in zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso plants, with the highest levels of expression occurring in the zzso Although zzso and zzso are linked to the S locus region, it is not clear whether these genes function in zzso or serve some other cellular roles in zzso zzso
