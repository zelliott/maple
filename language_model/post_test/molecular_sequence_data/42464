zzso is usually not a zzso zzso of zzso sugar zzso Our previous study showed that the zzso sugar chains of bovine zzso prepared from milk fat zzso zzso zzso contain this unique zzso as the zzso beta zzso group zzso et zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso Western zzso analysis of bovine zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds zzso terminating with either an zzso or zzso zzso showed that zzso binding is observed for most of the protein bands as detected with zzso zzso Blue zzso However, no zzso binding was observed for protein bands after treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso analyses of the sugar chains released by zzso from the zzso zzso by sequential zzso zzso and by zzso analysis revealed that zzso which bound to a zzso column, are zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sugar chains with the zzso beta zzso group in their outer chain zzso while zzso which passed through the column, were of zzso zzso and zzso of which the latter two groups contained the Gal beta zzso zzso These results indicated that many bovine zzso zzso contain zzso sugar chains with the zzso beta zzso zzso
