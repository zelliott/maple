Plants exhibit various kinds of movements that have fascinated scientists and the public for zzso zzso studies in plants with the so-called motor organ or zzso suggest that cells at opposite sides of the zzso mediate leaf or leaflet movements by swelling and zzso How motor organ identity is determined is zzso Using a genetic approach, we isolated a zzso designated zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso that fails to fold its leaflets in the dark due to loss of motor zzso zzso cloning indicated that zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso in zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in primordial cells that give rise to the motor zzso zzso expression of zzso resulted in dwarf plants with zzso and zzso reduced in zzso and the zzso cells gained characteristics of motor organ zzso zzso By identifying zzso zzso from other zzso species, namely pea zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that this motor organ identity is regulated by a zzso molecular zzso
