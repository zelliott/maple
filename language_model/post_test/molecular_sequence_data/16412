Ten highly zzso zzso peptides were zzso and tested for zzso activity against zzso zzso virus 1 and 2 zzso and zzso Several of the peptides were found to exhibit zzso zzso The peptides affinity for zzso zzso zzso increased with the number of zzso zzso Net charge could be decisive for the zzso activity, while secondary structure of the peptides seems more important for the zzso zzso The peptides were able to inhibit the entry of zzso into the host cell, probably by blocking HS at the cell zzso zzso plaque formation was inhibited in a zzso manner when cells were exposed to the peptides prior to the addition of zzso Lower zzso activity was observed when the virus was allowed to attach to the cell surface before the addition of zzso However, the plaque size was smaller compared to the zzso control, indicating that the peptides may also interfere with zzso spread of the zzso The two most potent zzso peptides exhibited zzso with zzso against zzso
