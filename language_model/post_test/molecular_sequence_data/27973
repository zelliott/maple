The cellular zzso acid binding protein is thought to be involved in the zzso signal zzso zzso We have isolated the mouse cellular zzso acid binding protein zzso from an zzso cell line by using differential zzso cloning zzso In zzso zzso on sections of mouse zzso of various zzso stages indicated that the cellular zzso acid binding protein zzso which we localized on mouse zzso 9, is zzso expressed in a zzso of zzso zzso This restricted expression pattern suggests an important role for cellular zzso acid binding protein in zzso zzso
