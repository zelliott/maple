zzso zzso zzso a positive regulator of the production of zzso zzso is zzso regulated by the competence zzso factor zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to search for a zzso that reduced the repression level of zzso caused by a zzso zzso A new gene exerting positive regulation on zzso was obtained and designated zzso zzso of zzso effect on zzso zzso determination, Northern analysis, and primer extension analyses revealed that the zzso gene contained an open reading frame zzso composed of 317 zzso and was transcribed into an approximately zzso zzso together with its short downstream zzso The expression of zzso is positively regulated by factors such as zzso itself, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that disruption of zzso caused a significant decrease in zzso expression in both zzso and zzso zzso while expression of zzso zzso and zzso was not affected by the zzso An zzso analysis revealed that overproduction of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a regulatory loop between zzso and zzso Several possible mechanisms for positive regulation of zzso by zzso are zzso
