zzso II is a zzso zzso that selectively binds to small synaptic zzso in the zzso nerve zzso Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the zzso region of the human zzso II zzso This sequence is very zzso and lacks a zzso or zzso zzso Two major zzso start sites were zzso A hybrid gene consisting of the zzso coli zzso zzso gene under the control of zzso base pairs of the zzso II zzso region was zzso into zzso and zzso zzso While reporter gene expression was low in zzso and zzso cells, high zzso zzso activities were monitored in zzso zzso zzso However, there was no correlation between reporter gene expression in the zzso cells and zzso zzso II zzso Using zzso binding zzso we showed that the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso specifically contact the zzso II promoter DNA in zzso Moreover, the zzso protein as well as zzso were shown to stimulate zzso of a reporter gene containing zzso II promoter zzso In the nervous system, zzso functions as a zzso zzso with a potential role in synaptic zzso zzso is expressed in the brain and its activity is regulated by proteins zzso from zzso zzso We zzso that zzso and zzso couple zzso signals to long-term responses by regulating zzso II gene zzso
