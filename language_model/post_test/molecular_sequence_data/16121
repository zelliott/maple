zzso host factor zzso of zzso coli is a zzso protein that is involved both in zzso zzso and in regulating the expression of a number of zzso and bacterial zzso We have shown previously that zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso coli is greatly reduced in zzso zzso We report here that zzso specifically protects two sites within the zzso zzso region against zzso I zzso These sites are located upstream from the promoter and in the leader region just prior to the sequence that specifies the zzso The zzso experiments and gel zzso zzso show that these sites have strong affinity for zzso These data and results with zzso promoter zzso suggest a direct role for zzso in expression of the zzso zzso
