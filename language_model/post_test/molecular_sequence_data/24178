zzso proteins constitute a large family of plant specific zzso factors implicated in many different zzso Here we describe zzso a barley gene coding for a zzso zzso whose expression is involved in cold and drought stress zzso zzso was early and zzso expressed during exposure to low zzso temperature, in zzso zzso Furthermore, it showed a continuous induction during zzso and freezing zzso A zzso fusion protein was found to zzso into the nucleus upon introduction into zzso onion zzso zzso expressed zzso was able to bind in zzso to the zzso element zzso also zzso by other zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was zzso and mapped onto the zzso region of the barley zzso zzso zzso and rice sequences zzso to zzso were also zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso factor may play a regulatory role in zzso stress zzso
