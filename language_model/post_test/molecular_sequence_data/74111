zzso proteins are a family of highly zzso zzso that function as small zzso that facilitate a diverse array of cellular processes by binding zzso target zzso One of these processes is the regulation of the cell zzso Here we characterized the role of zzso a zzso zzso in the cell cycle regulation of the fungus zzso zzso We found that this protein is essential in zzso zzso and that it has roles during the zzso transition in this zzso The function of zzso in zzso zzso seems to mirror the proposed role for this protein during zzso zzso cell cycle zzso We provided evidence that in zzso zzso zzso protein binds to the zzso regulator zzso zzso of the roles of zzso during cell cycle regulation in other zzso system let us to discuss the connections between zzso cell cycle regulation and the evolutionary role of zzso proteins in zzso
