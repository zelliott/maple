zzso play important roles in bacterial nutrition and zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene cluster was cloned from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes five zzso zzso B, C, D and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of these proteins showed high similarity with those from other zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso is involved in zzso production, an zzso knockout zzso was constructed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced more abundant zzso than the wild type in zzso zzso When both strains were grown in minimal zzso we could not detect zzso zzso However, it was found that the zzso productivity of the zzso zzso was two folds greater than that of the wild type in minimal medium containing zzso or zzso This variation in zzso production was demonstrated by scanning electron zzso zzso In minimal medium containing zzso both strains produced some zzso without significant difference in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene with the zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso plus promoter regions, was sufficient to restore growth rate and zzso to the wild zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is involved in zzso of peptides and affects zzso zzso
