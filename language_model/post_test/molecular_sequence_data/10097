zzso zzso an zzso involved in the zzso of the neurotransmitter zzso consistently zzso with the zzso deposits characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and may contribute to the generation of zzso proteins and/or physically affect zzso zzso In order to identify the structural zzso of the zzso zzso involved in the zzso induced by zzso we have studied the effect of this zzso zzso on zzso zzso fragments of different zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of the zzso and zzso peptides but not of the zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso was abolished by the presence of either zzso or zzso The effect of the zzso was also zzso using two different zzso fragments, possessing a low and the other a high capacity for zzso The fragments used were zzso and zzso zzso zzso was able to promote the zzso of these fragments in a very specific way and both zzso peptides were able to form zzso zzso as revealed by negative zzso under the electron zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso was bound to zzso as well as to the zzso zzso zzso was seen to form strong complexes with the zzso zzso as such complexes stained positively for both zzso and zzso activity, were resistant to high zzso strength treatment, and were partially sensitive to detergents, suggesting that zzso interactions may play a role in the stabilization of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that such zzso complexes are formed when zzso interacts with the growing zzso zzso and zzso the assembly of zzso zzso This is consistent with the fact that zzso is known to be present within zzso deposits including the zzso diffuse and mature senile plaques found in Alzheimer's zzso
