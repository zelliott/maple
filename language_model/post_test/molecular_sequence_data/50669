Nuclear zzso from zzso cells was gently extracted with a high salt solution and treated with zzso zzso DNA that remained associated with the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragments released into the zzso zzso were isolated respectively and dot zzso to human zzso sequence zzso zzso As the time of zzso I treatment was extended, the amount of zzso zzso DNA decreased while the concentration of zzso sequence in zzso DNA zzso zzso These preliminary results suggest that the zzso sequence is tightly bound to nuclear zzso in zzso zzso
