zzso zzso occurs within a large zzso complex called a zzso This stable complex includes four zzso of zzso zzso each zzso a zzso pair recognition site located near an end of the zzso zzso These zzso recognition sites are critical for assembling the zzso Here we report that when zzso of zzso DNA are zzso the zzso recognition sites permit assembly of zzso in which zzso DNA zzso for some of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso are stable to competitor DNA, actively transpose the zzso DNA, and produce zzso products that had been previously observed but not zzso The strongest zzso of zzso zzso is a DNA zzso containing two zzso recognition sites and no zzso site, but a shorter zzso with just one recognition site is zzso Based on our results, we propose that zzso recognition sites drive assembly of functional zzso in two complementary zzso Multiple recognition sites help physically position zzso zzso in the zzso plus each individual site zzso activates zzso
