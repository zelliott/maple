A full-length zzso gene zzso was isolated from zzso zzso is first zzso in the zzso zzso at the mid zzso zzso The zzso of this expression domain zzso with the anterior pole of the zzso and is offset zzso by about 20 degrees from the animal zzso During the zzso stage, expression is limited to the anterior zzso By the early zzso stage, expression remains in the anterior zzso and also appears in the adjacent anterior zzso By the early zzso zzso expression is zzso in the zzso zzso and in the zzso tip of the zzso zzso is never expressed anywhere except at the anterior tip of zzso zzso and zzso This is the first gene known that exclusively marks the anterior pole of zzso zzso It may, therefore, play an important role in establishing and/or maintaining the zzso zzso
