Two zzso zzso named zzso and zzso have been identified in the human zzso and characterized by zzso zzso These genes are predicted to zzso proteins that are very similar in primary structure to receptors for steroid hormones or zzso hormone zzso In addition, zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso gene products are very similar each other especially at the DNA binding domain zzso zzso and at the putative zzso binding domain zzso zzso Northern zzso with ear DNA zzso of zzso from various zzso of a human fetus reveals that the expression of zzso is high in the liver whereas the expression of zzso is relatively zzso zzso analysis of zzso from sorted zzso shows that the zzso gene is located on zzso 19 and zzso on zzso 5, indicating that the two genes are clearly different from each zzso
