The positive regulatory protein zzso from the zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was first demonstrated to possess zzso capabilities using zzso zzso protein and in zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso This paper is an extension of that research and presents evidence on the in zzso zzso properties of zzso using a zzso interference zzso zzso protein bound specifically to a zzso zzso response element and zzso zzso of a zzso reporter zzso but increased zzso in the absence of a zzso zzso A zzso response in specific zzso was observed upon increasing zzso zzso suggesting that specific binding was zzso affected by protein zzso Certain zzso hybrid proteins also bound the zzso box, but required sequences zzso to zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso These data further zzso a zzso domain within zzso and support a modified model for the regulation of zzso genes in which zzso by the zzso zzso functions to stabilize specific zzso by low zzso of zzso resulting in gene zzso Otherwise, at high zzso zzso promotes expression of the zzso zzso without assistance from zzso as was shown previously zzso et zzso zzso
