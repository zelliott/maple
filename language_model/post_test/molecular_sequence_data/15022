A novel zzso zzso was identified by comparing the expression profiles of human adult and fetal zzso using zzso zzso zzso analysis from multiple human and mouse zzso indicated zzso zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was located in zzso and round zzso of the zzso zzso in human and mouse zzso To further confirm the result from zzso the zzso for human zzso was generated against the protein zzso by the zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was mainly expressed in human zzso with a molecular weight of about 23 zzso zzso showed that zzso was predominantly located in zzso and round zzso consistent with the results from in zzso zzso In order to explore the function of zzso in zzso the study compared the expression of zzso in the zzso from fertile persons and from patients with zzso The results showed that there was less expression in patients with zzso zzso compared with fertile zzso and no zzso zzso at zzso and protein levels in patients with zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was considerably decreased in a zzso manner in the zzso of an zzso mouse model induced by zzso These data suggest that zzso is involved in human and mouse zzso
