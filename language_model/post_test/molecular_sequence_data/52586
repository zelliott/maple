The zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso are converted into potent zzso factors when they are zzso by zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Hardwick, Science zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Griffin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Hardwick, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso of the zzso zzso All tested zzso zzso zzso possess zzso activity, including the more zzso related zzso zzso by zzso zzso 68 zzso and bovine zzso 4 zzso as described zzso To determine if viral zzso proteins can be converted into death factors, similar to their cellular counterparts, five zzso zzso zzso from five different viruses were tested for their zzso to zzso Only the viral zzso protein zzso by zzso was susceptible to zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso products of cellular zzso zzso and Bid, which are potent zzso of zzso the zzso product of zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso was the only viral zzso zzso that was capable of killing cells when expressed as an zzso zzso However, because zzso was not zzso by zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso apparently cannot be zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso virus, and zzso were not zzso by zzso cell extracts and did not possess zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso escape negative regulation by retaining their zzso activities and/or failing to be converted into zzso proteins by zzso during programmed cell zzso
