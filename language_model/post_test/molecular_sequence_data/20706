zzso A is a circular zzso produced by zzso zzso strain zzso We found a zzso zzso designated zzso in this zzso zzso contained 44 open reading zzso including seven genes related to zzso A zzso zzso as well as genes for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was transferred from zzso to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso by filter zzso The zzso exhibited zzso more resistance to zzso A and produced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the producer of zzso 6, was proved to harbor a zzso indistinguishable from zzso and carrying seven genes zzso identical to zzso This suggests that zzso might have been transferred naturally between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The seven zzso genes of zzso were cloned into a zzso zzso to construct zzso zzso zzso transformed with zzso expressed zzso activity and resistance to zzso zzso zzso was zzso more stable than a zzso zzso zzso from which zzso was deleted and even was more stable than the zzso This suggests the occurrence of zzso host killing by the zzso zzso zzso carried a zzso zzso and zzso stabilization of a zzso by the zzso zzso genes was also zzso Thus, zzso was proved to carry the genes for at least two zzso maintenance mechanisms, zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing a zzso gene similar to zzso zzso were distributed in several zzso zzso zzso
