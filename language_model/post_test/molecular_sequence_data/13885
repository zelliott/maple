The gene zzso zzso is restricted in expression to the central nervous system, zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso gene upstream zzso zzso element is a principal zzso of both the tissue specificity and the relative level of zzso gene zzso We have now zzso the rat zzso zzso and analyzed the zzso properties of zzso fusion genes zzso contain zzso and zzso in the zzso after zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso contains both positive and negative elements that are recognized zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso properties of the zzso sequences were more similar in cell lines of zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso The zzso mobility shift zzso was used to identify specific zzso of the zzso that zzso with nuclear proteins from zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso sequences recognized proteins present in both zzso and zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso mobility shift zzso experiments also identified 1) zzso complexes common to both zzso and zzso cell lines and 2) zzso complexes specific to either zzso or zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso designated zzso displayed zzso activity in zzso and zzso but not zzso cell zzso Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the zzso zzso is comprised of multiple positive and negative zzso that likely function in a zzso fashion to regulate zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso
