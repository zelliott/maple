zzso zzso has two zzso zzso and zzso that are able to zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso is found as a structural element of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso contribute to the generation of zzso structures in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso that generate the zzso zzso zzso structure zzso are zzso In contrast, flies doubly zzso for the zzso are viable and zzso Here, we describe the structural analysis of the zzso in zzso zzso and find that in double zzso flies no zzso structure is generated and the zzso zzso zzso We also find that zzso transfer to zzso in the zzso does not occur, demonstrating that this step is dependent on prior or simultaneous transfer of zzso By comparing zzso structures generated in the zzso single zzso we show that zzso is the major zzso for the overall zzso zzso in adult zzso In zzso zzso composition of zzso structures is indistinguishable from zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso precursor structures are accumulating in different steps of zzso zzso without the complete loss of zzso indicating that zzso plays a minor role in generating zzso zzso Together our results demonstrate that both zzso are able to generate zzso structures in zzso zzso although with different contributions in zzso and that the zzso zzso is sufficient to avoid the major zzso consequences associated with the zzso zzso defects in zzso or zzso
