Four zzso of a human zzso of a zzso cell division cycle gene zzso which is thought to zzso a DNA replication licensing zzso have been identified zzso zzso upstream from the start of zzso of the zzso zzso gene on human zzso zzso initially by similarity to a rat zzso zzso replication zzso zzso analysis shows, that unlike zzso zzso is not restricted in its tissue distribution and does not show zzso variation in the level of expression in adult zzso
