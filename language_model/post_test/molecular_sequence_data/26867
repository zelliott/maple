zzso sequence tag zzso data representing transcripts with a high level of differential zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis between adult female and male zzso zzso were subjected to detailed zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso clustered into 209 zzso of which 52 and 157 represented transcripts that were enriched in female and male zzso zzso zzso Thirty zzso of the zzso subset of 52 sequences had zzso in other zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso 13 zzso exclusively in other zzso zzso and nine zzso had no match in any other zzso for which sequence data are currently zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules involved in reproduction as well as embryonic and zzso development, such as zzso and zzso zzso Of the zzso subset of 157 zzso 73 zzso had zzso in other zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso 57 zzso in other zzso zzso only, and 22 zzso had no significant similarity match in any other zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly major zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings of the present study should support further zzso investigations of zzso zzso
