zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso inherited blistering skin disorder associated with fragility at the zzso zzso zzso zzso findings in zzso are abnormalities in the zzso filament zzso These focal attachment structures, which extend from the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso to the underlying basement zzso have been shown to be zzso or zzso in different forms of zzso Previously, in different zzso zzso zzso have been found in the three genes for the zzso filament component zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso and in the gene for the zzso zzso beta 4 zzso Here, we describe the first zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso also known as type zzso collagen zzso The patient is affected with generalized zzso benign zzso zzso zzso a rare zzso of zzso and is a compound zzso for premature termination zzso on both zzso These novel findings emphasize the molecular zzso of this group of zzso and attest to the importance of zzso in maintaining zzso between the zzso and the zzso
