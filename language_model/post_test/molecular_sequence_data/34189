For the identification and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in environmental samples, various zzso zzso targeting zzso markers of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the gene for the zzso of zzso zzso M zzso zzso have been extensively developed and characterized zzso These zzso were designed to resolve different groups of zzso at different zzso levels, and have been widely used as zzso zzso or zzso chain reaction zzso for membrane zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso method, gene zzso DNA zzso and quantitative zzso chain reaction for studies in environmental and zzso zzso In this review, we present a comprehensive list of such zzso zzso which enable us to determine zzso populations in an environment zzso and zzso with examples of the practical applications of the zzso and zzso
