Mass zzso relative zzso of proteins is often achieved by the labeling of two samples with zzso light and heavy zzso The zzso of the zzso with different masses, but same chemical properties, can be reliably used for determining relative zzso Several strategies of labeling with various weakness and strength and degrees of complexity have been zzso In this chapter, we describe a simple and inexpensive zzso procedure based on the use of zzso and zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most commonly used techniques for zzso zzso thus, we emphasize the use of zzso as a labeling procedure for zzso proteins isolated by one- and two-dimensional zzso gel zzso
