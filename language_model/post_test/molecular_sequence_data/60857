zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The present study employs zzso scanning zzso and zzso spin labeling to investigate the structure of the second zzso segment zzso zzso in functional zzso channels zzso in zzso zzso zzso interactions are observed between zzso side chains at zzso sites close to the zzso axis of zzso To aid in quantitative analysis of these zzso a new zzso analogue of the zzso side chain is used to prepare zzso dilute samples with constant zzso Using constraints imposed by the zzso zzso a packing model for this segment is deduced that is in excellent agreement with the recently reported crystal structure zzso zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso The relatively immobilized state of the zzso side chains suggests that the channel is rigid on the electron zzso resonance time zzso Moreover, the poor zzso zzso of the zzso at many locations indicates that the channel is not subject to the zzso fluctuations that permit reaction of buried zzso At sites expected to be located in the zzso the accessibility of the side chains to collision with zzso or zzso zzso is zzso This zzso together with the generally low mobility of the side chains throughout the zzso makes it difficult to detect the presence of the pore based on these zzso However, the presence of a zzso pore can be directly demonstrated using a polarity zzso deduced from the zzso zzso recorded at low zzso These zzso also reveal the presence of a polarity zzso in the zzso zzso
