zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were induced by zzso with a zzso zzso analog zzso catalyze the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate a zzso zzso These zzso stabilize the transition state to catalyze the zzso reaction, strictly according to the theoretical zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso To zzso the molecular basis of the zzso reaction, the crystal structure of zzso was determined, and the binding thermodynamics of zzso and zzso with both the zzso and the zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso A resolution and compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso reported zzso showing that the zzso is bound into the zzso pocket of the zzso site in an zzso zzso manner, especially at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso binds the zzso of the zzso with a positive zzso differing from general zzso characteristics of zzso zzso This positive zzso could be due to the zzso interactions between zzso and the zzso or the zzso zzso by zzso zzso The difference in zzso between zzso and zzso to zzso was larger than that to zzso which is in good correlation with the larger zzso value of zzso Interestingly, the zzso was mainly because of the zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso is suggestive of zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso Together with X-ray structural zzso the zzso analyses suggest that upon binding the zzso the zzso alters the zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso from the zzso Z form to a zzso unstable twisted zzso followed by conversion into the transition zzso zzso strain also contributes to the zzso stabilization by zzso the ground state, and its degree is much larger for the more efficient zzso zzso zzso
