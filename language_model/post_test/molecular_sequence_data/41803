A novel technique that enabled the specific cloning of a DNA zzso unique to the dog Y zzso is zzso The method involves competitive zzso of DNA prepared from male dog zzso with zzso DNA prepared from female dog zzso The zzso zzso and zzso hybrid DNA fragments were removed by capture with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was generated from the remaining fragments by using the zzso zzso of DNA zzso I, followed by direct cloning using a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of putative zzso clones derived by this method has led to the identification of a zzso that zzso specifically to male dog zzso The clones were selected initially on the basis of a differential signal obtained when zzso to zzso of male and female dog DNA immobilized on neural nylon zzso To evaluate its suitability as a probe for zzso grafted cells in transplantation studies, the zzso was labeled with zzso and zzso in zzso to male and female dog tissue zzso The clone designated number zzso zzso strongly to male dog zzso The cloning strategy employed could be extended to other studies in which competitive zzso can be used to identify unique DNA zzso
