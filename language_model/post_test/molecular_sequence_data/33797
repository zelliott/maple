zzso zzso growth zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso Each zzso protein exhibits a distinct growth zzso activity, which resides in the zzso zzso region zzso zzso cells also express unique zzso immunity proteins that specifically block the activity of zzso zzso thereby protecting the cell from zzso Here we show that many zzso systems contain multiple zzso gene fragments that zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso genes are almost always associated with downstream zzso genes to form zzso zzso Comparative zzso analyses suggest that zzso zzso are mobile and exchanged between the zzso systems of different zzso In many instances, orphan zzso zzso are fused to full-length zzso genes in other bacterial zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed that these genes zzso functional zzso zzso Moreover, the orphan module from zzso was functional in zzso zzso when fused to the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the genetic organization of zzso systems shares features with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins also contain zzso zzso regions zzso some of which share significant sequence identity with zzso All zzso genes are followed by small zzso representing possible zzso immunity zzso and several zzso systems zzso orphan zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso have growth zzso activity, which is specifically blocked by zzso zzso immunity zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso competition and that orphan gene zzso expand the diversity of toxic activities deployed by both zzso and zzso zzso
