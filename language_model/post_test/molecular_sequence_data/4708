zzso cells consist of zzso intermediate and mature cells with respect to expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso immature myeloma cells respond to zzso 6 zzso to zzso in zzso but zzso mature myeloma cells have almost no zzso activity with higher zzso activity of zzso in zzso In order to further clarify the biological differences between these immature and mature myeloma cells, we examined survival of these cells with or without zzso in zzso and investigated the underlying mechanism of the zzso or zzso character of these cells by examining expression of cell cycle regulators such as zzso D1 and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso In zzso survival of these myeloma cells was examined by flow zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso myeloma cells rapidly entered zzso without zzso but mature myeloma cells could survive without zzso as well as normal mature plasma zzso zzso myeloma cells as well as myeloma cell lines expressed zzso D1 zzso and zzso but not any zzso zzso On the other hand, mature myeloma cells did not express zzso D1 but expressed zzso not zzso or zzso as well as normal mature plasma zzso Therefore these results show that immature myeloma cells zzso express zzso D1 and can zzso and mature myeloma cells as well as normal mature plasma cells zzso express zzso and can survive for a long time without zzso
