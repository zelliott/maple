zzso is one of three nuclear genes specifically required for translation of the zzso zzso for zzso c zzso zzso III in zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso base pairs zzso of zzso zzso DNA encompassing the zzso locus shows very close spacing between the zzso gene zzso zzso and two unidentified open reading zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso is zzso by the same strand of DNA as zzso and is located 53 zzso downstream of zzso while zzso is zzso on the opposite strand and is located 215 zzso upstream of zzso Five zzso with sizes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are produced from this zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts zzso zzso the zzso transcript encodes zzso and the zzso and zzso transcripts zzso zzso A particularly interesting feature of the zzso zzso unit is a zzso overlap between the zzso zzso transcript produced from one strand and a zzso zzso transcript produced from the opposite zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso transcript zzso the zzso zzso transcript by more than 900 bases and the zzso zzso transcript by at least 200 zzso zzso these pairs of transcripts are zzso to one another and have the potential to zzso in an zzso fashion, the zzso expression of zzso and zzso
