zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of one of the two pathways of zzso zzso in zzso The genes zzso zzso have previously been cloned from zzso zzso and zzso Using differential zzso we isolated zzso zzso clone from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso clone designated zzso contains an insert of zzso zzso The longest open reading frame potentially encodes a zzso of 345 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of 47 zzso and exhibit striking similarity to other zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso to a single transcript with a size of zzso zzso The zzso transcript was first observed in early zzso and increased steadily until it reached fully zzso zzso From the observation it is suggested that zzso is zzso regulated especially during later stage of zzso
