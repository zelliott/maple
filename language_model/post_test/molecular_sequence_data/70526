zzso zzso zzso which is a critical zzso in DNA zzso repair that recognizes and removes zzso from DNA, is specifically and zzso inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso A paradox for the highly specific zzso zzso of zzso is how zzso can successfully mimic DNA backbone interactions for zzso without resulting in significant zzso with numerous other zzso that possess DNA backbone binding zzso zzso X-ray crystal structures of zzso both free and in complex with zzso and the functionally defective zzso zzso zzso coli zzso reveal the detailed molecular basis for duplex DNA backbone mimicry by zzso The overall shape and charge distribution of zzso most closely resembles a zzso in a trajectory between zzso DNA and the zzso DNA observed in zzso product zzso Thus, zzso targets the mechanism of zzso flipping by zzso and appears to be a zzso mimic for zzso of zzso zzso from zzso Essentially all the exquisite shape, zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso interaction is zzso except for a key flip of the zzso zzso zzso group and zzso zzso which is triggered by the formation of the zzso zzso changes between zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso involve the zzso structural zzso which we have named for the zzso pairing observed between zzso zzso A similar zzso is observed in the conversion between the open and closed forms of zzso The combination of extremely high levels of pre-existing structural zzso to DNA binding features specific to zzso with key local zzso changes in zzso resolves the zzso paradox and suggests a potentially general structural solution to the formation of very high affinity DNA zzso complexes that avoid zzso zzso
