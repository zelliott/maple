A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library of zzso coli K-12 DNA by zzso to zzso zzso in an zzso coli strain lacking both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities zzso zzso zzso expression of a series of plasmids containing deletions in the zzso structural gene was employed to map the position and orientation of the gene on the cloned DNA zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing the gene was cloned into the sequencing zzso zzso for zzso DNA zzso the zzso coding region consists of zzso zzso The zzso was zzso from an zzso strain of zzso coli harboring the zzso zzso in which the level of zzso zzso was elevated zzso to zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a protein of zzso molecular weight and has a turnover number of 1,450 zzso in the standard zzso These values are to be compared with previously reported values of 133,000 for the molecular weight and zzso zzso for the turnover number of the zzso zzso zzso from a zzso strain of zzso coli B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dunham, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Matthews, zzso zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso Limited zzso of the native zzso with zzso resulted in loss of zzso activity but retention of bound zzso on a zzso zzso of 28,000 molecular zzso This zzso has been shown to extend from zzso zzso to zzso 900 of the zzso deduced zzso acid zzso
