zzso was zzso with zzso in 6 M zzso and two zzso fragments from zzso 4 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Holmes zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso fragments were identified as segments from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Their effects on zzso zzso induced by 50 or 100 zzso zzso were studied by measuring the increase in zzso by the falling ball zzso The zzso zzso decreased the rate of zzso zzso and increased the critical concentration for the zzso Based on the atomic model of the zzso filament zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso the zzso is presumed to bind to the barbed end of the zzso filament and inhibit the zzso By assuming that the zzso affected the rate of association of the zzso zzso to the end of the zzso filament, zzso zzso for the zzso zzso were zzso zzso results indicated that the zzso constant of the zzso zzso for zzso is 200 to 260 zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso only slightly inhibited zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso interface in the region between zzso and zzso has a stronger interaction than those between zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso present in the zzso segment is zzso to a common sequence in the zzso capping domain of various zzso zzso
