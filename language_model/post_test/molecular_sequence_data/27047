zzso small zzso zzso zzso generally recognize target zzso in the zzso region to prevent zzso zzso from initiating zzso It was thought that the zzso coding sequence zzso was zzso to zzso repression, because zzso zzso zzso have an efficient zzso zzso activity that prevents stable target zzso We report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso duplex within the zzso zzso zzso that is essential and sufficient for zzso zzso does not inhibit zzso initiation at this downstream position but instead acts by accelerating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose an alternative zzso zzso within bacterial zzso wherein zzso repress targets by zzso zzso zzso rather than by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The discovery of zzso targeting markedly expands the sequence space for zzso target predictions in zzso
