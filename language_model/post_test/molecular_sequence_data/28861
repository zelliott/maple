The zzso sequence and associated zzso tract are firmly established zzso signals in zzso In plants, however, these signals have not been characterized in zzso The potato zzso zzso 2 (9 zzso requires a zzso sequence positioned around 50 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso site of the neighboring zzso and a zzso element found adjacent to the zzso in the upstream zzso zzso et zzso zzso 2000, zzso zzso the sensitivity of this plant zzso system, these elements have been characterized by systematic zzso and analysis of the effect on inclusion of the zzso zzso of the zzso sequence in all possible positions demonstrated that zzso matching the consensus, zzso were most efficient at supporting zzso zzso sequences that differed from this consensus were still able to permit zzso inclusion but at greatly reduced zzso zzso of the downstream zzso element suggested that it functioned as a zzso tract rather than a zzso element, common to plant zzso The minimum sequence requirement of the zzso tract for efficient zzso was two closely positioned groups of zzso zzso zzso long zzso zzso apart) that, within the context of the zzso system, required being close zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The functional characterization of the zzso sequence and zzso tract defines these sequences in plants for the first time, and firmly establishes zzso tracts as important signals in zzso of at least some plant zzso
