zzso a Not (for zzso family zzso zzso is expressed in the chick zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso is zzso as the zzso derived zzso moves forward zzso to form a layer beneath it, which is of particular interest considering the known zzso role of the zzso in axis formation in the zzso Both zzso and zzso acid are able to activate zzso expression in cultured zzso cells and show a strong synergistic effect when applied in zzso Strong zzso of zzso transcripts in the presence of zzso also indicates the presence of a potent and zzso zzso inhibitor capable of modulating zzso zzso During zzso zzso transcripts become localized specifically to zzso associated with zzso function zzso zzso head process, zzso The expression data and the response to zzso inducing factors and zzso zzso signals suggest that zzso may be involved in zzso of the embryonic body axis and could play a part in regulating features of the zzso organizer in the chick zzso
