Using an zzso transient zzso we screened the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus for proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso Among eight proteins tested, only a zzso protein zzso was able to suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso of the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso Restoration of zzso expression by zzso under these conditions had no apparent effect on zzso of the small interfering zzso In addition, zzso elevated the transient expression level of the zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Similar activities were detected using zzso of zzso zzso by other members of the zzso zzso Computer analysis indicated that zzso proteins constitute a novel protein family that is unrelated to other recognized zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso distribution in zzso plants revealed that zzso is zzso between soluble zzso form and zzso inclusion bodies at the cell zzso
