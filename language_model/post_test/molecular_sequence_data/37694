We report that the expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene is subject to negative regulation by the zzso 3' zzso zzso This repression occurred both in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso When the zzso promoter was replaced with a zzso promoter or when the orientation of the zzso 3' zzso region was zzso the zzso effect was still zzso However, the zzso 3' zzso region was unable to exert repression on a zzso gene when fused downstream in either orientation, and it was incapable of acting in zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso analyses revealed that the repression occurred at the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the regulatory site responsible for the repression is located within a zzso region immediately following the zzso zzso zzso mechanisms for this repression are zzso
