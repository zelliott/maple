Human zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso Id, which have been detected on the lupus zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the variable regions of zzso and zzso clones were analogous except for one zzso difference in the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene segments of zzso clone were identical with zzso genes zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso heavy chains were zzso rich and zzso contained an zzso acid stretch, zzso the zzso sequence of zzso which was shared among zzso of several zzso zzso zzso frequency analysis using a limiting dilution method revealed that zzso zzso clones at precursor cell level increased in lupus zzso These findings suggest that some zzso zzso clones which express zzso Id associated with lupus zzso use zzso genes without zzso and they may be zzso expanded at the precursor cell levels as well as at the mature cell zzso
