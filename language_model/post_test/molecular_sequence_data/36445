The zzso zzso of eight zzso zzso obtained by bacterial zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso were recorded in order to construct an zzso data base of zzso zzso and to investigate the effects of zzso on the zzso chemical zzso These shifts were assigned by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicated the zzso zzso Two sets of zzso signals were observed, corresponding to the alpha and beta zzso of these zzso except those containing zzso zzso zzso in which only one set of signals appeared, corresponding to the alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso bound to an zzso carbon atom and those bound to the immediately neighboring carbon atoms were shifted downfield by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso containing the zzso zzso the signals of the zzso bound to zzso and zzso were shifted zzso by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, but that of zzso was shifted downfield by zzso zzso when compared with those of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso position of zzso zzso or the zzso position of delta zzso zzso zzso the signal of the zzso zzso of delta zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso was shifted zzso by zzso zzso indicating the zzso interaction of the two sugar zzso zzso These effects of zzso on chemical shifts are zzso
