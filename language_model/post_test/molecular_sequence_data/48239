The zzso response to zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso in zzso mice is directed against an zzso zzso zzso zzso presented in the context of zzso and is restricted primarily to zzso T zzso zzso expressing the zzso and zzso gene zzso We decided to examine the zzso response in zzso zzso zzso mice which are unable to express the dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso due to a large deletion at the zzso locus that includes the zzso gene zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso mice were still able to reject zzso tumor cells and direct ex zzso analysis of peripheral blood zzso from these immune mice revealed a dramatic increase in zzso cells utilizing the same zzso gene segment in association with two different zzso segments zzso and zzso Surprisingly, all these zzso recognized the same zzso zzso gag zzso Analysis of the zzso repertoire of individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice revealed a clear hierarchy in zzso zzso with a preferential usage of the zzso gene segment, whereas zzso and especially zzso were used to much lesser zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso regions of zzso clones specific for the zzso gag zzso revealed a diverse repertoire of zzso chains in zzso mice and a highly restricted zzso repertoire in zzso mice, whereas zzso sequences were highly zzso in both zzso zzso our data indicate that the zzso zzso gag zzso can be recognized in a zzso fashion by different zzso zzso and that the degree of zzso diversity varies according to zzso zzso
