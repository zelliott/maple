Two human melanoma cell lines were zzso with the human zzso zzso and zzso genes using zzso gene zzso zzso high-level zzso expression was zzso The in zzso growth of zzso tumors was zzso Neither of the zzso melanoma cell lines grew in zzso mice, whereas one zzso melanoma line showed retarded in zzso zzso This is consistent with animal studies suggesting a predominantly zzso response to zzso tumors and a more zzso response to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso melanoma cell lines could induce zzso zzso in mixed zzso zzso The expression of putative melanoma zzso zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso zzso In one cell line, zzso zzso resulted in a marked zzso of the zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso The results allow a comparison of zzso properties of zzso and zzso human melanoma cell lines in consideration of their use in genetically engineered tumor zzso zzso zzso results in stable zzso expression and zzso zzso that appear to be favorable for enhanced zzso and it deserves clinical zzso
