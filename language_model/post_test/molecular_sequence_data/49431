This study describes zzso cloning and characterization of mouse zzso The zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso about zzso of magnitude more active in zzso with zzso than with zzso zzso recognizes as zzso zzso generated in zzso cells by the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to zzso a path of zzso acid zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis showed expression of zzso zzso in adult mouse liver and zzso In zzso zzso revealed expression of zzso in liver on zzso day zzso in adult zzso and kidney zzso zzso confirmed zzso expression in zzso and showed that zzso also express zzso zzso and zzso zzso expresses the zzso protein primarily in the zzso and zzso convoluted zzso of the zzso but not in the zzso or the zzso zzso expresses zzso in the zzso convoluted zzso of the zzso but not in the zzso convoluted zzso or zzso zzso expresses zzso and zzso in the zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso its expression in fetal liver, and its unique expression pattern in adult kidney compared with zzso zzso and zzso suggest that it could meet specific needs for zzso acid zzso
