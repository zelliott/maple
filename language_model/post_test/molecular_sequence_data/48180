The zzso of zzso zzso harbors a gene coding for a zzso protein which shows zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the zzso coli zzso zzso protein zzso The expression of the zzso gene is tightly regulated by zzso immunity zzso It is completely zzso during zzso growth and only zzso expressed during zzso growth, as zzso by an zzso fusion zzso When cloned on an zzso zzso the zzso gene is able to suppress the zzso zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso indicating that the two proteins are functionally zzso Many zzso and zzso plasmids do not rely on the zzso protein provided by their host zzso but code for their own zzso zzso However, the close relationship between zzso and the zzso protein of the zzso host, zzso coli, raises questions about the functional significance of the zzso zzso
