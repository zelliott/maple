During zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is induced to generate the important zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and NO in rat zzso We found that the stability of zzso zzso changed during the induction and that the zzso zzso strand corresponding to the zzso region zzso of zzso zzso was transcribed from the zzso zzso zzso levels of the zzso AS transcript correlated with those of zzso zzso The zzso region zzso to zzso gene zzso 27 was involved in zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that sense zzso to zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso levels in the zzso by blocking the interaction between zzso zzso and the AS zzso zzso of zzso AS transcript stabilized the reporter zzso zzso through the fused zzso zzso zzso These results together with the data in a zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso AS transcript zzso with zzso zzso and stabilized zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso protein zzso a human zzso of embryonic zzso visual zzso and zzso nuclear zzso L zzso zzso in the zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso further revealed that the zzso AS transcript zzso with zzso which zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso the AS transcript, and the zzso proteins may mutually zzso 

The natural AS transcript of the zzso gene interacts with zzso zzso and may play an important role in the stability of zzso zzso This zzso interaction may be a new therapeutic target for zzso inflammatory zzso
