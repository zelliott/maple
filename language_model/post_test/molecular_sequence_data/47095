zzso is an zzso zzso zzso in which three urinary zzso have been zzso The gene responsible for type I, zzso encodes the zzso acid zzso zzso This gene is not responsible for types II or zzso Recently the type III locus zzso was mapped by two groups to overlapping zzso regions on zzso zzso In the present study, we restrict the critical region for zzso I zzso to zzso zzso by zzso analysis in Italian, German, and Spanish zzso For this purpose, we have used the zzso markers described in the region plus new zzso that we have zzso Our results locate the zzso I zzso gene in an zzso flanked by the markers zzso and zzso which are about zzso zzso zzso
