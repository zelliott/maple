zzso zzso is an important pathogen that causes disease in young and elderly zzso The currently available zzso vaccines have limited efficacy in those age groups most susceptible to zzso zzso This study focuses on mapping the zzso of a surface protein of zzso zzso by zzso a 15 zzso zzso display library using 5 different zzso zzso zzso against the zzso surface zzso A zzso zzso is a component of the bacterial cell wall that is highly species specific and is involved in bacterial adherence and zzso zzso of the zzso display library reveals three distinct zzso on the zzso zzso The sequence zzso of these zzso ranges from two to six zzso acids when compared to the native zzso protein type zzso Two of these zzso have been evaluated for their zzso in zzso The zzso selected by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is referred to as the consensus zzso and is zzso in zzso zzso zzso response is observed in mice zzso with zzso of the consensus zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso The zzso response is significantly lower than the response to the zzso native zzso The zzso selected by zzso zzso zzso in its zzso form is significantly protective in mice challenged with zzso zzso zzso 2 when compared to mice zzso with the native zzso These results show that the selected zzso of zzso protein are zzso and protective in zzso These zzso need to be evaluated further as alternatives to currently available zzso
