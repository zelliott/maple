The zzso zzso inherited disease zzso type 1 zzso is caused by zzso of a large gene zzso 59 zzso which code for a protein with zzso zzso acids called zzso zzso an expressed zzso site in zzso 5 of the zzso zzso the expression of its zzso was zzso zzso by scanning radioactive zzso fragments of this zzso prepared from the zzso of zzso cell cultures from 15 zzso patients and of white blood cells from one zzso zzso Thirteen of the zzso preparations yielded unequal amounts of the zzso zzso The zzso of the expression ratios zzso from zzso ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso messages were equally represented in the zzso preparations from five zzso healthy zzso Apart from zzso this phenomenon could also be detected in zzso zzso from normally pigmented skin and zzso from a zzso spot of one zzso Only one of three patients affected by stop zzso exhibited unequal zzso zzso When nuclear zzso from 10 of the 13 patients was zzso equal amounts of the primary transcripts were found zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that unequal expression on the level of zzso was not caused by zzso affecting zzso zzso The ratio of the amount of zzso to that of zzso GAP did not seem to be correlated with the extent of unequal zzso zzso
