The zzso required in the zzso M zzso reaction was shown to be a large zzso with an Mr of zzso in the free acid zzso The zzso named zzso for zzso reducing factor, was identified from analyses by fast atom zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Tanner, zzso zzso & Wolfe, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso and is linked to zzso of zzso acid of the zzso through a zzso zzso zzso It is zzso that this bond is responsible for the instability of the zzso and its zzso during zzso zzso of zzso and zzso plots of the zzso M zzso reaction indicate that zzso has a zzso lower zzso than zzso and a 50% greater zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso may be of importance in the binding of zzso to the zzso active zzso
