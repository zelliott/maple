The zzso major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso zzso is structurally similar to the human zzso class zzso zzso zzso but exhibits characteristics similar to those of the class zzso gene zzso These include limited zzso alternative zzso of a single message, and restricted tissue distribution, with high expression in the zzso In order to determine whether regulatory elements controlling expression of zzso resemble those of zzso or zzso we cloned the zzso and 3' untranslated regions of zzso zzso sequence comparisons showed that potential regulatory elements in zzso zzso resembled those in zzso and differed in major respects from those in zzso Unlike zzso zzso contained an intact zzso zzso response element zzso in the zzso Studies using zzso reporter zzso showed that the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso and its response to zzso was similar to that of class zzso zzso zzso Further, we identified an zzso in the 3' untranslated region of zzso that is known to be functional in zzso but is deleted in zzso These experiments predict that functional studies may demonstrate differences in regulation of expression of zzso and zzso zzso which could restrict the use of the zzso as a zzso model for studying zzso expression and zzso
