zzso zzso has a variety of biological functions and serves as a zzso for zzso zzso because of the elevated presence of zzso zzso zzso in this type of zzso In this study we zzso a novel zzso zzso from the mushroom zzso zzso by zzso zzso and affinity zzso on zzso The zzso zzso was designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso acid sequencing indicate that zzso has a molecular mass of zzso zzso and consists of 40 zzso acids zzso zzso focusing of the zzso showed bands near zzso zzso The zzso activity was stable between pH zzso and zzso and at temperatures ranging from 0 to 100 zzso for incubation times of 30 zzso When zzso was investigated with frontal affinity zzso using 132 zzso zzso it was found that the zzso binds only to core zzso zzso and not to other types of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso bound to zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso In addition, zzso was able to demonstrate the differential expression of zzso zzso between primary and zzso colon cancer zzso Thus, zzso will be a promising tool for analyzing the biological functions of zzso zzso and evaluating zzso zzso as cancer zzso
