zzso virus zzso zzso zzso contains two large open reading frames zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso that function primarily in viral zzso replication and a zzso zzso zzso the viral structural zzso zzso processing of the RV zzso zzso translation product zzso is essential for viral zzso zzso of zzso to two mature products zzso and zzso in the order zzso is carried out by an zzso zzso residing in the zzso region of zzso The RV zzso zzso zzso belongs to a viral zzso zzso family that zzso the zzso both in trans and in zzso A zzso X domain of unknown function was found from previous sequence analysis to be associated with zzso To define the zzso responsible for zzso and zzso activities and the function of the X domain in terms of zzso activity, an in zzso translation system was zzso We demonstrated that the zzso region from zzso 920 to zzso is necessary for zzso zzso The domain from zzso 920 to zzso is not required for zzso zzso The X domain located between zzso zzso and zzso outside the regions responsible for both zzso and zzso activities of zzso was found to be important for zzso zzso activity but not for zzso zzso Analysis of sequence zzso and secondary structure of the RV zzso zzso region reveals a folding structure similar to that of zzso
