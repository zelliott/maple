zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the induction of pathological zzso These zzso are believed to stabilize the zzso zzso and thus promote zzso zzso However, the zzso behind the pathology induction has not been zzso An example of a TM domain zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso linked to zzso syndrome with zzso zzso as well as to zzso zzso Here, we determine the free energy of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso TM domain in zzso zzso using zzso resonance energy transfer, and we show that hydrogen bonding between zzso and the adjacent zzso in the zzso is a feasible mechanism for zzso zzso The measured change in the free energy of zzso due to the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso consistent with previous reports of hydrogen bond strengths in zzso This is the first quantitative measurement of zzso zzso stabilization in a membrane zzso We show that this seemingly modest value can lead to a large increase in zzso fraction and thus profoundly affect zzso signal zzso
