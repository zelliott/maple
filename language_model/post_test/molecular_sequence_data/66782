zzso of the zzso of buried zzso zzso is an important reporter of protein zzso Human zzso zzso is a very stable eye lens protein that must remain soluble and folded throughout the human zzso zzso of non-native or zzso damaged zzso is associated with the prevalent eye disease zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso each containing a pair of highly zzso buried zzso The overall zzso of the zzso is zzso in the native state despite the absence of the metal zzso or zzso We report the results of detailed quantitative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the quantum yields of numerous zzso zzso of zzso From zzso of triple zzso to zzso zzso the zzso pair zzso and zzso were found to be extremely zzso with quantum yields close to zzso The zzso pair zzso and zzso were moderately zzso with quantum yields of zzso and zzso zzso In an attempt to identify zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso a set of 17 candidate zzso acids around zzso and zzso were zzso with neutral or zzso zzso None of these zzso showed significant changes in the zzso intensity compared to their own zzso zzso quantum zzso mechanical zzso simulations with the four different excited zzso as electron donors strongly indicate that electron transfer rates to the zzso backbone of zzso and zzso are extremely fast relative to those for zzso and zzso This is in agreement with the quantum yields measured zzso and consistent with the absence of a zzso side zzso zzso electron transfer to the backbone is possible for zzso and zzso because of the net favorable location of several charged zzso and the orientation of nearby waters, which collectively stabilize electron transfer zzso The zzso zzso zzso of single and double zzso to zzso zzso provide strong evidence for energy transfer from zzso to zzso in the zzso domain and from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso The backbone zzso of zzso in zzso may have evolved in part to enable the lens to become a very effective zzso zzso while the efficient zzso provides an in zzso mechanism to protect the zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso
