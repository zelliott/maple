zzso mental zzso zzso is an extremely zzso condition that account for zzso of all mentally retarded zzso The number of genes newly reported in relation with this condition has been rapidly increased in the past zzso One of the latest is called zzso zzso interactive domain zzso zzso This gene encodes for a member of a recently discovered protein family that zzso zzso zzso suggesting a possible role in zzso regulation and in the modification of zzso zzso In this work we describe the results obtained by screening zzso gene in 24 mentally retarded males with history of at least two affected zzso zzso we have found a novel zzso zzso in zzso 10 of the gene that results in a zzso change at zzso zzso zzso This zzso change appears to be restricted to mentally retarded patients, since it has not been detected in control zzso zzso analysis has confirmed the segregation of this zzso with mental zzso Furthermore, sequence alignment analysis with the different members of the human zzso family and with zzso proteins of mouse and fruit fly has revealed that the affected zzso acid is zzso Our data highlights the importance of reporting zzso in this gene since it might support the recent findings that implicates zzso with zzso
