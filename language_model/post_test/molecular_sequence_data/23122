zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed an approximately 555 zzso 3' coding extension to zzso An zzso was generated against this predicted zzso extension to determine if the unique zzso protein is zzso Western zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that the protein was predominantly expressed in zzso zzso expression was detected in other male zzso but the protein was not detected in female zzso This is the first report documenting the expression of a zzso protein with a long zzso in zzso Its universal presence in zzso zzso zzso suggests a functional significance for the zzso
