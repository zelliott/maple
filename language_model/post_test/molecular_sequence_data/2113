A zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in an unusual and highly zzso spatial pattern in zzso of two different species of sea urchin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso shows that this zzso accumulates initially throughout the zzso zzso however, between zzso and zzso zzso the region containing zzso zzso zzso gradually until only a small area around the zzso is labeled in zzso zzso zzso zzso appears zzso uniform and also accumulates uniform levels of other zzso zzso zzso the zzso pattern reveals a previously zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells and a polarity within this zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene product probably is not involved in initial zzso of cell fate, as this message does not achieve a significant fraction of its peak abundance until almost zzso zzso stage, well after the time zzso zzso cells have initiated a zzso program of gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso protection analyses revealed low levels of zzso zzso in all adult zzso zzso However, this message was not zzso in mature eggs, suggesting that the zzso gene does not have a maternal zzso In addition to highly zzso spatial and zzso patterns of zzso the zzso box genes of these two zzso species also are zzso highly in sequences outside the zzso domain, despite the divergence of these two species zzso zzso Two notable features of the protein shared with several zzso zzso proteins are a short zzso sequence zzso by an zzso upstream of that zzso the zzso domain and a large region of high zzso and zzso zzso
