The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso (for negative zzso zzso acts together with zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso to cause zzso pausing of zzso zzso II zzso zzso activity is associated with five zzso A to zzso zzso has sequence similarity to zzso delta zzso zzso the viral protein that binds to and activates zzso whereas zzso is an zzso protein whose zzso activity is critical for zzso zzso To understand the interactions of zzso zzso and zzso at a molecular level, we identified the B, C, and D proteins of human zzso zzso is identical to zzso recently reported to associate with the product of breast cancer zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso are highly related or identical to the protein called zzso of unknown zzso zzso and zzso or zzso are integral zzso that bring zzso and zzso together, and zzso of these four proteins in insect cells resulted in the zzso of functionally active zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso complexes indicated that the small region of zzso with similarity to zzso is critical for zzso binding and for zzso zzso This study defines several important zzso interactions and opens the way for understanding the mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
