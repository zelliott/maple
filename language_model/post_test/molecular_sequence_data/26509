This study evaluated four zzso peptides with known zzso activities for zzso activity against zzso zzso and assessed zzso relationships using zzso zzso The peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the six zzso substitution peptides of zzso were zzso zzso and evaluated for zzso activity using the bacteria, zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The peptides zzso and zzso inhibited growth of all four zzso tested, with activities of a similar order of magnitude to zzso and ethanol zzso zzso inhibited the growth of the bacteria, but zzso showed no zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed the highest overall zzso activity and zzso showed no zzso overall, the activities of the zzso were consistent with their zzso Some peptides with zzso activity also show zzso activity, suggesting that zzso peptides may exert beneficial effects via a number of zzso
