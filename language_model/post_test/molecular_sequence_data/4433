The sequencing of zzso zzso has suggested that the essential protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is absent from such zzso However, a single zzso protein with zzso zzso activity was zzso from zzso zzso and the gene that encodes this protein was zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso is similar to open reading frames of zzso function in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso but is unrelated to zzso zzso proteins reported in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso acid motifs characteristic of the zzso zzso domain identifies zzso zzso zzso as a class I zzso zzso in contrast to the known examples of this zzso which are class II zzso These data question the concept that the zzso of zzso zzso does not vary throughout living zzso
