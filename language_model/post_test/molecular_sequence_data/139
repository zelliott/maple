zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to play a central role in zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso We identified two discrete zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso in zzso zzso The similarities in sequence and zzso structure of the two zzso zzso and zzso suggest that they arose by gene zzso and that this occurred before separation of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes have different expression patterns in diverse stages of the zzso whereas both are equally expressed in the blood dwelling stages zzso and zzso zzso expression was higher in free living zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the role of each zzso in zzso of zzso eggs and the early stages of zzso development by zzso interference zzso Using zzso we observed marked and specific reduction of zzso along with a loss of zzso activity in soluble zzso extracts against the diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso or both together, was accompanied by zzso zzso of zzso of zzso eggs showing that both zzso are important to the escape of zzso from the zzso The methods employed here refine the utility of zzso for functional zzso studies in zzso zzso and confirm these can be used to identify potential drug targets, in this case zzso zzso
