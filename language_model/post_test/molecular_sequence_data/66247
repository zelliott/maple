The zzso zzso associated with healthy and zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied over a zzso period using isolation methods and molecular techniques such as zzso zzso gene zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso and real-time zzso zzso The zzso zzso bands obtained from healthy zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, and zzso zzso In the zzso analysis the zzso of recovery was highest for zzso marina zzso In general, the environmental sequences retrieved could be matched zzso to zzso recovered from the seaweed except for the zzso zzso which showed zzso zzso with the sequences of four different zzso including that of zzso zzso To estimate the extent of colonization of zzso zzso we used a zzso real-time quantitative zzso zzso for zzso 3 of the zzso zzso the probe for which proved to be species specific even when it was used in zzso with high background zzso of other zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence was detected with both healthy and zzso zzso but the signal was stronger for the zzso Additional sequence types, representing members from the zzso were recovered from the zzso zzso DNA, which suggested that a change in zzso community structure had zzso zzso analysis of these environmental sequences and the sequences of zzso and type species indicated that the environmental sequences were novel in the zzso
