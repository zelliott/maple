All colonies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studied so far are associated with a single genetically variable lineage of zzso zzso Such limited genetic variation of zzso and the absence of sexual zzso bodies zzso on zzso zzso mounds would be compatible with zzso vertical transmission, as is known to occur in zzso zzso We investigated this hypothesis by zzso DNA sequence zzso as zzso zzso markers of four zzso gene fragments of zzso zzso from 31 colonies of zzso zzso A signature of free zzso was found, indicative of frequent sexual horizontal zzso First, all 31 strains had unique zzso zzso Second, zzso markers zzso zzso zzso were largely in zzso equilibrium zzso and almost all possible pairs of zzso between genetically zzso zzso were in linkage equilibrium zzso Finally, extensive zzso zzso was found, especially in the zzso zzso zzso genetic variation and a freely zzso population structure can only be explained by frequent horizontal and sexual transmission of zzso The apparent variation in zzso transmission mode among zzso species implies that vertical zzso transmission can evolve zzso The unexpected finding of horizontal transmission makes the apparent absence of zzso mushrooms on zzso zzso mounds zzso To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of the genetic population structure of a single lineage of zzso
