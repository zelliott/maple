The emergence of West Nile virus zzso in the Western Hemisphere is marked by the spread of zzso lineage I zzso which differ from typically zzso lineage II zzso To begin to understand the zzso interactions that may influence the zzso properties of divergent lineage I and II zzso we compared the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso properties of a lineage II isolate from Madagascar zzso with those of a new lineage I isolate from Texas zzso Full zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso zzso albeit zzso with other lineage II zzso while zzso clustered with emergent North American zzso more specifically with other Texas zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso at low levels in cultured human cells, was highly sensitive to the zzso actions of zzso in zzso and demonstrated a completely zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and other zzso forms of zzso zzso was defective in its ability to disrupt zzso zzso zzso including the zzso of zzso and downstream zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso However, replication of zzso was rescued in cells with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this finding, the zzso of zzso was unmasked upon infection of mice lacking zzso Thus, control of the innate host response and zzso actions is a key feature of zzso zzso and replication zzso
