By sequencing extensive regions of the zzso gene cluster from zzso monkey (New World zzso and zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso monkey and zzso have two and one zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the ancestral zzso zzso gene duplicated after zzso zzso from zzso but before they zzso into zzso (New World zzso and zzso (Old World zzso apes, and zzso The zzso monkey gamma zzso gene promoter region accumulated many zzso zzso including a T to C substitution in the zzso zzso zzso This adverse zzso along with the previous finding that the gamma 1 locus in zzso monkey is a zzso suggests that in zzso the gamma zzso gene may be the primary fetal zzso zzso zzso The aligned gamma gene sequences contain several zzso sequence elements zzso zzso of 6 zzso or longer in the zzso zzso region, but none in the 3' zzso zzso Gene zzso frequently occurred in the zzso zzso and transcribed regions of the duplicated genes of zzso but rarely in the 3' zzso zzso However, an absence of zzso within the zzso and zzso monkeys promoter regions suggests that in zzso selection acted against zzso as they could decrease (or zzso gamma 2 zzso
