A barley zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein of the zzso class of zzso factors, zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso expression is restricted to the zzso where it precedes that of the zzso zzso zzso expressed in bacteria, binds specifically to the zzso motif zzso zzso in a zzso pair zzso derived from the promoter region of a zzso gene zzso This zzso also includes the zzso box zzso zzso zzso by zzso is prevented when the zzso is zzso to zzso but not when zzso affect the zzso The zzso protein is a potent zzso zzso in a zzso zzso system where it zzso with zzso a barley zzso protein zzso by the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso expression experiments in zzso developing barley zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso gene promoter and that this zzso is also partially dependent on the presence of an intact zzso A drastic decrease in zzso activity is observed in zzso barley zzso when using as zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These results strongly zzso the zzso zzso protein from zzso either as a zzso or as a zzso with zzso as an important zzso zzso of seed storage protein genes containing the zzso in their zzso
