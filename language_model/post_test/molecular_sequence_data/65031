In this study, the aim was to determine whether zzso zzso factors are implicated in zzso zzso in potato zzso zzso By searching a database of potato zzso zzso with a sequence characteristically zzso in zzso zzso a potato zzso gene was zzso A zzso clone containing the zzso sequence was isolated and the zzso sequence was zzso Using a zzso marker zzso the potato zzso gene zzso was mapped to zzso zzso In dormant zzso relatively high levels of zzso transcript were detected by in zzso zzso By contrast, in zzso zzso no expression of the zzso could be zzso Furthermore, an inverse relationship between zzso bud size and the zzso level of the zzso transcript was zzso In zzso buds exhibiting zzso zzso zzso transcript levels were also relatively high, but rapidly decreased when zzso dominance was removed by zzso of the zzso zzso
