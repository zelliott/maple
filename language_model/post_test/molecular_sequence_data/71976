To develop a better understanding of the interaction between zzso and their zzso we have investigated the zzso in zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso We used zzso libraries of wild mouse zzso and zzso to analyze genetic variation in the zzso found in wild mouse species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as some zzso laboratory zzso In this analysis, we detected several unique forms of sequence organization in the zzso regions of the long terminal repeats of these zzso The distribution of the zzso with unique zzso structures demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso were present only in zzso zzso subspecies, while zzso zzso zzso were found in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, one unique zzso from zzso zzso was found to be zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso This zzso termed zzso was thus likely to be related to the common zzso of these zzso Moreover, an ancestral type of zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso Despite their zzso zzso position, zzso of these types are not widespread in mice, zzso zzso spread by infection rather than zzso These results imply that recent evolution of these zzso involved alternating periods of replication as virus and residence in the germ zzso
