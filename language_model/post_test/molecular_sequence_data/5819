zzso restriction of dietary zzso elicits an increased zzso of zzso in the kidney zzso zzso which involves a stimulation of zzso zzso zzso This adaptation is in part a direct cellular response of which the zzso are poorly zzso In this study, the impact of dietary zzso restriction on the differential expression of rat kidney zzso zzso was zzso to identify gene products regulated by the zzso zzso When kidney zzso zzso of rats fed a low- or a zzso diet were compared by differential zzso chain reaction zzso thirty modulated zzso bands were observed, of which four were confirmed as being zzso We focused on one of the zzso bands, dietary zzso zzso zzso A zzso containing an open reading frame zzso a zzso protein was cloned by library zzso zzso exhibits a high degree of identity to the zzso zzso regulatory factor and to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was detected in the kidney zzso zzso and in small zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso specifically increases zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso type II zzso zzso zzso Further zzso of zzso will show whether zzso is primarily or zzso involved in the response to dietary zzso
