In a previous study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso HE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ten synthetic peptides were used to test for zzso zzso regions located throughout the length of outer membrane protein F of zzso zzso An additional nine peptides of zzso zzso acid zzso in length were zzso zzso collected from mice zzso with each of the 19 synthetic peptides zzso to zzso zzso zzso were used to determine which of the peptides had zzso zzso capable of reacting with the surface of whole cells of the various zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Cell surface zzso was measured by an zzso zzso zzso zzso with whole cells of the various zzso as the zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso with the various zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso of human and zzso zzso Three peptides located in the zzso portion of protein F zzso zzso with the greatest zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso 10 zzso and zzso 18 zzso appear to have sufficient potential for further development as vaccine candidates for zzso against infections caused by zzso zzso A zzso model for the arrangement of protein F within the outer membrane of zzso zzso is zzso
