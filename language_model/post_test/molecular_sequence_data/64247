The zzso sequence elements that direct zzso virus zzso zzso synthesis reside in the 109 base zzso region at the zzso trailer zzso zzso end of zzso zzso that makes up the zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso 14, 15 and 16 (the zzso zzso show sequence similarity with the equivalent region of many zzso and are analogous to the three zzso zzso that form the second replication control element in the zzso virus zzso In this study, results of two independent procedures demonstrate that the zzso zzso element also is a replication control zzso zzso of in zzso zzso selection experiments show that selection pressure for retaining the wild type zzso at the first position of each of the three zzso and for the fifth position of the 14th zzso was relatively zzso However, with continued zzso preference for the conservation of wild type zzso across the entire zzso element was clearly zzso zzso of zzso analysis of individual zzso in one or more zzso in a zzso driven reporter gene rescue system agreed with these zzso zzso at the first position of the 14th, the 15th or the 16th zzso reduced zzso activity zzso In contrast, changes at the other five positions of any one zzso had little or no effect on zzso activity, even when all the five bases were changed at the same zzso However, when zzso were analyzed which contained point zzso at equivalent positions in all three zzso it was evident that the zzso particularly those at the 5th position, were also important components of the zzso zzso This pattern of sequence requirement in the zzso element based on zzso analysis could be described as a distinct zzso zzso that is important for zzso zzso
