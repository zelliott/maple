The extent of zzso infections in rural Sierra Leone, where both feral and pet zzso zzso harbor divergent members of the human zzso virus type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso family, was tested in blood samples collected from zzso human subjects in zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis to test for zzso to zzso zzso we found only nine subjects zzso who tested positive for zzso seven tested positive for zzso and two tested positive for zzso Compared with other rural West African communities, Sierra zzso displayed the lowest zzso zzso of zzso infection yet reported, much lower than the previously reported zzso in zzso feral and household pet zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that two of the newly found zzso strains belonged to zzso A, the most common zzso zzso in Africa, but this is the first report of zzso A in Sierra zzso The two zzso individuals zzso two distinct zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso is a member of zzso zzso A, the first strain of this zzso zzso found in Sierra zzso In contrast, zzso zzso belongs to none of the five previously characterized zzso zzso (A to zzso but is a new zzso zzso designated zzso having the most divergent zzso sequences yet reported for zzso The fact that both of the two most divergent zzso zzso known, E and zzso are rare and found as single zzso in persons from Sierra zzso may be related to the fact that this small region of West Africa also contains zzso and household pet zzso zzso with highly divergent zzso of zzso This finding provides support for the hypotheses that new zzso zzso result from independent zzso transmission of zzso to the human population and that these zzso transmission events had not spread widely into the population by zzso
