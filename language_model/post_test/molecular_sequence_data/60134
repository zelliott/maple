We have previously identified an zzso zzso zzso zzso finger zzso by zzso zzso cloning zzso Here, we isolated a rat zzso of zzso zzso that encodes an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids sharing high zzso with human zzso zzso identity at the protein zzso and mouse zzso zzso identity at the protein zzso The zzso protein has a zzso finger, a zzso type of zinc finger zzso B1 box and B2 box, each having a pair of zinc fingers, and zzso domain, belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several members of zzso family including zzso have characteristic zzso domain, forming a zzso Next, we detected zzso zzso in primary zzso one of zzso target cells, derived from the zzso of rat zzso An zzso zzso revealed the zzso protein is expressed and regulated by zzso in the primary zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein in primary zzso is zzso by zzso zzso treatment that promotes the differentiation of the cells, whereas it is zzso by zzso treatment that zzso the differentiation of the zzso These findings suggest the possible involvement of the zzso in the differentiation of zzso zzso
