zzso zzso of zzso zzso precursors in zzso leads to the development of zzso with unique patterns of zzso zzso To investigate whether the differential pattern of zzso zzso is influenced by factors associated with either the display and/or recognition of the zzso we have used a set of zzso with various class II binding affinities but unchanged zzso zzso The zzso that exhibited approximately zzso higher binding to zzso considerably increased the frequency of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells in zzso Using an established zzso zzso zzso clone zzso only zzso we also demonstrated that stimulation with the highest affinity zzso resulted in zzso gamma production in zzso In contrast, zzso that demonstrated relatively lower class II binding induced only zzso zzso These data suggest that the major zzso complex binding affinity of zzso zzso leading to differential interactions at the T zzso cell zzso can be crucial for the differential development of zzso patterns in T zzso
