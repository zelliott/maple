The zzso zzso of a limited number of cellular proteins is a common feature of zzso cell zzso This zzso usually zzso the function of the target protein or generates peptides that actively contribute to the death zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is zzso by zzso in human zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso We have shown recently that zzso zzso delayed zzso cell death in response to zzso zzso In transient zzso experiments, the zzso and the zzso zzso peptides generated by zzso zzso demonstrate an zzso effect similar to that induced by the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso have lost their protective zzso Moreover, stable zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells to drug-induced cell zzso Altogether, these results indicate that zzso of zzso triggered by zzso mediates the zzso activity of the zzso
