We have identified in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso zzso 3' to the left zzso a sequence for zzso regulation by zzso zzso zzso using expression zzso for zzso and reporter zzso containing the zzso gene under the control of either the entire zzso zzso with zzso untranslated zzso or a minimal zzso promoter flanked with a 130 zzso zzso containing the zzso untranslated region, disclosed both positive and negative zzso of promoter activity in zzso cells in zzso a zzso fold decrease with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, and a zzso fold increase with zzso zzso and zzso in Schneider II zzso In all cases, the regulatory effects were abolished with reporter plasmids deleted for a 58 zzso zzso encompassing the putative zzso binding zzso zzso shift zzso with a zzso zzso zzso demonstrated direct interaction with the 58 zzso fragment, with an affinity in the zzso zzso range as reported with the same zzso for other well characterized zzso binding regulatory zzso zzso experiments with the extended zzso demonstrated protection of zzso zzso located within the 58 zzso zzso These zzso binding sites could be involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
