Small zzso regulatory zzso zzso have been studied in many bacterial pathogens during zzso However, few studies have focused on how zzso pathogens zzso zzso expression inside zzso zzso Here, we monitored expression of all known zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in bacteria located inside zzso a host cell type in which this pathogen zzso zzso zzso sequences known in zzso zzso and zzso coli were searched in the zzso of zzso zzso virulent strain zzso the subject of this zzso zzso of 84 distinct zzso was compared in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso six zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso was previously reported as an zzso induced by zzso zzso inside zzso zzso analyses unraveled changing expression patterns for some zzso along the zzso zzso and zzso expression dropped after an initial induction phase while zzso was induced exclusively at late infection times zzso 6 zzso Studies focused on the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso bacteria use this zzso to regulate zzso zzso a zzso protein of unknown zzso zzso together with zzso contributes to zzso zzso bacterial zzso To our knowledge, these data represent the first comprehensive study of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso bacteria and provide the first insights into zzso that may direct pathogen adaptation to a zzso state inside the host zzso
