zzso of zzso acid produced by zzso are interesting substances with prominent zzso zzso To zzso the zzso function of zzso it is necessary to identify a specific zzso in a particular tissue or organ and to characterize its zzso zzso In this study, the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated in liver, zzso zzso zzso heart, brain, and zzso of rats by zzso Furthermore, zzso acid metabolism was investigated using the rat zzso described above and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among the rat zzso zzso and zzso efficiently produced zzso and zzso produced zzso in zzso zzso was specifically expressed in the zzso zzso was detected in all zzso used in this zzso zzso was expressed in the kidney as well as in the zzso Among the human zzso zzso and zzso efficiently produced zzso zzso produced zzso The zzso properties of rat zzso were similar to those of human zzso and zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso were also similar between humans and zzso A systematic analysis of zzso expression in various zzso and of its zzso property may provide valuable information on the zzso roles of zzso in each zzso
