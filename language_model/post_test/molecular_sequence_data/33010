zzso a zzso zzso interacts with a plethora of cellular targets where the interaction with zzso and zzso is considered zzso zzso studies have demonstrated the zzso of zzso forms a bundle of three zzso of which zzso 2 and 3 are directly involved in binding to the zzso Here we found peptides derived from zzso 2 and 3 of zzso zzso with zzso zzso We confirmed that a 12 zzso zzso from zzso 2 directly zzso with zzso and when introduced into zzso and zzso cells, these peptides inhibited their zzso In conclusion, we have identified a small domain within zzso which appears to play a critical role in the interaction with zzso
