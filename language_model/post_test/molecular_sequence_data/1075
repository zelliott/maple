zzso zzso tumors zzso are zzso expressing zzso cell, zzso and rarely zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso show zzso zzso zzso However, zzso without zzso zzso and zzso with weak or lack of zzso zzso expression have also been zzso Recently, zzso zzso in zzso 18 zzso zzso and zzso 12 zzso zzso of the zzso were identified in such zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso may define a specific zzso zzso of zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso DNA samples were obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso 18 and 12 were evaluated for the zzso by zzso amplification and direct zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso were identified in 122 of zzso zzso gastric zzso and two of 75 zzso zzso zzso A great majority of these zzso represented simple T to A zzso zzso at the zzso zzso leading to substitution of the zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso However, zzso deletions and deletions with point zzso zzso between zzso zzso were found in approximately zzso of all zzso 18 zzso zzso in zzso zzso 12 were found only in 10 of 170 zzso gastric and one of 54 zzso zzso zzso negative for zzso zzso 11 and zzso zzso 18 zzso There were seven zzso of zzso acid for zzso at zzso zzso zzso and four zzso deletions with point zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso The majority of zzso with zzso zzso had pure or zzso zzso zzso Low zzso activity, zzso or zzso zzso was detected in zzso of analyzed zzso including larger, zzso zzso zzso Based on long-term follow-up zzso 135 zzso a majority zzso of zzso with zzso zzso followed a benign zzso
