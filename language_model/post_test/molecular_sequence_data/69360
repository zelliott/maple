Clinical zzso of zzso zzso were identified by direct sequence determination of zzso zzso gene fragments amplified by zzso chain zzso Identification was based on a zzso region within the zzso zzso gene in which zzso species are characterized by zzso zzso zzso A manually aligned data base including the signature sequences of 52 species of zzso easily allowed rapid and correct zzso The results of this study demonstrate that zzso chain zzso direct sequence determination can be used as a rapid and reliable method for the identification of zzso in the clinical zzso In addition, the prompt recognition of previously zzso species is now zzso
