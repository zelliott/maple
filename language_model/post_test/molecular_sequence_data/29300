An effective vaccine against human zzso virus zzso should protect against zzso transmission of genetically divergent zzso As a safe alternative to live attenuated vaccines, the zzso and protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine containing zzso zzso virus zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso T zzso zzso but low to zzso serum zzso responses, were observed following multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also detected in zzso washes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso control monkeys were challenged zzso with zzso strain zzso zzso a primary isolate whose zzso is zzso dissimilar to that of the vaccine zzso Four of seven zzso were protected from infection as determined by the inability to identify viral zzso or DNA sequences in the peripheral blood and the absence of zzso zzso responses zzso This is the first report of zzso protection against a primary zzso zzso isolate of zzso by using a commercially viable vaccine zzso These results support further development of a DNA vaccine for protection against zzso
