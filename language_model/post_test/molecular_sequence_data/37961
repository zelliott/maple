In this study, the zzso gene situated on the she zzso island of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso encodes a zzso protein which belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso The demonstration that zzso is autonomously zzso from the cell to yield a zzso processed form and possesses a zzso zzso domain for export from the cell were consistent with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of degrading zzso zzso was zzso for zzso cells, suggesting that it may be a zzso toxin with a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was at least partly responsible for the ability of zzso zzso to stimulate fluid zzso in zzso rabbit zzso zzso
