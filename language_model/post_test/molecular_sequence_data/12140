zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso has previously been suggested to require the participation of a zzso upstream zzso sequence zzso involved in carbon zzso repression that responds to zzso To determine the structure of the zzso zzso element, we used the zzso sequence zzso as the zzso zzso Using gel mobility shift zzso we have identified a 78 zzso protein from zzso that binds specifically to both single and zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso We have also identified a 48 zzso zzso from zzso that binds specifically to the zzso form of the zzso and whose DNA binding activity is remarkably heat zzso Even though the zzso zzso contains a consensus sequence for the binding of the zzso zzso protein zzso the two zzso complexes could still be detected in a strain bearing a deletion in the zzso zzso
