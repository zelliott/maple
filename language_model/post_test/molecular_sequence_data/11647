zzso triggers a complex response in zzso which includes induction and repression of a large number of zzso zzso repression is in part zzso by the zzso zzso a zinc finger protein that binds to the promoters of many zzso zzso zzso However, some genes that are required for zzso growth are also zzso by a zzso zzso We have isolated zzso in three genes that are involved in this zzso component of repression and cloned the genes by zzso All three genes zzso zzso of the recently discovered zzso zzso II zzso zzso Two of them are zzso zzso C and its associated zzso zzso of the three genes have identical zzso with respect to zzso repression and show no zzso with each zzso This suggests that these three zzso of the zzso complex function closely together in zzso the zzso response to zzso
