Four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were discovered by analysis of zzso DNA from a human zzso One zzso zzso is expressed by zzso of zzso cells and T cells, whereas expression of the other three genes could not be zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso type, a structural zzso that was previously unique to zzso Although having a similar structure overall, the zzso and zzso receptors have distinctive zzso acid sequences in the zzso zzso zzso and differ in the zzso and zzso motifs that determine signal zzso Whereas the zzso gene is present on all zzso zzso and is expressed by all human zzso cells, the zzso gene is restricted to the zzso subset of zzso zzso and is zzso expressed by zzso cells within an zzso zzso genes for zzso and zzso have been defined and are very similar in sequence to their human zzso The donor in whom zzso was first detected bears two zzso of it that differ by five zzso zzso in the coding zzso Although the zzso are not predicted to affect gene zzso zzso of only one of the two zzso zzso could be zzso
