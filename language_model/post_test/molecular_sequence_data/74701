zzso zzso are central to trace metal zzso and zzso throughout biological zzso zzso plants, and zzso zzso both gene zzso zzso zzso zzso designated Class I and II zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso designated Class III zzso or zzso In contrast, although gene zzso zzso are ubiquitous in animal species the identification of a functional zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a representative member of the zzso provided the first evidence for these zzso peptides in zzso By exploiting the conservation observed between species we have been able to clone and zzso characterize a zzso zzso from the immune cells of the earthworm zzso zzso the first evidence for its presence in a zzso belonging to the zzso The complete coding sequence of this zzso was determined and the zzso relationship to plant, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso in response to cadmium was performed by using real-time zzso
