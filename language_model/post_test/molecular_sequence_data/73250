zzso T zzso like other zzso zzso is expressed as various zzso in different muscle fibers and/or at different development zzso A recent study suggested the expression pattern of chicken fast zzso zzso is fixed in a given cell zzso In the present study, we isolated zzso clones of the chicken fast zzso gene to carry out molecular analysis of its expression zzso One of the zzso zzso contained the zzso upstream region and approximately 20 zzso downstream from zzso zzso We constructed zzso segments of the chicken fast zzso gene linked to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene and tested the regulatory function of the zzso upstream region by transient zzso of the gene zzso into muscle zzso We showed that a DNA segment between zzso and zzso zzso from the most zzso zzso initiation site, which has an zzso and zzso element, a zzso box and two E boxes, was essential for the expression of the fast zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso element in the segment resulted in the most serious reduction in the fast zzso promoter zzso The results suggested that the zzso element plays an important role in zzso regulation of the fast zzso zzso The zzso element is very similar to the zzso element, but in zzso mobility shift zzso the zzso that bound to this motif was found to be different from the zzso binding factor zzso
