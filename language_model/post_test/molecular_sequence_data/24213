The shift to zzso is one of the most prevalent evolutionary transitions in flowering zzso In the zzso plant zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are believed to zzso the evolution of zzso Positive directional selection has driven the evolutionary fixation of zzso zzso of zzso leading to substantially reduced zzso zzso zzso simulations indicate that this zzso event may have occurred very recently and is possibly associated with the zzso expansion of zzso zzso from glacial zzso This suggests that ancillary zzso innovations associated with zzso can evolve rapidly after the zzso of the zzso zzso
