Several zzso are associated with resistance to zzso zzso zzso in cultured human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso Little is known as to what extent drug resistance occurs in zzso and whether its development within the zzso differs from that in peripheral zzso We therefore performed comparative zzso sequence analysis of the zzso reverse zzso zzso gene in zzso DNA obtained from blood and zzso of three patients, all of whom had progressed to AIDS under long-term zzso zzso Six to 11 individual zzso copies per patient and compartment were analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso direct zzso In all samples, zzso associated with zzso resistance could be zzso They occurred in multiple zzso copies in both blood and zzso indicating that molecular zzso of resistance are reflected in most individual zzso in zzso zzso positions and zzso of zzso in zzso derived from both compartments do not argue for independent development of zzso resistance in zzso
