Many soluble proteins transit through the zzso network zzso and the zzso compartment zzso en route to the zzso but our zzso understanding of this zzso trafficking step in plants is zzso In particular, it is unknown whether zzso zzso zzso participate in this transport zzso Through a screen for modified transport to the zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso protein zzso we identified zzso which encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which encodes the zzso zzso factor zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso have overlapping expression patterns and interact genetically to transport zzso cargo and promote plant growth, but they have no apparent roles in protein zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso at the zzso and are incorporated into zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso show altered zzso distribution of zzso cargo exported from the zzso Moreover, zzso binds zzso in zzso and zzso associates in zzso with zzso directly linking these proteins to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are key zzso for zzso trafficking of zzso proteins from the zzso to the zzso in zzso
