The zzso zzso small zzso zzso genes are transcribed by zzso zzso III, but their zzso unit appears to contain both class II and class III promoter zzso One of these promoter element, a zzso box which we call the zzso zzso box, or zzso is located in a position typical for a class II zzso box but contains zzso zzso in the normal zzso motif and a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso box of the zzso major late promoter showed that the zzso promoter element does not substitute for a class II zzso zzso However, when the zzso promoter element sequence was changed to a class II zzso box consensus zzso the zzso 2 gene was transcribed in zzso by both zzso zzso II and zzso From these results, we conclude that the zzso promoter element is important for the exclusive zzso of the zzso 2 gene by zzso zzso zzso
