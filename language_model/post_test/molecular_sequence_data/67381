The zzso B4 zzso belongs to human zzso B species within the family zzso Here we report a novel complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso strain, zzso which was isolated from a patient with a fatal case of hand, foot, and mouth disease in zzso The complete zzso consists of zzso zzso excluding the 3' zzso tail, and has an open reading frame that maps between zzso positions zzso and zzso and encodes a zzso zzso zzso analysis based on different zzso regions reveals that zzso is closest to a zzso strain, zzso zzso in the zzso half zzso of the zzso although it is closer to a Chinese zzso strain, zzso in the 3' half zzso of the zzso Furthermore, similar zzso analysis based on the whole zzso demonstrates that zzso has possibly occurred within the zzso domain and that zzso is a possible progeny of zzso zzso of the zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso that occurred during their zzso and evolution, which is a relatively common phenomenon in zzso
