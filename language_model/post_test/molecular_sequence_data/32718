The zzso family of zzso factors has been implicated in many zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression observed in zzso cells of zzso suggests that these zzso factors might be involved in zzso zzso as zzso Here, we fully characterize the zzso of four novel zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These species, widely used for environmental assessment, develop a zzso zzso zzso that is frequently zzso The correlation between expression of zzso and its close relative zzso and onset of zzso leukemia was documented zzso We report the sequences of two distinct and novel zzso zzso amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso from both zzso One of the zzso zzso contains a 360 zzso zzso in the zzso coding zzso Based on this zzso and zzso lack of a zzso zzso domain, we designate this zzso as a zzso zzso the first to be reported in an zzso zzso In zzso species, zzso zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso and zzso and its zzso serves as a robust marker for zzso zzso In addition, we report on the occurrence of alternate zzso sites in the zzso zzso one zzso and one zzso site, which differ by zzso zzso We zzso that differential expression of various zzso zzso zzso controlled in part by zzso site choice variation, may help to interpret the apparently opposing roles of this gene in the development of zzso Overall, this research further illustrates the utility of the zzso model for studies involving the molecular mechanisms of zzso in naturally occurring zzso The data presented here require a revisiting of hypotheses regarding evolution of the zzso gene zzso Current hypotheses indicate that zzso the zzso gene family does not contain an zzso promoter for zzso expression and zzso zzso gene zzso did not occur in zzso Our characterization of zzso zzso in zzso suggests that zzso zzso gene family members have acquired an zzso promoter or zzso zzso either by invention that predates the evolutionary split of zzso from zzso or by parallel zzso Our data also show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are identical in their core regions with variation limited to their zzso and zzso supporting the notion that alternative zzso zzso promoter zzso and zzso site choice may lead to expression of distinct zzso originating from one common zzso
