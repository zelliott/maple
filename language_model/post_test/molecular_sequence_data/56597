zzso a major regulatory protein in zzso coli, controls the expression of numerous zzso including zzso zzso binds to six sites upstream of zzso and zzso binding is required for zzso zzso We show here that an zzso protein is also present in zzso zzso This protein can bind both zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso DNA, as can zzso coli zzso zzso zzso studies were performed with zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Six binding sites were zzso three of them being similar to corresponding sites in zzso coli, and three being organized zzso A consensus derived from six zzso zzso sites is compatible with that derived from a similar analysis of zzso coli zzso
