zzso a high molecular mass zzso with zzso and zzso activities, was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by gel zzso affinity and zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso with apparent molecular mass of 70 zzso and zzso point of zzso zzso shows very weak zzso activity, and only at doses higher than 20 zzso zzso with this, it partially degrades some components of the zzso zzso in zzso It zzso the zzso of zzso zzso at zzso bonds zzso and zzso Its preference for bulky and zzso zzso acids at the zzso position in zzso is demonstrated by its zzso of only the zzso and zzso bonds in the zzso of zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso It neither activates nor degrades zzso and zzso and has no effect on zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso analyses of its zzso fragments demonstrated that zzso is a zzso class snake zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its similarity to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanied by very low zzso makes zzso a promising candidate as an zzso to prepare zzso against these most dangerous components of the zzso zzso Moreover, its ability to degrade zzso clots suggests its clinical use as an zzso zzso
