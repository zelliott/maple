Recent evidence suggests that specific families of zzso zzso factors control the generation and survival of distinct zzso zzso We had previously characterized the zzso gene zzso which is expressed in zzso zzso of the central and peripheral zzso nervous system as well as in motor zzso of the zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene affects part of the structures in which it is zzso the locus zzso visceral sensory and zzso zzso and, as we show here, the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We now report on the characterization of zzso a close relative of zzso with an identical zzso zzso and zzso are zzso at most sites, therefore suggesting a broader role for zzso genes in the zzso of the zzso nervous system and zzso motor zzso than revealed by the zzso zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the relative timing of zzso and zzso expression at various sites suggests positive zzso which are substantiated by the loss of zzso expression in zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the major part of the zzso zzso expression precedes that of zzso and starts in the zzso zzso in a pattern zzso restricted on the zzso axis and at zzso zzso This suggests that zzso links early patterning events to the differentiation of defined zzso populations in the zzso
