An zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso gene zzso the transcript and translated product of which have been identified in zzso apples zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of the apple zzso Golden zzso The predicted coding region of this zzso zzso showed that seven zzso zzso in the corresponding region of zzso resulted in just one zzso acid zzso A zzso sequence characterized as a short zzso repetitive element zzso was inserted in the zzso region of zzso corresponding to position zzso in zzso The zzso site located near the 3' end of the predicted coding region of zzso was absent from the reverse zzso chain reaction product, revealing that exclusive zzso from zzso occurs during zzso of zzso Golden zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso chain reaction analyses of zzso zzso showed clearly that apple zzso were either zzso for zzso and zzso or zzso for each zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Fuji apple, which produces little zzso and has a long storage life, demonstrated that the level of zzso from zzso during the zzso stage was very zzso
