A major zzso binding site of mouse zzso was previously localized to about three zzso repeats zzso zzso of its B2 chain domain III zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 202, zzso The corresponding zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction and inserted into a zzso expression zzso zzso with a signal zzso zzso zzso human kidney cell clones were shown to process and zzso the resulting zzso zzso in substantial zzso It possessed high binding activity for zzso zzso in zzso zzso with an affinity comparable with that of authentic zzso zzso In addition, complexes of zzso and zzso could be efficiently converted into a zzso complex by zzso zzso zzso degradation of the zzso complex demonstrated the association of zzso with a approximately 80 zzso segment of zzso domain zzso to which zzso binding has previously been zzso The correct formation of most of the 12 zzso bridges in zzso was indicated from its zzso resistance and the complete loss of zzso zzso as well as of zzso activity after reduction and zzso Smaller fragments were prepared by the same zzso procedure and showed that combinations of zzso repeats zzso and 4-5 and the single repeat 4 but not repeats 3 or 5 possess full zzso zzso This identifies repeat 4 as the only binding zzso The sequence of repeat 4 is well zzso in the human and in part in the zzso zzso B2 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
