zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene is activated in cells exposed to growth zzso We now have identified a zzso domain in the promoter region of the zzso zzso gene that exhibits zzso zzso sensitivity in zzso and that contains a novel binding site zzso for the growth factor zzso zzso factor zzso as demonstrated in gel mobility shift zzso zzso similar to this novel zzso binding site were observed also in five zzso genes and shown to bind to zzso in competition zzso suggesting that zzso may influence the zzso regulation of these zzso zzso
