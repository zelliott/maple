This work compares frozen water, zzso alcohol, zzso and zzso fluid as preservation media for water zzso in terms of their eventual zzso of DNA extraction and zzso The time the zzso spent in the zzso ranged between 1 week and 25 zzso Two molecular markers were zzso zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso DNA was zzso and could be zzso from specimens fixed in all the above media, although this generally became more difficult as time zzso In the light of the known characteristics of these media, the results suggest zzso fluid to be the most practical, especially on long zzso
