zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group transfer from one zzso zzso to another to form zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is specified by the zzso zzso located at zzso zzso of the zzso coli genetic zzso zzso with zzso in zzso have longer doubling times, tend to lose viability in the stationary phase, are more resistant to zzso and have an altered sensitivity to zzso Although zzso zzso zzso appear to lack zzso zzso activity, they are still able to form trace quantities of zzso The zzso appears to be regulated at both the genetic and zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular mass is zzso zzso or about 8 zzso less than the zzso predicted by the gene zzso suggesting that zzso processing zzso zzso zzso can use various zzso such as zzso and zzso to convert zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso When the zzso acid sequences of four bacterial zzso zzso are zzso three highly zzso regions are zzso One of these regions contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso and another has a zzso zzso zzso These two sequences may be part of the active zzso zzso coli zzso zzso has been studied by using a mixed zzso zzso The zzso is inhibited by zzso the product of the reaction, and by zzso zzso partially zzso zzso caused by zzso but not by zzso zzso does not appear to affect the activity of the zzso zzso but does stimulate the activity associated with crude membrane zzso
