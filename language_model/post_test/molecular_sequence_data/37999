zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein found in the zzso zzso zzso membrane in cardiac and skeletal zzso zzso has recently been shown to bind directly to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso is thought to play a role in zzso (and perhaps zzso zzso release from the zzso zzso heart exhibits decreased zzso of zzso zzso stores for cell zzso We have cloned human and rabbit cardiac zzso and investigated the expression of zzso in developing rabbit zzso Human zzso was cloned from an adult cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates a single primary zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso in hearts from both zzso zzso analysis demonstrates greater than zzso zzso between the predicted zzso acid sequences of human, zzso and canine zzso in the putative zzso domain and subsequent initial 61 zzso acid portion of the putative zzso zzso These zzso also exhibit sequence zzso with zzso The zzso region shows much lower zzso to zzso sequence zzso among the three zzso In addition, Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that the expression of zzso increases markedly in zzso rabbit zzso These findings suggest that the putative zzso domain and subsequent initial portion of the putative zzso domain of zzso play an important role in the binding of zzso to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the previously described increase in zzso zzso release with development is associated with the increased expression of zzso
