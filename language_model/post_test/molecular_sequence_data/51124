We have isolated and characterized two zzso clones zzso zzso marker zzso zzso the amounts of which are known to decrease zzso with aging in the zzso of zzso Of these zzso zzso one consisted of zzso zzso zzso and the other of zzso zzso zzso generated by alternative zzso These two zzso clones shared the same open reading frame, but the larger species had zzso zzso zzso of 3' untranslated region in addition to the first zzso site of smaller zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that two species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso located in the liver and kidney were consistent with these short and long forms of zzso The open reading frame, 897 zzso could zzso 299 zzso zzso The estimated molecular weight and zzso of the deduced zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis confirmed that zzso was zzso localized in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was widely zzso among higher zzso A zzso zzso analysis of zzso acid and protein databases revealed no remarkable zzso with other known zzso zzso zzso seems to be a novel zzso In addition, the existence of putative zzso rich zzso degradation signals and protein degradation signals zzso zzso in the structure of zzso may suggest important regulatory function of this unique protein zzso by changes in its zzso
