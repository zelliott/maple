The zzso one-third of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso zzso encodes the structural proteins and eight accessory zzso including zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso varying in length from 39 to zzso which do not share significant zzso with viral proteins of known zzso The zzso protein 6 is 63 zzso acids in length and has been previously involved in virus zzso and zzso To further analyze this functions, the interaction of zzso protein 6 with other viral and/or cellular factors has been analyzed during zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso from extracts of zzso infected cells and mass zzso analysis revealed an interaction of viral proteins 6 and zzso in biologically relevant zzso This interaction has been reinforced by zzso of both proteins in the zzso of zzso infected zzso
