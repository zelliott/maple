zzso 1, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has a central role in zzso which has been linked to diverse biological processes including zzso development, tumor suppression, lifespan extension, zzso However, the relevant study about zzso 1 is rare in fish compared with zzso In this study, we isolated zzso 1 gene from the kidney tissue of common carp zzso zzso using rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of cloned zzso 1 comprised zzso zzso zzso which showed approximately zzso identity and zzso similarity to human zzso zzso It possessed a typical zzso zzso domain 3 zzso and an zzso zzso domain zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that common carp zzso 1 formed a zzso with zzso zzso zzso To explore the relationship between zzso 1 and cadmium zzso injury, a zzso exposure experiment was zzso The result showed that zzso content was significantly increased in a zzso manner in kidney after zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso were zzso Renal zzso zzso was zzso distributed in the zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso analysis revealed that the zzso transcript level of zzso 1 was markedly zzso in a zzso and zzso manner after exposure to zzso Similarly, Western zzso analysis indicated that its protein level was significantly elevated in a zzso manner after zzso zzso All the results indicate that the common carp zzso 1 gene may play a regulatory role against zzso zzso
