In recent decades, it has become evident that the zzso is by no means a passive inner lining of blood zzso This zzso with a large surface zzso 350 zzso and a comparatively small total mass zzso 110 zzso is actively involved in vital functions of the cardiovascular system, including regulation of zzso fluid and zzso exchange, zzso and zzso inflammatory responses, zzso and zzso The present chapter zzso on two central aspects of zzso structure and zzso zzso the zzso in zzso properties between species, zzso vessel classes and even within individual vessels and zzso the composition and role of the molecular layer on the zzso surface of zzso zzso The zzso lining of blood vessels in different zzso differs with respect to zzso and zzso and is classified as zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, the zzso release, zzso presentation or stress responses of zzso cells vary between species, different zzso and vessel zzso Finally there are relevant differences even between adjacent zzso cells, with some cells exhibiting specific functional properties, zzso as zzso cells for zzso calcium zzso zzso structural and functional properties of the zzso are marked in the vascular beds of the lung and the zzso Pulmonary zzso exhibits a high zzso expression of zzso molecules which may contribute to the zzso of the large zzso pool of zzso in the zzso Furthermore, the pulmonary zzso is less permeable to protein and water flux as compared to large pulmonary zzso zzso cells of the zzso barrier exhibit a zzso zzso with no zzso extensive tight junctions and sparse zzso zzso zzso This barrier allows a strict control of exchange of zzso and circulating cells between the plasma and the zzso zzso It was observed that average zzso levels in muscle zzso are much lower as compared to systemic zzso and that flow resistance of zzso beds is higher than expected from in zzso studies of blood zzso This evidence zzso the concept of a substantial layer on the zzso zzso surface zzso surface layer, zzso with a thickness in the range of zzso zzso In comparison, the typical thickness of the zzso directly anchored in the zzso plasma zzso as seen in electron zzso amounts to only about zzso zzso Therefore it is assumed that additional zzso zzso zzso plasma proteins or zzso are essential in zzso the zzso zzso consequences of the zzso presence are not yet sufficiently understood and zzso However, it is evident that the thick zzso surface layer significantly impacts zzso conditions, mechanical stresses acting on red cells in zzso oxygen zzso vascular control, zzso inflammation and zzso
