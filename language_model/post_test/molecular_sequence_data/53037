The single base change at the 94th zzso of zzso has been referred to as the event that zzso resistance on the drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso From this zzso it has been anticipated that some of the zzso clinical zzso of zzso tuberculosis would carry zzso zzso in the same region of the zzso However, few zzso have been identified in this region among zzso zzso 

To understand the molecular basis for zzso tuberculosis resistance to zzso and zzso 

The sequence zzso at the 94th zzso of zzso among zzso tuberculosis zzso from Korea was analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso cloning and sequence zzso 

No zzso change at the 94th zzso of zzso was detected in any of the 24 zzso zzso analyzed in this zzso On the other hand, a point zzso was found exclusively at the regulatory region zzso a putative zzso site of the zzso locus in 14 zzso Interestingly, all the zzso were of the same kind, which zzso C to zzso Among 14 zzso 12 were resistant to zzso as well as to zzso while two were resistant to zzso zzso 

It seems that zzso previously found at the 94th zzso of zzso have no particular relationship with the mechanism involved in the resistance of zzso tuberculosis to zzso and/or zzso On the other hand, the resistance mechanism of zzso tuberculosis to zzso may involve an altered level of zzso an expression which may have been influenced by the sequence change in the regulatory region of the zzso zzso
