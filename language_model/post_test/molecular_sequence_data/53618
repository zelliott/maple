zzso peptides exist in the zzso as a family of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to date, brain zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been definitively identified in the zzso Based on zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso the zzso zzso family of zzso may have evolved from a zzso zzso brain zzso The primary sites of synthesis for the circulating hormones are the heart and zzso additional zzso and zzso sites, including the zzso zzso and release zzso peptides locally for zzso regulation of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso are generally implicated in zzso zzso zzso effects via the production of zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors lacking the zzso zzso domain may influence target cell function through zzso zzso zzso of membrane zzso zzso activity, and they likely also act as clearance receptors for circulating zzso In the few systems examined using zzso or zzso zzso differential zzso binding and tissue responsiveness to specific zzso zzso zzso is zzso Similar to their acute zzso effects in zzso zzso peptides are zzso in all zzso zzso In contrast to zzso where zzso peptides act through zzso and zzso to bring about long-term reductions in blood volume and blood pressure, in zzso the primary action appears to be the zzso of excess salt at the zzso and zzso zzso and the limiting of zzso salt zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso both zzso and zzso are effective stimuli for cardiac zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso stimulus for zzso zzso peptides may be zzso hormones with appropriate target zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with each regulated zzso zzso either A- or zzso (or zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides act both directly on zzso cells of zzso zzso and indirectly through increased vascular flow to zzso zzso through zzso of drinking, and through effects on other zzso zzso
