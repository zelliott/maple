The zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso a zzso in zzso zzso contains nine zzso six of which are also present in other U zzso and three of which are specific to the zzso zzso Here we have used a zzso human zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso to define the zzso binding sites of one of the zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso B, and D proteins of U zzso was bound to zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso the same approximately equal to 24 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and termed the zzso zzso was protected as when no zzso was bound prior to zzso In contrast, when zzso zzso zzso which zzso with the zzso zzso Mr 70,000 zzso was bound, additional zzso zzso regions were protected against zzso zzso This phenomenon, which we term zzso zzso zzso was exploited to map the position of the Mr 70,000 protein to zzso I of zzso zzso However, there were also sites of Mr 70,000 protein interaction with more zzso regions of zzso zzso particularly the zzso zzso This indicates that in the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are in contact with each zzso The proximity of the Mr 70,000 zzso zzso binding site zzso I) to the functionally important zzso end of zzso zzso suggests that this protein may be involved in the recognition of, or stabilization of base pairing with, zzso zzso zzso zzso
