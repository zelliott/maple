zzso zzso a zzso expressed unconventional myosin, has roles in a broad array of biological zzso zzso for this motor family, zzso VI moves toward the minus zzso end of zzso zzso zzso VI has two light chain binding sites that can both bind zzso zzso However unconventional zzso could use zzso light chains to modify their zzso In the zzso zzso zzso VI is important for maintenance of moving zzso structures, called zzso cones, which mediate zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in the zzso and like zzso zzso accumulates on these zzso We have investigated the possibility that zzso is a zzso light chain of zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso and zzso VI precisely zzso at the leading edge of the zzso cones and that zzso VI is necessary for this zzso zzso Further, zzso VI and zzso zzso from the zzso and interact in zzso zzso zzso Finally zzso binds with high affinity to zzso versions of both zzso VI light chain binding zzso In contrast, although zzso zzso also shows high affinity interactions with these zzso we cannot detect a zzso VI interaction in the zzso We conclude that zzso and not zzso acts as a zzso VI light chain in the zzso zzso and zzso that it may alter the regulation of zzso VI in this zzso
