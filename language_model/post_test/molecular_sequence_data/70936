zzso initially discovered as a factor required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso II, is expressed in two zzso termed a and zzso zzso the zzso inactive zzso was identified as an interaction partner of protein zzso zzso zzso beta employing the interaction trap system for screening zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso We report here on the interaction between the other zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso The complete zzso of zzso was cloned by zzso and used for analysis in the zzso system with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or beta was zzso by one of three reporters, whereas the zzso - zzso interaction was zzso two zzso It was also shown that zzso is zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso but not by alpha or zzso alone, indicating the requirement of beta for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso carried out in zzso resulted in zzso of zzso Similarly, zzso but not zzso alone isolated with zzso zzso beads from buffer containing zzso zzso zzso was found zzso with alpha and zzso likely representing zzso zzso The data show a weak, nevertheless specific interaction of protein zzso zzso via zzso beta with the putative zzso factor zzso in zzso and in zzso and a role of zzso as a potential new zzso for zzso
