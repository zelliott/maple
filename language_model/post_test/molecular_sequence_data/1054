zzso for zzso zzso zzso were performed with zzso chimney samples collected from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at a depth of zzso m zzso degrees zzso 44 degrees zzso and the zzso zzso (27 degrees zzso 111 degrees zzso at a depth of zzso zzso Positive zzso were submitted to zzso at doses of 20 and 30 zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was isolated from chimney samples collected from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge after zzso at 20 zzso and strain zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso after zzso at 30 zzso Only strain zzso was zzso and both formed regular zzso These new strains grew between 55 and 95 degrees C with the optimal temperature being 88 degrees zzso The optimal pH for growth was zzso and the optimal zzso concentration for growth was around 20 g zzso These strains were zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a carbon source for zzso Ten zzso acids were essential for the growth of strain zzso such as zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while strain zzso was unable to grow on a mixture of zzso zzso zzso sulfur or zzso was required for zzso growth and was reduced to hydrogen zzso zzso inhibited growth for both strains zzso and zzso The G + C contents of the zzso DNA were zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso As determined by zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, these strains were more closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, no significant zzso was observed between them with zzso zzso These novel organisms also possess zzso traits that differ from those of its closest zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that these zzso which are amongst the most zzso zzso zzso known to date with zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso should be described as novel species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
