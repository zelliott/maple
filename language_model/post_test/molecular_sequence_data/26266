The zzso zzso acid zzso regulates gene zzso by interacting with specific nuclear receptors that recognize DNA sequences near responsive zzso While much has recently been learned about the nuclear zzso zzso little is known about the genes that are directly regulated by zzso and their zzso response elements recognized by these zzso Here we have analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene promoter that is controlled by zzso We find that a zzso element zzso is located adjacent to the zzso zzso The zzso shows a direct repeat symmetry which is essential for its zzso While zzso zzso elements can also function as zzso response zzso we show here that this zzso is activated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso but cannot be regulated by zzso hormone receptors and other known nuclear zzso In addition, we find that zzso gamma is a poor zzso of this zzso However, the response element is bound with high affinity by both zzso beta and zzso gamma as well as by zzso hormone zzso Thus, interaction between specific response elements and receptors is insufficient for gene zzso
