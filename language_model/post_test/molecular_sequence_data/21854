zzso resources for hundreds of species of zzso zzso economic, and medical importance are unavailable due to the expense of zzso zzso sequences and difficulties with zzso zzso zzso fish provide many models for human disease but possess zzso duplicated zzso that sometimes zzso zzso zzso information representing a fish lineage that zzso before the zzso zzso zzso zzso would provide an zzso for exploring the mechanisms of evolution after zzso zzso We exploited zzso parallel DNA sequencing to develop zzso maps with thrift and speed by zzso zzso offspring of a single female and a single male spotted zzso zzso zzso collected directly from nature utilizing only zzso existing in these two wild zzso Using zzso software that zzso the calling of zzso from zzso zzso by zzso sequencing, we constructed a map containing zzso zzso zzso on two zzso larvae provided a reference zzso that identified nearly 1000 mapped zzso markers and allowed zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso lineage zzso from zzso before the zzso and its zzso is organized more similarly to that of humans than zzso Thus, spotted zzso provides a critical link between medical models in zzso fish, to which zzso is biologically similar, and humans, to which zzso is zzso zzso Application of our zzso dense mapping strategy to species with no prior zzso information promises to facilitate comparative zzso and provide a scaffold for ordering the numerous zzso arising from next generation zzso zzso
