By use of the nearly perfectly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we compared the usefulness of three types of sequences for typing of zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 variable coding genes zzso the zzso zzso DNA, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are present in both zzso and the zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso zzso 28 genes zzso in zzso zzso but intact in zzso zzso including 23 split and 5 remnant zzso and zzso 27 zzso and 25 variable zzso zzso The 4 zzso and 23 split genes as well as the 27 zzso zzso zzso each had identical sequences in 34 human and 5 tick zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences identified three zzso of zzso zzso The variable zzso zzso were significantly more variable than zzso zzso split zzso remnant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all zzso Four of the variable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had highly variable zzso when they were combined for zzso zzso typing zzso identified 27 different zzso in the 39 zzso zzso zzso Two batches from the same zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso with different culture passage histories were found to exhibit the same zzso zzso zzso was more zzso for strain zzso than multiple gene sequencing zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso sequences was zzso with the geographic origins of zzso zzso zzso Our study supports the usefulness of zzso for strain zzso This tool may be useful for tracing a strain and identifying its source during outbreaks, including those resulting from zzso
