All zzso have three different zzso zzso zzso which transcribe different types of zzso zzso zzso I transcribes zzso zzso zzso zzso II transcribes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso III transcribes zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we use an in zzso approach to identify putative functional differences between these three zzso Our results show that zzso zzso are the most zzso regions of zzso but that these regions have several significant length differences between the three zzso There were also significant shifts in the rates of evolution of some zzso acid sites in all three zzso prior to the diversification of zzso and these zzso acids are zzso located near the zzso center of the three zzso These results suggest that functional differences exist between the three zzso and that these differences are all clustered near the active zzso
