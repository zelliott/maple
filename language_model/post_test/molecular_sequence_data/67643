A delicate balance between protein synthesis and degradation maintains cardiac size and zzso zzso zzso Muscle zzso Finger 1 zzso maintains muscle protein zzso by tagging the zzso proteins with zzso for subsequent degradation by the zzso system zzso 

To determine the zzso role of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso white zzso and 339 control subjects zzso white zzso led to identification of 2 zzso zzso and zzso and a deletion zzso zzso exclusively in the zzso zzso These 3 zzso were absent in zzso additional control subjects screened by zzso zzso Likewise, rare zzso were enriched in the white zzso population zzso zzso versus zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso to zzso Z zzso impaired zzso reduced zzso and zzso degradation of zzso heavy chain 6, cardiac zzso binding protein C, zzso zzso and zzso in adult cardiac zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso in the mouse heart was associated with cardiac zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and expression of the zzso zzso which were zzso on turning off expression of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso identified in patients with zzso impart zzso effects on zzso zzso activity and are probably zzso zzso in zzso The findings zzso impaired protein degradation in the zzso of zzso
