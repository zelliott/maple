zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were injected zzso into zzso and normal mice to examine the zzso pattern and persistence of these cells in zzso By in zzso zzso these zzso cells were zzso in the bone zzso cavity and the zzso 21 days after zzso zzso cells did not persist in normal mice but persisted in zzso zzso zzso of the recipients with zzso or zzso zzso treatment did not alter these zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with the genes for canine zzso class II zzso + zzso and transplanted into zzso recipients to investigate their zzso pattern and zzso These zzso zzso zzso cells did also home to zzso and zzso even in normal zzso However, these cells led to zzso of the host towards canine zzso as shown by accelerated skin graft rejection and delayed type hypersensitivity zzso Thus, zzso zzso mice allow for the zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and for prolonged zzso In zzso zzso mice, no zzso zzso cells were identified in zzso and zzso either because of their inability to home or more likely because of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso class II genes did home to zzso and zzso and persisted even though the recipient had become zzso Their survival may be due to a loss of expression of the zzso zzso zzso the presentation of these zzso gene products in the zzso zzso was such that a zzso response was not zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
