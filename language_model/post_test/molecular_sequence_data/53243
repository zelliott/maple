Using a modified zzso technique, the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes of a yam species, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso were successfully zzso Two novel modifications of the zzso procedure introduced here, namely zzso the use of a battery of random zzso zzso zzso as short arbitrary zzso and zzso the use of a total of five zzso zzso zzso allow the rapid isolation of the zzso region of any gene from organisms with large zzso zzso zzso regions were fused to the zzso zzso and tested for transient expression in tobacco zzso zzso All the isolated zzso regions were shown to drive reporter gene zzso Three zzso promoters responded to salicylic acid, presumably as a result of the binding of a zzso zzso zzso to the multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso present in these zzso
