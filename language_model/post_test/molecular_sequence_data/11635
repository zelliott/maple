DNA zzso repeats, zzso and zzso are present in genes which have been implicated in several neurodegenerative zzso To investigate possible stable structures formed by these repeating zzso we have examined zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3) using zzso and zzso optical zzso These studies reveal that single stranded zzso zzso zzso 2) forms stable, zzso zzso duplexes, while the single stranded zzso requires at least three repeating units to form a zzso zzso and zzso melting experiments show that the zzso increases in the order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso duplex is stable and exhibits similar zzso zzso in solutions containing zzso M zzso and at a pH range from zzso to zzso The zzso duplex, which contains zzso zzso displays many zzso spectral characteristics similar to those of zzso zzso However, unique zzso and zzso zzso patterns associated with the repetitive zzso zzso in the zzso repeats are zzso These results, in conjunction with recent in zzso studies suggest that longer zzso repeats may form hairpin structures, which can potentially cause interruption in zzso leading to dynamic expansion or deletion of zzso zzso
