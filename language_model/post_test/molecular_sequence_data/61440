zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso of molecular weight zzso zzso zzso cell zzso signaling in zzso and zzso in zzso Here, we cloned the full-length zzso for both human and mouse zzso zzso Both genes zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids containing a seven zzso domain, a zzso motif and a zzso zzso motif and showed a zzso zzso acid sequence identity to each zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of zzso with protein databases revealed no significant zzso with all known seven zzso zzso but a significant structural similarity to a hypothetical protein of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a highly zzso gene which encodes a novel type of seven zzso zzso
