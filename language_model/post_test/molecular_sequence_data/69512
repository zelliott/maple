The regulation of the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is zzso by the interaction of the iron regulatory factor zzso with a specific recognition site, the iron responsive element zzso in the zzso untranslated regions zzso of the respective zzso A new modular expression system was designed to allow reconstruction of this regulatory system in zzso zzso This comprised two zzso a zzso expressed reporter gene zzso zzso zzso preceded by a zzso zzso including an zzso zzso and an zzso expressed zzso zzso human zzso zzso of the latter led to the in zzso synthesis of zzso which in turn showed zzso activity and also zzso translation of the zzso zzso bearing an zzso zzso zzso The upper zzso region of an zzso with no further zzso zzso zzso zzso for recognition and repression by zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso could also be demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso This work defines a minimal system for zzso zzso regulation in zzso that requires no additional zzso zzso thus providing direct proof that zzso functions as a zzso zzso in zzso It should be a useful tool as the basis for more detailed studies of zzso zzso zzso
