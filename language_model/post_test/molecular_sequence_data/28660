The structural maintenance of zzso zzso proteins are essential for successful zzso transmission during replication and segregation of the zzso in all zzso zzso are generally present as single proteins in bacteria, and as at least six distinct proteins in zzso The proteins range in size from approximately 110 to 170 zzso and each has five distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which contain sequences characteristic of zzso two zzso regions separating the terminal zzso and a central flexible zzso zzso proteins function together with other proteins in a range of zzso transactions, including zzso zzso zzso cohesion, zzso DNA repair and zzso zzso of gene zzso Recent studies are beginning to decipher molecular details of how these processes are carried zzso
