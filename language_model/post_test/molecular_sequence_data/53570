To correlate zzso rigidity with zzso selectivity of zzso activity and zzso we prepared six zzso zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso bear zzso zzso bonds together with varying numbers zzso to three) of zzso zzso zzso The most constrained analog is a zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) containing three evenly zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso against 10 organisms in low- and zzso conditions showed that these zzso zzso were broadly active with different zzso profiles against zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso and one tested virus, zzso Compared to zzso the zzso zzso zzso 3 displayed approximately a zzso decrease in zzso activity against human cells and 6- to zzso improvement of zzso selectivity against six of the 10 tested zzso In contrast, zzso 8, a zzso zzso with no zzso bond, and zzso 5, a zzso mimic of zzso with one zzso bond, exhibited activity zzso zzso and zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso containing with one to three zzso bonds displayed some degree of zzso structures in zzso or zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso structures are useful in the design of zzso peptides and that an increase in the zzso rigidity of zzso may zzso zzso selectivity that zzso zzso activity from zzso zzso
