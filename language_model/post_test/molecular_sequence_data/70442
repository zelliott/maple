zzso studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso is a major carrier protein regulating the zzso pH in the cells of the zzso The presence of multiple forms of the zzso has been demonstrated by the recent cloning of four zzso zzso zzso to zzso Despite the structural zzso these zzso zzso differ in their tissue distribution, kinetic zzso and responses to external zzso The present study was undertaken to examine the expression and distribution of four zzso zzso in the guinea pig zzso We used reverse zzso chain reaction to assess the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso to examine their zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso could be detected in the cochlear zzso the zzso message was zzso zzso guinea pig zzso partial zzso fragments were highly zzso to the corresponding rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was distributed in the hair cells, marginal cells, spiral ligament zzso spiral prominence cells and spiral zzso zzso zzso localized in a variety of cochlear cells would contribute to their differential zzso
