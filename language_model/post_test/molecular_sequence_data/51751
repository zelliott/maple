zzso alpha zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is considered to have a nuclear function related to cell zzso zzso of its zzso acid sequence revealed the presence of sequences that may serve as targets for zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha isolated from calf zzso was zzso in zzso by zzso The zzso sites are zzso and zzso zzso located among the first 14 zzso acid zzso in the zzso alpha zzso Another site that is theoretically suitable for zzso by zzso at the zzso of the zzso is not, in fact, zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso alpha 1), a zzso whose sequence zzso to the first 28 zzso acids of zzso zzso is also zzso by zzso at the same zzso sites as zzso zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso alpha was zzso at zzso zzso located at positions 7, 12 and/or zzso Based on these observations we conclude that zzso or another cellular zzso with similar sequence zzso is responsible for zzso of zzso alpha in zzso
