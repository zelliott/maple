We have investigated the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the addition of zzso and 3' hairpin zzso As a model system, we have targeted the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso protein complex genes zzso three highly related zzso zzso 85 A, B, and zzso Whereas the addition of a hairpin extension at only one end of the zzso did not improve their zzso capacity, the addition of hairpin extensions at both ends enhanced their capacity to inhibit zzso tuberculosis zzso in comparison with unmodified zzso A combination of three zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting each of the three zzso zzso transcripts inhibited bacterial growth in broth culture by approximately zzso log units zzso zzso zzso and in human zzso zzso by approximately zzso log units zzso zzso zzso which to our knowledge has not previously been demonstrated for any zzso reduced target gene zzso by zzso or zzso caused approximately zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso and increased bacterial sensitivity to zzso by zzso The zzso effect of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso and zzso are highly zzso against zzso tuberculosis and supports the further development of zzso technology as a therapeutic zzso against zzso
