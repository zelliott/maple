zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso active zzso and a zzso inactive zzso Although structurally and functionally zzso these zzso are products of a single zzso division during zzso the sexual phase of the life zzso zzso analyses during growth, zzso and zzso were used to examine the nuclear deposition of zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is found in zzso and thought to play a role in zzso active zzso zzso zzso were generated using whole zzso protein and synthetic peptides from the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso active zzso stained at all stages of the life zzso zzso did not stain during growth or zzso but stained with two of the zzso during early stages of zzso preceding the stage when zzso become zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the zzso acquisition of zzso early in zzso zzso zzso disappeared from developing zzso late in zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso stained zzso only briefly, late in zzso The detection of the previously zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be related to the elimination of zzso during the dynamic zzso of zzso zzso that occurs as the zzso enters a zzso incompetent state that is maintained during zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso differences between zzso and zzso are associated with the loss of a zzso component from developing zzso rather than its de zzso appearance in developing zzso and argue that zzso functions in establishing a zzso competent state of zzso
