zzso zzso by zzso zzso of oral zzso facilitate bacterial zzso on zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is positively regulated by zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso The zzso promoter and zzso binding sequences are located within a DNA zzso repeat immediately downstream of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso transcripts are associated with this zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that the zzso product acts in trans near the zzso promoter to increase the level of zzso transcript, but it does not affect the level of zzso zzso To further analyze regulation by zzso a series of strain zzso derivatives was constructed and zzso activities were zzso zzso in which zzso was separated from zzso by integrated zzso sequences had decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso could not increase activity to parental zzso As expected, strains with zzso deletions involving the zzso structural gene and either the zzso or zzso promoter also showed decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso could increase zzso activity only in strains which had a zzso zzso region beginning 72 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso zzso suggest that these zzso located within the 3' end of zzso are necessary, either by direct involvement in binding or by indirectly affecting secondary structure, for zzso to increase zzso zzso Surprisingly, the presence of the zzso promoter upstream of this zzso region significantly increased the effects of zzso zzso zzso for zzso regulation and zzso to other zzso zzso are zzso
