Natural zzso of zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso have been analyzed by fast atom zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Some pure components have been zzso by two-dimensional zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso and zzso forms and the position of double bonds in the fatty acid part of these zzso can be easily zzso from positive and negative zzso zzso zzso Details about position of zzso can be obtained from zzso mass zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and from the zzso zzso zzso in zzso fragmentation between zzso and zzso molecular zzso are discussed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso from zzso zzso results specifically in the removal of the zzso group, whereas the zzso and zzso group are zzso This specificity is explained from a three-dimensional model of the zzso generated on the basis of the short zzso distances as zzso from the zzso zzso zzso
