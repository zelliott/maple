The zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion of zzso zzso by disassembling zzso complexes during zzso zzso is also required for zzso of the fusion factor zzso although the zzso machinery has not been zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso and acts during a novel zzso of zzso zzso This zzso is controlled by a zzso function of zzso Our data indicate that zzso presents zzso via its zzso zzso domain to zzso while transfer to zzso zzso domain occurs spontaneously and not zzso The conservation of zzso and its zzso to several zzso suggest that its zzso activity may also be required in other zzso fusion zzso
