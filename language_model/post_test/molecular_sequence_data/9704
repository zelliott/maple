Previous experiments using human zzso cells indicated that zzso the protein zzso by the first open reading frame zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso occurs in a large zzso zzso complex in direct association with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso We have now investigated the interaction between partially zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso using an zzso binding zzso dependent on zzso of zzso and bound zzso These experiments identified two zzso binding sites on the full-length sense strand zzso zzso Both sites are in the second zzso of the zzso zzso zzso site A between zzso 1999 and zzso and site B between zzso zzso and zzso The two zzso segments share zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso followed by zzso indicate that zzso in the in zzso complex is directly associated with zzso zzso as it is in the zzso zzso complex found in zzso zzso zzso and competition experiments demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso zzso containing a zzso binding site, but not to zzso or zzso DNA, zzso zzso or a zzso hybrid containing a binding site zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso
