A zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was identified from Chlorella zzso and designated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in zzso coli, and it showed both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcript of zzso increased throughout zzso zzso whereas the zzso protein amount and total zzso activity decreased once and then increased during zzso By in zzso pull-down zzso a zzso protein bound to zzso was isolated and identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is maintained at a constant level during zzso and functions as an zzso with zzso zzso in the acquisition of freezing tolerance of zzso
