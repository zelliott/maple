The zzso zzso factor has been shown to be important in the regulation of zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso and mast cell zzso It is a member of a family of zzso proteins which both overlap in their expression patterns and bind the motif zzso The zzso family of proteins are also members of the zzso of zinc zzso domain proteins and have two similar zzso of the type zzso which direct the DNA binding of the zzso A random zzso selection procedure has been employed to further zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso The resulting zzso were tested for binding activity to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two classes of zzso interaction have been zzso the first requiring only the zzso finger of zzso to bind and having the motif zzso the second requiring both finger zzso to bind and having the core motif zzso By using sequence comparison and zzso analysis it is concluded that the two zzso zzso of zzso have different DNA binding recognition zzso zzso of zzso to zzso motifs is associated with zzso zzso of linked zzso The only known zzso motif is in the zzso zzso promoter region of the human A zzso gene where the binding of zzso appears to regulate the correct zzso suppression of zzso zzso
