A zzso expressed gene has been isolated from a zzso expression library of zzso zzso zzso The isolated clone contains the complete coding zzso The corresponding protein zzso has a molecular weight of zzso zzso and is expressed at the zzso level in the zzso being zzso in the zzso layer of the zzso This protein shares an important zzso with a family of zzso weight proteins involved in the binding of zzso zzso This family includes a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso that has zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso data already reported for zzso zzso suggest that zzso could be a molecular marker for early events in the process of zzso zzso
