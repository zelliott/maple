A total of zzso bases of zzso zzso including the entire human zzso zzso gene locus has been zzso This is the largest zzso human DNA sequence ever zzso The sequence data revealed the organization of 36 potentially active V zzso gene zzso 33 zzso zzso and seven J zzso zzso gene zzso Among these 69 functional or zzso V zzso gene zzso 32 were newly zzso These V zzso gene segments are located within five zzso clusters and are divided into five clans based on sequence zzso Five potentially active zzso genes were also detected within the zzso gene zzso and two other genes were observed in the upstream zzso zzso organization suggests that large DNA zzso diversified the zzso repertoire of the V zzso gene zzso
