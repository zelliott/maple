zzso C zzso is unique among the zzso zzso because each zzso zzso contains a split zzso zzso zzso domain with an zzso tandem repeat zzso (where zzso indicates zzso zzso zzso in the middle of its zzso zzso zzso zzso exist in a number of other proteins that play crucial signaling zzso However, little is known about the structure and function of split zzso zzso The zzso half of the zzso split zzso domain has been implicated to interact directly with the zzso calcium channel, thereby providing a direct zzso mechanism between zzso and zzso calcium zzso However, this interaction has not been proved by direct zzso or structural zzso Here we determined the three-dimensional structure of the split zzso domain of zzso and we found that the split zzso domain of the zzso folds into a zzso zzso domain fold with high zzso The zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso strands does not change the structure of the split zzso zzso In contrast to the majority of zzso zzso zzso the zzso split zzso domain lacks the signature zzso motif located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with this structural feature, the split zzso domain of zzso does not bind to zzso Multiple zzso and zzso experiments have argued against a direct interaction between zzso and the zzso half of the zzso split zzso zzso Our data pointed to the existence of a yet to be zzso interaction mechanism between zzso and zzso
