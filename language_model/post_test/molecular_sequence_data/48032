zzso protein zzso both cell cycle progression and zzso zzso of specific cellular zzso including zzso with zzso zzso zzso mediates cell cycle zzso In contrast, the nuclear zzso protein associates with an zzso zzso domain with unknown zzso The zzso protein contains a region of sequence similarity to the death domain of proteins involved in zzso zzso We demonstrate here that forced zzso expression zzso zzso zzso in several tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso within the death domain zzso compromise zzso zzso suggesting that it is required for normal zzso zzso zzso protein is specifically altered in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso Furthermore, dominant interfering death domain zzso compromise cellular responses to zzso zzso Finally, physical association with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso protein plays a role in the regulation of zzso and that zzso directly coordinates cell proliferation and zzso by binding specific proteins involved in each process through distinct protein binding zzso
