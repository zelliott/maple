We examined the capacity of zzso rat zzso zzso zzso mast cells zzso to express zzso for several zzso zzso of zzso with zzso for 4 zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso for zzso but not for the other four zzso zzso of zzso with zzso A zzso or zzso zzso each at zzso M for 24 zzso significantly inhibited the induced expression of zzso for each of the five zzso and also inhibited release of biologically active zzso Throughout these experiments zzso levels of the zzso gene zzso were not altered by stimulation with zzso or incubation with zzso or zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso gene expression of several zzso and that expression of these genes can be inhibited by zzso zzso
