The Small zzso Partner zzso is an orphan nuclear zzso and an zzso member of the nuclear zzso zzso Since its discovery, a growing body of zzso have pointed out a pivotal role for zzso in the zzso regulation of a variety of target genes involved in diverse zzso zzso While we have previously developed a zzso model of the structure of zzso that was instrumental to identify a putative zzso binding pocket and suggest the possibility of the development of synthetic zzso others reported that some zzso zzso may represent the first synthetic zzso for this zzso In this work, we report a combined zzso approach aimed at shedding further lights on the binding mode and mechanism of action of some zzso zzso as zzso of zzso The results have been instrumental to design zzso experiments whose preliminary data suggest the presence of a functional site in zzso as defined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso While further experimental studies are zzso these findings constitute the basis for the design and identification of novel synthetic zzso of zzso zzso
