We investigated the synthesis of zzso zzso by two zzso zzso In the first method, two DNA zzso were associated through a duplex segment of more than a full zzso zzso zzso of the entwined zzso by T4 DNA zzso resulted in two zzso zzso with a total yield of approximately zzso In the second method, a DNA zzso was zzso over a circular DNA template, resulting in the formation of approximately zzso zzso zzso The circular nature of zzso zzso was verified with zzso zzso and the existence of zzso linkages was demonstrated by analyzing the zzso mobility pattern of DNA products obtained from the zzso of each zzso DNA using specific restriction zzso A zzso DNA library in which one of the two rings contained zzso zzso was also constructed and tested for zzso with in zzso zzso
