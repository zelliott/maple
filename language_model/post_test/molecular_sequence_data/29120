We report the presence of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are highly zzso in two zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is more similar to other zzso proteins than zzso which is the most divergent zzso described so zzso The zzso zzso zzso do not show any clear zzso to the zzso duplicated zzso zzso zzso and twin of zzso which suggests an independent zzso zzso in a zzso or zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the central nervous system of intact zzso labeling a subset of cells of both zzso zzso and nerve zzso and is activated during zzso zzso zzso follows a similar pattern, but shows a lower level of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are detected in visual cells only at the zzso level, probably because a limited amount of transcripts is present in these zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso by zzso gene interference zzso zzso neither eye zzso nor eye zzso suggesting that the genetic network that controls this process is not triggered by zzso in zzso
