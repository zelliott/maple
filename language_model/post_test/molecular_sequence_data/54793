The La protein binds the 3' ends of many newly zzso zzso zzso protecting these zzso from zzso and influencing zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although 3' end binding by La involves the zzso La domain and adjacent zzso recognition motif zzso the mechanisms by which La zzso diverse zzso from zzso and assists subsequent events in their zzso are zzso Here we report that a zzso feature of La zzso an zzso zzso C zzso is required for the zzso of certain zzso zzso precursors and for the role of the zzso zzso La protein zzso in assisting formation of correctly folded zzso zzso stems in zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso reveal that the C zzso is required to protect a zzso zzso stem from chemical zzso Although the C zzso of zzso is hypersensitive to zzso in zzso it becomes zzso upon binding zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus, while high affinity binding to 3' ends requires the La domain and zzso a zzso flexible C zzso allows La to interact zzso with a diversity of zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso adjacent to well characterized zzso motifs in other zzso zzso proteins may similarly contribute to the ability of these proteins to influence the cellular fates of multiple distinct zzso zzso
