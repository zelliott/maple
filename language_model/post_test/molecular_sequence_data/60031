zzso T4 zzso is a zzso zzso segmented zzso zzso zzso Earlier we showed that the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso is essential for correct zzso and folding of the zzso We constructed the zzso fusion protein zzso in which the zzso zzso sequence is followed by the small zzso zzso protein zzso of the T4 zzso We showed that the zzso is capable of zzso in the absence of the zzso part of zzso A deletion zzso of zzso zzso with completely deleted zzso is unable to fold and zzso zzso An excess of this zzso protein did not influence the zzso of zzso in zzso and the zzso protein inhibited this process zzso Our conclusion is that the zzso of the zzso is the initial step of zzso zzso and is followed by the formation of the zzso zzso
