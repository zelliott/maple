zzso cells are widespread in nature, yet the mechanism by which cells fuse their plasma zzso is poorly zzso To identify animal zzso we performed new screens for zzso that abolish cell fusion within zzso of zzso zzso throughout zzso We identified the gene zzso which is expressed as cells acquire fusion competence and encodes a novel integral membrane zzso zzso sequence motifs suggest zzso actions that could cause adjacent zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso completely block zzso cell membrane fusion without affecting other zzso events such as cell generation, zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is a key component in the mechanism of cell fusion, a process essential to normal animal zzso
