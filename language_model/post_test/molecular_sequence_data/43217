The zzso factor zzso a zzso protein complex composed of zzso and small zzso family zzso is considered crucial for the regulation of zzso gene expression and zzso zzso To facilitate the characterization of zzso functions in human cells, we isolated zzso zzso two members of the small zzso family, zzso and zzso The human zzso and zzso genes zzso proteins of 156 and 162 zzso acid zzso respectively, whose deduced zzso acid sequences show approximately zzso identity to their respective chicken zzso zzso of zzso zzso is high in heart, skeletal muscle and zzso whereas zzso zzso is abundant in skeletal muscle and is moderately expressed in heart and zzso Both are expressed in all zzso cell lines, including those of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso gel mobility shift zzso binding to zzso sites was found to depend on formation of zzso or zzso with zzso and zzso zzso family zzso The results suggest that the small zzso family proteins function in human cells through interaction with various zzso zzso zzso zzso
