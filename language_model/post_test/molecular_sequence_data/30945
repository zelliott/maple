The human zzso gene has been previously shown to zzso a zzso zzso whose zzso in zzso cells is regulated by the zzso growth factor zzso We report the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso which revealed that the full length transcript encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso portion is composed of three zzso zzso zzso resembling the organization of the zzso for zzso and the zzso domain displays unique organization of zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso directed to the zzso of the zzso protein recognized three zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso that undergo zzso in the zzso Moreover, the zzso specifically zzso two proteins zzso and zzso that were zzso zzso to basic zzso but only one zzso of the two molecular forms of the zzso for zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso zzso days zzso indicated that zzso is transcribed in the prospective brain, areas of the face and the zzso zzso The latter exhibited progressive zzso concentration into the zzso zzso Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the zzso gene encodes a zzso for zzso growth zzso
