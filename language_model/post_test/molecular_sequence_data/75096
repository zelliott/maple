A zzso clone that zzso to an zzso zzso that accumulates to a substantial level in the axis of the zzso soybean seed was zzso The zzso acid sequence of the clone indicates an almost perfect repeat of zzso resulting in a protein containing zzso zzso and lacking zzso and zzso On the likelihood that such a protein might be a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell walls of a soybean cell culture were extracted by procedures used to obtain soluble basic zzso zzso and the proteins were zzso and zzso A zzso protein (and possibly a zzso zzso was obtained that has an zzso acid distribution similar to that of the zzso zzso The protein lacks zzso and zzso and contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is thus distinct both in its zzso acid content and in its zzso repeat of zzso with half of the zzso being zzso
