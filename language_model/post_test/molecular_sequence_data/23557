zzso VI zzso has a crucial role in zzso responses to zzso Still, little is known about its interaction with its zzso In binding zzso using soluble or zzso human zzso we observed that zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso zzso with one another for the binding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso part of the human zzso displayed selective zzso properties on zzso interaction with its zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly reduced the binding of zzso to zzso zzso inhibited its interaction with zzso whereas zzso prevented all three zzso These observations suggest that zzso sites are zzso exhibiting specific features but at the same time also sharing some common zzso participating in the recognition of these zzso The zzso of zzso was mapped by zzso display, along with molecular modeling of human zzso which allowed the identification of zzso within zzso potentially involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso 34 and zzso 36 are critical for zzso interaction with collagen and zzso The loop might thus be part of a zzso zzso
