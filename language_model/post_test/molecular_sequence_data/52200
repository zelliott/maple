An updated zzso model is constructed for the zzso zzso site of the zzso The model is based on analogies to the known structures of the zzso site on zzso zzso and the zzso zzso sites on zzso factor Tu zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Recent studies of these known zzso zzso have revealed several common functional features and similar alignment of zzso in their binding zzso and these are used as a framework for evaluating results of affinity labeling and zzso studies of the beta zzso of zzso Several potentially important zzso on beta are noted that have not yet been studied by zzso or affinity zzso
