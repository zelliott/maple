Atlantic zzso zzso zzso from the zzso Hudson River population exhibit a genetic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene which is evidenced in Northern zzso analyses by a truncated transcript and in Southern zzso analyses by a deletion in the zzso zzso To initially evaluate the functional significance of this zzso we sought to characterize the molecular basis for this zzso and to determine its frequency in zzso from other populations in which the prevalence of zzso is zzso The common zzso zzso sequence was determined from zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso A sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was obtained by direct sequence analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso structure is highly zzso between zzso and all other zzso and zzso species zzso zzso of the deduced zzso rainbow trout, and zzso zzso acid sequences was zzso whereas similarity between zzso and zzso sequences was approximately zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso results from a zzso deletion in the 7th zzso of the 3' untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso chain reaction and Northern zzso analyses revealed an absence of this zzso zzso in zzso from other zzso Studies in humans suggest that variation in zzso zzso may impact on genetic zzso to environmentally induced zzso Furthermore, studies in in zzso zzso models indicate the importance of 3' zzso on gene expression by zzso on the stability of zzso These results suggest that the 3' zzso zzso zzso in zzso may have consequences for the genetic zzso of Hudson River fish to zzso zzso
