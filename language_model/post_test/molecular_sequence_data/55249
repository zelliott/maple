The genetic diversity present in populations of zzso viruses is likely to be strongly modulated by aspects of their life history, including mode of zzso However, how transmission mode shapes patterns of zzso and zzso genetic diversity, particularly when acting in combination with de zzso zzso population bottlenecks and the selection of advantageous zzso is poorly zzso To address these issues, this study performed zzso sequencing of zzso yellow mosaic virus in a wild gourd, zzso zzso zzso zzso under two infection conditions: zzso zzso and mechanically zzso achieving a mean coverage of approximately zzso It was shown that zzso persisted during zzso transmission events in both the zzso zzso and mechanically zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso transmission bottleneck is not as extreme as previously zzso Similarly, zzso were found to persist within individual zzso arguing against strong systemic zzso zzso zzso were seen to go to fixation in the zzso plants, suggestive of a major fitness advantage, but remained at low frequency in the mechanically zzso zzso Overall, this study highlights the utility of zzso sequencing in providing high-resolution data capable of revealing the nature of virus evolution, particularly as the full spectrum of genetic diversity within a population may not be uncovered without sequence coverage of at least zzso
