The zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and mercury zzso was previously obtained from activated sludge bacteria by applying the zzso isolation method with zzso zzso strain zzso as zzso A zzso zzso designated zzso occurred spontaneously and displays an extended zzso restriction zzso From the zzso zzso zzso it is known that the corresponding zzso zzso of this zzso contains a complete class 1 zzso with an zzso and an zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso variable region present on zzso revealed that a second copy of the zzso gene cassette has inserted downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the second zzso cassette indicate that this cassette was excised from zzso and zzso at a new site in an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cassette is associated with a higher level of zzso zzso Another zzso zzso designated zzso zzso higher resistance to zzso was shown to carry an zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso Since zzso possesses a zzso activity, it can be assumed that the elevated zzso resistance level is due to enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso
