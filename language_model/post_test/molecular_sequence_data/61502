zzso is a protein with zzso to the zzso motif of the zzso protein zzso zzso has been described as a zzso transcript, which starts to accumulate in zzso mouse zzso zzso a differential display comparing zzso gene expression in embryonic zzso and mature zzso also revealed the presence of the zzso transcript in fetal zzso as well as in fetal and adult zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso was expressed in a characteristic zzso manner in fetal zzso Only a weak expression was observed at zzso the strongest signal was reached at zzso whereas the signal declined between zzso and zzso This transitional expression zzso with the early stages of the female zzso zzso zzso In the male, however, zzso was expressed in all stages of zzso zzso I except zzso and zzso In zzso zzso further showed that the zzso level increased during zzso I in the male, with the strongest expression seen at the transition from zzso to late zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, initiation of zzso zzso paralleled that of the zzso complex protein 1 transcript zzso in the fetal zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore, propose that zzso is likely to have a function in both the male and female zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the distinct difference in both the timing and the level of zzso zzso in the two zzso zzso zzso I suggests that zzso zzso may be controlled by two different mechanisms during male and female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
