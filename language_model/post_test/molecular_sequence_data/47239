Type II signal zzso zzso zzso remove signal peptides from zzso zzso of zzso As the zzso mechanism employed by type II zzso was not known, the present studies were aimed at the identification of their potential active site zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of 19 known type II zzso revealed the presence of five zzso zzso The importance of the 15 best zzso zzso in these zzso was investigated using the type II zzso of zzso zzso which, unlike zzso II of zzso coli, is not essential for zzso The results showed that only six zzso are important for zzso II zzso These are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Only zzso was required for stability of zzso II, indicating that the other five zzso are required for zzso the active site zzso or the specific recognition of zzso zzso As zzso and zzso are the only zzso invoked in the known zzso mechanisms of zzso we zzso that these two zzso are directly involved in zzso zzso zzso This implies that type II zzso belong to a novel family of zzso zzso
