To identify zzso in the zzso important for expression of zzso zzso activity of horse zzso zzso zzso zzso and donkey zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio ten times higher for zzso than for zzso this zzso activity absolutely requires an zzso zzso or zzso zzso combined with an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso possessing the first 63 zzso of the zzso zzso and the last 33 zzso of the donkey zzso zzso and the inverse zzso were zzso zzso zzso were introduced by zzso in donkey zzso at positions 70, 85, 89, 93 and 96 zzso 18 zzso or 78 zzso 

These different zzso were zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso were then assessed in two zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso exhibited zzso activity when zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso or zzso gave hybrids with no zzso activity and important zzso activity when expressed with zzso zzso displayed an zzso ratio as low as that of zzso However, zzso at 78 in zzso had no effect on zzso zzso when zzso with zzso 

zzso present in both the first two-thirds and the last third of the zzso of zzso zzso are involved in their zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts as strong an influence on it as the zzso zzso By contrast, this zzso plays no role in the zzso specificity of zzso
