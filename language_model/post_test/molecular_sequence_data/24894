We investigated the role of zzso in the development of B cell memory by analyzing the zzso zzso response in a line of A strain mice in which expression of human zzso was enforced in the B cell zzso Previous studies of the zzso immune response in these zzso zzso mice, demonstrated that a large percentage of the zzso expressed by the zzso induced memory B cell compartment had accumulated point zzso via zzso zzso that increased their affinity for both zzso and the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso This was in sharp contrast to normal A strain mice which displayed no dual zzso B cells in their zzso induced memory B cell zzso These data suggested that interference with zzso pathways regulated by zzso allows developing memory B cells that have acquired zzso to bypass a peripheral tolerance zzso Further studies of these mice, reported here, demonstrate that enforced expression of zzso does not alter serum zzso affinity maturation nor positive selection of B cells expressing zzso zzso zzso with an increased affinity for zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso process was unaffected in zzso zzso zzso Thus, enforced expression of zzso in zzso zzso mice appears to selectively alter a negative selection process that operates during memory B cell zzso
