zzso A is zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso In the nucleus, zzso A is processed to zzso A by zzso removal of the final 18 zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we isolated a novel human zzso zzso that binds the zzso tail of zzso zzso zzso has limited zzso to zzso bacterial zzso and zzso proteins of unknown zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso expressed in all human cell lines and zzso zzso The protein is detected in the nuclear fraction of zzso cell zzso on Western blots and can be extracted from nuclear envelopes with zzso M zzso When a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells, it is exclusively nuclear and partially zzso with the nuclear zzso The zzso status of zzso A determines its ability to bind to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso or deletion of the zzso motif from the zzso A tail domain zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso and in zzso binding zzso The zzso binding of zzso to zzso A is an important first step in understanding the functional significance of the zzso A zzso
