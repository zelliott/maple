We isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from rat zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, by the zzso zzso The zzso lacked zzso recognizable zzso and showed a typical zzso zzso zzso such as a high sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso By means of zzso zzso zzso and cell fusion, zzso and zzso were found to belong to a recently identified zzso group zzso zzso of human zzso zzso restored zzso assembly in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso was zzso its deduced sequence comprises 405 zzso acids with zzso identity to human zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso was determined by zzso G to A transition resulted in one zzso acid zzso zzso in one zzso and zzso of a 42 zzso acid sequence from zzso to zzso in another zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso cell lines with a zzso of impaired zzso
