zzso zzso zzso egg zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso family which is mainly found in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso and its zzso architecture was zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequence indicated that zzso was composed of zzso zzso including 95 zzso of domain N and 97 zzso of domain zzso N and C showed 73 % sequence identity and contained both zzso and zzso motifs which are zzso in most of the zzso zzso recognition zzso The calculated molecular mass of mature zzso was zzso consistent with the result, and zzso from mass zzso zzso was zzso by eight zzso zzso 1 and 2 for a signal zzso zzso 3-5 and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso analyses revealed that zzso showed comparable affinity for zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso bound zzso to zzso of zzso The zzso values of zzso and zzso against zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso M for and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso Thus, the zzso recognition property of zzso is slightly different from that of zzso On the other hand, frontal affinity zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso with only zzso zzso such as zzso zzso not with zzso zzso The domain composition of these zzso and an zzso environment such as the zzso zzso of a zzso might influence the binding between zzso and sugar zzso
