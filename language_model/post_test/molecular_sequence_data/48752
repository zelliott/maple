Wall zzso of zzso zzso are abundant and conspicuous zzso inhabiting Europe and North zzso In recent years, they have become a popular zzso model for zzso and evolutionary ecology zzso However a lack of suitable nuclear markers currently presents a limitation on analyses of molecular evolution within this zzso We address this limitation by developing zzso new primer pairs for zzso chain reaction zzso amplification and sequencing of anonymous sequence markers in zzso zzso and performed an zzso of their zzso and zzso levels in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and sequencing was straightforward among members of the zzso and zzso group within zzso zzso (which includes zzso zzso and somewhat less successful in species belonging to other groups (one and four zzso out of 21 failed to amplify in zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and overall success rates were zzso zzso diversity for the five species examined ranged from zzso to zzso with an average of zzso across all zzso zzso and deletion zzso were found in all but three zzso 

Given the high zzso rates, these markers constitute a valuable addition to set of zzso resources available for zzso especially in studies dealing with zzso species zzso population zzso and zzso
