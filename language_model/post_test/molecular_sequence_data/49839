zzso with two identical zzso zzso acid sequences joined by a flexible hairpin zzso zzso can zzso bind to specific DNA sequences without altering zzso zzso thus offering a unique opportunity to attach various functional entities to high molecular weight zzso Current synthetic approaches, however, severely limit the possibility to link peptides or other chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Here we report a novel strategy for the synthesis of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso of zzso to peptides was accomplished through zzso formation between an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso modifications can also be zzso The described synthesis is highly efficient, does not require a protection strategy, and is carried out under mild zzso zzso Through this methodology long zzso sequences in either C to N or N to C polarity can be linked to zzso In addition, this protocol makes the zzso of zzso peptides feasible and allows zzso bond formation to be zzso This same approach can be exploited to link zzso zzso or other chemical entities to zzso
