In response to various zzso signals, serum response factor zzso activates cellular gene expression after binding to its zzso target sequence zzso zzso located within a serum response element zzso zzso is particularly important in T cell zzso and we now report that zzso activates zzso zzso from the human zzso leukemia zzso zzso long terminal repeat zzso A DNA element, with similarity to the consensus cellular zzso box found in the zzso promoter centered approximately 120 base pairs upstream from the viral zzso start site, has been identified and named the zzso zzso zzso zzso of gene expression from the zzso was localized to the zzso box, and zzso of this site abolished zzso zzso An zzso probe containing the zzso box bound zzso zzso and a complex formed on this probe with nuclear extract was zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso probe containing the zzso box bound zzso in zzso pull-down zzso zzso binding analysis yielded zzso affinities for both the viral and cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso is resident on the zzso zzso in zzso These data identify a functional serum response element in the zzso zzso and suggest that zzso may play an important role in regulating zzso zzso gene expression in early infection and zzso from zzso
