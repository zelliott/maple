zzso growth zzso activity zzso regulated zzso and zzso zzso are highly related zzso that have a zzso role in melanoma zzso zzso of these zzso is similar in that both require the zzso B element and additional regions such as the zzso binding protein zzso element of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso alpha in normal retinal zzso zzso and the zzso melanoma cells is partially regulated through the zzso B element, which binds both zzso B zzso and zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso alpha promoter reveals that, in addition to the zzso B element, the immediate upstream region zzso is necessary for zzso expression in retinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that several zzso DNA binding proteins interact with the zzso Although this region has sequence similarity to the several zzso factor elements including zzso the zzso includes sequences that have no similarity to previously identified zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso through either the zzso B element or the zzso suggesting a putative interaction between zzso B and this novel zzso
