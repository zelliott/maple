zzso zzso zzso including membrane type 1 zzso zzso can degrade zzso zzso and cell surface zzso molecules and have an essential function in zzso Recently, we established a functional link between zzso and the zzso of complement component zzso zzso The zzso is known as a zzso regulator of diverse cellular and viral zzso Once released by zzso cells, soluble zzso may inhibit complement component zzso zzso activity and play important roles in zzso in assisting tumor cells to evade destruction by zzso Here, we report that zzso is susceptible to zzso zzso in zzso and in cell zzso The major zzso zzso site zzso down zzso zzso is localized within the structurally zzso loop connecting the zzso and the zzso strands of zzso The zzso zzso construct that included the zzso domain but lacked the zzso domain lost the zzso zzso however, it retained the ability to bind zzso zzso of zzso activity by a zzso inhibitor converted the zzso into a cell surface zzso of zzso and promoted zzso zzso with the soluble zzso zzso It is tempting to zzso that these novel mechanisms may play important roles in zzso and have to be taken into account in designing zzso cancer zzso
