zzso zzso and human zzso cells, and a limited number of other normal and zzso cells, zzso three chains that have been identified as type VIII collagen zzso zzso 125 zzso and 100 zzso zzso with zzso converts these forms to major fragments of 65 zzso (based on zzso protein zzso In this study we have examined the structure and distribution of type VIII collagen in developing mice by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was observed in embryonic heart, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso of embryonic and zzso zzso showed major species of 125 and 65 zzso in the brain, zzso heart, zzso and zzso The zzso band in zzso zzso was zzso zzso with additional forms of 250 and 150 zzso in zzso heart and zzso Type VIII collagen was also zzso by zzso cells, forming zzso tubes in zzso We suggest that type VIII collagen functions in cellular organization and zzso and that its various forms reflect not only zzso processing but the presence of several related zzso
