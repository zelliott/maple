The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso factor attachment zzso zzso constitute the ubiquitous zzso machinery responsible for recycling of the zzso zzso zzso membrane fusion zzso The zzso uses the energy of zzso zzso to zzso the constituents of the zzso complex, which is formed during the fusion of a transport zzso with the zzso zzso However, it is still unclear how zzso and the zzso zzso work together to take the tight zzso bundle zzso zzso have been reported to attach to zzso independently from zzso complex zzso We have investigated how efficient the zzso of soluble and zzso zzso are, comparing the zzso We found that zzso support zzso of zzso zzso complexes much more zzso Moreover, we identified a zzso zzso membrane attachment site in an extended loop within the zzso domain of zzso zzso of two highly zzso exposed zzso zzso on the extended loop prevent zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This implies that the zzso machinery is adapted to attack zzso zzso complexes, probably in their relaxed zzso
