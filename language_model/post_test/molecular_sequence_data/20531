zzso graded communication between different cell types is essential for normal development and zzso In the nervous system, heart, and for some cancer cells, part of this communication requires signaling by soluble and zzso factors produced by the zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso factors activate a zzso localized release of soluble zzso from zzso zzso that can, in turn promote proper zzso development zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso Here we zzso the mechanism of this zzso regulated release by implicating the delta zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso the zzso delta zzso with either zzso a selective zzso or small interference zzso blocks the regulated release of zzso from both zzso cells and primary zzso zzso zzso zzso also leads to the rapid zzso of the zzso zzso tail on zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso segment, that, when zzso markedly reduce the rate of zzso activity zzso These findings zzso this specific zzso zzso as an important factor for the zzso and zzso release of soluble zzso forms that have important effects in nervous system development and zzso
