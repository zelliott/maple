We cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes neutral zzso It showed zzso and zzso identity at zzso and zzso acid sequence level, respectively, with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple alignment of the predicted zzso protein sequences from zzso bacteria, insects, and zzso revealed two major zzso of zzso Only the zzso zzso displayed in an zzso extension two consensus sites for zzso protein zzso and a putative zzso zzso Gene disruption of the zzso gene abolished neutral zzso activity and clearly revealed a zzso activity with an acid pH zzso It also resulted in a high zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in an zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in rapid zzso of the zzso zzso upon addition of zzso to cells growing on a zzso carbon source and upon addition of a nitrogen source to cells starved for nitrogen in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso the same responses were observed except that rapid zzso by zzso was observed only in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso neutral zzso by alkaline zzso and zzso by zzso in cell extracts are consistent with control of the zzso by zzso protein zzso
