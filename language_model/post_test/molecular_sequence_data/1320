A zzso zzso was cloned from the Nile zzso zzso by zzso and subsequent zzso zzso of known zzso sequences from zzso confirmed the conservation of the zzso open reading frame and protein zzso especially the zzso domain and zzso region, while some zzso runs of zzso acids are found only in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is expressed in the zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the highest level of expression in the zzso reflecting the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso also revealed an evident sexual zzso expression pattern in the zzso zzso zzso was mainly detected in the zzso cells surrounding the zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso begins early during the differentiation of the zzso and persists until adulthood, zzso the involvement of zzso in fish zzso differentiation and the maintenance of zzso zzso
