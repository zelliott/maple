The structure and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso are considerably more complex than originally perceived to zzso The zzso gene has two alternative first zzso and is located in the zzso zzso Two other potential first zzso were determined to be zzso The region between the functional first zzso cannot direct zzso Thus, one common promoter element directing zzso exists, and zzso zzso occurs such that only one of the first zzso zzso only untranslated zzso is incorporated into each zzso species with common downstream zzso zzso expression and regulation are therefore similar to those of other zzso zzso handling zzso which also produce zzso species differing only in the zzso regions to yield identical zzso zzso was previously considered a zzso zzso as zzso zzso had little effect on zzso However, the promoter region immediately upstream of the dominant first zzso zzso responds to zzso zzso In this respect, zzso is similar to zzso zzso that also zzso respond to zzso zzso The discovery that zzso zzso alternative first zzso zzso eliminates a problem with the first description of zzso zzso in that it appeared that zzso expression was in violation of the zzso scanning zzso The identification that the first zzso originally noted is in fact a minor alternative first zzso far downstream of the primary first zzso eliminates this zzso
