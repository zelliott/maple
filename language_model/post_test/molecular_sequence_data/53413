zzso zzso 3 zzso and WW zzso are known to associate with zzso motifs within their respective zzso Here we demonstrate that the proposed adapter protein for zzso zzso zzso is a zzso whose zzso motifs interact with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso as well as with the WW zzso of zzso and zzso These zzso zzso in turn, are flanked by zzso repeats that represent targets for the type I protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso within these zzso repeats dramatically reduces the binding of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but has no effect on their binding to the WW domain of zzso These results suggest that protein zzso zzso can selectively zzso certain zzso interactions and that mechanisms exist for the irreversible regulation of zzso zzso zzso
