The zzso zzso factor zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso II initiation zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso zzso or zzso associated with the zzso protein zzso play a critical role in modulating zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Thus far, six of the largest zzso associated with zzso zzso have been cloned and partially zzso Here, we report the molecular zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso of two small molecular mass zzso Both zzso alpha and zzso beta are associated with zzso via interactions with other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso alpha also contacts zzso The zzso half of zzso was found to contact a short zzso region of zzso zzso which is predicted to form two potential zzso one of which is zzso Interestingly, zzso alpha also appears to zzso through its zzso zzso Although neither zzso alpha nor zzso beta have been found to interact with specific zzso thus far, it is intriguing that both bind other zzso such as zzso and zzso which are the targets of zzso zzso Our studies suggest that both of the small zzso of zzso play a role in the assembly of the complex and may contribute to the stability of multiple zzso zzso
