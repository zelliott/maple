A zzso chain reaction zzso strategy with zzso zzso was used to identify novel zzso zzso genes from human zzso zzso One of the isolated zzso termed zzso showed high sequence similarity to the genes zzso human zzso receptors for zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso inflammatory protein 1 alpha zzso zzso and to the rat orphan zzso gene zzso When zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso zzso was found to be most highly expressed in neural and zzso zzso zzso cell lines, particularly zzso cells, showed especially high expression of zzso We have mapped zzso to human zzso zzso near the zzso zzso zzso zzso
