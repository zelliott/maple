zzso cell communication is necessary for normal zzso zzso However, the identities of the majority of zzso proteins remain zzso A novel zzso zzso mouse zzso protein 1 zzso was identified using a modified zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein that contains a zzso acid signal zzso zzso 5 putative zzso zzso consensus zzso and 6 zzso that are predicted to form 3 zzso zzso zzso shares zzso acid identity with zzso protein 1 zzso a zzso protein expressed in the zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is approximately zzso zzso and is present at high levels in the zzso of adult zzso and at lower levels in the zzso The mouse zzso gene is 5 zzso spans greater than zzso zzso and zzso to zzso 19 at a position that shares zzso with human zzso zzso The identification of zzso as a new zzso protein permits future in zzso and in zzso functional analyses to define its role in zzso zzso
