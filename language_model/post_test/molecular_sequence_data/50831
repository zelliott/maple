The functional role of the zzso charged zzso acid zzso in zzso J from zzso zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso zzso located at the weak zzso site was replaced with zzso to examine the role of zzso in the heat stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and was zzso from the culture zzso When the zzso zzso was expressed at 37 degrees C in the presence of zzso calcium zzso the pattern of zzso production was quite different from that of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed with respect to optimal temperature, optimal zzso and heat zzso The zzso was found to decrease the heat stability but not zzso efficiency zzso and optimal zzso These results demonstrate the important role of the zzso charged side chains at the weak zzso site in the heat stability of zzso
