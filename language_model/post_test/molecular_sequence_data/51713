Recently, the primary structures of 17 different receptors for zzso and small zzso hormones have been zzso by molecular zzso All but one belong to the zzso of zzso coupled receptors which share a topography consisting of seven zzso zzso zzso of primary structures shows that two classes of zzso receptors zzso One referred to as the zzso zzso possesses many of the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence motifs of the zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso The other, referred to the zzso zzso displays unrelated and distinctly different sequence motifs which are zzso between the three presently known members of this zzso These are the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One may speculate that many other peptides with a core of biological activity in the zzso or middle region may have receptors of the zzso
