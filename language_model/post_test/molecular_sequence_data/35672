The zzso zzso regulatory gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso which determines the zzso acid induction of at least five structural zzso The zzso zzso contains a potential zzso zzso motif which has been shown to be present in the zzso region of a large number of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the fourth zzso of this motif zzso zzso function as shown by loss of zzso of an zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso of a zzso gene replacement zzso Studies using zzso in which the proposed zzso zzso motif is replaced with that from another zzso zzso shows that induction is independent of zzso specificity and that sequences in the zzso region of zzso are zzso zzso zzso of several zzso zzso zzso which affect zzso and/or zzso together with studies of deletion zzso indicate that changes in the zzso of the protein determines its activity and that this is modulated by zzso
