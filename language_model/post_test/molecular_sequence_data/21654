African strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso contain fewer zzso zzso than Asian zzso and their contribution to zzso is zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes was used to decipher the contribution of each of the eight zzso zzso zzso to zzso of African zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A strain zzso in zzso was severely affected in the production of disease zzso Analysis of growth in zzso upon zzso zzso showed that zzso bacteria multiplied only at the site of zzso at the zzso of the zzso suggesting a requirement for zzso during colonization of vascular zzso Such zzso effect of a zzso zzso is a novel zzso which has not yet been characterized in other zzso zzso experiments comparing the host response of rice leaves challenged with zzso zzso zzso were performed to identify genes targeted by zzso A total of 120 zzso and 21 zzso genes were identified, among them zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso Based on zzso reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso reporter zzso we show that zzso is directly zzso by zzso and identify a zzso DNA target box within the zzso upstream zzso
