The zzso zzso sodium channel zzso controls zzso zzso movement in zzso zzso and is associated with zzso syndrome, an zzso dominant form of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso channel properties and the functional consequences of zzso causing zzso syndrome has been, so far, limited by lack of a method allowing specific and quantitative detection of zzso zzso We have developed a quantitative zzso based on the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against a zzso reporter zzso introduced in the zzso loop of each of the zzso zzso and gamma zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso sequences did not change its functional and pharmacological zzso The binding specificity and affinity zzso zzso 3 zzso allowed us to correlate in individual zzso zzso the zzso zzso sodium current zzso with the number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed at the cell zzso These experiments demonstrate that: zzso only zzso channels made of zzso zzso and gamma zzso zzso are zzso and efficiently expressed at the cell surface; zzso the overall zzso open probability is one order of magnitude lower than previously observed in single-channel zzso zzso the zzso causing zzso syndrome zzso zzso enhances channel activity by two mechanisms, zzso by increasing zzso cell surface expression and by changing channel open zzso This quantitative approach provides new insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying one form of zzso zzso
