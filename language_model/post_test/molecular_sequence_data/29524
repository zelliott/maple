zzso disorders of zzso zzso are a group of zzso disorders with zzso involvement characterized by abnormalities in the synthesis of zzso zzso The most common form, zzso resulting from zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso with severe abnormalities in zzso development, zzso features and visceral zzso While this disorder is zzso we present the first cases of zzso identified in an African American family with two affected zzso The zzso had failure to thrive in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On examination, she also exhibited zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso fat distribution, all features characteristic of zzso zzso sequencing demonstrated that the patient had a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso and sequencing of each zzso introduces a stop zzso 11 zzso acids downstream from the site of the zzso The presence of this zzso zzso at zzso position zzso suggests that this site in the zzso gene may be a hotspot for zzso zzso
