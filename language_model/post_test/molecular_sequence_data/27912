Internal zzso fragments containing zzso zzso are useful zzso of coding sequence for selection of restriction zzso fragments or synthetic zzso to use in isolation of a zzso or zzso zzso We describe a strategy to identify such fragments which uses an zzso zzso array zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso from an zzso system to select peptides for zzso acid sequence zzso We applied this information to the identification and subsequent isolation of a zzso corresponding to bovine zzso zzso from a bovine zzso zzso library which contains numerous closely related gene zzso
