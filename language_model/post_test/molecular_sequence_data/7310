The large differences between the zzso content of the zzso virus zzso and those of other characterized zzso have precluded the use of DNA zzso to establish a gene map of zzso zzso Here we have zzso the ends of cloned restriction zzso fragments of the zzso strain of zzso virus zzso and used the translated sequences to search protein data zzso zzso from 15 points found zzso matches to data base entries, including 18 zzso virus zzso zzso We also present 2 zzso of sequence from a region near the right zzso of the zzso zzso and show that it encodes zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The data presented here in conjunction with published and as yet unpublished data have allowed the construction of a gene map of zzso on which 37 genes have been zzso zzso of these genes have zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso gene map with that of zzso revealed that each zzso gene and its zzso counterpart occurred in the same order and orientation on their respective zzso The intervals between many of the points of sequence were also found to be zzso zzso The zzso spacing of genes between zzso and zzso within the central zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is not maintained in the zzso where zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso are drawn between the data presented here and related data from zzso virus and zzso zzso
