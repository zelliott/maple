zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which is widely used for the production of fusion proteins in the zzso of zzso coli, was employed as a functional fusion module that effects zzso formation of a zzso protein and zzso zzso reporter activity at the same zzso For this purpose zzso was linked via a flexible zzso to the zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso whose binding properties for zzso were to be zzso The fusion protein was zzso into the bacterial zzso by means of the zzso signal zzso to ensure formation of the two zzso bonds in zzso The formation of wrong zzso in the zzso milieu was prevented by replacing three of the four exposed zzso zzso in zzso Using the zzso promoter for tightly controlled gene expression the soluble fusion protein could be isolated from the zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso was achieved in one step by means of an affinity column with zzso zzso zzso the protein was isolated via zzso affinity zzso after the zzso had been appended to its C zzso The zzso zzso of the fusion protein was zzso active and the kinetic parameters were determined using zzso and zzso as zzso Furthermore, strong binding activity for zzso was detected in an zzso The signal with the zzso fusion protein was much higher than with zzso itself, demonstrating an zzso effect due to the zzso formation of zzso The zzso structure was further confirmed by chemical zzso which resulted in a specific reaction product with twice the molecular zzso Thus, engineered zzso is suitable as a moderately zzso zzso fusion partner that can zzso zzso to a protein of interest and promote detection of binding interactions even in cases of low zzso
