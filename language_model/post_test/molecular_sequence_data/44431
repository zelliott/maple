The zzso acid sequence of the light chain of zzso zzso zzso deduced from the zzso sequence comprises 149 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso All but the 3 zzso zzso were also determined by zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso which also showed the zzso to be zzso zzso analysis shows zzso zzso zzso light chain to be more similar to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins than to the zzso II essential light chain or regulatory light chain zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso light chain sequence is most similar to sequences of zzso zzso 50% zzso and a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the sequence is approximately 37% identical to the zzso essential light chain of zzso zzso II and approximately zzso identical to the essential light chain of zzso zzso II, and the essential light chain and regulatory light chain of zzso zzso zzso The sequence predicts four zzso zzso with possible zzso sites in zzso I and III, suggesting that calcium may affect the activity of this unconventional zzso This is the first report of the sequence of an unconventional zzso light chain other than zzso
