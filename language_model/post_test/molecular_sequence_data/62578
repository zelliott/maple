zzso of lung zzso zzso is a complex process involving multiple events and zzso Though some molecular zzso studies on human lung cancer have been undertaken successfully in gene zzso and zzso zzso levels, the zzso mechanism is still zzso At present, there is no special molecular marker for zzso diagnosis and prognosis zzso The objective of this study was to establish two-dimensional zzso profiles with high resolution and zzso from human lung zzso zzso tissue and paired normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and to identify differential expression zzso 

The total proteins of human lung zzso zzso tissue and paired normal zzso zzso zzso tissue were separated by immobilized pH zzso zzso two-dimensional gel zzso zzso The differential expression proteins were analyzed using image analysis software, then identified using mass zzso and database zzso 

zzso For tumor zzso the average protein spots of 3 gels were zzso and zzso spots were matched with the average matching rate of zzso For control, the average protein spots of 3 gels were zzso and zzso spots were matched with the average matching rate of zzso The average position zzso of matched spots was zzso zzso in zzso direction, and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso spots were matched between the zzso maps of 15 human lung zzso zzso tissue and paired normal zzso zzso zzso zzso Forty differential proteins were identified by zzso mass zzso some proteins were the products of zzso and the others involve in the regulation of cell cycle and signal zzso 

In this study, the zzso zzso zzso patterns of human lung zzso zzso and adjacent normal zzso zzso zzso were established and certain differential proteins were zzso These data will be helpful for screening the zzso to further study on human lung zzso zzso
