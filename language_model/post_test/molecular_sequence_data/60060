The zzso positions of two strains of zzso bacteria that had been isolated from the highest positive tubes zzso with serial zzso of zzso mud in zzso media with either zzso or zzso as zzso were determined by comparative sequence analysis of their zzso zzso zzso The strain isolated with zzso zzso zzso zzso several zzso including a number of zzso acids but no zzso The degradation of certain zzso was enhanced by or dependent upon zzso with a zzso zzso In earlier work this strain was assigned to the new zzso and species zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso has now been identified as a member of cluster zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso as its closest zzso The zzso strain asp zzso was a zzso rather zzso zzso which zzso a wide range of zzso in a zzso zzso and had the ability to fix molecular zzso zzso asp zzso was shown to be a new member of the zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso as its closest zzso It is described as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain asp zzso zzso zzso zzso
