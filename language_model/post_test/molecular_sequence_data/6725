The entire sequence of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso from rice was assembled from more than 50 independent zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of the coding zzso strand spans over 166 zzso followed by one long open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso that encodes a large putative zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso and by a zzso 3' zzso zzso This zzso is apparently the longest reported to date in the plant zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons revealed that the large putative zzso includes an zzso zzso domain and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparisons of the zzso acid sequences of these two zzso and of the entire genetic organization of the rice zzso with those found in zzso and the zzso zzso of chestnut blight fungus suggest that the rice zzso is located zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso This zzso zzso in rice seems to constitute a novel zzso zzso in zzso
