Most animal toxins are short proteins that appear in zzso and vary in zzso structure and zzso A common characteristic of many such toxins is their apparent structural zzso zzso instances of zzso zzso proteins that function in zzso context have been zzso We have zzso machine learning methodology, based on zzso features and guided by the notion of structural stability, in order to conduct a large-scale search for toxin and zzso zzso Application of the method to insect and zzso sequences revealed novel families of zzso zzso One of these proteins shows significant similarity to zzso channel zzso that are expressed in cone snail and assassin bug zzso and is surprisingly expressed in the bee zzso A toxicity zzso in which the protein was injected to fish induced a strong yet zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the protein may function as an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we have identified a novel zzso cluster of zzso proteins that are expressed in the zzso We suggest that these proteins might be involved in regulation of zzso zzso receptors that affect the zzso reaction and zzso zzso Finally, we highlight a possible evolutionary link between zzso toxins and zzso zzso We expect our methodology to enhance the discovery of additional novel protein zzso
