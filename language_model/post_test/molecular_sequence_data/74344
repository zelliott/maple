The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is vitamin C deficient and is defective in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The connection between the zzso gene and this zzso has only recently been established, and little is known about the molecular characteristics of the zzso zzso In this paper, the expression of the zzso gene was characterized on both the zzso and the protein zzso The zzso gene was expressed in all zzso zzso and the zzso was expressed at a higher level in green zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso expression was induced strongly by exposing zzso zzso to light, to levels higher than found in zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein was detected only in green zzso zzso a zzso fusion protein was found not only in the zzso but also in the nucleus, which suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a zzso zzso which has both zzso and regulatory zzso
