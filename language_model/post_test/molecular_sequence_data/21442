zzso zzso use zzso zzso zzso zzso to regulate several zzso traits related to the symbiotic zzso zzso In this work, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso three zzso strains with different zzso zzso produced a similar pattern of AHL zzso sharing, in all cases, production of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso and/or zzso zzso Interestingly, production of zzso was enhanced when these three zzso were grown in the presence of their respective zzso zzso while a new zzso zzso was produced by zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso In addition, expression of AHL synthesis genes zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso increased when induced with zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso
