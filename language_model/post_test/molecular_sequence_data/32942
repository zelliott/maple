zzso zzso and large zzso viruses employ powerful molecular zzso to zzso zzso into a zzso zzso zzso The zzso T4 motor is composed of a zzso portal and small and large zzso zzso assembled at the special zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The motor pumps DNA through the portal channel, utilizing zzso zzso energy provided by an zzso present in the large zzso zzso We report that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso and protein zzso possess a common zzso motif zzso zzso in the zzso T4 zzso zzso lead to loss of zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso can catalyze at least one zzso zzso event but are unable to turn over and reset the zzso This is the first report of a zzso block in zzso zzso motor after zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso is an zzso zzso zzso linking product release to mechanical zzso A novel zzso mechanism is proposed for zzso of zzso in zzso
