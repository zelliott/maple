By a zzso method, zzso genes zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were identified and cloned from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso were zzso similar to those reported from other zzso zzso of zzso genes on acid tolerance were assessed by comparing acid zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso whose zzso genes were separately zzso by zzso zzso The results demonstrated that gene products of zzso contribute to acid tolerance of zzso zzso and that their contribution is dependent on prior exposure of cells to moderately zzso zzso
