We recently identified a zzso expressed gene in zzso stage rabbit zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso family designated zzso (also known as zzso Its unusually high molecular mass, novel zzso extension, and highly selective pattern of zzso expression suggest a specific function in zzso This study analyzes its relationship to the zzso zzso zzso zzso investigates its zzso activity, and examines its zzso in zzso site zzso Construction of a zzso indicated that zzso is zzso to the zzso family of zzso and zzso are present in a broad range of zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso formation demonstrated that zzso is a functional zzso zzso The zzso for transfer of zzso zzso from E1 to zzso is 817 zzso compared to 100 zzso for other zzso zzso this suggests that the unique zzso terminal domain of zzso zzso specific functional zzso zzso zzso prepared with zzso zzso zzso showed that the protein was zzso by zzso analysis in zzso zzso from zzso and Day zzso pregnant zzso attachment zzso rabbits but was expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso site zzso of Day 8 pregnant zzso No expression was detected in adjacent zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso expression exclusively in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of the Day 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mirrored zzso zzso with zzso levels in zzso sites of Day zzso pregnant zzso but high levels in zzso zzso cells of Day 8 pregnant zzso This zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells could play major roles in orchestrating differentiation events through the modification of specific protein zzso
