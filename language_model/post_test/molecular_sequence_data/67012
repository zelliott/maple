The increasing zzso of zzso zzso strains that are resistant to zzso zzso and other zzso are resulting in a global resurgence of malaria morbidity and zzso zzso resistance zzso is associated with multiple zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso The mode and tempo of the zzso of zzso leading to these complex zzso zzso remain speculative due to the dearth of samples temporally spanning the evolution of drug zzso The origin and evolution of the zzso zzso of zzso New zzso zzso is particularly zzso It remains unclear whether the zzso zzso in zzso resulted from an independent origin of a zzso zzso identical in sequence to the South American zzso or if this zzso originated in South America and zzso into a Southeast zzso zzso We zzso a segment of zzso zzso 2 from 398 zzso clones derived from archival human zzso collected in the Pacific before and after the first reported cases of zzso treatment failure zzso and modern samples zzso None of the 251 zzso zzso clones from nine archival samples displayed the zzso or the zzso zzso that are characteristic of zzso zzso In contrast, these two zzso acid zzso were present in all 147 zzso zzso clones from five samples collected between 2001 and zzso thus, the archival samples represent the baseline zzso genetic diversity before the evolution of zzso zzso We are currently expanding our analyses to include additional samples from the series described here and from series collected in the 1970s and the 1980s to evaluate the geographic origin of zzso strains in the Pacific and the zzso of the sequential point zzso zzso model of zzso zzso
