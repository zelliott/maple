An zzso probe, derived from the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify the gene zzso this protein within a cloned DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso b) was found and zzso zzso it upstream was a gene zzso a) zzso a protein of 206 zzso acids and downstream a gene zzso c) probably zzso an 85 zzso protein was zzso This genetic zzso of the zzso zzso differs from that of other zzso zzso in zzso zzso All three proteins have signal zzso The zzso sequence was zzso for zzso with other zzso secondary structure, zzso binding sites and possible promoter zzso A region of zzso symmetry probably involved in the regulation of translation of the zzso c gene was found at the zzso end of this zzso A region of zzso symmetry was also observed within the zzso b zzso In front of the zzso zzso part of zzso sequence zzso was zzso This zzso sequence was found in a number of zzso zzso obtained from strains isolated from various geographic zzso The zzso of the zzso element in the zzso zzso therefore probably happened rather early during evolution of zzso producing zzso coli zzso
