zzso exposure to cadmium can result in zzso zzso Previously, we reported that cadmium reduced the relative abundance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate this phenomenon further, we isolated full-length zzso clones zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, from cultured mouse kidney cortical zzso We also amplified a zzso of another putative zzso zzso with zzso to the known zzso or zzso from our cultured cells and named it zzso In order to examine the effect of cadmium on these zzso primary cultures of mouse kidney cortical cells were exposed to zzso zzso of cadmium for 24 h and levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso Five to 10 zzso of cadmium inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and progressively reduced the level of zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso by zzso but no further decline was observed at zzso of cadmium greater than 5 zzso While cadmium inhibited zzso and zzso it significantly zzso the expression of zzso by zzso These results imply that individual zzso zzso zzso species are not regulated in a similar zzso In addition, the isolation of three separate zzso species from these cultures suggests that, in addition to zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells might involve additional zzso zzso such as zzso
