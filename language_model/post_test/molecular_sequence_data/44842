zzso zzso are zzso that catalyze the zzso and/or zzso of a variety of zzso Rapid zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies on zzso require quantities of zzso zzso capable of being obtained only through zzso DNA zzso This laboratory has previously developed a protein expression and zzso system in which zzso are expressed as proteins fused to a zzso zzso followed by a zzso site to allow liberation of the zzso Typically, however, only zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could be readily zzso in a single isolation sequence by zzso zzso zzso the expression system was modified by inserting the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was carried out with zzso zzso coli zzso The new zzso methodology zzso the unique pH dependence of binding to a zzso zzso column by the zzso zzso zzso Unfortunately, the affinity zzso strategy did not work zzso Although the specific activity of the zzso zzso was comparable to that of zzso obtained from zzso zzso only zzso of the activity was zzso The apparent cause of the low recovery is the unanticipated irreversible binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was investigated as an alternative zzso zzso An initial zzso zzso column resulted in partial zzso of the fusion zzso The fusion protein was zzso with zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The second zzso column resulted in not only the separation of zzso from zzso zzso but also the zzso of zzso to near zzso Application of the nearly homogeneous zzso to a zzso column resulted in recovery of homogeneous zzso The zzso method of zzso zzso is inexpensive and simple and yields more than 8 zzso of pure zzso from 1 liter of cell zzso
