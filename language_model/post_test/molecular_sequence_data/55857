The zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be alternatively spliced to generate long zzso and short zzso zzso zzso which differ in sequence at their zzso regulatory zzso By extending the 3' zzso sequence of the human gene zzso we show highly zzso zzso boundaries suggesting that zzso is also capable of generating spliced zzso zzso blots of rat zzso reveal 2 transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso expressed in brain regions and multiple peripheral zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso tumor cells zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso human zzso zzso but not in rat or human zzso zzso This transcript shows 4 fold induction by zzso in zzso cells suggesting zzso dependent control of zzso gene zzso The abundant expression of zzso zzso the occurrence of 2 zzso and evidence of extensive regulation at both gene and zzso levels, suggests that zzso is the principal zzso selective zzso
