zzso zzso of the human zzso is comprised of long zzso nuclear element 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be the cause of several genetic diseases, such as zzso A, zzso muscular dystrophy, and so zzso The zzso zzso are also able to cause colon cancer, suggesting that zzso zzso could occur not only in germ cells, but also in zzso cells if innate immunity would not function zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso restriction in the normal cells, however, are not fully zzso We here show that zzso innate zzso human zzso zzso family members, from zzso to zzso zzso reduce the level of zzso zzso that does not correlate either with zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso leukemia virus, or with patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in striking contrast to the recent zzso zzso effect of zzso family members on zzso zzso might not be due to zzso activity, but due to novel zzso Thus, we conclude that all zzso proteins act to zzso suppress uncontrolled zzso of zzso zzso
