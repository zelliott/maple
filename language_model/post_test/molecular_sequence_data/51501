The zzso gene located at human zzso 11 band zzso is rearranged in acute zzso with zzso deletions or zzso zzso between this region and zzso 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, or zzso The gene spans approximately 100 zzso of DNA and contains at least 21 zzso It encodes a protein of more than zzso zzso acids containing three regions with zzso to sequences within the zzso zzso zzso including zzso regions that can be folded into six zinc zzso zzso The zzso cluster region within zzso spans 8 zzso and encompasses several small zzso most of which begin in the same phase of the open reading zzso The zzso zzso zzso results in two zzso fusion products coding for zzso proteins derived from zzso and from a gene on zzso zzso This suggests that each zzso zzso gives rise to a specific zzso fusion zzso
