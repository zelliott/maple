The La protein is a zzso component of zzso zzso complexes that binds the 3' zzso elements of nascent zzso zzso III zzso zzso transcripts to assist folding and zzso This specific recognition is zzso by the zzso domain zzso of zzso which comprises a La motif and an zzso recognition motif zzso We have determined the solution structures of both zzso and show that the La motif adopts an zzso fold that comprises a zzso motif elaborated by the zzso of three zzso Chemical shift mapping experiments show that these insertions are involved in zzso zzso They further delineate a distinct surface patch on each zzso both basic and aromatic zzso interacts with zzso and accounts for the cooperative binding of short zzso exhibited by the La zzso
