This paper reports on a significant improvement of a new structural biology approach designed to probe the secondary structure of membrane proteins using the zzso zzso technique of electron spin echo envelope zzso zzso zzso Previously, we showed that we could characterize an zzso secondary structure with zzso zzso using a zzso Val side chain coupled with zzso zzso zzso In order to further develop this new approach, molecular dynamic zzso simulations were conducted on several different zzso zzso that are commonly found in membrane zzso zzso distance zzso from the MD results indicated that zzso zzso was a very strong candidate to significantly improve this zzso zzso In order to test this hypothesis, the secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso incorporated into a zzso was investigated with zzso zzso zzso at position 10 zzso and zzso spin labels positioned 1, 2, 3, and 4 zzso away zzso zzso to zzso with zzso zzso The zzso data reveal a unique pattern that is characteristic of an zzso zzso zzso per zzso Strong zzso zzso was detected for the zzso and zzso samples, but not for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso depth observed for zzso zzso zzso was significantly enhanced zzso when compared to previous zzso zzso that used zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso zzso on the zzso side chain are closer to the spin label when compared to zzso The enhancement of zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso peak intensity for zzso zzso significantly reduces the zzso data acquisition time for zzso when compared to zzso This research demonstrates that a different zzso zzso acid zzso can be used as an efficient zzso probe further zzso this important zzso zzso Finally, this new method can provide pertinent qualitative structural information on membrane proteins in a short time zzso minutes) at low sample zzso zzso zzso
