The crystal structure of the DNA repair zzso zzso III, which recognizes and zzso DNA at damaged zzso has been solved to zzso zzso resolution with an R factor of zzso This zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso with a deep zzso separating two similarly sized zzso a novel, zzso zzso domain zzso 22 to zzso and a zzso zzso domain formed by the zzso and three zzso zzso zzso 1 to 21 and 133 to zzso together with the zzso zzso The cluster is bound entirely within the zzso loop with a zzso pattern zzso distinct from all other known zzso zzso zzso conservation and the positive zzso potential of zzso regions identify a surface suitable for binding duplex zzso across the long axis of the zzso matching a 46 zzso length of protected zzso The primary role of the zzso cluster appears to involve positioning zzso basic zzso for interaction with the DNA zzso zzso The zzso identified inhibitor binding region, which recognizes the damaged base zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso 113 to zzso zzso and side chain orientation at the base of the inhibitor binding site zzso zzso in the zzso mechanism and zzso in the zzso zzso Overall, the structure reveals an unusual fold and a new biological function for zzso clusters and provides a structural basis for studying recognition of damaged DNA and the zzso and zzso zzso
