zzso peptides are recognized by zzso T zzso zzso as a complex with major zzso complex zzso class I zzso but the extent to which a single zzso zzso can accommodate zzso peptides of different length and sequence is not well zzso Here we report the identification of zzso zzso responses from the same donor that independently recognize one of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 to 40) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 to zzso Although zzso studies indicated that the zzso zzso stabilized the zzso complex more efficiently than the zzso zzso strong zzso responses were directed at each zzso In samples from a second zzso the same phenomenon was observed, in which distinct zzso clones recognized zzso zzso presented by the same zzso class I zzso (in this case, zzso which were entirely zzso These data are relevant to the accurate characterization of zzso responses, which is fundamental to a detailed understanding of zzso class zzso zzso In addition, these studies demonstrate marked differences in the length of peptides presented by zzso an zzso which is associated with zzso human zzso virus zzso
