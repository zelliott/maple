We constructed a molecular zzso of the African zzso zzso family zzso using two zzso markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one nuclear marker zzso 538 zzso This analysis showed that the zzso zzso consists of five major zzso which we interpret as representing five zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were each recovered as zzso but zzso as currently conceived is zzso consisting of three distinct zzso zzso The two zzso consisting of zzso major zzso zzso and zzso zzso Smith, 1849 are both described here as new zzso namely zzso Bates & zzso zzso zzso and zzso Bates & zzso zzso zzso zzso Two subspecies of zzso zzso that were historically separated on the basis of differences in zzso pattern are not zzso zzso so zzso zzso Del zzso 1895 is relegated to the zzso of zzso major zzso zzso zzso zzso which is rendered zzso zzso zzso zzso De zzso 1938 is genetically and zzso well differentiated from zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso also occur in zzso We therefore zzso the former as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rendering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Our analysis also showed that zzso zzso zzso comprises two major zzso one consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso Andersson, zzso and the other containing the remaining zzso In this latter zzso we show that zzso African zzso zzso zzso 1857 is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than to zzso zzso from East and Southern zzso The zzso African zzso of zzso zzso differs from the East and Southern African zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and can be differentiated zzso We accordingly apply the name zzso zzso zzso 1907 zzso zzso to populations from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, zzso zzso Zimbabwe and South Africa previously identified under the name zzso zzso Our analysis also confirms that zzso zzso zzso 1954 is a distinct species and sister zzso to a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The latter four zzso form a zzso zzso zzso species zzso with a widespread distribution in zzso Most closely related to this complex of species is zzso zzso zzso zzso which has an extensive range in East and Southern Africa, and displays genetic zzso which requires further zzso The status of zzso zzso zzso zzso and Angolan populations referred to zzso zzso remains zzso
