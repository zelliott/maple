A gene zzso to the zzso heavy chain zzso gene in channel zzso zzso zzso was found zzso zzso downstream of the zzso heavy chain zzso gene in Atlantic salmon zzso zzso As in zzso the first constant zzso zzso is spliced into the delta zzso In agreement with the zzso ancestry of the zzso fish family there are two highly similar delta genes in Atlantic zzso zzso of these genes showed that they zzso seven zzso zzso zzso three of which are tandem zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso arose from two zzso zzso zzso salmon delta can be reduced to a unit of three zzso zzso corresponding to the three zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The ancestral zzso unit is apparently best zzso in zzso zzso indicate a relationship between zzso and zzso zzso mainly because of the similarity between the zzso zzso and human zzso The corresponding domain in mouse zzso has been deleted during zzso The zzso zzso and zzso sequences are most similar to zzso of other zzso zzso including those in zzso zzso
