zzso zzso environment is a challenge to which very few animals have zzso The largest, zzso animal to inhabit the continent year-round is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso survive the lengthy zzso winter encased in ice, and when the ice melts in summer, the larvae complete their zzso life cycle, and the wingless adults form mating zzso while subjected to surprisingly high zzso zzso Here we report a zzso in survival strategies exploited by this insect at different stages of its life zzso zzso zzso zzso their heat shock proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso and maintain a high inherent tolerance to temperature zzso High or low temperature exposure does not further zzso these genes nor does it further enhance zzso Such zzso synthesis of zzso is sufficient to prevent irreversible protein zzso in response to a variety of common environmental zzso zzso adults exhibit no zzso zzso of their zzso and have a lower intrinsic tolerance to high temperatures, but their zzso can be zzso zzso resulting in enhanced zzso Thus, the zzso larvae, but not the adults, have adopted the unusual strategy of expressing zzso zzso possibly to facilitate proper protein folding in a cold habitat that is more zzso stable than that of the adults but a habitat subjected frequently to zzso episodes and bouts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
