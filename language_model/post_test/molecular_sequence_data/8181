The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protect their zzso DNA by expressing an inhibitor protein zzso which zzso the host zzso zzso zzso zzso repair zzso Also, zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso from other biological sources, including the zzso from zzso zzso virus zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex at zzso zzso reveals an zzso sandwich structure for zzso which interacts with zzso regions of zzso involved in DNA zzso and directly mimics zzso interactions observed in the zzso zzso The inhibitor completely blocks access to the active site of zzso but makes no direct contact with the zzso pocket zzso
