In the zzso area, the prediction of zzso factor zzso by position weight zzso zzso is a powerful approach to decipher biological pathways and to zzso regulatory networks in zzso The main difficulty once a zzso prediction is available is to estimate its reliability prior to start expensive experimental zzso and therefore trying to find a way how to identify true positive hits from an endless list of potential target genes of a regulatory zzso Here we introduce zzso zzso Regulatory zzso zzso a tool developed for predicting zzso of zzso proteins in bacterial zzso that, beside the automatic zzso scoring and positioning of potential binding sites and their respective target genes in zzso bacterial zzso it also provides an easy way to estimate the thresholds where to find reliable possible new target zzso zzso can be downloaded freely at zzso
