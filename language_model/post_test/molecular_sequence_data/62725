zzso of 777 zzso of zzso locus were determined in order to shed light on the molecular zzso and evolution of the zzso zzso Examined were nearly all of about 50 species of the zzso zzso together with seven species of the allied zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The NJ and the zzso zzso trees show that the zzso constitute a zzso group, zzso a number of cluster groups probably reflecting a relatively rapid radiation in zzso The clusters of zzso zzso zzso zzso to those zzso recognized on the basis of zzso zzso Our findings will also help understand the biological relationships among several species or subspecies on which the classical zzso is in zzso The unexpected finding is that among the samples of allied zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be the most closely related to the zzso despite zzso and behavioral zzso Furthermore, in contrast to the previous higher zzso zzso zzso which is classified in the tribe zzso was found genetically closer to the tribe zzso raising a zzso zzso
