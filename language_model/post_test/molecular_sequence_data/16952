zzso zzso promote intrinsic factor zzso complex assembly by presenting high zzso zzso binding sites for factor zzso zzso by two zzso loop structures zzso 1, zzso loop 2, zzso within the second zzso growth factor zzso zzso To identify zzso acids essential for factor X zzso complex zzso zzso factor zzso point zzso in loop 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso and loop 2 zzso zzso and zzso were zzso All seven zzso were similar to the native factor zzso by zzso active site zzso and content of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso obtained by either zzso factor X or factor zzso on zzso zzso or zzso zzso revealed near normal values of zzso and zzso for all zzso indicating normal zzso and zzso zzso In a factor zzso generation zzso in the presence of activated zzso and zzso factor zzso compared with native factor zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso approximately 12 zzso zzso zzso displayed an increase of approximately zzso in zzso and a decrease of approximately zzso in zzso zzso had an increase of approximately zzso in zzso and approximately zzso decrease in zzso and zzso had an increase of approximately zzso in zzso and approximately zzso decrease in zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and zzso within zzso 1 and 2 zzso of the zzso domain of factor zzso are essential for normal interactions with the zzso surface and for the assembly of the factor zzso complex on activated zzso
