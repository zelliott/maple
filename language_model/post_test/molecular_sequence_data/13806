Four zzso females from a family exhibiting idiopathic dominant zzso were zzso zzso blood levels of delta 5 and delta 4 steroids were within the normal range, but zzso stimulation led to increases in zzso and zzso that were significantly above control zzso Using zzso genetic zzso the genes for zzso zzso zzso by zzso and the type I and II forms of 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso were found not to segregate with zzso in this family, though a base substitution was detected in the 3' end of zzso 1 of the gene for 3 zzso type I in three of the four patients zzso Analysis of zzso patients amplification products by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and sequencing revealed a novel zzso of zzso 3 of 3 zzso DNA of one of the affected patients was used to create a zzso library in zzso gem 11 and clones containing the novel zzso were obtained and partially zzso The equivalent clone was obtained from a zzso library of an unrelated normal zzso The sequences of the clones from patient and control were identical and zzso to zzso 2-4 of human 3 zzso types I and zzso No difference was found in the zzso primer sites that flanked the zzso 3 zzso which led to its detection on zzso zzso In both zzso stop zzso and deletions were identified in the zzso 4 zzso leading to the deduction that the sequence comes from a zzso which we call 3 zzso zzso zzso The zzso mapped to zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso inherited idiopathic zzso in this rare zzso was not due to deficiencies in 3 zzso types I, II, or zzso or of zzso
