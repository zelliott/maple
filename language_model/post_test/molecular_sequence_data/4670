We have identified and characterized zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that human zzso contains two zzso death zzso zzso fused to a zzso zzso zzso The structure and zzso acid sequence of zzso resemble those of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso protein identified in this zzso Unlike zzso zzso and zzso however, two important zzso predicted to be involved in zzso were lost in the zzso domain of zzso Analysis with zzso zzso for zzso activity confirmed that zzso is zzso zzso zzso was found to interact with zzso but not with zzso an upstream death zzso zzso protein of the zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso 1 signaling zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso which was blocked by the viral zzso inhibitor zzso dominant negative zzso zzso and the synthetic zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the killing ability of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The human zzso gene maps to zzso Thus, zzso represents a regulator of the upstream zzso which may play a role in zzso during tissue development and zzso
