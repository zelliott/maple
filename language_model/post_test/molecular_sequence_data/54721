zzso play an important role in the degradation of dead plant materials and have acquired zzso and symbiotic cellulose zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene amplified from the zzso DNA of zzso zzso gut was cloned in the zzso cloning zzso and zzso into a zzso expression zzso The zzso gene has zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso and shows zzso acid sequence identity with predicted zzso zzso and zzso The sequence analysis reveals that probably zzso could be a new gene and that its molecular mass was zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli zzso was zzso U with zzso zzso zzso and its specific activity was zzso zzso zzso The optimum pH and temperature for zzso activity were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso preferences and sequence similarity of the zzso place it in the zzso zzso of zzso
