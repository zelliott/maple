In response to zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules from large zzso zzso zzso to initiate zzso Little is known about the molecular machinery responsible for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and the linkage of that machinery to cell zzso We found that zzso zzso contain a full complement of interacting zzso zzso and zzso zzso are necessary for zzso zzso and fusion with the plasma zzso zzso also contain an zzso zzso of the zzso family that appears to regulate zzso zzso through its binding with a zzso zzso This zzso zzso protein zzso bound to zzso 4 and thereby excluded the binding of zzso with zzso 4, an interaction critical to zzso zzso As predicted by its zzso zzso was detected predominantly in the zzso zzso and was zzso in zzso by protein zzso C zzso a zzso zzso incorporating zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso per mole of zzso zzso was also specifically zzso in zzso zzso after cellular stimulation by zzso zzso or zzso and this zzso was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso by zzso in zzso inhibited zzso from binding to zzso zzso Taken together, these studies indicate that zzso like zzso and other cells capable of regulated zzso contain a unique complement of interacting zzso zzso proteins and zzso a putative regulator of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in activated zzso and its zzso effects on zzso 4 binding provide a novel functional link that may be important in zzso the processes of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso
