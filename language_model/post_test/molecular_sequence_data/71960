zzso virus C zzso also known as zzso G virus, is a recently discovered zzso zzso agent with unclear zzso zzso To investigate whether human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso are susceptible to in zzso zzso infection, we have incubated zzso from four healthy blood donors with a human zzso zzso zzso By means of zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity zzso zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis, it has been demonstrated that zzso is able to zzso in zzso cells and replicate for as long as 30 days under the conditions developed in our cell culture zzso The concentration of zzso zzso increased during the second and third weeks of zzso The zzso of the zzso strand were 10 times higher than the zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, the same zzso zzso sequence was found in all zzso cultures and in the in zzso zzso isolated from the donor of the zzso zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso signals were confined to the zzso of cells at different times during the culture zzso Finally, evidence obtained by zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso and Western zzso analysis of the culture zzso suggests that viral particles are released from in zzso zzso In conclusion, our study has demonstrated, for the first time, zzso replication in human zzso cells under experimental in zzso infection zzso
