zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso agent of anthrax, an zzso studied because of its importance as a potential zzso Although in zzso zzso responses of zzso to either spore or anthrax toxins have been previously reported, little is known regarding the impact of infection on gene expression in host zzso We infected zzso mice zzso with 5 zzso of zzso zzso Ames spores and observed the global zzso profiles of various zzso over a 48 h time zzso zzso was extracted from zzso zzso and heart zzso of infected and control mice and examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso 580 host genes were significantly over or under expressed among the zzso zzso and heart zzso at 8 and 48 h time zzso zzso of genes zzso for zzso and major zzso complex zzso presentation was diminished during the early phase of infection in zzso By 48 zzso a significant number of genes were modulated in the heart, including zzso of zzso gene zzso and zzso of multiple genes related to cell zzso formation of the zzso zzso and the cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso showed striking increases in the expression of genes that zzso zzso zzso and these levels remained elevated throughout zzso Further, genes involving zzso presentation and zzso responses were zzso in the zzso at 8 zzso In late stages of infection, zzso genes related to the inflammatory response were zzso This study is the first to describe the in zzso global zzso response of multiple zzso during zzso zzso Although numerous genes related to the host zzso response and certain protection mechanisms were zzso in these zzso a vast list of genes important for fully developing and maintaining this response were zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso and heart showed differential responses to the infection, further zzso the demand for a better understanding of anthrax zzso in order to design therapies against novel zzso
