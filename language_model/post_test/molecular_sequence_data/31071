We have discovered a zzso particle of zzso zzso diameter, zzso and apparent molecular weight of approximately zzso that displays zzso zzso symmetry and is composed of a single kind of an zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso of Mr zzso zzso Using zzso to this protein we have detected its occurrence in a wide range of cells and zzso of diverse species from zzso to man, including highly specialized cells such as zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso the particle is found in both isolated zzso and in manually zzso zzso which zzso to zzso zzso dispersed over both zzso and zzso The particle has a zzso zzso zzso activity, and its zzso acid zzso as deduced from zzso zzso displays considerable zzso to the zzso zzso fusion protein zzso and zzso zzso believed to be essential for zzso fusion in zzso zzso indicating that these three proteins belong to the same zzso zzso
