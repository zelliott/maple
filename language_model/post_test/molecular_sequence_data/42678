A zzso protein Tax of zzso activates the zzso of various cellular genes as well as viral promoter through the multiple zzso elements and leads cells to the zzso Tax protein interacts to zzso DNA elements by zzso with cellular zzso binding proteins such as zzso zzso B and zzso In addition, we found recently that Tax interacts with an I zzso B zzso the inhibitor of zzso B, resulting in the enhancement of nuclear zzso of zzso B zzso zzso Tax seems to zzso the zzso by the interaction with multiple zzso factors in different modes of zzso
