zzso are important elements in innate immunity that can also trigger zzso immune zzso The zzso form a family of small zzso zzso peptides with six characteristic zzso zzso whose pairing pattern in forming three zzso zzso bonds defines the zzso and zzso zzso In a search for new zzso zzso we performed zzso analysis using the zzso mouse zzso data base and found zzso zzso 23 different zzso including the eight previously characterized members of this zzso Among the new zzso nine of them form two groups of zzso related sequences that were characterized in greater zzso Northern zzso reverse zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analysis showed that expression of these genes is restricted to the zzso with a specific regional expression zzso One of the new zzso zzso was chemically zzso in in zzso zzso on zzso and zzso bacterial zzso zzso showed the characteristic zzso zzso activity of zzso The results demonstrate the existence of a relatively large number of zzso with specific expression in distinct regions of the zzso zzso and suggest complex roles for these proteins in host defense and other zzso processes of the male zzso zzso
