zzso disease, an zzso zzso error of zzso zzso results from zzso in the zzso A zzso zzso gene at zzso To determine the nature and frequency of the molecular zzso causing the classical and zzso zzso zzso and for precise carrier detection in zzso families, the zzso A transcripts or zzso sequences from unrelated zzso zzso were zzso In patients with the classical zzso 18 new zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta 2, zzso delta 5, zzso delta 11, and zzso delta zzso zzso zzso or mildly affected patients with symptoms confined to the heart had a zzso zzso zzso that expressed residual zzso zzso Related, moderately affected patients with zzso cardiac and pulmonary manifestations had a small zzso zzso delta 3, that predicted the zzso deletion of zzso zzso near the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, five small gene zzso involving zzso sequences were identified in unrelated classically affected zzso Two small deletions and one small zzso had short direct repeats at their respective zzso junctions and presumably resulted from slipped zzso A deletion occurred at a potential zzso alpha arrest site, while the zzso of another deletion occurred at an zzso zzso zzso zzso of unrelated zzso patients with zzso zzso for seven zzso revealed that these were private, with the notable exception of zzso zzso and zzso which were each found in several unrelated families from different ethnic zzso The zzso zzso at zzso 227 was the most common site of zzso having been altered in zzso of the 148 unrelated zzso zzso These studies revealed that most zzso A zzso were private, that zzso 227 was a zzso hot spot, and that certain zzso predicted a milder disease zzso
