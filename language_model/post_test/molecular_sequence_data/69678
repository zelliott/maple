The objective of this study was to determine whether the three zzso of zzso zzso II receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso and individually expressed in zzso cells, could be zzso distinguished by their zzso binding zzso Competition studies were performed to characterize the zzso of zzso II binding to each of the cell membrane preparations by an extensive series of zzso and zzso zzso II zzso zzso plot analyses revealed the following binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Site zzso zzso zzso 126 zzso 23 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso The binding of zzso II in the three preparations was similarly sensitive to zzso by zzso gamma zzso The zzso binding signatures of the three zzso zzso are essentially the same and are illustrated by the affinity and order of potency of the following zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso II zzso or zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso In conclusion, the two rat zzso zzso zzso are zzso indistinguishable from each other and from that of the zzso
