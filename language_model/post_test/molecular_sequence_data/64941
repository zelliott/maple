zzso a zzso domain zzso factor involved in zzso zzso is a candidate zzso gene localized in zzso a region commonly deleted in a wide variety of human tumors, including those of the stomach, zzso zzso and zzso Recently, frequent zzso of zzso has been demonstrated in human gastric zzso In this study, to examine the involvement of zzso abnormalities in zzso of zzso duct as well as pancreatic zzso we investigated not only the expression but also zzso status of zzso in 10 human zzso duct and 12 pancreatic cancer cell zzso Seven zzso of the zzso duct and nine zzso of the pancreatic cancer cell lines exhibited no expression of zzso by both Northern zzso analysis and the reverse zzso zzso chain zzso All of the 16 cell lines that did not express zzso also showed zzso of the promoter zzso island of the zzso whereas the six cell lines that showed zzso expression were not zzso or only partially zzso in the zzso promoter zzso Moreover, treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso activated zzso zzso expression in all of 16 cancer cell lines that originally lacked zzso zzso Finally, zzso deletion of zzso as detected by zzso in zzso zzso was found in 15 of the 16 cancer cell lines that lacked zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso of zzso plays an important role in zzso duct and pancreatic zzso and that zzso is a common mechanism by which the gene is zzso
