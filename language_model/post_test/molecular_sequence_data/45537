The zzso gene zzso the beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso characterized by zzso amplification and DNA sequencing in 26 zzso reference strains by using zzso selected according to the zzso zzso 16 M zzso published zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence of all zzso strains zzso revealed specific zzso variations associated with different zzso species and zzso 17 zzso zzso were recognized and new zzso typing is zzso Our results suggest that the zzso gene zzso can be used to identify all zzso species and most of the zzso offering an improvement over conventional typing zzso
