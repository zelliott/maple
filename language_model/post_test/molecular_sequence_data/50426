Human zzso virus type 1 zzso strains display a high degree of zzso in their biological properties that correlate with in zzso zzso of the zzso We previously demonstrated that overlapping regions encompassing the third zzso domain zzso within the envelope zzso zzso determine the zzso of zzso for zzso lines and primary zzso Studies with zzso viruses carrying one or more zzso acid zzso in the zzso loop have now identified this zzso domain as a major zzso for these cellular host range zzso Three to five zzso acid changes in this domain, but rarely a single zzso acid zzso can zzso zzso zzso and alter zzso zzso These findings emphasize the effect on cell zzso of small zzso acid differences in the viral envelope and suggest that the overall zzso of the zzso loop plays the major role in determining the ability of zzso to zzso zzso lines and primary zzso
