By modulating the magnitude and duration of zzso responses, zzso zzso zzso transport into and release from the zzso zzso is central to the fine tuning of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the prime target for widely used zzso zzso drugs of abuse and zzso We have isolated the gene zzso the zzso zzso and determined the sequence of all zzso including adjacent zzso regions and approximately zzso zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso The zzso zzso gene is composed of 14 zzso spanning approximately 34 zzso The single gene transcript after zzso is zzso zzso in length and it contains 186 zzso of zzso untranslated region zzso and zzso zzso of zzso A zzso motif and several potential binding sites for zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso motifs are present in the zzso zzso zzso The characterization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso organization will facilitate studies of zzso zzso function with molecular zzso and transgenic strategies as well as investigations of its role in quantitative traits and psychiatric zzso
