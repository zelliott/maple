An zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from a hot spring in Japan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 74, zzso was characterized in zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis had revealed that strain zzso was the first cultivated representative of the candidate zzso zzso The cells were zzso filaments with a single polar zzso The strain contained zzso : zzso as the major fatty acid and zzso zzso and zzso as the respiratory zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso growth was obtained at 65 degrees C, pH zzso and in the absence of zzso with a doubling time of zzso zzso On the basis of the results of zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence and the characterization of the strain in this study, we propose the name zzso exile zzso zzso zzso zzso for strain zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we propose the new zzso name zzso zzso zzso for the candidate zzso zzso represented by zzso exile zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
