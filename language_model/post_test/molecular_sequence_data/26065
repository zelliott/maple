We report the zzso analysis of a series of zzso zzso related to the hormone zzso utilizing zzso zzso zzso and zzso restrained molecular zzso The zzso preferences and results from biological analysis of these zzso zzso zzso allow for refinement of the current understanding of the zzso relationship of zzso For most of the molecules zzso a beta zzso turn about the zzso zzso zzso to be required for biological activity, was zzso From the zzso restrained molecular zzso it can be seen that the turn structure is important for the maintenance of the proper orientation of the side chains of the adjacent zzso zzso and zzso The biologically active zzso have the side chains of zzso and zzso extended away from the zzso ring in close proximity to each other for a significant portion of the dynamic zzso Although other zzso are accessible and monitored during the simulations, we believe this is important for biological zzso The absence of the beta zzso turn at the zzso zzso this side chain array producing inactive zzso The role of the bridging region, the zzso zzso is to stabilize the beta zzso turn and help maintain the proper orientation of the biologically important side zzso
