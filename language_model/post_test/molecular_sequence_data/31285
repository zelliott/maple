The expression of acid zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso hybrid genes is regulated by zzso zzso and mating type locus respectively, as well as the zzso and zzso alpha 1 gene products zzso When zzso and zzso zzso hybrid genes were cloned in the zzso site of the zzso sequence of the zzso shuttle zzso zzso or zzso in one orientation they were regulated normally but in the other orientation their expression was not regulated but expressed zzso The zzso sequences present upstream of the inserted genes are responsible for the zzso zzso By replacing the zzso upstream zzso sequences zzso element with zzso fragments, we have identified three zzso zzso from zzso 376 to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso which were able to promote expression of zzso A comparison of these three zzso fragments revealed zzso zzso 3' and zzso zzso 3' to be the common sequences likely to act as zzso in zzso zzso By using synthetic zzso it was found that both sequences are required for maximum expression of zzso zzso
