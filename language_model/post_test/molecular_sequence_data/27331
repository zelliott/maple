zzso zzso is a geographically zzso zzso zzso pathogen of humans and zzso Previous investigations using zzso small unit zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso DNA sequences positioned zzso zzso as a close relative of zzso zzso However, given the few individuals of zzso zzso studied and the high degree of genetic variation observed in zzso zzso the existence of zzso zzso as an independent species has been zzso To investigate the zzso position of this species, we conducted a zzso analysis using 20 zzso zzso collections zzso zzso was obtained from proven cases of zzso and 14 collections were maintained in mice, the others were analyzed from DNA taken directly from infected human zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence was compared to that from 17 zzso zzso strains that represented the known variation in this species, and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our analyses used DNA sequence from ITS zzso and partial coding sequences of zzso zzso 4, zzso factor, and zzso zzso variation among strains of zzso zzso was minor but numerous zzso zzso and multiple gaps were found for these gene regions among members in the zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso maximum zzso and zzso analyses showed no significant conflict and depicted zzso zzso as a zzso zzso group that was sister to the zzso zzso These results argue for maintaining zzso zzso as a zzso independent from zzso within the zzso
