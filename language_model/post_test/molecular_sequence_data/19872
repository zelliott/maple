zzso coli zzso is an zzso of the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso of specific membrane zzso We previously showed that it can cleave a type I model membrane zzso zzso having the second zzso region of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso at the predicted zzso boundary region of zzso Here we investigated the environment of the active site regions of zzso in the zzso state by examining the zzso of zzso zzso introduced into the regions around the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso active site is fully open to the external zzso zzso zzso also zzso a similar fusion zzso zzso having the zzso region of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso site regions of the zzso and zzso sequences were efficiently modified with a zzso zzso zzso showing that these regions are exposed to the zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso an zzso region of zzso unlike the currently prevailing view that this class of membrane zzso acts against a zzso zzso segment after its lateral entrance into the zzso active zzso
