zzso zzso proteins are zzso of ammonium transport zzso zzso zzso and structural evidence shows that zzso proteins are gas channels for zzso but the zzso of zzso zzso be it CO2 as shown in green zzso or zzso as shown in zzso cells, remains zzso We assembled a large zzso generated of zzso and zzso to explore how zzso originated from and evolved independently of zzso zzso Analysis of this rich data implies that zzso was split from zzso first to emerge in zzso zzso The zzso zzso underwent divergence and zzso along zzso leading to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The characteristic zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso reflects their early separation and subsequent independent zzso they coexist in microbes and zzso but do not in zzso vascular plants or zzso zzso zzso was prominent in zzso while zzso zzso displayed strong zzso selection, zzso zzso and zzso experienced different episodes of positive selection in each of which zzso evolution occurred at certain time points and in a few zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were subject to particularly strong positive selection in some zzso sites in the lineage from zzso to zzso The grounds of this zzso evolution may be driven by the necessity to increase the zzso ratio of zzso zzso for zzso gas zzso Altogether, these results are consistent with zzso proteins not being the zzso of zzso proteins but having gained the function for zzso zzso with important roles in systemic pH zzso
