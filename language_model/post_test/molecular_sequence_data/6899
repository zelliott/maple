It has been accepted that retinal zzso is localized in the outer zzso layer zzso of the zzso but no electron microscopic evidence has been reported until zzso Using zzso zzso the authors investigate whether retinal zzso zzso at the zzso or zzso membrane of synaptic zzso 

zzso zzso raised against human zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis was used for testing zzso protein in retinal zzso zzso preparations were stained with the zzso or zzso method and were observed with light and electron zzso 

zzso analysis showed a molecular weight of band zzso zzso in the sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of the retinal zzso zzso zzso disclosed that retinal zzso was localized at the zzso membrane of synaptic regions in the zzso 

zzso retinal zzso zzso at the zzso membrane in the zzso suggesting that it may play some role in the neurotransmitter release of the zzso zzso
