zzso stone crystal attachment to the urinary zzso plays an essential role in the development of kidney stones by allowing small zzso to be retained in the kidney until they become zzso We among others have described attachment of stone zzso to cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Blumenthal, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Mandel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To isolate zzso that may participate in crystal attachment, zzso zzso of cultured zzso inner zzso collecting duct were zzso the cells were zzso with zzso the zzso was subjected to zzso zzso and zzso were incubated with calcium zzso zzso zzso of material zzso from the zzso showed several selectively zzso protein zzso A zzso band stained positively for zzso and for zzso and bound zzso The zzso acid sequence of this band was determined to be that of a protein closely related to rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and was zzso zzso with the previously zzso zzso protein zzso Using zzso phase zzso with zzso zzso zzso was associated with both the zzso membrane skeleton zzso and the soluble zzso phase but not the soluble zzso zzso This association with the membrane skeleton was increased in the presence of zzso Thus, zzso is associated with the zzso zzso of cultured zzso zzso cells and is bound to membrane skeletal elements in a zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso remains to be zzso however, a zzso role may be that of zzso the attachment to the zzso zzso zzso of calcium stone zzso
