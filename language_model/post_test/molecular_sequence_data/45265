Tokyo Bay, a zzso bay in Japan, receives nutrients from wastewater plants and other urban diffuse sources via river zzso A zzso was conducted along a line from the zzso River into Tokyo Bay to investigate the ecological relationship between the river zzso and the distribution, abundance and population structure of zzso bacteria zzso Five zzso marine sediments were collected and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and genetic diversity of zzso populations were examined using restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A shift of the microbial community was detected in samples along the zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso genes generated zzso in the restriction profiles that were distinguishable at each sampling zzso Two zzso zzso gene libraries were constructed using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method to determine the major zzso zzso maintaining high cellular zzso zzso Two major groups were observed in the zzso zzso no zzso were zzso The effort to isolate novel zzso was zzso the isolate dominated in the gene zzso For quantitative analysis, a real-time zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso gene was zzso The population sizes of zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in dry zzso which corresponded to zzso of the total bacterial zzso An zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso was also tested to obtain complementary zzso The population sizes of zzso zzso ranged between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso of dry zzso which corresponded to zzso of the total bacterial zzso zzso bacteria cell numbers deduced by the two methods were correlated (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso In both methods, the number of zzso increased with the distance from the river zzso zzso bacteria were most numerous at zzso where the ammonium concentration in the zzso was markedly lower and the zzso concentration was slightly higher than nearby zzso These results reveal spatial distribution and shifts in the population structure of zzso corresponding to nutrients and organic zzso from the river zzso and zzso zzso
