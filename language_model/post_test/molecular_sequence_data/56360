In zzso tumors, zzso DNA is commonly found next to or within a cellular zzso such that zzso of the gene is influenced by the viral promoter or zzso zzso surveys of naturally occurring tumors reveal that zzso integrated on the 3' side of the gene are usually in the same zzso orientation, suggesting a model in which the zzso viral zzso acts primarily on the closest zzso Here we describe a zzso induced zzso tumor that appears to contradict these ideas since the zzso and zzso zzso have both been activated by mouse zzso tumor virus zzso DNA integrated 3' of the gene in the opposite zzso zzso However, by cloning the relevant zzso we show that these are not simple zzso zzso In the zzso zzso there is an additional zzso immediately adjacent to the 3' end of the zzso zzso while in zzso the zzso has sustained a deletion that removes the zzso zzso zzso and most of zzso These structural zzso can be zzso with the zzso zzso model by zzso that the viral zzso can only function if it is not zzso
