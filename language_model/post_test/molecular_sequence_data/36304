The zzso structures of blood group zzso are not the primary gene zzso they are constructed in a zzso manner by adding particular sugar to precursor zzso via several zzso coded for by different blood group genes zzso 1966, 1978, zzso zzso final profiles of zzso expressed in each cell type are influenced by many different factors such as the intrinsic composition of zzso species which are defined by the zzso of the individuals, relative activity or amount of these zzso zzso zzso or induction of the zzso competition between zzso with overlapping zzso zzso the organization of the zzso in zzso zzso of precursors and specific zzso zzso and the activity level of zzso zzso Changes in the zzso profiles during zzso differentiation and zzso transformation are thought to be intimately related to the zzso of these zzso Although great importance zzso to zzso and zzso information on the distribution and levels of zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to the relevant zzso detailed and precise zzso of the blood group zzso and their zzso is the base line for analyzing these complex zzso On the basis of individual zzso and zzso findings about the zzso distribution and the zzso between cells and cellular components producing different zzso structures zzso and zzso zzso we can deduce precursor zzso levels as well as the status of gene zzso and its primary product, zzso Thus, these findings are a prerequisite for further analysis at the molecular genetic zzso As emphasized in this article, zzso zzso or zzso methods with zzso combined with zzso zzso procedures are powerful tools for in zzso analysis of zzso structures in zzso zzso Although in some cases valuable results have been obtained by applying the technique, our knowledge concerning the distribution of complex zzso structures is still far from zzso Along with well defined zzso and zzso the key to developing our methods further is successful introduction of zzso in particular, zzso since these zzso are indispensable for analyzing the inner core structures and zzso species of the blood group zzso Application of these techniques at the zzso level is an alluring possibility, even though many difficulties must be zzso Although their functional roles have not yet been determined, a diverse array of zzso is known to be decorated with blood zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
