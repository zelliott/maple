In order to analyze T cell zzso of human zzso zzso zzso 60 peptides based on the sequence of zzso were zzso and used as zzso in a peripheral blood zzso cell zzso zzso zzso were obtained from 19 patients with zzso disease, 19 patients with zzso zzso and 24 normal zzso zzso proliferation of zzso to these peptides occurred only among the zzso zzso disease zzso patients, whereas normal subjects did not respond to any of the peptides with a stimulation index over zzso Many peptides induced isolated positive responses and eight produced stimulation of zzso from multiple patients on comparison to control zzso zzso To confirm the significance of zzso to the peptides zzso from four patients were studied on two occasions, and the zzso responses found to be zzso Four zzso designated according to the zzso acid sequence as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients' zzso in a zzso zzso The optimal concentration was 10 zzso An zzso zzso zzso directed against a zzso zzso of the DR zzso was able to block the zzso A significant correlation was found between the zzso responses to these peptides and responses to zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that four peptides corresponding to the zzso acid sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso are T cell zzso of zzso
