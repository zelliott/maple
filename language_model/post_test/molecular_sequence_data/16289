The gene locus for bovine zzso as well as several zzso of sequence zzso the gene on either end, has been zzso Two of the several clones seem to contain full-length copies of the protein zzso portion of the zzso Using these clones and zzso zzso we have determined that there are one or perhaps two copies of the zzso gene per zzso zzso in several zzso The gene is compact considering the large size of the protein zzso zzso and its large zzso (about zzso zzso Surprisingly, the gene is no more than 14 zzso being fully contained on zzso clones of maximum packaging size 20 zzso Small parts of the gene were zzso for the purpose of proving the identity of the zzso zzso DNA sequencing of one of the zzso gene clones demonstrates the existence of an zzso in the zzso The sequence analysis of another zzso identified the zzso which has been zzso at the protein zzso The DNA sequence analysis showed the existence of a putative signal sequence and the potential existence of a short five zzso acid sequence between the signal sequence and the authentic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This confirms and zzso the finding of the extra five zzso acid sequence that is present on zzso of the zzso in monkey and human zzso which have been isolated from the zzso zzso The presence of the appropriate gene sequence for the zzso but its absence in bovine zzso indicates differences in processing among the zzso zzso
