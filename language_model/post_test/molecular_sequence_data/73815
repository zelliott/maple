The gene for a zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from zzso zzso and termed the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains 214 zzso with a potential zzso signaling sequence on the zzso zzso This gives the mature protein a calculated molecular mass of 21 799 zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein contains the zzso motif of zzso which is found in the zzso site of other bacterial zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli and was found to be able to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso strain by restoring zzso and alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were impossible to characterize because of the extreme deleterious effect of the zzso zzso the in zzso role of zzso zzso zzso is unknown, but it may function to form zzso bonds and/or be involved in zzso zzso
