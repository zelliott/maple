The comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequences of plant and animal zzso zzso has allowed the identification of four well zzso regions, and previous experimental evidence suggested that regions I and IV might be involved in the binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, region IV is zzso to the zzso zzso binding loop zzso motif known to be involved in zzso zzso binding in several protein zzso In this study, the function of zzso acid zzso within these two regions was investigated by zzso zzso of the plant zzso zzso In region I, our results identify zzso as critical for zzso since replacement of this zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in specific activity, while a zzso reduction was observed after the conservative replacement with zzso zzso labeling of zzso and zzso with zzso revealed that zzso is not required for zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso had a reduced affinity for zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may participate in the stabilization of an intermediate during the zzso In region IV, all zzso of zzso resulted in a marked decrease in specific zzso Conservative and zzso replacements of zzso resulted in weak zzso labeling with zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso displayed reduced affinities for zzso suggesting that the zzso side chain is required to bind the zzso The analysis of the kinetic zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso allowed to confirm that region IV is involved in zzso zzso
