A zzso clone specific for zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso This sequence corresponded to a zzso of an estimated 544 zzso in length excluding the zzso A zzso The zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence showed 51% protein sequence identity with zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso and avian zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso using this zzso as probe, revealed that zzso zzso zzso expression is tissue specific with the zzso being expressed in abundance in the zzso of larvae, at a lower level in zzso but is not zzso in zzso zzso During normal development this zzso was zzso in eggs but was present at similar levels from first to fifth zzso zzso The zzso was expressed at very low levels in zzso and adult zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso by treatment with the zzso zzso and to be zzso in some individuals of a zzso resistant population of zzso zzso The induction and zzso patterns were identical to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The present data suggests that zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso zzso
