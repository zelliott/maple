zzso zzso play a critical role in the regulation of the zzso cell cycle and signal zzso A putative protein zzso zzso gene has been isolated from the human malaria zzso zzso zzso The gene has an unusual zzso that contains four repeats of 32 zzso and displays a high degree of size zzso among different strains of zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso by removal of the zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso The zzso zzso termed protein zzso beta zzso is composed of two distinct zzso The zzso domain comprises 315 zzso acids and exhibits a striking similarity to the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso Database searches revealed that the zzso domain has the highest similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso However, it contains a zzso insert consisting of five zzso zzso The zzso domain comprises 151 zzso acid zzso and exhibits several striking features, including high levels of charged zzso acids and zzso and multiple consensus zzso sites for a number of protein zzso An overall structural comparison of zzso with other members of the protein zzso 2A group revealed that zzso is more closely related to zzso zzso zzso Southern blots of zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso is a zzso gene and is located on zzso zzso A zzso transcript of this gene is expressed specifically in the sexual zzso stage zzso The results indicate that zzso may be involved in sexual stage zzso
