The human tissue zzso zzso family of zzso zzso which is important in zzso processing events, currently consists of just three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso We identified an expressed sequence tag from an zzso zzso zzso library with 50% identity to the three known zzso zzso zzso designed to putative zzso 2 and zzso 3 regions from this novel zzso sequence were used to zzso chain zzso five zzso spanning 130 zzso around the zzso locus on zzso zzso This new zzso which we have named zzso is 25 zzso downstream of the zzso gene and follows a region that includes two other putative zzso gene zzso zzso spans zzso zzso has an identical zzso zzso zzso and four zzso the other zzso genes and is transcribed on the reverse zzso in the same direction as zzso but opposite to that of zzso and zzso It encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso that is most similar zzso zzso to pig zzso zzso zzso zzso but is also 37% identical to zzso These data suggest that the human zzso gene family locus on zzso 19 is larger than previously thought and also indicate a greater sequence divergence within this family compared with the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso
