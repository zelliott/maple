We investigated the effects of zzso zzso on cell cycle progression and protein synthesis in zzso primary T zzso zzso of resting human T zzso with zzso zzso and calcium zzso rendered cells capable of initiating DNA synthesis within 30 zzso roughly zzso of the cells entered the first zzso phase of the cell cycle within 96 zzso zzso of zzso delayed the entry into S phase by 9 zzso although a similar percentage zzso zzso of cells entered the first zzso phase and zzso On this basis, we concluded that zzso primarily induced a zzso zzso without blocking cell cycle zzso zzso of the zzso to resting T zzso zzso the translation of zzso protein zzso concurrent with zzso of zzso zzso inhibited this zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso as well as the zzso of zzso without affecting translation of zzso protein zzso zzso also prevented the synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso Further, this failure to increase zzso zzso which probably reflects the failure to increase numbers of zzso resulted in suppression of the synthesis of total cellular protein and a delay in the escalation of cell zzso zzso cells eventually initiated DNA synthesis when cell size became equivalent to that of the control cells entering S phase of the cell zzso Thus, zzso of protein synthesis caused by the primary zzso of zzso protein zzso translation probably explains the effect of zzso on cell cycle progression of zzso resting T zzso
