The zzso that mediates binding of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso to human DNA zzso delta has not been clearly zzso We show that the third zzso of human DNA zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso through a zzso zzso sequence located in its C zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso loop of zzso a region previously shown to be important for DNA zzso delta activity and for binding of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso In accordance with this, a zzso containing the zzso domain of zzso inhibited zzso binding to zzso and the activity of native zzso DNA zzso zzso Furthermore, pull-down zzso showed that DNA zzso delta requires zzso for interaction with zzso More importantly, only zzso zzso DNA zzso delta displayed zzso DNA replication that could be inhibited by the zzso domain of zzso zzso participation of zzso in zzso DNA replication in zzso is demonstrated by zzso of zzso with zzso and DNA zzso delta within DNA replication zzso Finally, in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso suggests that zzso activity may be subject to cell zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is the chief zzso of zzso DNA synthesis by DNA zzso zzso
