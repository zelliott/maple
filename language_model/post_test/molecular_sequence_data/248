A zzso zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the inland zzso lake zzso de zzso a zzso zzso reserve located in the province of zzso in southern zzso zzso zzso was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso It produced colonies with a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso of zzso % zzso and at temperatures of zzso degrees zzso The pH range for growth was zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso various organic acids as sole carbon and energy zzso Its major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso appeared to be a member of the zzso zzso and clustered closely with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso between the new isolate and the type strains of its closest related zzso species was zzso levels of zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
