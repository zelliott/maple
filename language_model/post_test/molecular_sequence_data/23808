The usefulness of various suggested species zzso criteria was compared in attempts to determine the zzso status of ten new zzso zzso Five of them zzso 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) were obtained from different sources of commercially grown zzso zzso zzso two zzso 1 and 2) from different sources of commercially grown zzso zzso and three from water samples, zzso from a small river zzso in Northern Germany, from a brook (near zzso in Southern Germany and from the groundwater in a zzso production zzso in the Netherlands zzso zzso The zzso zzso decoration test allowed a quick preliminary assignment of various zzso to several known zzso A more precise analysis of the relationships was achieved by comparing the deduced zzso acid sequences of the coat zzso zzso as well as zzso data suggested that eight of the zzso should be classified as strains or zzso of either zzso Italian zzso virus, zzso Algerian zzso virus, zzso asteroid mosaic virus or zzso zzso virus, respectively, whereas the 9th isolate zzso 2) appears to represent a distinct new zzso zzso The case of the 10th isolate zzso 5) illustrates the zzso problems experienced when the properties of a virus place it close to the more or less arbitrary man-made borderline between virus species and virus zzso The coat protein gene sequences were also determined for some viruses for which these data had not yet been available, zzso Neckar river virus, zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequences of the coat protein gene and also of zzso 1 of the latter virus proved to be almost identical to the corresponding zzso regions of the recently described zzso zzso virus, which for priority reasons should be zzso zzso which have been suggested in addition to zzso and sequence comparisons for zzso species zzso zzso differences in natural and in experimental host zzso in zzso features and in coat protein size, appear to be of little value for the zzso of new zzso
