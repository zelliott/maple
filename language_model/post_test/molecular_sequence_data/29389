In the present study we have characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso and which differs from previously described zzso zzso zzso Based on sequence zzso to zzso zzso we cloned the human zzso zzso of human embryonic kidney zzso and Chinese zzso zzso cells with zzso or human zzso resulted in marked increases in zzso activity in membrane zzso that were used to examine its zzso zzso Unlike other known type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso but similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly specific toward long chain zzso base zzso and degrade zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited apparent zzso zzso with zzso as zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso and optimum activity at pH zzso Similar to other zzso zzso activity was also independent of any zzso requirements, including zzso and was not inhibited by zzso but was markedly inhibited by zzso and zzso However, zzso has some significantly different zzso properties than the zzso the zzso zzso zzso which is an effective inhibitor of type 1 zzso zzso activities and is only modestly effective as an inhibitor of zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso the activity was partially sensitive to zzso but not to the zzso compound zzso and importantly, low zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso were strongly zzso Thus, in agreement with zzso analysis which shows that outside of the consensus motif there is very little zzso between zzso and the other type 2 zzso zzso zzso are significantly different and divergent from the zzso zzso
