We have cloned the zzso gene coding for the major zzso factor of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence reveals a protein of zzso zzso which has extensive zzso acid zzso with the principal zzso factors of a number of divergent zzso It is larger than most zzso factors identified to date, having a molecular mass of zzso zzso We have designated this factor zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to complement the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso better specificity to the zzso coli zzso zzso allowing increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter, but could not activate the zzso and zzso promoters in the zzso coli zzso strains carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the implications of these results on the mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
