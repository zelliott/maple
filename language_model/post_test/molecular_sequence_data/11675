zzso receptors mediate a wide range of zzso functions extending from stimulation of gastric acid zzso to induction of human zzso zzso We have previously cloned the zzso zzso gene and noted that only three zzso acids on the zzso were sufficient to define its specificity and zzso Despite only modest overall zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid identity and zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso for another zzso the beta zzso zzso there is remarkable similarity at their critical zzso binding zzso We hypothesized that, if the specificity and selectivity of both receptors are invested in just three zzso zzso it should be possible to convert one of the receptors into one that recognizes the zzso of the other by simple zzso at only one or two zzso 

We explored the effect of two single zzso in the fifth zzso domain of the zzso zzso which encompasses the sites that determine zzso zzso The canine zzso zzso gene was zzso at zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso by zzso directed zzso The coding region of both the zzso and zzso zzso receptors was zzso into the zzso expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso cells and L zzso The biological activity of zzso and zzso on the expressed zzso was examined by measurement of cellular zzso production and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso rise in zzso in response to zzso with an early phase zzso approximately zzso zzso that could be inhibited by both zzso and zzso zzso also induced zzso generation in the same cells, a biological response that is characteristic of zzso of the zzso zzso but not of the zzso zzso L cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso also responded to zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We converted the zzso zzso into a zzso one that has characteristics of both zzso and zzso receptors by two simple zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso specificity is determined by only a few key points on a zzso regardless of the structure of the remainder of the zzso Our studies have important implications on the design of pharmacological agents targeted for action at zzso zzso
