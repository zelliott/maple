zzso are essential zzso zzso Many animal zzso are clustered in the zzso and it has been shown that clustered zzso may be transcribed as a single zzso zzso zzso are often members of the same family, suggesting a role of tandem zzso in the emergence of zzso The zzso zzso family is the largest in zzso zzso with 8 members that are mostly clustered in the zzso Previous studies suggest that the copy number and zzso distribution of zzso family members has been subject to significant change during zzso The effects of such changes on their function are still zzso Here we study the evolution of function in the zzso zzso Our analyses show that, in spite of the change in number and organization among zzso most zzso zzso produce very similar mature zzso zzso Multiple mature zzso sequences are predicted to target genes involved in neural development in zzso These targeting properties are zzso in the distant species zzso zzso zzso followed by functional diversification is frequent during zzso gene zzso However, our results suggest that the production of zzso clusters by gene zzso rarely involves functional zzso This pattern of functional zzso among clustered zzso zzso reflects zzso evolutionary zzso However, we identified a small number of zzso sequences in zzso that may have undergone functional shifts associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso families may facilitate the acquisition of novel functional zzso
