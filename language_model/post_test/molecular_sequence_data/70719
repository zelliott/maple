zzso and adult zzso provide important experimental models to study limb development and zzso These animals have exceptional ability to zzso their zzso as well as other vital zzso Our research examines the role of the fringe gene zzso in the developing and zzso adult zzso zzso Fringe codes for a zzso zzso It was first discovered in zzso and later zzso were isolated in zzso zzso chick and zzso This gene has been highly zzso throughout evolution, indicating its crucial role in zzso and zzso zzso We have isolated, zzso and zzso the full length of the zzso zzso radical fringe zzso zzso by screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso library with a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fringe zzso The zzso fringe zzso codes for a zzso zzso acid protein with a predicted zzso signal zzso Newt fringe shows high zzso with radical fringe zzso of many zzso Whole mount zzso in zzso zzso on several stages of zzso limb development reveals that zzso is first expressed in the limb field, with intense expression as the limb bud zzso However, gene expression diminishes with more advanced zzso zzso A significant role in adult zzso zzso is also zzso as we isolated the zzso from a zzso library and found it highly expressed during the zzso zzso of active cell division and then down regulated at sites undergoing differentiation and zzso
