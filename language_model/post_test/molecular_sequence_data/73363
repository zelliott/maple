zzso zzso zzso DNA through the formation of a zzso zzso intermediate at sites containing the sequence zzso The active site, zzso is situated near the zzso zzso of the 314 zzso acid zzso Here, we report the effects of serial zzso zzso zzso of five zzso acids had no effect on zzso zzso However, deletion of 10, 15, or 20 zzso acids rendered the zzso zzso in DNA relaxation, zzso slowed the rate of zzso DNA zzso and progressively diminished DNA binding zzso without altering the sequence specificity of DNA zzso These effects lead us to speculate that the region downstream of the active site, which is not zzso among the zzso zzso is a component of the proposed zzso interface between the zzso and duplex zzso
