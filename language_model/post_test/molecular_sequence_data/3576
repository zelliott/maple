zzso zzso was performed to investigate whether the two zzso sequences zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in functional interaction with zzso II zzso The ability of MSP to bind to its functional site on the zzso complex and to reactivate oxygen evolution was dramatically reduced by the substitution of zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso by zzso of a single zzso between zzso and zzso or by deletion of zzso zzso of each of the four charged zzso with an zzso charged zzso showed that the charges at zzso and possibly zzso are important for the zzso interaction with zzso The zzso ability was also strongly affected by the zzso of zzso to zzso Replacement of zzso the only strictly zzso charged zzso in the zzso zzso by zzso had only a marginal effect on the function of zzso High affinity binding of MSP to zzso was also affected significantly by zzso at zzso which is located in a region zzso strictly zzso among the 14 sequences so far zzso These results imply that the zzso zzso which is well zzso among zzso from zzso to higher plants, is a domain of MSP for functional interaction with zzso
