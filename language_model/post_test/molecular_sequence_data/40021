zzso zzso zzso zzso is a poorly characterized zzso producer of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso It consisted of ten open reading frames arranged in the order zzso zzso the i zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso coded for a putative small zzso 71 zzso acid zzso of unknown function related to several bacterial zzso Its presence appeared to be a distinctive feature of the zzso zzso of zzso distant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso The results of northern zzso and zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso genes were zzso into a single zzso zzso zzso zzso data provided evidence showing that zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso during zzso zzso The amount of the zzso transcript decreased at the end of the exponential growth phase, and then moderately increased during the early stationary phase when, in contrast, the levels of zzso zzso the zzso c zzso zzso II, progressively zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed that zzso zzso was also present in the membrane during the stationary zzso These results together with previous data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso pumping activity remained constant in the stationary zzso in contrast, the activity and zzso content of the respiratory zzso became zzso
