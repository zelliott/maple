Current models of zzso between viral zzso are based on zzso zzso zzso The existence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso is demonstrated in the present study by the rescue of viable viruses after zzso with different pairs of zzso zzso fragments with suppressed zzso and replicating zzso zzso 100 distinct zzso zzso have been zzso The majority of crossovers occurred between zzso segments of the partners and might have resulted from zzso zzso not necessarily involving an zzso zzso Some of the crossover zzso are zzso The origin of some of these zzso zzso could be explained by zzso structures similar to known zzso A significant proportion of zzso zzso contained the entire zzso partner, if its 3' end was oxidized or zzso prior to being mixed with the 3' zzso All of these observations are consistent with a mechanism that involves zzso formation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso zzso may contribute to zzso significant zzso zzso
