The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is capable of zzso the activity of promoters containing DNA binding sites for the zzso factor zzso Recently a protein which binds RB and possesses the DNA binding characteristics of zzso has been zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso domain is the target for zzso zzso RB can silence the 57 zzso zzso zzso domain but cannot effectively repress an zzso zzso which has reduced RB binding zzso zzso zzso of zzso shows zzso involved in RB binding are required for zzso zzso zzso which affect both functions most dramatically lie within the minimal RB binding zzso A further subset of sensitive zzso lies within a new repeat motif zzso zzso L X P which zzso the minimum RB binding zzso These data show that RB can mask zzso zzso involved in the zzso process, possibly by mimicking a component of the zzso zzso zzso with this model, we find that the zzso box binding protein zzso can bind to the zzso zzso domain in zzso in a manner indistinguishable from that of zzso
