The zzso zzso a zzso of two related zzso zzso complexes, the zzso and zzso zzso the mast cell response and is necessary for the cell surface expression of zzso in zzso The transient reporter zzso indicated that zzso region is required for cell zzso zzso regulation of mouse zzso zzso zzso using zzso against zzso factors or competitive zzso demonstrated that zzso region zzso overlapping three zzso sites, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso region zzso one zzso zzso are recognized by zzso The promoter activity of zzso was decreased by zzso replacements of the zzso sites in mouse mast cell line zzso Furthermore, zzso produced zzso zzso the promoter activity in zzso cells, which are negative in the zzso production and the zzso was apparently suppressed by zzso site zzso These results indicate that cell zzso zzso of mouse zzso gene is regulated by zzso
