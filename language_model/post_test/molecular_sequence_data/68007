The authors analyzed 25 zzso lung biopsy specimens for zzso DNA by the zzso chain reaction zzso from patients with pulmonary zzso infection demonstrated by zzso zzso culture, or zzso DNA was extracted from 4 zzso zzso zzso sections by zzso K zzso followed by zzso and amplified by zzso zzso with zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in 7 of 7 wedge and 9 of 18 zzso biopsy specimens by zzso zzso zzso with direct zzso on an zzso gel was as sensitive as Southern zzso zzso zzso dilution studies demonstrated that zzso zzso could detect DNA amplified from zzso zzso organisms from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the amplified zzso product differentiated zzso tuberculosis from zzso zzso zzso chain reaction can detect low numbers of zzso organisms in zzso sections and confirm and zzso zzso zzso infection when cultures are negative or not zzso
