zzso processed zzso class zzso peptides possess ragged zzso and zzso zzso It is not known whether these zzso zzso zzso zzso which lie outside the zzso anchor zzso are recognized by the zzso or influence zzso Here we analyzed T cell responses to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso egg zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the majority of T cells were completely dependent on, and specific for, the zzso zzso of the zzso In addition, there were striking correlations between zzso V beta usage and zzso zzso We zzso that the V alpha zzso region recognizes zzso zzso while the V beta zzso region recognizes zzso zzso zzso peptides containing zzso were considerably more zzso and zzso a greater recall response to the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso which are a unique characteristic of peptides bound to zzso class II zzso can have a profound effect on zzso recognition and T cell zzso These data may have important implications for zzso zzso and vaccine zzso
