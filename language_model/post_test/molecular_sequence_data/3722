zzso is a member of zzso family and has two zzso recognition zzso Although zzso has been thought to function in cell zzso its precise zzso binding specificity has not yet been zzso We studied the zzso binding specificity of zzso comparatively with that of zzso using surface zzso zzso zzso or zzso column zzso and the zzso zzso of their binding to immobilized zzso zzso broadly recognized zzso type 1, type 2, and core zzso The substitution at the zzso and zzso position of zzso in these zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso increased the binding ability for zzso whereas the substitution at the zzso or zzso position diminished the zzso In contrast, zzso had quite weak affinity to zzso type 1, and type 2 zzso zzso with 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed weak binding ability to core 1 and zzso or zzso zzso type 1, and type 2 with zzso zzso or zzso zzso : 5 zzso zzso approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso value, zzso zzso zzso M, of zzso to zzso at 25 degrees C was two orders of magnitude lower than that of core zzso zzso core 1 had very weak affinity to zzso suggesting that zzso of core 1 is critical for the zzso These results suggest that zzso has a unique zzso binding specificity and interacts with zzso zzso
