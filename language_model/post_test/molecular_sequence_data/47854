In an effort to develop a zzso assembly for the zzso of zzso zzso we have made and characterized four zzso zzso peptides designed to associate spontaneously and strongly with zzso zzso without causing significant leakage from anchored zzso These peptides have a primary zzso structure with the following zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its reversed zzso zzso zzso Two of the four peptides have their zzso segments capped at both zzso with basic zzso to stabilize the zzso orientation and to increase the affinity for zzso charged zzso We have studied the secondary structure and the membrane affinity of the peptides as well as the effect of the different peptides on the membrane zzso The influence of the zzso length and the role of zzso zzso were clearly zzso First, a zzso segment of 24 zzso zzso corresponding approximately to the thickness of a zzso zzso improves considerably the affinity to zzso lipids compared to the shorter one of 12 zzso zzso The shorter zzso has a low membrane affinity since it may not be long enough to adopt a stable zzso Second, the presence of zzso zzso is essential since the binding is dominated by zzso zzso as illustrated by the enhanced binding with zzso zzso The charges at both ends, however, prevent the zzso from inserting spontaneously in the zzso since it would involve the zzso of a charged end through the zzso core of the zzso The direction of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso has no significant influence on its zzso None of these peptides zzso membrane zzso even at an incubation zzso to zzso zzso ratio of zzso Among the four zzso zzso is identified as the most suitable anchor for the zzso of zzso zzso
