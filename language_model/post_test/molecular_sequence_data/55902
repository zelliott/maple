The synthesis of zzso from zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso The expression of this zzso is highly regulated in both a zzso and zzso specific zzso We have chosen to examine the molecular basis of zzso gene regulation by studying two models of zzso expression: the zzso zzso chicken and the zzso rat zzso tumor cell zzso In the first model, affected zzso chickens express zzso in many zzso zzso while normal zzso chickens express zzso only in the zzso and zzso Our studies have demonstrated that in normal chickens the site of zzso initiation is located zzso 147 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso While zzso animals also express zzso zzso initiated at an analogous initiation site in the zzso a distinctive species of zzso zzso is also detected and is present in zzso and zzso zzso This zzso contains an identical coding zzso but contains an alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso that is derived from a distinctive zzso The second model, the zzso zzso tumor cell line, provides ample zzso This cell line expresses high zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso that is suppressed with administration of 8 zzso zzso or zzso but the activity is not altered by zzso or zzso growth factor zzso Despite this distinctive pattern of regulation, at least three species of zzso zzso are detected in Northern zzso each of which is also detected in rat zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso zzso indicate that both zzso cells and zzso cells zzso a promoter that is located zzso 97 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso These studies suggest that the zzso promoter is zzso zzso in both rats and zzso These results further imply that the genetic mechanisms controlling the diversity of zzso expression among zzso and among different species are likely to fall into two groups: those that employ distinctive promoters and alternative zzso and those that effect different patterns of regulation through a common zzso zzso
