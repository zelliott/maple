The zzso factors controlling the complex genetic response to zzso and their modes of regulation are poorly zzso We found that zzso and zzso DNA binding activity is markedly enhanced in zzso kidney or in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso After 40 zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso for as little as 5 zzso binding of zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso response element binding zzso to zzso containing either an zzso response element zzso or the zzso from the zzso promoter, was significantly zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso occurred with an identical time zzso In contrast, nuclear protein binding to an zzso containing a zzso zzso element was not detected until 40 zzso of zzso and although zzso was present in the complex, zzso was zzso zzso nuclear extracts from zzso kidney with protein zzso 2A markedly reduced binding to both the zzso and zzso zzso compatible with regulation by an zzso zzso An zzso zzso which zzso both the zzso and DNA binding zzso of zzso was activated by zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso on zzso Q column zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and with the peak of zzso protein zzso but not zzso zzso In conclusion, DNA binding activity of zzso directed at both zzso and zzso motifs is modulated in response to the extreme cellular stress of zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the DNA binding activity of zzso which appears to be regulated by the zzso protein zzso may play an important role in the earliest stages of the genetic response to zzso by targeting zzso and zzso to specific zzso including the zzso promoter and those containing zzso
