The bacterial zzso zzso zzso system zzso consists of several proteins whose primary functions are to transport and zzso their zzso The complexity of the zzso undoubtedly reflects its additional roles in zzso to zzso zzso and in regulation of other zzso processes in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso are the zzso proteins of the zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso their specific zzso in separate steps, and the zzso coli zzso zzso is one of the best studied of these zzso It consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso and an integral membrane domain zzso which is sufficient to bind zzso but which zzso zzso at a rate that is dependent on zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Recent results show that several zzso in a zzso zzso segment of the zzso domain are important for the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso This segment may be at least partially exposed to the zzso of the zzso A model is proposed in which this region of the zzso domain is crucial in zzso zzso of the zzso domain to transport through the zzso domain of the zzso zzso
