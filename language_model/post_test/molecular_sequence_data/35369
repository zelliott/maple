Fibrosis is characterized by excessive zzso of zzso tissue as a result of exaggerated deposition of zzso zzso zzso leading to tissue contraction and impaired function of the zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso and plays an important role in zzso One such zzso pathology is that of zzso zzso zzso a zzso complication which develops as a consequence of failure of surgical repair of retinal zzso Such patients often require repeated surgeries for retinal zzso therefore, a preventive measure for zzso is of utmost zzso The zzso zzso formed in zzso are composed of various cell types including the retinal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso is an important constituent of the zzso surrounding these zzso Together with the zzso zzso creates zzso in which zzso cells zzso We have successfully developed a zzso fully human, zzso single chain variable zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which acts in two ways: zzso binds to cryptic sites in zzso and thereby prevents its self zzso and zzso interacts with the cell surface zzso zzso zzso (through an attached zzso sequence zzso and thereby blocks the downstream cell signaling zzso We demonstrate the ability of this zzso to effectively reduce some of the hallmark features of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as reduction of collagen gel contraction (a model of zzso tissue zzso The data suggests that the zzso can be used as a rational, novel zzso zzso
