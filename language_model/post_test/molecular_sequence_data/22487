The zzso protein is a small zzso membrane zzso zzso by the zzso C virus which consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and can be blocked by zzso zzso zzso The length of zzso and zzso was estimated by employing different secondary structure prediction zzso and is proposed to span from zzso to zzso for zzso and from zzso to zzso for zzso A zzso search protocol based on simulated zzso combined with short restrained molecular dynamics simulations is used in addition to zzso zzso to investigate the packing of zzso Full zzso zzso zzso were generated, and in the most plausible models zzso and zzso are facing the zzso zzso In these models, zzso would be a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be sensitive to pH in respect to its zzso
