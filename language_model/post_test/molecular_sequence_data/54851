Comparative zzso analysis of zzso zzso recently revealed that a zzso island containing the zzso zzso referred to as the zzso zzso island zzso zzso can be transferred by zzso and contains a partial zzso element and an zzso zzso zzso Here, we characterize the role of zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and in trans zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of excised zzso zzso were determined using inverse zzso analysis on zzso zzso DNA from strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso No zzso were detected in zzso while in the zzso strain zzso zzso formation was zzso indicating that zzso is essential for zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso island in zzso zzso Based on the fact that this island can be mobilized and is zzso we propose to change the name of the zzso zzso to zzso
