zzso zzso is essential for all living cells and organisms, and zzso stress is a major factor constraining plant growth and yield zzso In plants, P efficiency is a complex quantitative trait involving multiple zzso and the mechanisms underlying P efficiency are largely zzso Combining linkage analysis, zzso and zzso association zzso and plant zzso we identified a soybean gene related to P efficiency, determined its favorable zzso and developed valuable functional zzso First, six major zzso regions associated with P efficiency were detected by performing zzso associations zzso in various zzso A highly significant region located on zzso 8, zzso was identified by both zzso and linkage mapping and explained zzso of the zzso zzso Then, a regional mapping study was performed with 40 surrounding markers in 192 diverse soybean zzso A strongly associated zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of the markers zzso and zzso was identified, and zzso was located in a region of approximately 250 zzso which contained a candidate gene zzso that zzso an acid zzso zzso zzso in soybean zzso roots increased P efficiency by zzso relative to the zzso A zzso association analysis indicated that six natural zzso zzso explained zzso of the zzso zzso The favorable zzso and zzso of zzso associated with increased transcript expression correlated with higher zzso zzso The discovery of the optimal zzso of zzso will now enable the accurate selection of soybeans with higher P efficiencies and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying P efficiency in zzso
