Several zzso zzso with optimum growth temperatures of about zzso degrees C, were recovered from hot springs in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso values showed that these organisms represented two new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had maximum temperatures for growth below 80 degrees C, while strains zzso and zzso unlike all other strains of the species of the zzso zzso except those belonging to zzso zzso grew at 80 degrees zzso The new zzso from zzso could not be distinguished easily from each other or from other strains of the species of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso however, strains zzso and zzso assimilated zzso a characteristic which was not detected in any of the other strains zzso Moreover, the species represented by strains zzso and zzso and the species represented by strains zzso and zzso could be distinguished clearly from the other species of zzso by their fatty acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso have the highest combined levels of zzso and zzso and the lowest levels of zzso of any of the strains of the species of zzso while strains zzso and zzso are characterized by a very low zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso analysis, zzso zzso values, zzso and zzso characteristics and fatty acid zzso the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the species represented by strains zzso and zzso and the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the species represented by strains zzso and zzso
