Surface zzso are principal receptors used by pathogens to invade target zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso surface zzso function as decoy receptors attracting pathogens to the zzso zzso and away from their target zzso zzso A zzso is solely expressed on the zzso surface where it is the most abundant zzso although its function is zzso The pathogen decoy hypothesis may be relevant here, as zzso has been shown in zzso to bind numerous viruses and bacteria, which do not zzso zzso However, it is also a zzso for zzso invasion by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequence variation among six higher primates and within a human population show that there is a large excess of replacement zzso zzso along each zzso lineage zzso on zzso 2-4 zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso and a significant excess of zzso in zzso 2 zzso the terminal portion of the zzso zzso within zzso These two signatures suggest that there has been exceptionally strong positive selection on this zzso driving zzso divergence during zzso evolution and balancing selection maintaining zzso variation within human zzso The pathogen decoy hypothesis alone is adequate to explain both these signatures of zzso and zzso diversifying zzso This has implications for understanding the functions of zzso surface components and their roles in health and zzso
