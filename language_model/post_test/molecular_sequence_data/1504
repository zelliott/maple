A myriad of predicted proteins have been described based upon zzso acid sequences but the existence of these structures has not been confirmed at the protein zzso The aim of the study was therefore to show expression of hypothetical proteins in several cell lines and to provide the zzso basis for their identification and zzso We used two-dimensional gel zzso with zzso zzso of high protein spots and subsequent zzso analysis of cell zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso and kidney cell zzso A zzso range from 3 to 10 was selected and second dimension was run using zzso zzso zzso A series of structures that have not been described before at the protein level were identified in several cell lines and were assigned to major zzso systems including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism and zzso We conclude that the zzso approach used serves as a suitable tool to verify the existence of zzso zzso The zzso identified zzso may contribute to several zzso in the human zzso Furthermore, zzso data given are of major relevance as zzso a prerequisite to find proteins in a map, cannot be predicted from zzso acid zzso
