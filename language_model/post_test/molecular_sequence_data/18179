The gene family zzso the small zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso contains approximately twelve zzso We have isolated six of these genes from a zzso library, and zzso five of the coding zzso The transit zzso zzso sequences are zzso but less highly than the mature zzso coding zzso The mature zzso zzso acid sequences are identical to each other and to the sequence deduced from a zzso clone derived from a seventh zzso Each of the five fully characterized zzso sequences contains a single zzso in precisely the same position as the second zzso of several zzso The zzso sequences differ in length and are less zzso than the coding zzso The zzso regions of the different genes have been zzso and used to prepare zzso zzso These zzso have been used to study the expression levels of individual zzso zzso zzso of six of the seven genes can be detected in total zzso isolated from plants grown in continuous zzso The levels of zzso zzso by each expressed gene are regulated by the action of zzso but there is zzso in the amount of expression of each zzso
