Using zzso analysis of zzso virus zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso disorders zzso we detected zzso of all tested zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in all cases, suggesting the presence of similar zzso expression patterns in both zzso and cell zzso In addition, the detection of immediate early zzso and early gene zzso transcripts in cell lines and zzso indicates that zzso of the virus zzso cycle zzso To investigate zzso expression patterns at the zzso level, a combination of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso (including zzso zzso was zzso In the zzso and zzso cell lines, the zzso type 3 expression pattern was detected in 80 to zzso of the cells as shown by the zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, in the three zzso that could be analyzed by double zzso cells expressing both zzso and zzso were rarely zzso A mixture of at least three different cell populations were zzso zzso cells exclusively expressing zzso and zzso zzso type zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso type zzso and zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso zzso of the zzso cycle was observed in a small minority of cells, as demonstrated by detection of zzso and zzso in all cases and zzso in two zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso cell lines, the observed zzso gene expression pattern in zzso reflects a mixture of multiple zzso zzso expressing different zzso of zzso zzso These data indicate that the operational definitions of zzso zzso in zzso cannot easily be applied to zzso but that a zzso of different zzso expression patterns can be detected at the single cell level in these zzso with, in a small minority of cells, progression to the virus zzso zzso
