The zzso relationships of a number of zzso and zzso rails have been investigated using zzso sequence zzso The third domain of the small zzso zzso zzso has been zzso for 22 zzso and part of the zzso end of the zzso gene has been zzso for 12 zzso Additional sequences were obtained from zzso zzso two species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rails were investigated using DNA extracted from zzso bones, and in cases where fresh material could not be obtained from other extant zzso feathers and museum skins were used as sources of zzso zzso trees produced from these data have zzso that are, in general, consistent with data from zzso zzso studies and recent interpretations based on zzso zzso zzso zzso groups zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso falls within the zzso group, and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso and should probably be placed in that zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso The Northern Hemisphere zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso Pacific zzso (or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is close to zzso zzso and distinct from the zzso zzso zzso and is evidently a separate zzso zzso zzso appears to be more closely associated with zzso than zzso Deep relationships among the rails remain poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso is closer to the cranes than the rails in this zzso zzso distances between zzso rails and their zzso counterparts varied considerably with observed zzso sequence zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This may be taken as an indication of the zzso with which zzso can evolve, and of the persistence of zzso zzso zzso data supported the notion that zzso zzso were independently zzso sometimes from similar colonizing zzso The zzso of zzso rails is apparently frequently dominated by evolutionary zzso although similarity of external appearance is not an indication of the extent of genetic zzso In some cases zzso that are genetically close are zzso distinct from one another zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whilst some zzso similar zzso are evidently independently derived zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
