zzso are novel surface zzso on zzso coli that mediate binding to soluble zzso zzso The expression of zzso is affected by environmental factors, such as temperature, zzso and growth zzso zzso formation is regulated at the level of transcription, in that the zzso gene can be zzso activated by the zzso zzso protein or zzso relieved by a zzso in zzso The expression of zzso is also dependent on functional zzso zzso zzso zzso bind to human skin zzso provided they are zzso with soluble zzso suggesting that zzso may act as a colonization factor in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and plasma protein involved in cell zzso and cell zzso It also interacts with a variety of zzso and thus the role of zzso in zzso binding of zzso zzso coli is of great zzso An investigation of the zzso of both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein involved in the binding of zzso coli to tissue will give us more insight into the initial colonization of host surfaces by zzso
