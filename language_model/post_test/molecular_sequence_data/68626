The 434 zzso binds more tightly to zzso than it does to zzso The zzso makes several specific contacts with the zzso arrayed outer four zzso of the 14 zzso site, and no specific contacts to the central six zzso The sequence of the outer zzso of zzso and zzso differs only by an zzso substitution at position 4 in one zzso of zzso while that of central bases is very zzso As expected from sequence analysis of zzso operators, the data show zzso prefers an zzso zzso at position zzso The magnitude of this preference depends on operator sequence context and solution zzso zzso 4 changes in the context of zzso have a greater effect on operator affinity for 434 zzso than do similar changes in zzso Although zzso and zzso display different affinities for 434 zzso their zzso complexes are similarly insensitive to changes in salt concentration and zzso By contrast, complexes formed between zzso and position 4 zzso zzso bearing an zzso change, and zzso which bears a zzso change, are affected zzso and to similar zzso by changes in zzso strength and zzso zzso protection experiments show that 434 zzso protects the DNA zzso backbone of zzso operators from zzso more efficiently than those of zzso zzso These data show that the zzso and structural properties of a zzso complex, while affected by position 4 base zzso are independent of the identity of this zzso The ability of zzso to recognize the base at position 4 depends on the sequence context at operator positions 5 to zzso Apparently there is an interplay between the bases at operator positions 4 to 7 which has a global effect on the structure of the zzso zzso
