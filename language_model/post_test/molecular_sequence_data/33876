zzso peptides zzso are produced in a very wide range of zzso Their zzso generally involves either zzso zzso zzso or zzso production of precursor zzso Plants within the zzso and certain other families produce zzso which generally consist of zzso zzso zzso zzso The biological roles for these zzso in the plant are not very clear, but many of them have activity in zzso zzso There is currently very little known about the zzso of zzso in the zzso A collection of expressed sequence tags from developing seeds of zzso zzso was investigated for information about zzso zzso This revealed genes that appeared to zzso zzso precursors which are subsequently zzso to mature zzso This was tested and confirmed by the expression of a zzso zzso a putative precursor of the zzso zzso A in transformed zzso zzso Similarly, extracts of developing zzso seeds were shown to catalyze the production of zzso A from the same putative zzso zzso Moreover, the presence in zzso seeds of two zzso J zzso and K zzso which was predicted by sequence analysis, was confirmed by liquid zzso zzso zzso analysis also predicts the presence of similar zzso precursor genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data support the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso
