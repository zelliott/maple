The B zzso zzso of zzso toxin is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediates attachment, entry, and zzso trafficking of zzso in host zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso with identical folding zzso zzso 1 and 2 are each comprised of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that likely arose by gene zzso from a primordial zzso recognition domain zzso although only zzso zzso and zzso retain functional zzso zzso As part of our ongoing effort to generate a comprehensive B cell zzso map of zzso we report the characterization of three new zzso zzso zzso zzso All three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were initially identified based on their abilities to neutralize zzso in a zzso cell zzso zzso and to partially (or zzso block zzso attachment to cell zzso However, only zzso proved capable of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and in zzso passive immunity to mice in a model of systemic zzso Using a combination of techniques, including competitive zzso zzso analysis, differential zzso by Western zzso as well as affinity enrichment of zzso displayed zzso we tentatively localized the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose that the zzso recognized by zzso is within zzso zzso adjacent to zzso high affinity zzso zzso These data suggest that recognition of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical zzso of zzso zzso activity and protective immunity to zzso
