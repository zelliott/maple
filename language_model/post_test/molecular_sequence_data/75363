We describe a zzso zzso that is associated with the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were highest in cells and tumors of relatively low zzso potential in two experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma cell lines, in which the gene was identified, and zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso levels did not correlate with cell sensitivity to host zzso responses and may, therefore, be associated with intrinsic zzso The predicted zzso protein sequence zzso by the zzso zzso clone is novel compared with zzso animal, zzso and viral zzso
