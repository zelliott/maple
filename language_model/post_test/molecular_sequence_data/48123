The zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso exchange factor zzso were cloned and zzso zzso have multiple and highly divergent zzso species, with zzso and zzso showing only about zzso zzso acid sequence identity, and yet these can apparently interact with a single zzso zzso zzso lies in an zzso with zzso which encodes zzso protein zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso from zzso zzso differs from most other bacterial zzso zzso in having a zzso extension of 70 zzso zzso with a highly repetitive organization, the function of which is zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by promoter zzso zzso zzso mapping and Northern zzso revealed that the genes give rise to a zzso transcript from a single promoter upstream of zzso An zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso it results in an approximately zzso ratio of zzso vs zzso zzso Although zzso zzso the major zzso is located in the zzso zzso protein zzso an additional promoter in the zzso zzso region leads to a significant excess of zzso over zzso Most zzso acid zzso known from the zzso coli crystal structure of the zzso complex to be directly involved in interaction between the two zzso factors are zzso between zzso coli and zzso However, whenever interaction zzso in the zzso zzso show divergence among zzso zzso zzso and zzso the single zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso These apparently enable productive interaction to occur with all three zzso
