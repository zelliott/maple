zzso protein A zzso is a cell surface protein expressed by zzso zzso It consists of five repetitive zzso The five zzso show individual interaction to the zzso as well as certain zzso of zzso G zzso from most zzso zzso Due to the high affinity and selectivity of zzso it has a widespread use as an affinity zzso for capture and zzso of zzso One of the problems with zzso affinity zzso in large-scale zzso is their sensitivity to alkaline zzso zzso however, is considered relatively stable to alkaline zzso Nevertheless, it is desirable to further improve the stability in order to enable an zzso affinity medium to withstand even longer exposure to the harsh conditions associated with zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, a protein engineering strategy, which was used earlier for stabilization and consists of replacing the zzso zzso is zzso Since Z in its zzso form already has a significant tolerance to alkaline treatment, small changes in stability due to the zzso are difficult to zzso zzso in order to enable detection of improvements regarding the alkaline resistance of the Z domain, we chose to use a bypass zzso strategy using a zzso zzso zzso as a surrogate zzso zzso has earlier been shown to possess an affinity to zzso that is similar to the zzso but also demonstrates decreased structural zzso Since the contribution of the different zzso zzso to the zzso rate of a zzso is dependent on the environment and also the structural flexibility of the particular region, it is important to consider all sensitive zzso acids one by zzso The parental zzso contains eight zzso zzso each with a different impact on the alkaline stability of the zzso By exchanging zzso 23 for a zzso we were able to increase the stability of the zzso domain in alkaline zzso Also, when zzso the zzso zzso to the Z scaffold, we were able to detect an increased tolerance to alkaline treatment compared to the native Z zzso
