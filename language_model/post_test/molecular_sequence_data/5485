zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of an zzso group from an zzso donor to the zzso position of zzso zzso The plant cell contains three types of zzso which are located in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso in zzso is soluble and uses zzso zzso as the zzso zzso whereas the zzso in the zzso and the zzso are bound to zzso and use zzso as the zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso have been cloned from several plants, and the gene for the zzso has been cloned from zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from the zzso sequences of zzso indicate that the product of translation is a precursor of about 460 zzso acid zzso which consists of a leader sequence of about 70 zzso acid zzso and a mature protein of about 400 zzso with a molecular mass of about 42 zzso zzso engineering of the zzso of fatty acids has been achieved by manipulation of the zzso for the zzso found in zzso and has allowed modification of the ability of tobacco to tolerate chilling zzso
