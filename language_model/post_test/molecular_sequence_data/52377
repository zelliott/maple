Nuclear extract of human zzso cell line zzso contains a 70 zzso protein which is gradually reduced when cells are induced to express zzso genes by 25 zzso zzso When zzso synthesis was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso or zzso D (1 zzso the disappearance of this protein was zzso The 70 zzso nuclear protein exhibited strong binding to G gamma and A gamma zzso promoters but not to zzso zzso This suggests that this 70 zzso nuclear protein may be involved in the regulation of fetal zzso gene zzso
