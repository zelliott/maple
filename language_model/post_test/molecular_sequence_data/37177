Efforts to develop a vaccine against human zzso virus type 1 zzso are complicated by resistance of virus to zzso The zzso resistance zzso of zzso has been linked to high zzso We studied the mechanisms determining this zzso using clones of the zzso zzso MN strain zzso and the zzso primary MN strain zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso halves of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso contributed to the zzso resistance, zzso zzso but depended upon sequences in the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso Among 23 clones constructed to map the contributing zzso there was a very strong correlation between zzso and zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso that distinguished the zzso of zzso and zzso clones were clustered in or near the zzso and zzso binding sites and in regions distant from those binding zzso To test the hypothesis that some of these distant zzso may interact with zzso we determined which of them contributed to high zzso and whether those zzso modulated zzso association in the context of zzso zzso zzso In one zzso six zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso at least four of which clustered closely on the inner domain, modulated zzso This clone had a zzso association zzso like zzso in comparison to zzso spontaneous zzso was low, and zzso induced by soluble zzso binding was zzso These results identify a region of the zzso inner domain that may be a binding site for zzso Our studies clarify mechanisms of primary virus zzso zzso
