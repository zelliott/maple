zzso proteins zzso are zzso repeat zzso proteins involved in plant zzso Wheat zzso genes have been isolated from the B zzso and D zzso zzso and now we report the identification of zzso genes from the A zzso of wild and cultivated zzso By Southern blots and sequence analysis of zzso clones we demonstrated that wheat contains a single copy zzso gene per zzso and the one from the A zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso of a long terminal repeat zzso zzso within the fourth zzso We demonstrated also that this zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso and all the zzso zzso zzso but is absent in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso took place after the divergence between zzso zzso and zzso zzso but before the formation of the zzso zzso We identified also two independent zzso events of new Class II zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso that interrupted the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso The occurrence of these zzso within the coding region of zzso facilitated the mapping of the zzso locus in the zzso region of the short arm of zzso group zzso We speculate that the zzso of zzso genes are tolerated because of zzso of zzso activities in the wheat zzso
