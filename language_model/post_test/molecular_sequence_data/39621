zzso control of zzso zzso at the level of the anterior zzso zzso is primarily through the zzso action of the zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso However, a zzso zzso acting at the level of the zzso to zzso regulate zzso zzso has, until recently, remained unknown in any zzso In 2000, we discovered a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso release at the level of the zzso in quail and termed it zzso hormone zzso A zzso system is an intriguing concept and provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to study the regulation of avian reproduction from an entirely novel zzso To zzso the mode of action of zzso we further identified the zzso for zzso and characterized its expression and binding activity in zzso The identified zzso zzso possessed seven zzso zzso and specifically bound to zzso in a zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was found in the zzso and several brain regions including the zzso These results suggest that zzso acts directly on the zzso via zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso may also act on the zzso to inhibit zzso zzso To understand the functional significance of zzso in avian zzso we also investigated the mechanism that regulates zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso induced zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso Thus zzso appears to act directly on zzso zzso via its zzso to induce zzso zzso Based on these studies, zzso is likely an important zzso for the regulation of avian zzso
