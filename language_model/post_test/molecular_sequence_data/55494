zzso zzso are key zzso in the complex regulation of cellular processes in almost all living zzso For this reason, protein zzso represent attractive targets to stop the growth of zzso pathogens such as zzso and zzso However, using zzso zzso to fight against these organisms bears several challenges since most of them are zzso and will also affect crucial host zzso Here we present the X-ray structure of zzso zzso zzso 3 from the zzso plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso and its zzso by zzso zzso zzso Despite the high sequence zzso between the human and the zzso zzso of this vital zzso we found substantial differences in the zzso plasticity of their active zzso zzso that induced such zzso changes could be used to selectively inhibit the zzso zzso This study serves as an example of how zzso selectivity of zzso can be achieved by identifying and addressing the inactive state of a protein zzso In addition to this, our study gives interesting insights into the molecular plasticity of zzso by revealing a previously unknown inactive zzso of this important zzso zzso
