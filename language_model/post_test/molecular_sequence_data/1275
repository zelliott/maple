zzso zzso is a zzso soil zzso found either in zzso form or as a zzso zzso of a plant structure called the zzso zzso between zzso zzso and its plant host alfalfa is dependent on bacterial zzso of nod zzso which zzso the zzso responsible for synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor is a zzso that zzso a zzso modification essential for its biological zzso zzso also zzso the zzso zzso of the bacterial cell surface, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso Ross, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso the zzso sequence of zzso zzso to identify an open reading frame, zzso (which we now propose to name zzso which encodes an zzso zzso zzso We expressed zzso in zzso coli and demonstrated that the zzso protein functions as an zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso displayed an zzso reduction in zzso zzso activity in zzso However, zzso zzso retain approximately zzso levels of zzso zzso when zzso in zzso indicating the presence of an additional zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso that can compensate for the loss of zzso The zzso zzso did show reduced zzso zzso compared to that of the wild type, under conditions that promote nod gene zzso and it zzso a greater number of zzso than did the wild type during zzso with zzso These results suggest that zzso of cell surface zzso and zzso factor may compete for a limiting pool of zzso zzso and that zzso is required for optimal zzso zzso under these zzso
