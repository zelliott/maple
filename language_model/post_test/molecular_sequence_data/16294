zzso of promoters of zzso genes is controlled by an zzso sequence zzso The sequence of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been zzso This protein specifically recognizes the zzso element and is part of the previously identified zzso family of zzso The zzso domain of zzso is structurally related to the zzso box consensus and thus contains a potential zzso zzso zzso also possesses a potential zzso zzso domain, where four zzso are each separated by exactly seven zzso Comparisons of zzso with protein zzso which also recognizes the zzso element but is zzso expressed in all cell types, show high sequence conservation through the zzso zzso domain, as well as an adjacent tract of 75 zzso The latter zzso region is also found in regulatory genes expressed in zzso cells and zzso and has been termed a zzso zzso Because two different zzso were isolated, it is proposed that the zzso gene is expressed as multiple zzso that vary in zzso zzso Most interestingly, the zzso zzso contains a second overlapping open reading frame, zzso zzso in zzso which might also specify a protein important for zzso zzso
