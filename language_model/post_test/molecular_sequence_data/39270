Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from a knee zzso of a 66-year-old man and an industrial zzso respectively, were studied for their zzso zzso On the basis of zzso data zzso major zzso zzso major polar lipids zzso zzso and zzso and major fatty acids zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequence zzso both strains belong to the zzso The presence of zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso in zzso zzso were in agreement with its zzso affiliation in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities between both strains and established species within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were less than 95 zzso Although both organisms showed highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to members of zzso zzso features (including zzso zzso were more like those of members of the zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso genes confirmed the separate zzso position of the two zzso On the basis of zzso pairing results and zzso and zzso data, the two strains can be clearly differentiated from each other and from all known zzso zzso It is evident that these organisms represent two novel species in a new zzso zzso zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso (the type species, type strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
