Recent evidence suggests that the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso role in zzso A zzso zzso zzso However, the nature of the zzso interaction and effect on the zzso zzso is zzso The purpose of the present study was twofold: zzso to determine if zzso exposure caused direct local release of zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso to determine if locally generated zzso has zzso effects on the underlying vascular smooth muscle to induce zzso zzso were performed in isolated rat zzso zzso First it was determined that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso decreases in zzso diameter to increasing zzso zzso of zzso The AA was more sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso than the zzso Next, the blocking effect of a recently zzso putative ETA zzso zzso was verified in both the AA and zzso where it was found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso totally inhibited the zzso observed with zzso zzso Finally, the role of locally zzso zzso in zzso zzso was tested by determining the effect of the ETA zzso zzso on zzso AA and zzso zzso In the AA the zzso effect of zzso M zzso was completely blocked by the ETA zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso M zzso in zzso in the presence of the ETA zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso diameter by a mean of zzso from baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This change in zzso diameter was similar to that induced by zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso directly zzso zzso zzso This effect is zzso by zzso in the AA but not the zzso
