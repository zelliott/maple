zzso plays a major role in energy and zzso flow in the biological food zzso Plant zzso has attracted much interest since Darwin's time, but many fundamental properties of the carnivorous lifestyle are largely zzso In particular, the chain of events leading from prey perception to its zzso zzso remains to be zzso One of the first steps after the capture of animal zzso zzso the zzso breakup of the zzso zzso zzso is reflected by considerable zzso activity in the zzso zzso fluid in the carnivorous plant Venus zzso This study addresses the molecular nature, function, and regulation of the underlying zzso zzso zzso Using mass zzso based de zzso sequencing, zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso As anticipated for one of the most prominent proteins in the zzso zzso zzso during prey zzso zzso of zzso zzso is restricted to zzso and enhanced by zzso zzso In their natural habitat, Venus zzso is exposed to high zzso We expressed and zzso zzso zzso zzso and show that the zzso exhibits the hallmark properties expected from an zzso active in the hot and zzso zzso fluid of zzso zzso zzso modeling revealed a relative compact zzso form of zzso zzso which might contribute to its overall stability and resistance to zzso These peculiar characteristics could well serve industrial purposes, especially because of the ability to zzso both soluble and zzso zzso zzso including the commercially important zzso of zzso
