We have zzso 13 large zzso proteins of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and determined their partial zzso acid zzso To zzso the structure and function of these zzso we searched for their genes by comparing our sequence data with those deduced from the zzso zzso sequence data of zzso zzso and analyzed zzso In addition, we searched for the genes zzso proteins whose zzso zzso acid sequences we have reported previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, we were able to identify and characterize 12 new genes for large zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we determined the zzso zzso acid sequences of seven small zzso proteins and subsequently identified the genes for five of them, three of which were found to be zzso
