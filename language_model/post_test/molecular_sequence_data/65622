The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are organic zzso that are required for cell growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso the first and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, is a highly regulated zzso 

To use this zzso as a potential drug target, the gene zzso putative zzso zzso zzso sequence was cloned from zzso zzso a zzso zzso causing zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of 413 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46 zzso and a predicted zzso point of zzso The zzso zzso putative zzso sequence has zzso sequence identity with human zzso and zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso gene located on a zzso zzso The zzso putative zzso protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso against zzso putative zzso protein detected a band of anticipated size approximately 46 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso irreversible inhibitor of zzso had no effect on the zzso putative zzso from zzso zzso Comparative modeling of the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso putative zzso shows that the putative binding site for zzso is disrupted by the substitution of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso through which this inhibitor interacts with the zzso zzso acid changes in the pocket of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in low zzso specificity for zzso It is possible that the zzso has evolved a novel zzso zzso 

To our knowledge this is the first report on the molecular characterization of putative zzso sequence from zzso zzso Computer modeling revealed that three of the critical zzso required for binding of zzso to the zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso resulting in the likely loss of interactions between the zzso and zzso
