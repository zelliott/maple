The 18 zzso peripheral zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso These two compounds are zzso competitive zzso of each zzso However, while the binding affinity of zzso varies enormously across species, zzso always displays high zzso suggesting that their binding zzso are overlapping but not zzso We report here that zzso human and bovine zzso produced in zzso a zzso devoid of zzso zzso can be zzso with zzso but only the human zzso can be zzso with zzso Furthermore, we identified, through the binding analysis of zzso zzso zzso a region near the zzso end of the zzso with only five zzso zzso acids between human and bovine zzso as responsible for the difference in high affinity binding of zzso to the two zzso
