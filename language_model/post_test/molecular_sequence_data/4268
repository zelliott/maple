Ten years after the idea of zzso cluster analysis zzso was conceived and first published, theoretical and practical experience has shown this unconventional method of protein sequence analysis to be particularly efficient and sensitive, especially with families of sequences sharing low levels of sequence zzso This extreme sensitivity has made it possible to predict the functions of genes whose sequence similarities are hardly if at all zzso by current one-dimensional zzso methods alone, and offers a new way to explore the enormous amount of data generated by zzso zzso zzso also provides original tools to understand fundamental features of protein stability and zzso Since the last review of zzso published in 1990 zzso significant improvements have been made and several new zzso have been zzso Here we wish to update and zzso this zzso
