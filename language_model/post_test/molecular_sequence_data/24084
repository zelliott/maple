The zzso differential display method was applied to identify banana genes that were regulated by salicylic acid zzso during chilling zzso zzso zzso fragments induced by zzso during chilling stress were zzso Seven of them were affirmed by reverse Northern zzso to be significantly zzso Two most differential fragments zzso and zzso of them were cloned and zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that clone G zzso had zzso zzso to partial zzso sequences of two zzso genes in soybean zzso zzso and clone A did not show any identity to previously reported sequences in zzso zzso
