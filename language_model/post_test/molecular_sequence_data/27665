zzso treatment of mouse zzso tumor cells produces zzso zzso that express new transplantation zzso zzso zzso recognized by zzso T zzso We found that the gene zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso contains 12 zzso zzso a 60 zzso protein lacking a typical zzso signal zzso The sequence shows no significant similarity with sequences in current data zzso A zzso that causes expression of the zzso is located in zzso 4; it is the only apparent difference between the normal and the zzso zzso A short synthetic zzso corresponding to a region of zzso 4 located around this zzso makes zzso cells sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso T zzso The zzso creates a strong zzso enabling the zzso to bind the zzso zzso zzso Several secondary tumor cell zzso that no longer express zzso zzso zzso were found to carry deletions in the zzso
