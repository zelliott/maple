Signaling through the zzso zzso activates diverse molecular pathways in a variety of immune cell zzso To study zzso signaling complexes in B cells, we produced soluble zzso zzso domain zzso that zzso across cell zzso and engage zzso zzso signaling zzso As zzso by zzso zzso rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain fusion protein zzso occurred in both the zzso B cell line and human zzso B zzso Upon cellular entry, zzso activated zzso transcription, induced zzso processing of zzso to the zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso and zzso on the surface of B zzso zzso zzso of B cells did not, however, activate zzso levels of zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso and did not zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso complexes recovered from zzso B cells revealed that zzso associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or extensive zzso of zzso zzso diminished the disruptive effect of the zzso zzso in the zzso binding site of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso mimics some of the natural zzso signaling pathways in B cells by assembling partially functional signaling zzso that do not require plasma membrane zzso We present a novel approach for delivering zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso into cells and recovering intact signaling complexes for molecular zzso
