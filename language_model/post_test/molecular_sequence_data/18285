A series of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso in order to assess the phasing problem, which arises because of the lack of zzso correspondence between zzso and zzso in DNA binding zzso The consequences of incorporating zzso flexible and rigid zzso zzso Z and E zzso zzso and zzso between the two zzso zzso on the DNA binding properties were assessed by zzso I zzso The zzso freedom associated with two zzso linked by a flexible zzso zzso allows zzso binding in both a zzso and zzso fashion, with zzso binding requiring a minimum zzso length of zzso For compounds possessing rigid zzso for example, zzso and trans zzso zzso the zzso geometry excludes zzso zzso while the trans structure favors zzso zzso zzso possessing zzso linking groups have reduced DNA binding zzso This is most zzso due to the zzso groups, which are not zzso with the zzso zzso thus blocking the zzso from penetrating deeply into the minor groove of zzso
