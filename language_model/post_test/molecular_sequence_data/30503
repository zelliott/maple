The zzso gene of zzso zzso Dalton zzso was isolated by cloning in zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this gene encodes a zzso of 156 zzso acid zzso When high levels of zzso were expressed from the gene in zzso zzso by using the zzso promoter of zzso zzso inserted upstream of the coding zzso zzso which were indistinguishable from zzso of zzso zzso were zzso
