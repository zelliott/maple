The varied organ zzso and clinical presentations of infection by zzso zzso have zzso interest in the role of zzso genetic diversity in zzso We investigated genetic diversity among 54 zzso zzso zzso from Bangladesh by analyzing zzso in the zzso gene by zzso zzso on DNA extracted from stool and liver zzso zzso We detected both size and restriction site zzso among the zzso within this endemic zzso A combination of the zzso zzso results and the zzso zzso of the zzso products examined yielded 25 distinct DNA zzso patterns among the 42 stool zzso and an additional 9 distinct patterns among the 12 liver zzso zzso zzso half of the zzso had unique zzso Interestingly, the majority of zzso zzso from the liver had zzso which were not present in zzso zzso from the same geographic zzso These data are consistent with the existence of genetic differences between zzso zzso which cause zzso and those which cause zzso zzso We conclude that there is genetic diversity within zzso zzso zzso from an endemic population as reflected in zzso zzso zzso protein gene zzso The correlation of genetic differences with the zzso potential of zzso zzso strains and the implications of genetic diversity for the zzso of zzso require further zzso
