zzso zzso zzso has been shown to contain components capable of inducing zzso and osteogenesis at zzso sites when implanted in zzso and zzso in cultures of embryonic zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso responsible, called the zzso agent zzso has been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso extract of zzso bovine zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was identified in zzso by zzso for zzso of zzso into zzso by the zzso after 24 zzso in zzso The active fraction induced the zzso to produce type II collagen zzso and decrease production of type I collagen zzso after 5 days in zzso The zzso + zzso cultured for 4 to 7 zzso formed zzso and zzso zzso indicative of zzso zzso In zzso implants in rat muscle with collagen carrier produced zzso bone after 7 zzso The zzso was brought to zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso tested at each step by zzso zzso zzso The zzso components had masses in the ranges of zzso to 10,000 Da by both mass zzso and gel zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and internal zzso acid sequences were zzso These data showed unequivocally that the zzso peptides were derived from bovine zzso The peptides contain the zzso portion of the bovine zzso The presence of these zzso zzso in zzso zzso leads us to zzso that they may be involved in zzso signaling during tooth development zzso first time a function has been indicated for these zzso
