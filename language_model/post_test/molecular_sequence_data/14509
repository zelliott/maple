Here we present a highly efficient protocol for zzso zzso of fluorescent zzso or other functional groups to the zzso of synthetic peptides prior to zzso and zzso The protocol avoids expensive zzso zzso and instead employs zzso zzso activated by large amounts of zzso zzso The protocol was used to label peptides with low zzso such as long zzso peptides and peptides with strong tendencies to form zzso shielding structures or zzso in zzso In all cases, the yields far exceeded those from commercially available zzso zzso
