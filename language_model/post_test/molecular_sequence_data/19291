zzso molecular diversity within the zzso zzso has primarily been studied in marine surface zzso Here, the vertical distribution of zzso diversity was investigated in the zzso Sea from zzso to zzso waters, using zzso samples zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso gene clone libraries were used to generate sequences from zzso zone samples zzso zzso maximum to the zzso the permanent zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zone and zzso data contrasted zzso the former displaying greater diversity at the zzso zzso level, based on 232 nearly full-length zzso zzso sequences belonged almost exclusively to the zzso and zzso while surface samples also contained known and putative zzso groups, such as unique zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses placed most zzso and zzso sequences within previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso within the Novel zzso groups I and II zzso and zzso or the novel Marine zzso zzso However, some zzso zzso formed zzso zzso supported zzso zzso were recovered from the zzso zone only, although many zzso are reportedly zzso making the observed distribution a point for further zzso An unexpectedly high proportion of zzso sequences were zzso From these, five environmental zzso zzso zzso to zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were composed of zzso zzso with the former solely containing zzso Sea zzso although from all depth zones zzso Our findings highlight the vast diversity of these zzso most of which remain zzso and of unknown ecological zzso
