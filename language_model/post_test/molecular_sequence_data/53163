zzso chemical properties of the zzso zzso in zinc zzso have been investigated by the model of zzso zzso zzso complexes, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso most suitable zzso values for the zzso zzso in zzso were illustrated by the first model zzso complex, which mimics the essential kinetic and zzso roles of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso (in alkaline zzso and zzso of alcohols for hydride transfer to zzso (in alcohol zzso were also zzso by zzso zzso zzso The functions of two zzso in zzso zzso were explained by a new zzso zzso For an zzso type II model, a zzso zzso showed facile zzso formation from a zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso The strong zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso were exploited into novel selective zzso zzso (or zzso recognition of zzso complexes by the strong zzso zzso zzso bond zzso The zzso zzso complexes selectively bind to T (or zzso in zzso and zzso DNA (or zzso Thus, zzso complexes act like molecular zzso to break zzso pairs in DNA, which was proven by various zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso These zzso complexes showed some relevant zzso and biological properties such as zzso of zzso factor, zzso binding zzso or strong zzso activities to zzso bacterial zzso
