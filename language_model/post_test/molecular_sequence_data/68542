zzso zzso of human zzso by zzso zzso a series of rapid zzso events that include zzso of zzso zzso to liberate zzso acid for further conversion to zzso zzso The identity of the zzso zzso involved has not been zzso Here we show by zzso analysis that human zzso contain significant amounts zzso zzso zzso of the recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling of human zzso with zzso revealed that the extent of zzso of zzso was greatly increased after zzso zzso Upon stimulation of zzso with zzso zzso exhibits enhanced zzso activity, as well as a change in its zzso and zzso properties compared with zzso in resting zzso These zzso of zzso are reversed by treatment with zzso demonstrating that they are the consequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso is rapid zzso by 1 zzso at 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is more sensitive to zzso than the generation of zzso zzso suggesting that it may be an early event in the sequence of steps leading to the zzso and further metabolism of zzso zzso By comparing the functional properties of zzso from control versus zzso zzso we found that while activated zzso exhibits the same zzso requirement and apparent zzso affinity zzso its zzso activity zzso is increased compared with control zzso We conclude that 1) zzso is likely to play an important role in zzso zzso of zzso acid and 2) zzso elicits rapid and full zzso of zzso not only by promoting a rise in zzso free zzso but also by inducing zzso of zzso thereby improving its zzso zzso
