The zzso zzso factor zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso which are located within the zzso and zzso zzso To study their differential zzso properties, we linked the isolated zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso We have shown that both zzso regions of zzso isolated from their natural context, can activate zzso as promoter zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso by the zzso domain is dependent on a yet unidentified zzso binding to the zzso virus 40 zzso The results obtained by zzso of zzso zzso or their mixed combination suggest that the zzso are functionally zzso However, zzso from a remote position could only be achieved with the zzso of zzso in B zzso In zzso cells, higher zzso levels were observed, suggesting that distinct zzso zzso in concert with the zzso zzso of zzso might be involved in zzso zzso from zzso and remote zzso Furthermore, we identified a repression domain at the zzso of zzso When transferred to a potent zzso zzso stimulation was inhibited zzso These results underscore the modular structure of zzso with zzso zzso for zzso and repression and suggest that zzso might have complex regulatory functions in zzso
