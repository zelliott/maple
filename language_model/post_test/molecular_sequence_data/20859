zzso zzso zzso of DNA bases represents a considerable zzso threat to all organisms, particularly those living in extreme zzso zzso is readily zzso to zzso which base pairs with zzso during zzso and most organisms zzso at least one zzso DNA zzso zzso that removes this zzso base from DNA with high zzso zzso zzso to zzso approximately zzso less zzso and its removal from DNA in zzso has to date been reported to be zzso solely by zzso DNA zzso We previously showed that zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso can zzso zzso from zzso zzso but as this zzso is not amenable to genetic zzso we were unable to ascertain that the zzso also has this role in zzso In the present study, we show that zzso from zzso zzso protects this zzso against zzso associated with zzso of both zzso and zzso Together with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also helps zzso the zzso of the zzso agent zzso
