zzso genes zzso zzso zzso factors that are key regulator of zzso in both zzso and zzso How these zzso factors regulate targets required for neural determination and/or zzso is beginning to be zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso is a zzso target of zzso zzso Using a combination of transient and stable transgenic reporters, we show that regulation of zzso by one such zzso factor, zzso requires three clustered zzso binding sites that act in a zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that as for other zzso targets, members of the different zzso families regulate zzso expression via distinct zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, however, while the zzso zzso regulated by a second zzso factor, zzso has been zzso between delta genes of different species, we show that the zzso zzso has zzso These results suggest that evolutionary constraints on the mechanism by which zzso regulates gene expression appear less strict than for zzso
