From a screen for genes expressed and required in the zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso which encodes a set of proteins most similar to human zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are nuclear zzso proteins normally expressed in the zzso where they directly regulate zzso In patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins are present as zzso zzso with a role in zzso zzso is localized to nuclear zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso normally and maintain zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso develop irregularities in overall zzso and have defects in zzso zzso The zzso defects in zzso zzso provide a potential mechanism for the loss of motor function observed in zzso zzso
