Most improved zzso of commercially important zzso zzso blueberry were developed from only four native selections collected from the zzso thus, many zzso are closely related by zzso The zzso among major zzso is a potential problem, as the zzso zzso are highly zzso natural zzso with potential zzso zzso We investigated the extent of genetic zzso among 15 improved zzso and four wild selections by the technique of random amplified zzso DNA, also referred to as arbitrarily primed zzso chain zzso Single zzso of arbitrary sequence revealed zzso among zzso and wild zzso zzso distances were estimated based on the amount of band zzso zzso analysis of genetic distance estimates tended to group siblings with each other and with one or both zzso The average genetic distance between improved zzso decreased relative to the four wild parental selections, which might indicate progression towards zzso The significance of increased genetic zzso among the improved zzso of zzso blueberry and the application of molecular methods in breeding and commercial zzso is zzso
