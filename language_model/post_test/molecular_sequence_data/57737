The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding pocket of the zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli was zzso to substitute zzso zzso or zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso were made in zzso zzso and in a zzso or zzso form of the protein to assess the effects of the zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso zzso containing the binding pocket zzso forms of zzso were characterized through zzso activity and by measurement of zzso binding zzso This study confirms a role for both zzso 72 and zzso 82 in zzso binding and zzso of zzso zzso or zzso substitution of zzso 72 produced forms of zzso having low affinity for the zzso and unresponsive to the zzso zzso zzso for zzso 72 produced a low affinity zzso form of zzso zzso has a stringent requirement for the positioning of the position 72 zzso zzso group within the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of this study also indicate that there are differences in the binding requirements of zzso and zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso binding to zzso
