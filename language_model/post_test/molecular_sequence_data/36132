We have zzso the molecular basis of zzso in 22 Anglo-Saxon individuals, all of whom were zzso for zzso except for one, who was a compound zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso of the zzso chain reaction zzso and direct sequencing of zzso DNA amplified by the zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso Nine different zzso were zzso four are commonly found in the Mediterranean, one in Asia, one has been described previously in both Europe and Asia, and three are rare zzso associated with a dominant zzso zzso In three individuals the zzso remains zzso despite sequence analysis of the zzso gene and its immediate zzso zzso We report our findings and discuss the diversity of these zzso
