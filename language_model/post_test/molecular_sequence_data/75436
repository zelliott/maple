A zzso gene that encodes zzso related to zzso zzso zzso was isolated by screening a zzso library with a zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and with synthetic zzso This gene was used to isolate a zzso from a zzso adult head zzso zzso The zzso was defined by sequence analysis to zzso 13 peptides that have zzso or related sequences at their zzso zzso Other putative zzso including one that has zzso to zzso zzso factor, are present in the deduced approximately equal to zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested the presence of a single zzso gene within the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the expression of at least two transcripts of approximately equal to zzso and approximately equal to zzso zzso Both transcripts are evident throughout zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso In zzso zzso was used to zzso this zzso gene to band zzso on the right arm of the 2nd zzso These data provide the basis for utilizing the advanced zzso and molecular techniques of zzso to address complex aspects of zzso expression and zzso
