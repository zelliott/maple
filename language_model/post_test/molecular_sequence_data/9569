A sensitive zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso zzso was developed for the rapid detection of zzso virus zzso zzso The reaction was performed in one step in a single tube at zzso for 45 zzso with zzso Green I dye added prior to zzso The detection limit of the zzso zzso was approximately 10 zzso and no zzso with other avian viruses was zzso The zzso was evaluated further for the diagnosis of zzso in field samples and compared with conventional zzso demonstrating that results of the zzso zzso corresponded to those of conventional zzso In conclusion, zzso with zzso Green I dye was shown to be a sensitive, simple zzso for the rapid diagnosis of zzso infection in zzso
