zzso methods were developed for zzso zzso of human zzso zzso for use in clinical settings where prospective parents are at high risk for transmission of zzso zzso Using single cultured cells and zzso from human zzso as model systems, a multiplex protocol was developed for rapid analysis via zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso gene segments from both X and Y zzso as well as zzso zzso repetitive zzso Each cell was manually isolated and individually washed to avoid potential zzso zzso amplification allowed recognition of zzso amplification failures specific to particular zzso zzso zzso The zzso internal control and multiple zzso markers allowed recognition and exclusion of most zzso samples, thus averting potential zzso The zzso zzso protocol reduced experimental zzso errors to zzso zzso zzso but also revealed potential pitfalls of zzso zzso With human zzso zzso separate sampling of individual zzso provided zzso female or male zzso Slight modification adapted the procedure for diagnosis of biopsy material from zzso stage zzso allowing separate analysis of multiple tubes containing multiple cells for improved zzso
