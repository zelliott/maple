The constant region of the human gamma 1 chain was zzso either by deleting the second domain zzso or by mutating the two hinge region zzso zzso normally involved in the zzso chain zzso bond formation, to zzso The effects of these zzso on chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso were measured after expressing the human constant regions together with mouse variable regions zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to have increased zzso binding activity and little zzso or no zzso biological zzso The zzso to zzso hinge region zzso zzso had normal or slightly reduced zzso binding activity, greatly reduced zzso activity, and a reduced, but still zzso ability to mediate zzso These results reflect the complexity of the interactions between the zzso zzso and their role in balancing the zzso binding and zzso functions of zzso They suggest further that such zzso may be useful in applications, such as the in zzso imaging of tumors, where the loss of zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
