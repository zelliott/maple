The effects of the zzso peptides zzso and zzso on the expression of the insulin gene in isolated adult rat zzso of zzso were zzso zzso rat zzso were maintained under various culture conditions for 26 zzso The contents of zzso zzso zzso and the amounts of zzso zzso were zzso In the presence of 5 zzso zzso the zzso zzso content was increased by zzso M zzso to zzso zzso less than zzso and by zzso to zzso zzso less than zzso of the control without zzso The zzso zzso content was raised in the presence of 5 zzso zzso by zzso M zzso These results corresponded with an increase in the zzso zzso under the same zzso The zzso of zzso was strongly decreased by zzso D at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that there is a zzso stimulation of the insulin gene expression by zzso and that the increase in zzso zzso in isolated pancreatic zzso by zzso zzso peptides occurs mainly on the zzso zzso
