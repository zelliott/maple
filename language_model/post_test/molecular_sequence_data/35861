The metabolism and mode of action of zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied and compared with those of zzso In zzso zzso cells, low zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso were occasionally just zzso the limit of detection being about 1 zzso zzso In contrast, in cells infected with either zzso zzso virus type 2 zzso or zzso virus zzso zzso was zzso quickly to give high zzso of the zzso zzso Following the removal of zzso from the culture zzso zzso remained trapped within the cells for a long time zzso 20 and 7 h in zzso and zzso cells, zzso In zzso cells, zzso was zzso to a lesser extent and the zzso of the zzso zzso was only 1 zzso We were unable to detect any zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso DNA zzso competitively with zzso the Ki values being zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas for zzso the Ki value was zzso zzso for the two zzso Both compounds had relatively low levels of activity against the cellular DNA zzso zzso with Ki values of 175 and zzso zzso zzso zzso did inhibit DNA synthesis by zzso DNA zzso with a defined zzso although it was not an zzso chain zzso like zzso These results provide a zzso rationale for the highly selective and effective zzso of zzso and zzso DNA synthesis by zzso and for the greater activity of zzso than that of zzso when zzso cells were treated for a short zzso
