A zzso zzso zzso having a strong zzso forming potential in the zzso state was designed to interact with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso On the basis of this concept a cluster of four zzso acid zzso was inserted in the central region of the zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso by mutual charge zzso at neutral zzso zzso of these zzso might then bring about both a zzso change in zzso and zzso forming a zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso produced by the design strategy induced zzso zzso of human zzso A molecular model zzso the zzso activity to the formation of zzso pores which were detected by electron zzso in zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso studies indicated a zzso of the zzso random zzso form with increasing zzso concentration leading to the apparent induction of strong zzso formation zzso zzso zzso in the fully zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso zzso transition was observed, zzso that zzso zzso and zzso interactions not only govern the zzso but also decisively influence the zzso stability of the zzso
