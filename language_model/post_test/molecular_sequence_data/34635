The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comprise a host of zzso proteins that are zzso by a gene zzso and a zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso studies of certain zzso zzso have linked their zzso functions to important zzso such as the zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a correspondence has been observed between resistance to zzso zzso as zzso elevated zzso levels in resistant zzso Such zzso recurring connections suggest that these zzso genes may feature in a model for the development of zzso zzso We have amassed substantial zzso support for relating the zzso of a particular zzso gene to zzso resistance but are still short of solid genetic evidence to affirm a zzso zzso With the zzso system, we have at our disposal genetic and molecular techniques such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso technology, and versatile transgenic zzso We can use these methods to effect zzso and zzso conditions and, in these rendered zzso study other potentially important functions of the zzso gene zzso An immediate problem that comes to mind is the possible zzso relationship between zzso zzso specificity and chemical resistance zzso In this chapter, we present an analysis of selected strategies and laboratory methods that may be useful in pursuing a variety of interesting zzso We will cover three kinds of zzso zzso and zzso important instruments in a zzso for studies of the zzso zzso zzso We make the case that these approaches zzso zzso and zzso have helped us gain important insights and can continue to help the community gain a more complete understanding of the biological functions of zzso Such knowledge may be key in addressing questions about the zzso of pesticides and how zzso stresses affect life zzso We hope that these techniques will prove fruitful in studying a host of other zzso functions as zzso
