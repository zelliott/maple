In addition to their effects on zzso surface tension, some components of lung zzso also have zzso zzso We found recently that the zzso lung zzso protein zzso specifically binds to the zzso A region of zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso also interacts with zzso Four observations showed cross talk between the three molecules zzso zzso and zzso zzso Like zzso zzso allows the binding of a fluorescent zzso to cells expressing zzso (the other zzso components were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (or a synthetic analog of zzso interact in a zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks the binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances the binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso These results, obtained with native zzso zzso and with three synthetic zzso suggest that zzso and zzso interact with the same region of zzso and that binding of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso or the accessibility of its zzso site, allowing it to bind zzso This ability of zzso to interact with the pattern recognition zzso zzso extends the possible zzso targets of zzso to a large panel of zzso that can enter the zzso
