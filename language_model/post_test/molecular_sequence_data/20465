The zzso water is the main source of bacterial contamination of paper zzso Identification of these bacterial zzso could be an asset in developing specific control zzso An amplified zzso DNA restriction analysis zzso was carried out to characterize the bacterial communities associated with the zzso water of a paper machine in a Canadian mill in February and July zzso Eight bacterial zzso were identified as the main zzso present in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso appeared to be the dominant bacterial group in the Canadian paper zzso Some variation was observed between the February and July clone zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso were only detected in February or in July, zzso Furthermore, the proportion of zzso clones in the libraries was higher in July than in zzso The zzso profile of the February and July communities, determined using zzso zzso also suggested that zzso variation occurred within the bacterial populations that zzso the zzso of the paper zzso
