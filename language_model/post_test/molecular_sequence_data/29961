The transforming protein zzso by the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is thought to be involved in the regulation of gene zzso The zzso region of the zzso protein is composed of two highly zzso tandem repeat sequences of unknown zzso It has been speculated that the zzso zzso repeats might be crucial for zzso since zzso deletions destroy the zzso activity of the zzso zzso Here, we have studied the zzso zzso domain in more zzso Our results show that the zzso region of the zzso protein is sufficient for specific zzso zzso of this region suggests that both repeats are required for zzso but that both repeats play different roles in zzso protein DNA zzso We also show that the zzso repeats of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso function as zzso zzso zzso Our results support the view that specific zzso zzso by the zzso zzso repeats, is a general feature of zzso zzso
