The binding of iron by zzso leads to a significant zzso change in each lobe of the zzso Numerous studies have shown that the zzso zzso discriminates between zzso and zzso zzso and that it zzso the release of zzso Given these zzso it seems likely that there is contact between each lobe of zzso and the zzso This is the case with chicken zzso in which it has been demonstrated zzso that both zzso are required for binding and iron donation to occur zzso and Woodworth (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further support to this contention is added by the ability of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso to block the binding of a solution containing both zzso zzso Brown and Church zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study a similar conclusion is reached for the binding of human serum zzso to the zzso zzso With the use of zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso produced in a zzso expression system, we show that both zzso are required to achieve full zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the baby zzso kidney cell system is reported here for the first zzso Each lobe is able to donate iron to zzso receptors on zzso zzso cells in the presence of the zzso zzso The results are not identical with the chicken system, because the zzso alone shows a limited ability to bind to receptors and to donate zzso Further complications arise from the relatively weak zzso between the two zzso of human zzso compared with the zzso of the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso to either lobe block the binding of zzso and zzso zzso in the human system, thus zzso the need for zzso
