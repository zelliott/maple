We present here the characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is closely related to zzso Both zzso and zzso transcripts are present in the embryonic axis of zzso dry zzso The patterns of zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso genes are strongly zzso Both genes are expressed at higher levels in zzso of zzso zzso plants compared to zzso from plants grown under zzso zzso When zzso plants are exposed to continuous white light, differential changes in the steady state levels of the zzso and zzso zzso from zzso are zzso These changes are accompanied by an zzso of zzso zzso
