The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by random, zzso zzso A circular sequence of zzso zzso was zzso One hundred zzso open reading frames zzso were predicted using zzso and zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA zzso The overall zzso content of the zzso is zzso The most recognizable feature of the zzso is a zzso zzso defined by a zzso region that is bordered by zzso zzso elements at each zzso This region contains the three toxin genes zzso zzso and zzso regulatory elements controlling the toxin zzso three zzso response zzso and 19 additional zzso Nearly zzso of the zzso on zzso do not have significant similarity to sequences available in open zzso Absent from the zzso sequence are zzso to genes that are typically required to drive zzso replication and to maintain stability of large plasmids in zzso zzso Among the zzso with a high degree of similarity to known sequences are a collection of putative zzso zzso and zzso suggesting an evolution involving lateral movement of DNA among zzso Among the remaining zzso there are three sequences that may zzso zzso responsible for the synthesis of a zzso capsule usually associated with zzso virulent zzso
