zzso zzso has multiple stress response systems whose integrated action promotes growth and survival under zzso zzso Here we address the function and zzso organization of a zzso cluster containing zzso previously known to be important for growth at high temperature because of the role of its zzso product in rescuing stalled zzso zzso zzso experiments detected a single message for the zzso zzso suggesting that it constitutes an zzso However, rapid amplification of zzso zzso and zzso fusion experiments indicated that zzso zzso is complex, with at least five promoters controlling different segments of the zzso One zzso promoter preceded zzso zzso and internal zzso promoters were found in both the zzso zzso and zzso intervals zzso and zzso Another internal promoter lay in the zzso zzso region, and this activity zzso was dependent on the general stress factor zzso zzso zzso in the four genes downstream from zzso were tested for their effects on zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso caused no obvious zzso By contrast, zzso was required for growth at high temperature zzso degrees zzso as anticipated if its product (a small zzso binding zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also required for growth at low temperature (16 degrees zzso a zzso not previously associated with zzso zzso These results extend the known zzso role of zzso and indicate that the zzso rescue system is important at both extremes of the zzso zzso temperature zzso
