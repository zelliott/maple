zzso of muscle zzso DNA zzso have recently been found in patients with zzso zzso However, as most of the described cases were zzso and individual deletions involved different portions of zzso the zzso producing the molecular zzso as well as their mode of transmission, remain zzso By studying families with zzso zzso valuable information can be obtained about the role of zzso factors in the zzso of these zzso We have studied four members of a family with zzso dominant zzso zzso Multiple zzso involving the same portion of muscle zzso were identified in all zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso performed after DNA amplification by the zzso reaction showed that all the deletions start within a zzso stretch at the zzso end of the zzso region, a site of active communication between the nucleus and the zzso The data indicate that a zzso of a zzso protein can destroy the integrity of the zzso zzso in a specific, zzso zzso
