To help understand the mechanisms of gene zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso insects, we zzso the zzso zzso of the plague zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is zzso zzso zzso long, and has many unusual features, including zzso zzso genes zzso and distant from one another, zzso an extra gene for zzso zzso a zzso lacking a zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso duplicate control regions, and zzso zzso and/or zzso of 24 of the 37 zzso The mechanism of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso may be different from that of other zzso since the two zzso genes have zzso and are distant from one zzso Further, the zzso genes are not adjacent or even close to either of the two control zzso zzso zzso and deletion is a plausible model for the evolution of duplicate control regions and for the gene zzso but zzso zzso may account for the gene zzso in zzso zzso All the 18 genes between control regions zzso and zzso have zzso and/or zzso whereas only six of the 20 genes outside this region have zzso and/or zzso Moreover, the extra zzso gene and the two zzso genes are either in this region or immediately adjacent to one of the control zzso These observations suggest that tandem zzso and deletion may be facilitated by the duplicate control regions and may have occurred a number of times in the lineage leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso shares two novel gene boundaries with a zzso species from another order of zzso insects, the zzso The evidence available suggests that these shared gene boundaries evolved by convergence and thus are not zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We discuss the potential of zzso insects as a model system for studies of the evolution of animal zzso zzso and outline some fundamental questions that may be addressed with this zzso
