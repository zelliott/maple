We have cloned the gene cluster zzso three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli by performing a zzso zzso The positive clone converted zzso to zzso zzso in the culture zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso clone revealed that the cloned zzso contained the complete structural genes for a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso c zzso and a zzso zzso of unknown function and that the genes were clustered with the same zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences and the zzso sequences determined for the zzso protein indicated that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained typical signal peptides of 22, 19, and 42 zzso zzso zzso The molecular masses of the processed zzso deduced from the zzso sequences zzso 45, and 20 zzso coincided well with the molecular masses of zzso estimated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli, the zzso was zzso formed and the activity of zzso was enhanced more than twofold by addition of zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli was zzso by addition of zzso zzso to the culture zzso and the conversion of zzso or zzso to zzso by zzso zzso coli harboring the cloned zzso gene was attempted in batch zzso The conversion yields for zzso were zzso zzso of zzso of zzso after 16 h of zzso and those for zzso were zzso zzso of zzso of zzso after 12 h of zzso
