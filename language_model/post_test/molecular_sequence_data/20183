The assembly of the Z ring is the earliest step in bacterial cell zzso In zzso coli this assembly requires either zzso or zzso which bind to a zzso zzso 17 zzso acid motif in zzso and to the zzso The zzso interaction is well zzso however, nothing is known about the region of zzso involved in the interaction with zzso even though the zzso interaction is nearly ubiquitous in zzso zzso is proposed to bind to the membrane through its zzso zzso zzso zzso before efficiently interacting with zzso Based upon this model we designed a genetic screen to identify zzso specifically impaired for the zzso zzso The zzso obtained retain the ability to be targeted to the membrane but fail to be recruited to the Z ring or interact with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These zzso do not complement an zzso zzso Through this approach we have identified a region of zzso containing some zzso zzso which is required for binding to zzso The results support our model that zzso is targeted to the membrane before it interacts with zzso and demonstrates that this interaction plays an essential role in zzso coli cell zzso
