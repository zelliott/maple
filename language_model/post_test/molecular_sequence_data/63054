zzso the respiratory protein of zzso and zzso was found to function against bacterial and zzso zzso In this study, we show that this protein complex could delay the infection of white spot syndrome virus zzso in zzso and cloned two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso from the shrimp zzso zzso Further investigation of their zzso regulation during viral invasion showed that in contrast to zzso zzso zzso expression could be strongly induced by zzso zzso These findings not only reveal an important role of zzso in shrimp zzso defense but also suggest a possible zzso between the two zzso in shrimp innate zzso
