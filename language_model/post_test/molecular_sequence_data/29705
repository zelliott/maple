Mice have a zzso high density zzso zzso profile, whereas humans have two major zzso designated zzso and zzso Human zzso transgenic mice exhibit a zzso HDL profile, indicating that the zzso acid sequence of zzso is a zzso of the HDL zzso zzso of the primary sequence of mouse and human zzso and the previously designated zzso domain of zzso led us to zzso that zzso 7 and 8 zzso are zzso of HDL zzso zzso The following proteins were expressed in zzso zzso human zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso human zzso containing zzso zzso zzso in place of human zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins were examined for their association with human plasma HDL zzso The results demonstrated that zzso bound zzso and zzso equally well, whereas zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso behaved like zzso and zzso behaved like zzso Thus, zzso zzso are strong contributors to the pattern of HDL zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso activity of the zzso proteins were also zzso Human zzso zzso more and activates human zzso zzso better than mouse zzso These differential characteristics of human and mouse zzso are not dependent on zzso zzso
