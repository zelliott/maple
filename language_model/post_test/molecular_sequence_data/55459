zzso of the human stomach with zzso zzso is a risk factor for zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso and gastric zzso The zzso zzso toxin is an important zzso zzso zzso factor that causes multiple zzso in gastric zzso cells and T zzso Several families of zzso zzso have been zzso and zzso zzso strains containing certain zzso types zzso zzso and zzso are associated with an increased risk of gastric disease, compared to strains containing other zzso types zzso zzso and zzso Thus far, there has been relatively little study of the role of the zzso intermediate region zzso in toxin zzso In this study, we compared the ability of zzso and zzso forms of zzso to cause functional zzso in zzso zzso To do this, we manipulated the zzso zzso gene in two zzso zzso strains to introduce zzso in the region zzso the zzso zzso We did not detect any differences in the capacity of zzso and zzso forms of zzso to cause zzso of zzso zzso In comparison to zzso forms of zzso zzso forms of zzso had a diminished capacity to inhibit the zzso of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso and suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso bound to zzso cells less avidly than did zzso forms of zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is an important zzso of zzso effects on human T cell zzso
