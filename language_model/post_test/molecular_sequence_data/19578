We studied a series of 42 cases of zzso of the great arteries zzso a complex heart zzso zzso that is two times more prevalent in males than in zzso A zzso in the X zzso at the zzso gene was found in two affected siblings (one male, one zzso and their unaffected zzso A second factor, skewed zzso pattern explained the zzso between the zzso zzso In this family, the zzso zzso zzso was found in the first zinc finger of zzso a domain that is relatively specific to each of the five human zzso zzso It was tested further along with two other zzso of this domain zzso and zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso expressed lower protein levels, and an increased protein degradation zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso had a decreased zzso zzso of the zzso reporter zzso Nuclear zzso of the three zzso zzso varied considerably depending on the experimental zzso Finally, zzso and zzso showed diminished activities for both zzso axis zzso and neural crest induction in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso in the first zinc finger of zzso mildly affect several functions of the zzso
