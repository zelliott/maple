zzso mosaic virus zzso is an emerging pathogen that causes severe economic losses in tomato crops zzso zzso zzso in the Northern hemisphere, despite persistent attempts of zzso In fact, it is considered one of the most significant viral diseases for tomato production worldwide, and it may constitute a good model for the analysis of virus emergence in zzso We have combined a population zzso approach with an analysis of in zzso properties of virus strains to explain an observed zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso populations are composed of zzso of two types zzso and zzso that zzso The zzso type zzso are zzso however, zzso zzso have not been displaced but persist mainly in mixed zzso Two zzso cloned zzso belonging to each type have been used to examine the dynamics of in zzso single infections and zzso revealing that the zzso type has a higher fitness than the zzso zzso zzso expand the range of susceptible zzso and zzso plants remain zzso several weeks after infection, so a potentially important problem for disease prevention and zzso These results provide an explanation of the observed zzso pattern in terms of genetic and ecological interactions among the different viral zzso Thus, mixed infections appear to be contributing to shaping the genetic structure and dynamics of zzso zzso
