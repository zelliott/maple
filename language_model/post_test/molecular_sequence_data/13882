To identify zzso in the rat zzso zzso critical for binding the zzso zzso zzso we systematically replaced 12 segments zzso zzso of the zzso zzso surface with the corresponding segments of the zzso rat zzso zzso and screened the resulting zzso in zzso cells for altered zzso binding zzso Surface expression of zzso receptors was assessed by the binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Of the nine well expressed and therefore zzso zzso zzso four bound zzso zzso at levels that were zzso to the corresponding levels of surface zzso whereas five zzso bound zzso to levels that were lower than predicted from the cell surface expression zzso These five zzso occurred at the zzso zzso end of zzso domain 1, the zzso portion of the first zzso loop, the second zzso loop, and the third zzso zzso We selected for further fine structure analysis the third zzso zzso two specific zzso zzso and zzso were identified at which zzso caused zzso to zzso reductions in zzso zzso The same zzso had little or no effect on the binding affinity of zzso This study provides new information on the location of zzso zzso regions important for high affinity zzso binding and identifies two zzso in the third zzso loop which may contribute to interactions involving the zzso critical zzso zzso
