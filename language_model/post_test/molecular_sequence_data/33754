To zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso social zzso we identified a novel zzso zzso whose expression in the worker brain changes according to the zzso division of zzso in normal zzso The open reading frames contained in the zzso zzso were not zzso in the zzso of a related species, suggesting that the zzso gene product is a zzso zzso The distribution of zzso cells partially overlapped that of zzso cells and zzso cells, the latter of which are involved in the synthesis and zzso of juvenile hormone zzso zzso and zzso control worker task transition, and thus zzso might be involved in task transition through the zzso of zzso synthesis and zzso
