zzso elements important for zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene have been identified by analysis of a series of zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso Fusion genes containing zzso and zzso zzso promoter sequences from zzso to zzso base pairs zzso fused to the coding sequence for zzso zzso were zzso Internal deletion zzso that replaced specific bases with a zzso zzso within the region from zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso promoter were zzso In addition, zzso and zzso DNA templates were used as zzso in zzso I protection experiments to determine sites of zzso zzso The zzso promoter contains a binding site for nuclear factor zzso zzso of the zzso end of this binding site reduced the size of the zzso I footprint in this region but had no effect on promoter zzso In contrast, deletion or disruption of the 3' end of this binding site completely eliminated protein binding and reduced promoter activity by zzso zzso of core sequences of the zzso regulatory element zzso resulted in loss of zzso responsiveness and an zzso decrease in zzso promoter activity, indicating that the zzso also functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the core sequence of the zzso resulted in loss of the zzso I footprint over the zzso Internal deletions zzso the zzso showed no loss of induction by zzso but did have reduced promoter zzso This zzso the zzso to an zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso that disrupted bases between the zzso and the initiation site identified a zzso zzso element adjacent to a zzso zzso element, both located just 3' of the zzso as well as a zzso zzso element zzso with the zzso consensus sequence centered at zzso These data demonstrate that several zzso elements are located within 130 zzso of the initiation site of the zzso gene and that the zzso is essential for both zzso promoter activity and zzso expression of this zzso
