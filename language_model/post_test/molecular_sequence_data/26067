Sea zzso zzso vary considerably in their affinities for sodium channels occurring in different excitable zzso The zzso acid sequence variation in a set of six sea zzso type I zzso toxins zzso zzso zzso was zzso using zzso scales zzso zzso and zzso derived from a large number of zzso acid zzso zzso The pharmacological properties of the toxins were represented by the results from four zzso on zzso zzso and rat brain and from rat zzso By means of the zzso scales and the zzso data zzso method zzso zzso least squares projections to zzso zzso it was possible to develop quantitative zzso relationships zzso Using the zzso derived from the set of six zzso toxins the pharmacological properties of two zzso sea zzso zzso toxins were zzso Thus it is shown that zzso may be formulated for relatively long zzso zzso The zzso indicate that 11 different zzso acid positions may be of importance, but that positions zzso 5, 21, 28, 34, 37, and 40 were of main importance in modeling the relative zzso of the six zzso
