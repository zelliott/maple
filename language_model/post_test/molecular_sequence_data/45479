Two full-length zzso zzso delta zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the brain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previous work from our laboratory describing the cloning of zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso delta zzso shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity with a zzso delta zzso and lower zzso identity with zzso receptors cloned from zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso shares zzso sequence identity with a zzso zzso zzso zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso receptors cloned from zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso delta zzso possessed a single, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding site for the zzso zzso zzso zzso In competition binding zzso the zzso delta zzso displayed highest affinity for zzso relatively low affinity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso in zzso and very low affinity for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso also possessed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso site that showed highest affinity for zzso zzso affinity for zzso and zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso in zzso and very low affinity for zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells expressing either zzso type zzso or zzso showed very high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses the same four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso receptors found in other zzso classes, but zzso selectivity appears less stringent in the zzso than has been documented in zzso
