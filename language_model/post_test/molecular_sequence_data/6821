Comparisons of the zzso zzso and zzso sequences of small round structured viruses zzso have recently shown these are genetically diverse viruses which fall into two distinct zzso The zzso of two group I zzso Southampton and Norwalk viruses have been zzso however, similar data for the genetic group II zzso have not been available until zzso We report here the complete zzso sequence of a recent group II zzso zzso zzso The zzso virus zzso is zzso zzso in length and has a similar organization to the group I zzso The large zzso in the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso is shorter than the group I zzso zzso zzso zzso but has the characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the structural protein is of a similar size to the group I viruses but the small zzso zzso is significantly larger in group zzso A highly zzso sequence of 28 zzso was identified at the start of zzso virus zzso and repeated at the start of zzso These zzso motifs are typical of the animal zzso zzso of the 150 zzso zzso acids in the zzso protein revealed little identity between the two zzso genetic groups, reflecting the shorter zzso in the group II zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso sequences were constructed and used to express large quantities of the group II zzso virus structural zzso The zzso protein formed zzso particles by self assembly which resembled zzso zzso
