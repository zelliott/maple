In a previous paper, we demonstrated that a gene coding for a protein zzso to the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso proteins occurs in zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso encodes a protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated Mr of zzso Here we report the isolation of another zzso zzso zzso which encodes an zzso acid sequence of 449 zzso acid zzso with a Mr of zzso The predicted primary structure of the zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso to zzso G proteins zzso and zzso G proteins zzso and zzso respectively), a G protein of unknown function zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso When aligned with the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso to obtain zzso zzso zzso alpha was found to contain a stretch of 83 additional zzso acid zzso near the zzso zzso The gene was mapped in zzso zzso close to the zzso zzso cells carrying a disrupted zzso gene are zzso zzso carrying a high copy number of zzso zzso zzso had markedly elevated levels of zzso and could suppress a zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso levels in zzso zzso
