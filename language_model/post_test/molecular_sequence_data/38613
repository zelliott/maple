zzso is a core zzso of zzso zzso II zzso zzso specifically zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of this protein profoundly affect cell zzso cell zzso and zzso in zzso Here we describe zzso a novel human protein that interacts with zzso zzso possesses a domain of high zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso final zzso 70 and zzso large T zzso In addition, we report that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso gene zzso by two distinct zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso the growth suppression function of zzso zzso the zzso action of zzso on the zzso function of zzso These results identify a novel protein that binds zzso and the core of pol II, and suggest that zzso may be part of zzso regulatory zzso
