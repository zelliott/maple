The zzso system, zzso and zzso of zzso coli enable certain proteins to fold under conditions when spontaneous folding is zzso slow as to compete with other zzso channels such as zzso We investigated the plausible mechanisms of zzso folding using simple lattice zzso In particular, we have investigated protein folding in a confined environment, such as those offered by the zzso to decipher whether rate and yield enhancement can occur when the zzso protein is allowed to fold within the cavity of the zzso The zzso cavity is modeled as a cubic box and a simple zzso model is used to represent the zzso zzso We consider three distinct characteristic of the zzso zzso First, the cavity is taken to be a passive zzso cage in which the walls merely reduce the available zzso zzso We find that at temperatures when the native zzso is stable, the folding rate is retarded in the zzso zzso We then assumed that the interior of the wall is zzso In this case the folding times exhibit a complex zzso When the strength of the interaction between the zzso chain and the cavity is too strong or too weak we find that the rates of folding are retarded compared to spontaneous zzso There is an optimum range of the interaction strength that enhances the zzso Thus, above this value there is an inverse correlation between the folding rates and the strength of the zzso zzso The optimal zzso walls essentially pull the zzso trapped states which leads to a zzso the energy zzso It is known that upon addition of zzso and zzso the interior cavity of zzso offers a zzso environment to the zzso zzso In order to mimic this within the context of the dynamic zzso cage model, we allow for changes in the zzso of the walls of the zzso The duration for which the walls remain zzso during one cycle of zzso zzso is allowed to zzso These calculations show that frequent cycling of the wall zzso can dramatically reduce the folding times and increase the yield as well under zzso zzso zzso of the structures of the zzso proteins before and after the change in zzso indicates that there is global unfolding zzso In addition, it is found that a fraction of the molecules zzso partition to the native state in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Thus, frequent zzso activity of zzso leading to global unfolding of the zzso chain results in enhancement of the folding rates and yield of the folded zzso We suggest that zzso efficiency can be greatly enhanced if the cycling time is zzso The calculations are used to interpret a few experiments on zzso protein zzso
