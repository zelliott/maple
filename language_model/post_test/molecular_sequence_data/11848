The therapeutic action of zzso zzso drugs zzso is exerted through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed as two zzso termed zzso and zzso From the crystal structure of sheep zzso it has been proposed that the zzso acid group of zzso is located in a favorable position for interacting with the zzso 120 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso to zzso was performed and expressed in zzso cells using a zzso virus expression zzso zzso of zzso zzso preparations show that the zzso results in a zzso reduction in the specific activity of zzso and in a zzso increase in the apparent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso activity containing a free zzso acid group, do not exhibit any zzso effects against the activity of zzso zzso and zzso acid, other zzso containing a free zzso acid group, were zzso less potent zzso of the activity of the zzso as compared with the wild type zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso analogue of zzso zzso were both more potent zzso of zzso than of the wild zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso as observed for the wild type zzso indicating that the zzso does not alter the basic mechanism of zzso Aspirin is an acid zzso that zzso zzso through a unique zzso zzso of the zzso and also showed a reduced rate of zzso of the zzso zzso These data provide zzso evidence of the importance of the zzso zzso in zzso for interaction with zzso acid and zzso containing a free zzso acid zzso
