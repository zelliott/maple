In zzso and higher plants, separate genes zzso the zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso In contrast, although zzso II activity has been detected both in the zzso and zzso of zzso only a single gene zzso zzso II has been zzso Previously it was thought that this gene (the zzso zzso zzso comprised 8 zzso that are transcribed into zzso and that the resulting zzso species zzso a single zzso form of zzso zzso Here we show that this gene gives rise to two distinct zzso species transcribed from 9 and 10 zzso zzso The zzso transcript encodes two protein zzso zzso targeted zzso II, which is initiated from an zzso zzso in a previously zzso part of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso II, which is initiated by internal zzso entry at a downstream zzso zzso The transcript zzso from 10 zzso has an zzso termination zzso between the two initiating zzso zzso and hence only encodes the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso targeted form of zzso II is directed to the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso II zzso sequences from a number of species indicates that dual initiation from alternative zzso zzso is zzso throughout zzso
