In this paper we report the cloning and sequence analysis of four zzso located on zzso zzso which are involved in the synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are coupled to form zzso zzso which is then zzso to make zzso zzso The first open reading frame zzso product, of 610 zzso has significant zzso zzso zzso with the product of zzso from zzso coli, which is involved in the synthesis of zzso The second zzso product, of zzso zzso is the product of a novel gene zzso zzso A protein motif involved in zzso zzso zzso binding was found in the zzso part of zzso also, zzso involved in the zzso site of zzso acid zzso are zzso in zzso suggesting that it zzso the zzso zzso of some intermediate of zzso zzso The third zzso product, of 323 zzso has significant zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso coli, which is involved in the synthesis of the zzso The fourth zzso product, of 204 zzso has significant zzso zzso zzso with the product of zzso from zzso coli, which is involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso induced by a single zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso in zzso occurred within a zzso region which is highly zzso in all of the zzso promoters analyzed and promotes zzso expression of zzso zzso extension analysis showed that zzso zzso in strain zzso originates within the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso protein content and expression of the zzso zzso which codes for the symbiotic terminal zzso zzso revealed that zzso produces the zzso terminal zzso These data show a direct relationship between expression of zzso and production of the zzso terminal zzso This is consistent with the proposition that a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative zzso of the production of the symbiotic terminal zzso zzso in zzso zzso
