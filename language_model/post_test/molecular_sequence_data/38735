A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso its zzso was cloned and characterized as having a single open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso specifying zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of the deduced zzso sequence of the zzso protein indicated that characteristics of three consensus sequences and a zzso motif in the zzso protein of zzso zzso a zzso zzso involving a zzso replication zzso were zzso in those of zzso zzso zzso a zzso structure was produced in the zzso zzso by introducing zzso DNA into the zzso zzso zzso This result strongly suggests that zzso is a zzso zzso and probably replicates by a zzso replication zzso By using the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso that could replicate in both zzso coli and zzso zzso was constructed and found to be a useful cloning shuttle zzso
