We analyzed a case of zzso zzso zzso primary gastric diffuse large zzso zzso zzso with areas of zzso marginal zone zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso tissue zzso type in a zzso male zzso The patient had two separate tumors, in the corpus and in the zzso each showing two zzso distinct components zzso and zzso of zzso zzso To determine the zzso relationship between the zzso and zzso zzso we zzso four samples from zzso distinct tumor components at both tumor zzso zzso analysis revealed rearranged zzso heavy chain zzso genes of different sizes in three of the four zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso products displayed different zzso gene zzso in the two small cell components of the zzso and the zzso A third genuinely differently rearranged zzso gene was found in the zzso components of both zzso and zzso Our results suggest that in primary gastric zzso with areas of zzso of zzso type, the zzso component may comprise more than one tumor zzso Furthermore, the zzso component may evolve independently from zzso zzso
