zzso is a critical requirement for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The single zzso zzso zzso of zzso contribute to zzso but the details are not well zzso Work with TM zzso in various model systems has revealed a small number of specific zzso sequence zzso and it has been suggested that zzso zzso is modulated by such zzso Yet questions remain about the zzso of these sequence motifs for zzso zzso and about how TM domain zzso in model systems relates to zzso zzso in zzso zzso To investigate these questions, we designed a zzso zzso zzso library based on the TM domain of zzso zzso as a model zzso The library contains many closely zzso zzso zzso including thousands of sequences with known zzso zzso We used an zzso screen to select peptides that zzso better than the native zzso zzso and we zzso the zzso of zzso zzso receptors in zzso cells with TM sequences selected in the zzso Despite the very high abundance of known zzso motifs in the library, only a very few zzso sequences were identified by zzso About half of those sequences activated the zzso zzso significantly more than did the zzso TM zzso This work zzso our knowledge about the requirements for membrane protein interactions and the requirements for zzso zzso in zzso
