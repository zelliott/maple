The crystal structure of zzso type zzso inhibitor zzso from peanut was refined at zzso A resolution using a restrained zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso for zzso reflections with F zzso 3 zzso zzso in the range from zzso to zzso A zzso Two molecules in an zzso unit are independently refined and, their structures are compared with each zzso The inhibitor zzso has an zzso shape with two zzso sites, one at both ends of the longest zzso As a secondary structure, a zzso zzso structure is found, in which two water molecules bind two zzso zzso together with six hydrogen zzso The zzso is constructed by two zzso zzso which are related by an zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure and atomic zzso of zzso zzso containing a zzso site were compared with that of zzso bean zzso type inhibitor in the complex with bovine zzso This comparison shows that no significant structural change occurs in the zzso site of inhibitor at the formation of the zzso complex, but structural rigidity around the zzso site seems to zzso
