zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso and zzso have a similar domain structure and contain four zzso regulatory motifs that serve as anchors for the binding of the zzso zzso of specific zzso alpha zzso As an initial approach to define further the different functional roles of zzso and zzso we determined their expression profile and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated a widespread tissue distribution of zzso whereas zzso is primarily enriched in zzso Brain punch zzso of 13 discrete brain regions indicated that both zzso and zzso are expressed in all areas tested but are zzso regulated during zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso cultures, whereas zzso expression is restricted to zzso In primary zzso cultures as well as in dividing cultures of zzso cells, zzso indicated distinct zzso locations of zzso and zzso The zzso locations of the two proteins were zzso regulated by external stimuli and the cell zzso In zzso and zzso cells, zzso moves from the nucleus to the zzso structure separating daughter cells during the later stages of zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso Thus, although zzso and zzso share a similar overall motif structure and both bind zzso nature has endowed these proteins with different regulatory elements that allow functional diversity by virtue of zzso expression and zzso zzso
