zzso zzso zzso has previously been reported to degrade zzso and zzso by a zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso and a gene cluster channeling various zzso into an zzso zzso route has been zzso We now report that during growth on zzso besides a novel zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso which showed features not yet reported, was zzso This zzso which was practically inactive with zzso evolved for the turnover of zzso zzso and zzso zzso into equal amounts of zzso and zzso suggesting that it is a functional intermediate between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were located in a zzso zzso region clustered with genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a putative regulatory zzso zzso zzso to regulators of the zzso zzso Thus, this region includes genes sufficient to enable zzso to transform zzso to zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso are only zzso related to previously described zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso and the previously identified zzso rather than zzso are crucial for zzso zzso Thus, zzso uses zzso zzso by a completely novel gene cluster for degradation of zzso which, together with a gene cluster zzso zzso for channeling zzso into the zzso pathway, form an effective zzso for zzso and zzso zzso
