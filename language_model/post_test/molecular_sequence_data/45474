The zzso coli zzso channel zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inner membrane protein in which each zzso has 11 zzso zzso We have shown that the structural gene zzso encodes a zzso with a signal zzso that is zzso off to produce a zzso with the zzso in the zzso and the zzso in the zzso zzso of the signal zzso coding region results in significantly lower levels of zzso zzso in the membrane but modification of the signal zzso zzso site, leading to zzso zzso does not prevent zzso formation and does not zzso the zzso The presence of a signal zzso is apparently not a zzso feature of all zzso zzso zzso zzso of predicted zzso sequences suggests that while zzso proteins in zzso organisms zzso a signal zzso the zzso proteins in zzso organisms do zzso
