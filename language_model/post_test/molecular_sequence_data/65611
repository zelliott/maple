zzso parallel sequencing instruments enable rapid and inexpensive DNA sequence data zzso Because these instruments are new, their data require characterization with respect to accuracy and zzso To address this, we zzso a zzso zzso zzso Bristol strain isolate using the zzso zzso zzso and compared the reads to the reference zzso to characterize the data and to evaluate coverage and zzso zzso parallel sequencing zzso zzso comparison for zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso to the zzso sequences produced, we developed a revised approach to determine the regions of the zzso to which short reads could be uniquely zzso We then aligned zzso reads from zzso zzso strain zzso to the reference, and screened for zzso zzso zzso and small zzso This study demonstrates the utility of zzso parallel short read sequencing for whole zzso zzso and for accurate discovery of zzso zzso
