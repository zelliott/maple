A zzso zzso able to facilitate zzso movements of zzso in zzso has been zzso to zzso from sunflower zzso This zzso which has the properties of a zzso protein zzso is also able to bind zzso as shown by zzso zzso This finding, in addition to previous observations suggesting that a zzso protein from spinach leaves can bind zzso acid and that zzso zzso contain a fatty zzso protein with similar features than zzso transfer zzso provides a clear demonstration that plant cells contain zzso fatty zzso transfer zzso These proteins can play an active role in fatty acid metabolism which involves movements of zzso between zzso zzso
