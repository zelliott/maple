In general, proteins fold with zzso zzso zzso away from zzso zzso protein folding due to zzso interactions results from inverse temperature transitions where folding occurs on raising the zzso Because zzso animals constitute an infinite heat zzso it is the transition temperature, zzso not the zzso heat of the transition, that determines the zzso folded state of zzso at body zzso zzso here is a new zzso scale based on the values of zzso for each zzso acid zzso as a guest in a natural repeating zzso zzso the high zzso of which exhibit zzso inverse temperature zzso zzso a number of ways have been demonstrated for changing zzso such that zzso lowering zzso from above to below zzso temperature becomes a means of zzso and zzso driving zzso zzso zzso controlling zzso becomes a mechanism zzso proteins can be induced to carry out zzso free energy zzso
