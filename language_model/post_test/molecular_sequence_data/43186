The zzso of fully zzso spores of zzso zzso zzso in zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain another zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso zzso and shown to be a zzso which requires zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso for its zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and sodium zzso reversed the zzso by zzso The zzso zzso isolated spore cortical fragments from a variety of zzso organisms but had minimal activity on zzso spores and isolated cell zzso However, the zzso was not capable of digesting isolated cortical fragments from spores of zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso acid zzso in its cortical zzso This indicates that the zzso recognizes the zzso zzso peculiar to spore zzso suggesting an involvement of the zzso in spore zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso in its mature form is localized on the exterior of the zzso layer in the dormant zzso A gene zzso the zzso zzso was cloned into zzso coli, and the zzso sequence was zzso The gene zzso a protein of 321 zzso acids with a deduced molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene indicated that the zzso is produced in a mature zzso It was suggested that the zzso belongs to a separate group within the zzso family typified by the fungus zzso zzso A possible mechanism for zzso degradation in zzso zzso zzso spores is zzso
