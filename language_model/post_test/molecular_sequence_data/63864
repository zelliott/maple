zzso binding zzso zzso were chosen as research models to reveal the structural basis underlying the recognition of zzso by zzso with the application of two distinct zzso Using the zzso analog interference mapping zzso we found strong interference effects after incorporation of the zzso zzso zzso analog into the zzso chain at equivalent positions zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 18 and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso The results obtained by zzso analog interference mapping suggest that these zzso bases are crucial for the creation of zzso binding sites and that they appear to be involved in the coordination of the zzso to the exposed zzso atom of the tandem zzso Additionally, most zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were located in the common zzso loop zzso in zzso zzso 18 and kissing zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso stretches containing zzso with the highest interference values were the targets for zzso of zzso which are members of the zzso zzso library in both zzso It zzso that DNA zzso directed zzso H zzso are sensitive to zzso and, at an elevated metal zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso targets is zzso probably due to higher stability and complexity of the zzso zzso
