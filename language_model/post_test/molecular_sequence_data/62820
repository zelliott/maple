The zzso seed coat zzso zzso a complex process of differentiation that includes the zzso and zzso of large quantities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and secondary cell wall zzso zzso in zzso zzso lead to a decrease in seed coat zzso and incomplete zzso zzso We show that zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso an zzso required for the synthesis of the zzso zzso I, the major component of zzso zzso This result suggests that the synthesis of zzso zzso is a limiting factor in the zzso of zzso seed coat zzso In addition, the reduced zzso zzso observed in the absence of a key zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso establishes a zzso link between zzso production and cellular zzso The cellular zzso seen in zzso zzso is similar to that of several zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso is zzso regulated in the seed coat by zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso and zzso appear to be regulating zzso production through alternate zzso Our results provide a framework for the regulation of zzso production and zzso cell zzso
