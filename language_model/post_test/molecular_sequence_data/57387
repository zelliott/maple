zzso promoter zzso stimulates an increase in zzso differentiation activity in human zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that this process involves a rapid zzso of five species of zzso beta zzso differentiation factor zzso followed by protein zzso C zzso and that variation in size of the zzso transcripts is due to multiple 3' ends, presumably reflecting an alternative zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, a zzso DNA zzso containing an zzso consensus sequence zzso located in the zzso region of the zzso gene was capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso early zzso and a zzso zzso enhanced these fusion promoter zzso The deletion of zzso sequences from the zzso element in the zzso DNA sequence context abolished its zzso zzso from the zzso promoter even in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso products zzso the zzso promoter activity enhanced by the zzso zzso element itself or in concert with zzso zzso zzso indicating that the putative zzso sequence acts as an zzso element, depending upon zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso DNA sequences of the human zzso beta A zzso gene play an important role in its zzso
