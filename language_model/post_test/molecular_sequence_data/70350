The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso for stem cell factor and plays a critical role in the growth and differentiation of various types of cells including zzso stem zzso To investigate the mechanisms of its zzso regulation, we isolated the zzso zzso region of the human zzso gene and characterized its promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso region lacked a typical zzso zzso but had a relatively high G + C content and four potential zzso zzso zzso binding sites for zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso protection analyses of zzso cells indicated that the major zzso start sites are 62 zzso and 58 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso Essentially the same start sites were detected in zzso cells such as small cell lung zzso and zzso this single promoter in zzso is different from the multiple promoter system of zzso a zzso zzso in which at least two promoters are differently used in zzso and zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso zzso zzso region using the bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells, which express the zzso zzso zzso at high levels, showed that a region from zzso to zzso is important for the expression of the zzso zzso In addition, a negative regulatory zzso is suggested to be involved in the regulation of the zzso gene expression in zzso
