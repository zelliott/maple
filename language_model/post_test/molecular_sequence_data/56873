The zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a class III zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The beta zzso gene is located on mouse zzso 18 close to the zzso gene which codes for the colony stimulating zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that in a high percentage of zzso zzso induced by the zzso helper zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso were integrated in the first zzso of the zzso gene leading to an enhanced expression of zzso zzso Since zzso by zzso zzso can act at long distance, we studied beta zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso This gene was found to be frequently expressed but the level of beta zzso zzso zzso was weak and not related to zzso zzso High affinity binding sites were expressed on zzso cells and zzso binding induced cell zzso To determine whether beta zzso expression is a common feature in zzso cells, we tested cell lines belonging to other zzso zzso We found that zzso stem and mast cell lines also expressed the beta zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso known as a zzso for zzso tissue cells, could also play a role in normal zzso
