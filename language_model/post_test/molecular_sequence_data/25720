A set of zzso and T zzso suitable for the study of protein DNA interactions have been incorporated into the central zzso sequence within zzso The individual zzso have one potential protein contact zzso a zzso group or a zzso group capable of a van der zzso zzso zzso In general, the modified bases do not zzso the overall structure of the zzso enabling results obtained to be simply interpreted in terms of loss of protein DNA zzso We have used the modified zzso set to study the recognition of DNA by the zzso restriction zzso zzso sequence zzso The zzso and zzso values for the set have been determined, and a comparison with results seen with the parent zzso zzso no modified zzso has been carried zzso Three classes of results are zzso First, some zzso lead to no change in kinetic zzso meaning no zzso contact at the altered zzso Second (this is seen for most of the modified zzso a drop in the zzso ratio relative to the parent is zzso This comes mainly from a decrease in zzso zzso that the zzso uses the interaction under study to lower the zzso barrier rather than to bind the zzso zzso of these results show that the drop in zzso is what would be expected for the simple loss of a hydrogen bond or a zzso contact between the zzso and the zzso This implies a contact of these types at these zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
