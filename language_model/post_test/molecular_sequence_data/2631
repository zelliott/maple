zzso acid sequence analysis of a protein from chicken zzso tissue which promotes zzso maturity in chicken bone zzso cells in culture has established sequences of a zzso fragment, a zzso zzso and a zzso and an zzso zzso Independent comparison of the zzso and zzso fragments with known zzso acid sequences by computer search has unequivocally identified avian zzso hormone as a zzso This is the first demonstration that a protein previously identified by a biological function is a zzso
