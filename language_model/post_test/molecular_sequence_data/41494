zzso of environmental signals into zzso information is thought to occur widely but has been poorly studied as zzso It is proposed that changes in the expression of molecules involved in zzso modifications might play a role in this zzso Here we study the expression of abundant satellite DNA zzso that makes up zzso of zzso of the red flour zzso zzso zzso and is located within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II promotes the zzso of zzso satellite DNA from both zzso and long primary transcripts are rapidly processed into zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso satellite zzso zzso is zzso zzso the most intense being at specific stages of zzso Moreover, the expression is strongly induced following heat shock and is accompanied by increase in repressive zzso modifications of zzso at zzso zzso Upon recovery from heat stress, the expression of satellite zzso zzso as well as zzso modifications is quickly zzso Our results indicate that satellite zzso zzso zzso activated after heat zzso affect zzso state of zzso zzso in zzso It can be hypothesized that transient zzso of zzso is part of a zzso gene expression program activated under stress conditions in zzso
