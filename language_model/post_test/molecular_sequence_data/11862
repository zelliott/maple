zzso from rat liver had the ability to bind zzso growth factor zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso resulted in the complete loss of the activity, while the zzso with zzso ABC had no zzso zzso zzso zzso gel also bound zzso and the binding was competitively inhibited by zzso and bovine liver zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso pig zzso zzso or other zzso suggesting the specific structural domain in HS for the binding of zzso Among limited zzso with zzso I of bovine liver zzso zzso is the minimal size to bind zzso zzso of the zzso unit compositions revealed a marked difference in zzso unit between the bound and zzso zzso The contents of this zzso unit were calculated to be 2 zzso for the bound zzso but 1 zzso for the zzso zzso Considering both the zzso specificity and properties of zzso I, the above results suggest that the bound zzso should contain two units of zzso zzso or alternately in the vicinity of the reducing zzso The bound zzso was more than 20 times as active as the zzso one with regard to the ability to release zzso bound to rat liver HS zzso The ability was comparable to the zzso of that of zzso
