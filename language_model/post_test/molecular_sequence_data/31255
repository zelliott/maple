We have shown that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso promoter is zzso by a zzso factor, the zzso response zzso protein zzso This repression can be alleviated when zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso cannot be alleviated by a zzso zzso deficient in the protein zzso A zzso site zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso at this site is essential for the relief of zzso zzso by zzso requires its binding to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso is no longer induced by serum, but this repression can be relieved by treatment of the cells with zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso has a dual function, that of a zzso in the absence of zzso and an zzso when zzso by protein zzso zzso
