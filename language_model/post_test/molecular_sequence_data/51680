zzso zzso chains of the major zzso family, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are composed of neutral zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The structures of the main components of the neutral chain have been established zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the structures of the zzso zzso Only two kinds of zzso fragments were released from zzso by zzso zzso following zzso of zzso zzso zzso one-dimensional and two-dimensional zzso zzso revealed their structures to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing that the zzso zzso chains are constructed with zzso zzso repeats which have zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso position of zzso zzso The zzso zzso chains obtained from zzso by zzso were separated into zzso chains zzso and zzso and zzso chains zzso by zzso gel zzso The zzso chains and their zzso zzso were zzso by zzso From the analyses of the zzso zzso of each zzso structures of the zzso zzso chains were zzso They are classified into four zzso The first group is the zzso chains without the zzso zzso repeating zzso The other three groups have the chains of various lengths differing in the number of zzso zzso zzso These chains are extended from the Man zzso branch of the zzso core in the second group, from the Man zzso branch in the third group, and from both branches in the fourth zzso The structural features of the zzso and zzso zzso chains are also zzso
