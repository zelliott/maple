A zzso zzso protein has been characterized by zzso zzso The zzso sequence predicts an zzso located zzso of 345 zzso zzso This protein does not possess a zzso domain but contains a zzso zzso sequence characteristic of membrane attachment by a zzso zzso It displays zzso to the zzso protein zzso featuring three zzso that resemble zzso constant zzso More specifically, the protein is most zzso to a zzso of proteins which includes the neural cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and one zzso of the zzso zzso growth factor receptors zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These sequence zzso suggest that the protein could be involved in either cell recognition and zzso zzso zzso binding or zzso
