zzso has been identified as a protein which shares significant zzso with the tumor zzso zzso We found two new types of zzso zzso zzso for zzso expressed in zzso cells which we named zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that these zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins bearing distinct zzso structures, which are also different from the previously reported zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as alpha and beta were confirmed to be expressed in normal human zzso in varied zzso All of these zzso zzso activated promoter with the zzso consensus zzso but to different zzso Furthermore, zzso effects of zzso gamma and zzso but not zzso on zzso zzso activity were observed when zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso regions of zzso which were altered by alternative zzso affect these zzso abilities and zzso the functions of zzso zzso
