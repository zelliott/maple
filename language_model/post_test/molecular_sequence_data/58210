The avian zzso zzso which encodes a zzso fusion zzso zzso chicken zzso but not zzso However, passage of zzso viral stock in zzso leads to emergence of a virus capable of zzso zzso This virus has not acquired zzso zzso instead, it carries internal gag deletions which zzso the ability to transform zzso We now demonstrate that this and similar deletion zzso emerge repeatedly during zzso zzso analysis reveals direct repeats at or near deletion zzso suggesting that errors during reverse zzso may be involved in genesis of these zzso which are then positively selected in zzso zzso By using the zzso chain reaction, we found that such zzso zzso in original stocks even before selection, although they could not be detected by focus zzso
