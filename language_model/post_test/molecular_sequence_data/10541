The zzso zzso or zzso zinc finger gene is structurally related to the zzso leukemia zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor, zzso through a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso gene normally produces two protein products that differ by the zzso zzso The smaller protein zzso lacks the zzso domain of zzso but is otherwise identical to zzso Here we show that zzso proteins bind to zzso or zzso elements and repress zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso promoter, one of the best characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were able to bind to zzso zzso This binding was zzso by the zzso zzso elements of the promoter and the first three zinc finger motifs of zzso zzso also encodes a zzso domain that was mapped to the central region of the zzso Fusion of this region to the zzso zzso domain generated zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso protein can efficiently repress the zzso virus 40 zzso early promoter, which primarily consists of zzso zzso zzso however, only zzso zzso this promoter, suggesting a role for zzso in modulating zzso protein zzso The data have implications for a role of zzso proteins in the regulation of cellular gene zzso many of which are characterized by zzso zzso
