A zzso segment of DNA containing two previously cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso Petersen, zzso Welch, zzso Rudolph, and zzso Bennett, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Two complete open reading frames zzso were identified zzso and zzso along with a third truncated zzso zzso The translation products of zzso and zzso corresponded to the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso I and zzso II zzso zzso The two zzso had a high zzso acid identity zzso and showed zzso to a newly described class of alcohol zzso Northern blots revealed that zzso and zzso did not form an zzso zzso extension experiments located single zzso start sites 37 and 58 zzso upstream of the start zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso promoter regions for these genes were almost zzso zzso and zzso were found to be induced or zzso immediately prior to significant zzso production in controlled pH zzso batch zzso
