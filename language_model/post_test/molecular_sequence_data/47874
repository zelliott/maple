A zzso processing zzso zzso zzso a broad range of precursors targeted to the zzso yielding proteins for numerous zzso pathways in different zzso zzso contains a signature zzso zzso zzso that places it in a zzso family which includes the zzso processing zzso Here, we have investigated the mechanism of zzso by zzso a late, yet key event in the import zzso zzso zzso removed the transit zzso from a variety of precursors in a single zzso zzso Whereas the mature protein was immediately released, the transit zzso remained bound to zzso zzso converted the transit zzso to a zzso form that it no longer zzso We conclude that zzso contains a specific binding site for the transit zzso and additional zzso by zzso triggers its zzso A stable interaction between zzso and an intact transit zzso was directly demonstrated using a newly developed binding zzso Unlike zzso zzso a zzso extract rapidly zzso both the transit zzso and zzso A new zzso activity, distinguishable from zzso was identified that is zzso and zzso Our results indicate a regulated sequence of events as zzso functions during precursor import, and demonstrate a previously zzso zzso for transit zzso zzso
