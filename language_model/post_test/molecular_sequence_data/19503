In humans, the zzso zzso is located in two narrow passages, the zzso zzso at the upper part of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is covered by a zzso layer which is essential for the function of the zzso zzso that are directly connected with the brain through the zzso zzso This anatomical weakness of the brain protection may be the source of zzso Little is known about the composition of this zzso in zzso Previous zzso analyses have been performed on washes of the entire zzso cavities and therefore might better zzso to the zzso over the respiratory zzso than to the zzso covering the zzso zzso In the present study, we sampled the zzso zzso directly from the zzso of 16 healthy adult volunteers, and 83 proteins were identified in the samples using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins were not previously observed either in zzso zzso sampled through zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso with the data in the protein databases, the most abundant proteins are zzso whereas some others zzso to zzso proteins covering a large range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, zzso zzso regulation, zzso and metabolism of zzso zzso This study clearly demonstrates the complexity of the zzso covering the human zzso zzso which might comprise potential markers for characterizing zzso zzso
