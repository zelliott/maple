zzso genes code for zzso peptides with a zzso zzso zzso In this project we hypothesized that zzso genes may be candidate genes for resistance to zzso In this article we describe the identification and zzso characterization of eight bovine zzso zzso including six novel zzso genes and two zzso zzso in the bovine zzso zzso of one of the novel zzso zzso has been demonstrated, as well as the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso For zzso zzso 20 zzso from two different bovine zzso libraries zzso numbers 750 and zzso were isolated by zzso screening with zzso consensus zzso derived from published zzso zzso products from zzso generated with consensus zzso have been zzso and zzso revealing a total of 16 genes and two zzso Six novel zzso genes share the typical zzso structure and are highly zzso to published bovine zzso zzso They are named zzso zzso and zzso and two novel zzso are named zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso from nine cows with different clinical findings demonstrated the expression of several zzso genes mentioned zzso First results indicate that the zzso status of the cow presumably has no influence on gene zzso zzso knowledge of zzso activity of zzso from literature, the abundance of zzso zzso in the bovine zzso zzso and the zzso of some genes give first evidence that zzso may play a role in local host defense during zzso zzso
