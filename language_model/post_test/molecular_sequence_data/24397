In zzso zzso the ability to acquire iron from the host has been shown to correlate with zzso Here, we show that the DNA upstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso encodes a protein in the inverse orientation to zzso (named zzso zzso shares zzso with the zzso family of positive zzso zzso A zzso fusion contained on a zzso was transformed into zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso is zzso regulated by iron and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Under zzso conditions with added zzso the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso was significantly lower than in the zzso This diminished response to zzso was detected by both Northern zzso and zzso fusion zzso The zzso response of zzso in the zzso zzso was restored to zzso levels when zzso with zzso in zzso These studies suggest that zzso may act as a positive regulator of zzso zzso under zzso conditions in the presence of zzso
