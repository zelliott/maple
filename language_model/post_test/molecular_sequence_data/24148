zzso repeat expansion is the cause of an ever-increasing list of neurodegenerative disorders, especially zzso zzso However, genes responsible for zzso of the clinically diagnosed zzso are still unidentified in different zzso Traditional linkage and repeat zzso based methods zzso with human zzso sequence and expression information can now accelerate the pace of identification of putative disease zzso We have analyzed two zzso repeat containing zzso human zzso and zzso which are expressed in the brain as putative candidates for zzso using zzso as well as zzso scanning zzso Both zzso exhibited features characteristic of genes associated with repeat zzso These zzso are zzso with respect to size and interruption pattern in the Indian zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of zzso embedded zzso in the respective proteins predicted these regions to be zzso zzso beyond a threshold of 40 zzso Comparative zzso analysis suggested a stabilizing influence of zzso zzso in repeat tract in zzso but not in zzso Although repeat expansion could not be detected within these genes in unidentified zzso patients reported in India, we suggest that these zzso be screened in other zzso as there is a wide zzso in the prevalence of these disorders in different zzso
