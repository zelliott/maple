The main zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso that cleave zzso a major constituent of the plant cell zzso Although zzso studies suggested that zzso production in zzso species is subjected to zzso repression, the direct implication of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in this regulation has never been zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we cloned the zzso zzso zzso gene by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso and then constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to that of an zzso coli zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso are unable to grow on zzso or zzso as the sole carbon zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene revealed the presence of a zzso open reading frame zzso that codes for a protein highly similar to the zzso of zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso fusion, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso its own zzso probably via a mechanism similar to that described for the zzso coli zzso zzso Moreover, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of genes of the zzso part of the zzso degradation zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are important for zzso formation and zzso is dramatically reduced in induced zzso In contrast, expression of zzso which encodes a zzso zzso important for zzso zzso zzso seems to be zzso regulated by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso have greatly decreased zzso capacity in potato zzso chicory leaves, and celery zzso as well as highly diminished zzso on zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso plays a crucial role in expression of the zzso genes and in the zzso of zzso zzso
