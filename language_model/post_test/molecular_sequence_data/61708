In zzso zzso the DNA binding protein zzso activates zzso from two classes of zzso those used by zzso zzso containing the primary zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso and those used by zzso zzso containing the secondary zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso Several single zzso acid zzso in region 4 of zzso define positions in zzso that are specifically required for zzso promoter zzso Similarly, several single zzso acid zzso in zzso define positions in zzso that are required for zzso promoter zzso but not for other functions of zzso It is unknown whether these zzso acids in zzso interact directly with those in region 4 of zzso or whether they interact with another zzso of zzso zzso to effect promoter zzso Here we report the identification of a new zzso acid in region 4 of zzso zzso at position zzso zzso that is involved in zzso promoter zzso To further investigate the role of zzso we used the coordinates of zzso and zzso region 4, each in complex with DNA, to build a model for the interaction of zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso We tested the model by examining the effects of zzso acid zzso in the putative interacting surfaces of these zzso As predicted by the model, we found genetic evidence for interaction of zzso of zzso with zzso at position 221 of zzso These results appear to define the surfaces of zzso and zzso that directly interact during zzso of the zzso zzso
