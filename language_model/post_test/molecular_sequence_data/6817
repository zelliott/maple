We examined 24 zzso zzso specimens from Thailand and detected zzso C virus zzso zzso in all of them by zzso zzso for a portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region and a portion of the zzso core zzso However, we failed to detect zzso zzso in 11 specimens by zzso zzso for a portion in the zzso protein 5 zzso region that has been used commonly for zzso zzso We designed a new primer set for a separate portion of the zzso zzso Using this primer set, we succeeded in amplifying this portion in all 24 zzso Two novel zzso zzso tentatively designated zzso and zzso were identified by sequencing these amplified zzso Our newly designed zzso for zzso zzso may be useful for diagnosing infection as well as for zzso unidentified zzso zzso
