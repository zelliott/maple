The primary structure of the human zzso zzso factor contains 12 nearly identical repeats of a consensus motif of five zzso acid zzso with the sequence zzso No known function has yet been ascribed to this zzso however, according to secondary structure prediction zzso it should form a zzso structure in zzso To validate this theoretical zzso we zzso a 31 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso containing six repeats of the zzso sequence and characterized its structure and stability by circular zzso zzso zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso No effects of concentration on the CD or zzso properties of zzso were observed, indicating that the zzso is zzso in solution at zzso up to 2 zzso The far zzso zzso of zzso indicates that at a low temperature (1 degrees zzso the zzso zzso has a relatively high zzso content zzso at pH zzso and zzso at pH zzso The effects of pH and zzso strength on the CD spectrum of zzso suggest that a number of zzso interactions zzso zzso i + 3 zzso zzso pair, zzso zzso contribute to the stability of the zzso structure in this zzso zzso profiles show that the melting of zzso zzso is accompanied by positive change in the zzso To determine zzso parameters of zzso transition from zzso profiles for this zzso we developed a new, zzso procedure based on the calculated function for the heat capacity of the coiled state for a broad temperature zzso The application of this approach to the partial zzso heat capacity function for zzso provides the zzso change for zzso formation calculated per zzso acid zzso as zzso zzso
