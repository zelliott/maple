The zzso gene zzso resistance to a wide spectrum of zzso of the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene has been zzso from the wild tomato species zzso zzso into the cultivated zzso We have used zzso and zzso analysis for the targeted search of the zzso zzso into the cultivated zzso We have used zzso and zzso analysis for the targeted search of the zzso zzso zzso The resistant line LA zzso contains a single zzso segment on zzso 4, which is characterized by three zzso markers from the zzso zzso map of zzso The map position of the zzso gene in large zzso four additional markers were identified in the zzso zzso After analyzing more than 800 zzso for zzso we found that one marker is only zzso zzso away from the zzso zzso zzso clones isolated from a region near the zzso gene indicate that in this area of the zzso the zzso ratio is relatively low zzso zzso and zzso walking should be feasible in order to isolate this zzso
