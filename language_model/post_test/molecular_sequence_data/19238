zzso zzso of the major zzso complex zzso zzso II gene was studied by amplification of zzso 2 using zzso followed by cloning and DNA sequencing in eight indigenous Chinese chicken zzso To reveal the genetic variation of the zzso II zzso 37 types of patterns detected by zzso were investigated first, which would be used to screen novel zzso II sequences within the zzso The types of zzso patterns and final sequencing allowed for the identification of 31 novel zzso zzso II zzso from 30 unrelated individuals of Chinese chickens that were zzso These are the first zzso for the zzso of chicken zzso zzso II gene based on the rule of assignment for novel zzso zzso zzso alignment of the 31 zzso II zzso revealed a total of 68 variable sites in the zzso of zzso 2, of which 51 zzso zzso and 17 singleton variable sites were zzso Among the zzso sites, the zzso zzso in the first and second positions of the zzso accounted for zzso and zzso zzso The sequence similarities between the zzso were estimated to be zzso The relative zzso of synonymous and zzso zzso zzso within the region were zzso and zzso zzso These results indicated that the genetic variation within zzso 2 appeared to have largely arisen by gene zzso and balancing zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso domain coded by zzso 2 revealed 6 synonymous zzso and 27 zzso zzso at the 33 disparate zzso In particular, the zzso zzso at the putative zzso sites are considered to be associated with zzso specificity of zzso zzso II zzso in Chinese native zzso These results can provide a molecular biological basis for the study of disease resistance in chicken zzso
