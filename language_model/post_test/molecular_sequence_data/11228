zzso zzso is a zzso zzso 3 zzso protein that has been implicated in synaptic zzso zzso as a result of its interaction with zzso In a screen for novel members of the zzso family, we identified zzso an zzso zzso identical to the previously characterized zzso zzso The zzso distribution of this zzso parallels zzso both being enriched in nerve zzso Like zzso a role in zzso at the nerve terminal is supported by the rapid zzso of zzso on zzso zzso the two zzso can be zzso from the brain as an zzso complex, suggesting that the two zzso act in zzso As determined by zzso of brain zzso the zzso complex is a zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with either zzso or zzso show greatly reduced zzso zzso but zzso of the two proteins zzso this zzso supporting a role for the zzso in zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso 3 zzso of both zzso interact with zzso the zzso can associate with multiple zzso molecules in zzso and activates zzso zzso zzso We propose that it is an zzso zzso that drives the recruitment of zzso to zzso pits in zzso nerve zzso
