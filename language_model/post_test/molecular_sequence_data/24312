zzso The zzso zzso channel zzso family represents a unique group of zzso channels that share limited zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso channel zzso as well as the transient zzso potential zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that this family is restricted to two members, zzso and zzso (also named zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the two channels are zzso in zzso zzso including small zzso zzso and zzso whereas kidney and brain only express zzso and stomach solely zzso zzso From an zzso point of view, zzso and zzso are highly similar zzso zzso concern zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and recovery from zzso zzso zzso red is a potent blocker of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso has a zzso lower affinity for zzso red zzso 9 zzso 1 zzso than zzso zzso 121 zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso are modulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activity rapidly zzso in the absence of zzso zzso This effect is further accelerated at higher zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso are zzso channels, with an almost identical pore zzso They can be zzso by their sensitivity for zzso red and show differences in zzso zzso
