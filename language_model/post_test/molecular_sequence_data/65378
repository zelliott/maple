Large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels zzso by the zzso alpha and zzso zzso exist abundantly in rat zzso cells, pancreatic beta cells, and zzso zzso The zzso loop of zzso acting as the channel regulator influences the zzso and toxin sensitivity of BK channels, and the zzso domain at its N zzso zzso rapid zzso However, the regulatory zzso especially the trafficking mechanism of zzso is still zzso With the help of zzso and patch clamp techniques, we determine that the zzso zzso alone resides in the zzso zzso suggesting that trafficking mechanism of zzso differs from that of zzso opposite to what we predicted zzso We further demonstrate that a zzso alpha zzso segment at the N zzso of zzso prevents the surface expression of zzso that is, the zzso segment itself is a retention zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso loop of zzso we reveal that the most accessible site by zzso is located at the middle of the zzso loop, which might provide clues to understand how the auxiliary beta zzso regulates the toxin sensitivity and the zzso of zzso zzso
