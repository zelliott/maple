The mechanism by which zzso fuse with cellular zzso to permit virus entry is still relatively poorly zzso This process is proving difficult to zzso largely due to the fact that multiple viral envelope proteins appear to function in concert to mediate the fusion zzso For zzso zzso zzso Type 1 zzso zzso B, D and the zzso zzso are all required for fusion, and zzso counterparts are involved in the fusion process of all other members of the zzso zzso An understanding of the functional zzso of zzso that are critical for fusion may offer the possibility of designing specific zzso zzso of virus entry, and recent progress has highlighted the potential usefulness of this zzso This review discusses these advances and outlines some of the similarities and differences between zzso zzso of the different members of this diverse family of zzso
