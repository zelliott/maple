When targeted to sequences adjacent to a zzso element, zzso zzso zzso inhibit the DNA binding activity of zzso box binding protein zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we scanned the human zzso virus type 1 promoter for zzso zzso of zzso binding and zzso using a series of DNA zzso in which a zzso binding site was placed at various distances from the zzso zzso zzso interference with either zzso or zzso contacts both upstream and downstream of the zzso element resulted in zzso of zzso Our results define important zzso interactions outside of the zzso element and suggest that zzso zzso of selected gene promoters can be achieved with zzso that target unique sequences within these promoters at a distance from the zzso zzso Our studies also demonstrate the utility of the zzso zzso for discovery of functionally important zzso contacts involved in zzso
