zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein that has been shown to mediate iron delivery during zzso cluster and zzso zzso zzso processing zzso zzso yields a form of human zzso corresponding to zzso zzso However, structural and functional studies have focused on a core structure that results from an zzso zzso event at the zzso zzso we show that the zzso of zzso zzso shows a unique zzso iron site and that this iron center appears to mediate a zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso appears to block previously defined zzso sites located on the zzso surface defined by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso most likely through zzso contact with the zzso surface on the core zzso as well as zzso zzso binding of the zzso cluster assembly scaffold partner zzso zzso The zzso significance of zzso release of the zzso zzso from this zzso surface is zzso
