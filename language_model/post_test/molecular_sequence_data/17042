Recently, carbon zzso zzso have been reported to be an effective zzso zzso for small molecules zzso zzso 75, zzso In a somewhat related study, we have employed zzso produced by using zzso zzso aluminum oxide zzso as a zzso template as the assisting zzso for zzso analysis upon the addition of high zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that the mass range can be extended to zzso 12,000 Da and that zzso metal zzso of zzso are effectively zzso Furthermore, we have employed zzso zzso zzso as affinity zzso to selectively concentrate traces of zzso from zzso zzso High zzso of zzso and zzso in the sample solutions are also zzso This approach is very suitable for the zzso analysis of small zzso zzso and protein zzso digest zzso
