The zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso are two very large zzso that can be detected in concentrated culture zzso zzso Both of these proteins exhibit zzso with the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso of the latter zzso The zzso open reading frame is flanked upstream by a zzso zzso that encodes a predicted protein with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso outer membrane protein that is involved in zzso of zzso across the outer zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso gene was transcribed together with the zzso gene on a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with a zzso zzso present in the zzso cell envelope fraction of zzso zzso zzso which indicated that the zzso protein is likely an outer membrane zzso zzso culture zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso gene on a zzso restored zzso protein expression and resulted in release of zzso amounts of the zzso protein into culture zzso zzso When evaluated in the zzso rabbit model of infection, the zzso zzso was attenuated in the ability to cause zzso and was never recovered in a viable form from zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso zzso protein is involved in zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins across the outer zzso
