The zzso factor zzso is highly zzso in the majority of prostate zzso due to zzso fusion of the zzso responsive promoter of zzso to the zzso reading zzso Our aim was to identify this gene fusion in urine samples from prostate cancer patients prior to radical treatment and to compare fusion status with zzso zzso zzso zzso from 55 patients (with and without prior zzso zzso were analyzed for the presence of zzso zzso using real-time zzso zzso percent of urine samples following zzso massage were positive for zzso zzso a or zzso five out of which were positive for both, vs zzso of samples obtained without prior zzso zzso a seems to be most prevalent and some patients may be positive for more than one fusion zzso reflecting the zzso of prostate zzso zzso massage prior to zzso analysis of zzso urine material and detection of zzso provided the highest zzso Positive statistical correlations were identified between zzso fusion and high zzso pathological stage and zzso zzso Our findings contribute to the increasing zzso of the role of zzso in the development of prostate zzso
