The structures of rice zzso zzso a plant zzso active in zzso cell zzso zzso and its zzso intermediate with zzso have been solved at zzso A and zzso A resolution, zzso The structures were similar to the known structures of other zzso zzso family 1 zzso zzso but showed several differences in the zzso around the active site, which lead to an open active site with a narrow slot at the bottom, compatible with the zzso of long zzso zzso Though this active site structure is somewhat similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso B, which zzso similar zzso molecular zzso studies indicate that the zzso interacting with the zzso beyond the zzso zzso site are completely different, reflecting the independent evolution of plant and microbial zzso zzso The complex with the zzso included a zzso zzso which appears to be in a position to make a zzso attack on the zzso carbon in a zzso zzso The coordination of the zzso groups suggests that zzso are positioned as zzso for zzso by their interactions with zzso the zzso zzso and zzso which is zzso in barley zzso zzso that has zzso zzso and zzso activity similar to rice zzso As the rice and barley zzso have different preferences for zzso and zzso zzso that appeared to interact with zzso zzso were zzso to those of the barley zzso to see if the relative activities of rice zzso toward these zzso could be changed to those of zzso Although no single zzso appeared to be responsible for these differences, zzso zzso and zzso did appear to interact with the zzso
