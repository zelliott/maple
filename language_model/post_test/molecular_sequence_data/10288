We report here the isolation, cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso to the mouse zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The full length zzso zzso sequence zzso revealed zzso similarity with the previously reported mouse and human zzso and coded for a protein of 198 zzso zzso results which were very similar to that observed for the mouse and human zzso Western zzso analysis performed using a zzso zzso against a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of a strongly zzso protein band at 30 zzso (as opposed to 27 zzso in mouse and human zzso in cell zzso prepared from rat and zzso zzso Although the size of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso transcript is similar in mouse and zzso it is likely that the differential mobility of the zzso zzso protein compared to the mouse and human zzso protein could be due to zzso zzso
