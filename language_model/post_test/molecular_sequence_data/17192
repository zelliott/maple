zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the formation of structurally diverse and biologically important zzso Given their modular organization, zzso provide an enormous potential for zzso approaches to generate novel zzso zzso zzso for the exploitation of this potential is a profound knowledge of the zzso communication between partner zzso The overall goal of this study was to understand the basis of zzso communication that zzso the selective interaction in these zzso zzso On this account, we studied the relevance of short regions at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso investigations of zzso deletion zzso of the initiation module zzso provided evidence for the existence and impact of short zzso zzso zzso Their decisive role in zzso recognition was subsequently proven by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the terminal zzso zzso between the donor zzso zzso and zzso as well as between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearly demonstrated that matching pairs of zzso zzso are both necessary and sufficient for the establishment of communication between partner zzso in zzso These results zzso the zzso of zzso zzso which were subsequently exploited to induce zzso even between zzso derived from different zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso represent interesting tools for zzso approaches, which, for example, could be used for the generation of innovative natural product zzso
