We have isolated and characterized a zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso from zzso rice cells treated with a zzso zzso zzso functions as zzso zzso which is considered to play a key role in the zzso of zzso recently isolated as rice zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was also confirmed in ultraviolet zzso rice zzso In addition, we identified zzso a putative zzso hydrocarbon precursor of zzso as an zzso compound in the zzso zzso rice cells and the zzso rice zzso The zzso zzso isolated here will be a useful tool to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the zzso of zzso in zzso
