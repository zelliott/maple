Both cholesterol and zzso fatty acid zzso metabolism play an important role in retinal and brain development and zzso zzso intake of cholesterol is accompanied with higher risk of heart disease and was suggested to have a role in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease, while dietary zzso were reported to act in an opposite zzso The same phenomena could be seen in case of zzso These effects are mainly realized through gene expression zzso In the present study, the effects of dietary cholesterol and the combination of cholesterol and fish oil were analyzed on the zzso of fatty acid composition and gene expression in the brain and in the zzso At the zzso level, specific changes could be detected in both zzso among zzso factor genes coding for zzso regulatory element binding zzso zzso X receptors and zzso zzso zzso and different fatty acid binding protein genes by using quantitative real-time zzso In the eye, cholesterol diet attenuated the positive effects of fish oil on inflammatory gene expression as the combined diet resulted in increased zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This induction was absent in the zzso Complex changes could be also recorded in the fatty acid composition of lipids extracted from eye and brain tissue due to the dietary zzso One of the most interesting changes was the reduced level of zzso acid by cholesterol in the zzso Our results on fatty acid composition and gene expression changes may open up new zzso in understanding the complex roles of cholesterol and zzso in normal and pathological visual and brain zzso
