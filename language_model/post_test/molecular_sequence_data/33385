zzso zzso is known to be a major zzso agent in the onset and progression of chronic zzso Among various zzso factors that this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are believed to be major zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report on our finding that there are zzso of these zzso zzso in a rice protein zzso Comprehensive affinity zzso and zzso analyses resulted in the identification of 17 zzso zzso proteins in the rice zzso Of these, four proteins zzso a 26 zzso zzso a plant zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso seed zzso and an alpha zzso zzso were estimated to account for zzso of the zzso zzso activity in the rice protein zzso using a two-dimensional gel system of zzso reverse zzso In addition, a synthetic zzso derived from an zzso zzso zzso zzso could inhibit the growth of zzso zzso and showed zzso activity against both the zzso and zzso These results suggest that these rice proteins may be useful as zzso ingredients for the prevention and management of zzso zzso
