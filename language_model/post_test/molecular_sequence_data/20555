zzso editing of two zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso in different zzso were analyzed using zzso but zzso and zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as experimental zzso A total of 18 and 26 editing sites for zzso conservative region transcript were identified by direct and clone sequencing, zzso By direct sequencing 23 and 22 editing sites for zzso transcript were identified in zzso and zzso nuclear backgrounds, zzso From the direct sequencing results, the occurrence rates of different transcripts generally increase in sterile zzso It is concluded that zzso editing of zzso and zzso might have a certain relationship with zzso zzso
