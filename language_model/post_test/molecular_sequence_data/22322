zzso zzso is a life-threatening human pathogen that is increasingly resistant to a wide array of zzso Resistance to zzso the most widely used zzso is correlated with tens of zzso acid zzso in their zzso that is, the zzso proteins zzso resulting from multiple events of zzso To discriminate relevant zzso from those that are incidental to the zzso process, we report the exhaustive characterization of all the zzso in the zzso domain of zzso from the highly resistant strain zzso A zzso method combining zzso and zzso approaches singled out 6 zzso of 41 zzso that are essential for high level zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with the previously studied zzso and zzso account for nearly all the loss of affinity of zzso for zzso Most interestingly, zzso and zzso cause the zzso change of a loop that borders the entrance of the active site zzso zzso zzso zzso For the first time all the zzso of a zzso relevant to zzso resistance have been identified, providing new zzso zzso Most notable is the relationship between the decreased zzso to zzso and the dynamic behavior of a zzso
