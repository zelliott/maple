Two luminous marine bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from seawater at zzso Region and zzso Bay in Japan, zzso These bacteria were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strains zzso and zzso formed a cluster within the zzso zzso species zzso However, zzso sequence analysis using five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicated that these strains were distinct from the currently known zzso zzso Additionally, these strains differ from related zzso species in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the ability to reduce nitrate to zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso iso zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso evidence presented in this study, it can be concluded that strains zzso and zzso belong to the same zzso and represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
