A method for the zzso of a zzso biologically active human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso coli is reported zzso The zzso steps zzso include mild extraction zzso zzso concentration by ammonium zzso zzso zzso in 8 M zzso on an zzso zzso liquid zzso column, and finally, resolution by zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso After the final step, the zzso is dried and stored under zzso zzso zzso acid compositional analysis and zzso sequence analysis confirm that the zzso protein is zzso Unlike other methods reported for zzso of zzso zzso zzso our protocol uses zzso instead of zzso zzso The zzso is fully soluble in zzso solutions at zzso exceeding 10 zzso zzso as a single 14 zzso species on both sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and two-dimensional PAGE gels with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso as a zzso on zzso zzso columns under native zzso Finally, zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity when introduced into appropriate reporter zzso Since zzso is zzso when tested by gel zzso and yet exhibits biological activity, we conclude that the method of zzso we have zzso is distinct from all other methods reported to zzso
