The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex in which the zzso zzso zzso are attached to a unique zzso zzso called zzso The attachment is zzso by two mutually interacting zzso namely multiple zzso zzso on the zzso zzso and a zzso domain on each of the zzso zzso zzso of the three-dimensional structure of each of the interacting components would be critical to a better understanding of the zzso interaction at the molecular zzso In this report, we describe the zzso of one of the nine zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso A DNA segment containing the zzso 2 sequence was fused to a zzso tag, and the zzso construct was expressed in zzso zzso The expressed zzso was efficiently isolated by zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso form of the zzso was zzso pending determination of its zzso
