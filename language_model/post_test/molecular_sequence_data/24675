The zzso protein zzso has received more research attention than any other inhibitor of zzso zzso in the injured central nervous system zzso zzso of its zzso effect, by using zzso specific to zzso has been shown to promote zzso zzso Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that active or passive zzso of zzso rats or mice with zzso peptides zzso a zzso protective zzso response, which promotes recovery by reducing zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso after incomplete zzso zzso in rats was substantially reduced, and hence recovery was significantly zzso by zzso zzso with zzso a zzso derived from zzso The observed effect seemed to be zzso by T cells and could be reproduced by passive transfer of a T cell line directed against the zzso zzso Thus, it seems that after incomplete zzso injury, zzso with a variety of zzso zzso including those derived from zzso can be used to evoke a T zzso response that promotes zzso The choice of zzso for clinical treatment of zzso injuries should be based on safety zzso in particular, the likelihood that the chosen zzso will not cause an zzso disease or interfere with essential functions of this zzso or other zzso From a therapeutic point of view, the fact that the active cellular agents are T cells rather than zzso is an advantage, as T cell production zzso within the time window required for a protective effect after zzso injury, whereas zzso production takes zzso
