Purple acid zzso zzso are zzso acid zzso also referred to as zzso acid zzso zzso or type 5 acid zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso from different species and zzso indicate that these zzso are translated as zzso zzso of zzso 35 zzso contrasting with the predominantly zzso structure observed in zzso zzso zzso In the present study we have compared certain structural and zzso properties of zzso rat zzso zzso with those of the native rat bone zzso zzso zzso and examined effects on these parameters by zzso the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a moderate zzso of the zzso zzso and shifted the pH optimum to a slightly more basic value zzso zzso with zzso resulted in complete zzso and zzso similar properties to those of the bone zzso zzso with regard to pH optimum zzso and sensitivity to reducing agents, as well as in the sizes of the zzso zzso specificity studies showed that the zzso bone zzso was considerably more active than the zzso zzso rat zzso towards a variety of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of these zzso bovine milk zzso seemed to be the most readily zzso zzso In conclusion, the results suggest that the zzso form of zzso represent a zzso zzso with low zzso activity towards both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Besides being implicated in the zzso of the zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso family might also exert a regulatory role in zzso processes involving the zzso zzso by converting the newly zzso zzso to zzso active and zzso regulated zzso
