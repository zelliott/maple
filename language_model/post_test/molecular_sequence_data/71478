A zzso with molecular mass of 42 zzso was identified as the major component of the chicken zzso the zzso zzso zzso known as the zzso zzso By using a DNA probe amplified with degenerative zzso derived from the zzso partial zzso acid zzso a zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame zzso 435 zzso acid zzso including a putative signal zzso of 20 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed significant similarity to zzso zzso of the zzso family of several other zzso species, including human zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which play important roles for zzso zzso A single zzso site present in chicken zzso is zzso among all five of these zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed the presence of a complex type zzso chain at this zzso zzso sequence analysis of the mature zzso suggests that zzso processing of the zzso occurs during synthesis and zzso The zzso zzso transcript was detected only in zzso and was found to be accumulated in zzso cells in a manner dependent on zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a metabolically zzso zzso was zzso from both cell zzso and culture zzso of the zzso cells with specific zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso synthesis and zzso of the zzso
