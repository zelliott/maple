zzso interfering zzso zzso of Tomato bushy stunt virus zzso a zzso zzso virus, comprise four zzso zzso regions (I through zzso derived from the viral zzso Region III, a zzso sequence corresponding to a zzso segment located zzso zzso upstream of the 3' zzso of the zzso has been found to enhance zzso zzso zzso by approximately zzso in an zzso manner zzso Ray and zzso zzso White, zzso zzso zzso In this study, a more detailed zzso analysis of region III was zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that region III contains zzso structures in both plus and minus zzso Through deletion analyses of a zzso zzso a primary zzso of region III activity was mapped to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that a zzso structure in the minus strand of this zzso was required for enhanced zzso zzso zzso The same zzso structure was also found to function in a zzso manner in a zzso zzso (albeit at reduced zzso and to be important for efficient zzso within the context of the zzso zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that the zzso segment of region III is a modular zzso replication element that functions primarily through the formation of an zzso hairpin structure in the minus zzso
