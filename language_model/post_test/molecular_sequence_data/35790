The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene promoters contain several zzso sequence elements which bind zzso and yet there are other zzso DNA sequences that do not zzso We report here that zzso of one of these zzso zzso regions increases zzso from this promoter both in zzso and in zzso We show that this zzso region is flanked by sites hypersensitive to zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso zzso comprised of this region display faster migration through zzso than control zzso The difference in mobility is not the result of bending, nor does the primary sequence contain features that would predict altered zzso We propose that this zzso Control zzso is rigid and zzso zzso by zzso interactions between proteins binding adjacent to this zzso
