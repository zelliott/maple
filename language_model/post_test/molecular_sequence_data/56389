A zzso labeled version of a zzso zzso zzso probe was used to monitor the enrichment and isolation of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was originally identified as a molecular isolate that was zzso related to zzso zzso by amplification and sequencing of part of its zzso zzso zzso The zzso in turn, was used to design a zzso zzso The zzso medium used for the zzso enrichment and isolation was based on the zzso properties of the its closest relatives as identified by sequence zzso Of 30 zzso zzso only 3 zzso with the zzso Nearly complete zzso zzso sequences determined for each of these three zzso zzso had no zzso with the probe target site, zzso were identical to the amplified partial sequence of about 500 zzso and to one another in all other positions, and zzso were zzso similar to that of zzso zzso In addition, one isolate chosen for further study zzso zzso had a zzso specificity comparable to that of zzso zzso These results confirmed that zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso sequences from environmental samples can be accurate and can also provide zzso information from which aspects of a population's physiology can be zzso
