While zzso zzso zzso of retaining zzso have been structurally characterized zzso no such information for a zzso zzso has been zzso This study presents a new zzso zzso zzso zzso methodology that, for the first time, has allowed the isolation and structural characterization of a zzso competent zzso zzso intermediate with human pancreatic zzso This has been achieved by the use of a zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso as zzso zzso This generates an zzso zzso that then zzso with the free zzso The zzso zzso zzso are extremely stable, with zzso zzso on the order of 240 h for the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso however, they undergo turnover via zzso according to a zzso of less than 1 zzso zzso studies of intermediate complexes zzso show the zzso attachment of a zzso zzso in the chair zzso to the side chain of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso portions of the intermediate complexes are found to bind in the zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso forming extensive zzso zzso Comparative structural analyses with the related zzso complex formed by zzso highlight the structural rigidity of the zzso surface during zzso and the key role that zzso zzso flexibility must play in this zzso Taken together, the structural data provide atomic details of several key zzso zzso The scope of this zzso approach to probe the active sites and zzso mechanisms of zzso is further demonstrated through preliminary experiments with zzso pancreatic zzso
