We have recently identified by zzso cloning a set of genes that are rapidly activated in cultured mouse cells by protein growth zzso Here we report that the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso derived from one of these immediate early genes zzso called zzso encodes a protein zzso to that zzso by the avian zzso virus 17 zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso proteins is in two zzso one near the N zzso and the other at the C zzso The latter sequence was shown by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 84, zzso to have regions of sequence similarity to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso and to the zzso protein zzso Southern blots of human, zzso and chicken DNA demonstrate that zzso and zzso are different genes and that there may be other zzso genes related to zzso and zzso These findings suggest that there is a zzso family of genes zzso related zzso regulatory zzso The zzso zzso and perhaps other members of the zzso family, may play a role in regulating the zzso response to growth zzso
