The structural and affinity details of the interactions of synthetic zzso linear zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with the broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated in solution by using zzso zzso techniques, specifically zzso transfer difference zzso zzso zzso and transferred zzso zzso Linear zzso show similar binding modes to the zzso with the zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso making the closest zzso contacts in the bound zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso shows two alternate binding zzso involving both zzso arms zzso and zzso a dual binding description of the molecular recognition of this zzso by zzso in solution that differs from the single binding mode deduced from X-ray zzso On the contrary, the zzso shows an unexpected selectivity for one arm zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso This result explains the previously reported lack of affinity enhancement relative to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed noticeable differences in binding affinities among the linear and zzso zzso in solution, with the latter showing decreased zzso Among the analyzed series of zzso the strongest zzso zzso were the linear zzso and zzso because both show similar affinity for the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso techniques can deliver abundant zzso zzso and affinity information for the characterization of zzso binding in solution, thus zzso and, as in the case of the zzso zzso the structural view from X-ray zzso This information is of key importance for the development of zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso mimics in the context of vaccine zzso
