We have identified two zzso zzso genes that, in high zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor that blocks cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle prior to budding and DNA zzso One gene zzso encodes a zzso and is likely to act at the level of zzso entry into sensitive cells, while the other encodes zzso one of a family of four related proteins that function positively and zzso with the zzso protein zzso Increased zzso dosage protects cells by influencing the sensitivity of the zzso target and is unique among the four zzso genes in zzso zzso resistance in high zzso but is antagonized by zzso zzso or zzso Since cells lacking zzso or deleted for both zzso and zzso are also zzso zzso our data support a model zzso zzso zzso promotes resistance by competition with the zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso sensitivity therefore requires a zzso function of zzso protein zzso zzso affecting the zzso zzso II zzso complex also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso strains share in common several other zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso function may be a zzso zzso
