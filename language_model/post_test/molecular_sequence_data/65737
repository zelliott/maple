The zzso family of zzso factors comprises zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are all zzso unstable zzso zzso proteins zzso with a variety of other zzso factors to control genes zzso key cell zzso Their best known partners are the zzso family proteins zzso zzso and zzso At the cellular level, zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso and responses to environmental zzso At the zzso level, they play paramount parts in zzso immune responses and cognitive functions, among zzso zzso family genes are subjected to zzso complex and zzso zzso and zzso regulations, which are necessary to avoid pathological zzso In particular, the zzso proteins undergo to numerous zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso regulating their zzso activity, their zzso zzso and their zzso The mechanisms zzso zzso and zzso are zzso have been studied in zzso zzso with the classical scenario, according to which most unstable key cell regulators are zzso by the zzso after zzso of zzso zzso the bulk of zzso and zzso can be zzso independently of any prior zzso in different zzso zzso and zzso share a common zzso domain whose primary sequence is zzso in zzso and zzso suggesting that similar breakdown mechanisms might be at play in the latter two zzso However, a database search indicates that this domain is not found in any other zzso suggesting that the mechanisms underlying zzso protein destruction may be specific to this zzso Interestingly, under particular conditions, a fraction of zzso zzso is zzso leading to faster zzso This poses the question of the zzso of degradation pathways that can target the same zzso depending on its zzso state, its protein partnership and/or its zzso zzso This issue is discussed here together with the, thus far, overlooked roles of the various zzso complexes found in all zzso
