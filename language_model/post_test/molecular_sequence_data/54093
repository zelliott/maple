zzso zzso are structural components of the genetic material, function as zzso donors, participate in cellular zzso are zzso in zzso zzso and constitute the main carriers of cellular zzso Thus, imbalances in zzso zzso zzso affect nearly the whole cellular metabolism and must be tightly zzso We have identified a substitution zzso zzso that reduces the activity of the zzso zzso zzso in budding zzso and the total zzso pool, leading to precipitous reductions in the zzso ratio and zzso level in zzso zzso strongly reduces the rate of growth, zzso general protein zzso and zzso translation of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of diverse zzso acid zzso zzso Although processing of zzso and other zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso are also strongly impaired in zzso cells, zzso complexes with the zzso composition of the zzso complex zzso and the zzso complex zzso required for translation initiation accumulate zzso in zzso cells and, to a lesser extent, in zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso addition of an external supply of zzso reverts all the zzso of zzso cells, but not those of zzso zzso zzso unable to refill the internal zzso pool through the salvage zzso These and other findings suggest that a zzso in zzso zzso zzso evokes a reduction in the rate of general protein synthesis by zzso multiple steps of the process, zzso the zzso zzso mechanism for translation of zzso zzso and has far-reaching effects in cell biology and zzso
