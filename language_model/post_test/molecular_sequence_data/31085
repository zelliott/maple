zzso bases were introduced into zzso during in zzso zzso synthesis or by chemical zzso These zzso were used as zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso P zzso from zzso zzso The synthetic approach permitted the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso and this resulted in complete zzso of the specific zzso processing zzso zzso modified zzso were obtained by chemical modifications of zzso and zzso in the zzso This allowed detailed analyses of specific bases excluded in the zzso With zzso and zzso zzso strong effects were observed in the T arm and weaker effects in the zzso zzso Only minor base zzso were detected in the zzso stem of zzso and in the D arm of zzso
