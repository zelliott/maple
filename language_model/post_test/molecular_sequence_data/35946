zzso zzso is an essential trace element for animals and zzso Its biological role was established following the discovery that zzso is a structural component of the active center of the zzso zzso zzso zzso During the last decade remarkable progress has been made in the recognition of the structure and function of several zzso Cellular zzso was the first zzso recognized as a zzso In it zzso was found in the form of zzso The zzso is a zzso protein and is composed of four apparently identical zzso each containing one gram atom of zzso Plasma zzso also has a zzso form with identical zzso and with one atom of zzso per zzso It is, however, a zzso zzso and is distinct from cellular zzso Both zzso catalyze the reduction of hydrogen zzso and a variety of organic zzso by zzso A third zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso containing one atom of zzso per mole of zzso This zzso destroys zzso zzso zzso The fourth known zzso zzso is a type I zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to the biologically active hormone zzso It is a zzso zzso and contains one atom of zzso per mole of zzso zzso zzso a fifth known zzso is a zzso zzso protein containing ten atoms of zzso per zzso The function of this protein is not known, but it may play a role in zzso transport or be connected with a protective activity against free zzso In all these zzso the zzso is incorporated into the protein zzso via the zzso which recognizes the specific zzso zzso in zzso to insert zzso into the primary structure of zzso
