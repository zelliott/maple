We have characterized a zzso zzso in a cell line zzso established from a patient with zzso zzso in which the zzso gene on zzso 8 was juxtaposed to a zzso zzso analysis of this cell line showed zzso zzso and zzso marker zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed juxtaposition of the zzso heavy chain joining region zzso with zzso 18 near the minor zzso cluster region zzso of the zzso zzso There was also a rearranged zzso gene zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning studies showed that the zzso gene was joined to zzso 18 zzso zzso sequence analysis of cloned zzso DNA revealed that the crossover between zzso 8 and 18 occurred at the 3' end of the zzso gene resulting in replacement of the zzso gene on the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso As a result of this zzso the zzso cell line contains no zzso zzso zzso or protein but has abundant levels of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso occurred simultaneously with zzso zzso in a B cell zzso zzso
