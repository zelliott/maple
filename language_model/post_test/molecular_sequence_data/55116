zzso is a zzso infestation of the skin by the zzso zzso zzso that causes significant morbidity worldwide, in particular within socially disadvantaged zzso In order to identify mechanisms that enable the zzso zzso to evade human immune defenses, we have studied molecules associated with zzso systems in the zzso including two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that within zzso human skin zzso (54 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were both localized in the zzso gut and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did inhibit zzso zzso zzso such as zzso albeit zzso zzso functional analysis revealed that both zzso zzso with all three pathways of the human complement system at different stages of their zzso zzso inhibited mostly the initial and progressing steps of the zzso while zzso showed the strongest effects at the zzso level in the terminal zzso zzso effects of both zzso were shown at the zzso level in the zzso zzso Both zzso were able to interfere with complement factors without zzso zzso A range of binding zzso showed direct binding between zzso and seven complement proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while significant binding of zzso occurred exclusively to complement factors without zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was observed between zzso and the complement zzso zzso and zzso However no complex formation was observed between either zzso zzso and the complement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No zzso zzso by either zzso was observed for any of these zzso In zzso the zzso were acting at several levels zzso overall zzso of the complement system and thus we propose that they may protect zzso zzso from zzso gut zzso
