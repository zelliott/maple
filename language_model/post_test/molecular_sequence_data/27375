Most zzso proteins are zzso by the nuclear zzso and consequently, need to be transported into zzso across multiple envelope zzso In diverse organisms possessing secondary zzso zzso zzso precursor proteins zzso commonly have an zzso extension that consists of an zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and a transit zzso sequence zzso This zzso targeting zzso is believed to be necessary for targeting the zzso into the secondary zzso Here, we newly demonstrate the function of the zzso targeting peptides of an zzso group, zzso and characterize the functional zzso of the zzso in the precursor of a zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso using a zzso as a reporter zzso We show that the zzso portion of the zzso is important for targeting the zzso zzso from the zzso into the zzso zzso and several positively charged zzso acids in the zzso are also necessary for transporting the zzso across the 2 zzso zzso zzso Compared with other groups with secondary zzso the zzso functional zzso of the zzso are unique, which might be caused by independent acquisition of their zzso
