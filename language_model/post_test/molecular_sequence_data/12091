Ever since the discovery that the human zzso zzso zzso gene is induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88 (1991) zzso and contains zzso regulatory elements zzso et zzso Gene 128 zzso zzso the biological rationale for this induction has remained zzso A survey of immune system proteins in this study reveals that the human major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and complement factor B, which are known to be induced by zzso together with zzso zzso are all exceptionally enriched in zzso zzso as compared to human proteins in zzso It also reveals the conservation of a sequence zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The conservation of this sequence motif and the utility of zzso zzso within zzso sites clearly contribute to the zzso enrichment in zzso These observations suggest a biological rationale for the induction of zzso by zzso in safeguarding zzso incorporation for the zzso synthesis of zzso zzso
