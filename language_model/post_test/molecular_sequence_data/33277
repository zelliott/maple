zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso that contributes to the zzso cell wall architecture of zzso Nevertheless, because of its potent zzso functions, zzso zzso appear to have evolved an zzso maneuver to zzso zzso expression within the zzso We have shown previously that zzso tuberculosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso replace zzso with zzso zzso zzso by borrowing zzso zzso as an alternative zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso is also known to zzso zzso expression in infected zzso but the function of its zzso has been poorly zzso We found that, unlike zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unexpectedly inefficient in transferring zzso zzso resulting in impaired production of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that a bulky side chain of zzso at position 130 of zzso zzso zzso the zzso tunnel that was proposed to accommodate the zzso portion of the zzso zzso even after a highly reductive evolution, zzso zzso remained functional in terms of transferring zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role that is distinct from that as a zzso
