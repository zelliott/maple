zzso A, a zzso zzso zzso of activated zzso T cells and natural killer cells, has been reported to play a critical role in DNA fragmentation of target zzso To address the question of the biological role of zzso A, we have now generated a zzso zzso mouse zzso by zzso zzso Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso and reverse zzso confirmed the absence of zzso A in activated T zzso In addition, deletion of zzso A does not alter the expression patterns of other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice are healthy and show normal zzso zzso Most notably, their in zzso and ex zzso zzso T cells and natural killer cells are indistinguishable from those of normal mice in causing membrane zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation in target zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mice readily recover from both zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso infections and eradicate zzso tumors with zzso similar to the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso A does not play a primary role in zzso zzso as has been assumed zzso
