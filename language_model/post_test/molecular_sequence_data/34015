The development of methodology that is designed to allow a significant increase in the patterning and in the zzso of the zzso is the ultimate goal of the research described zzso zzso clusters based on zzso were formed using click chemistry and were attached to zzso zzso A series of zzso bearing zzso and an zzso group was zzso and the binding interactions of these zzso with zzso A were evaluated using zzso zzso The results of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso clusters can replace individual zzso on the zzso without loss of zzso Since zzso zzso allows for a zzso of the zzso surface zzso from this chemistry one can envision patterned zzso that incorporate multiple groups to increase the function and utility of the zzso
