zzso zzso a close relative of zzso provides a source of novel genes for wheat zzso zzso markers were developed to monitor the zzso of zzso zzso zzso segments into zzso zzso zzso simple sequence repeats zzso derived from zzso libraries were initially screened for detecting zzso zzso zzso in zzso but only 6 of the zzso markers tested were zzso To increase detection of zzso zzso specific zzso 165 zzso were identified from wheat expressed sequence tags zzso where their zzso positions in wheat were known from deletion bin zzso zzso sequence analysis identified 41 zzso within this group as potentially superior in their ability to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso alignments were used to position zzso within regions of the zzso that have sequence conservation with at least 1 similar zzso from another cereal zzso The targeting of zzso in this manner enabled 14 zzso zzso markers from 41 wheat zzso to be identified, whereas only 2 from 124 zzso designed in random positions zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lines were used to assign all 22 markers to specific zzso locations in zzso zzso Nine of these zzso markers were assigned to zzso zzso locations based on their similar position in zzso zzso The remaining markers mapped to other zzso zzso zzso indicating a degree of zzso zzso zzso sequences and zzso sequence variation between the 2 zzso The zzso markers were also used to screen other wheatgrass species indicating further zzso zzso and zzso sequence variation between wheatgrass zzso This study details zzso for the generation of zzso for detecting zzso zzso zzso
