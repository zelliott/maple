zzso which control human zzso early gene expression have previously been localized to sequences in the upstream regulatory region zzso which are zzso to the E6 open reading zzso These elements include an zzso element which functions zzso in zzso as well as promoter zzso The function of the remaining approximate zzso region of the zzso in regulating viral expression in the high risk zzso has been largely zzso In zzso 6, a negative regulator of early zzso or zzso has been identified in this zzso region of the zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of the zzso portion of the zzso 31 zzso in regulating viral zzso zzso in this region were found to exert a minimal negative effect on zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso sequence within this region was found to exhibit zzso activity on zzso and zzso zzso This zzso also zzso the activity of the previously identified minimum zzso zzso The cellular factors, zzso and zzso were determined by zzso I footprint analysis and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso to bind the zzso zzso The binding of zzso to two of these sites was found to be important for zzso zzso
