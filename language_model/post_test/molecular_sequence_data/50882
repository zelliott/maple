zzso chain reaction was applied to human zzso DNA using zzso corresponding to the rat substance P zzso zzso As a result, a zzso of 94 zzso was isolated identical to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the exception of the zzso substitution zzso in the zzso acid zzso A comparison of the established sequence with the published structures of zzso receptors of zzso zzso and zzso types allows its assignment to the substance P zzso zzso zzso zzso gene detected in the human zzso
