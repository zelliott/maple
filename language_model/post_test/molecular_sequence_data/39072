zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso cause zzso zzso zzso an zzso error of metabolism characterized by severe neurological zzso We have determined the structure of zzso and of its zzso zzso and studied their expression for a molecular analysis of zzso The zzso gene spans at least 135 zzso and consists of 25 zzso All donor and zzso sites adhere to the zzso zzso rule, except for the donor site of zzso 21, where a zzso form zzso is used instead of zzso The zzso initiation site has been assigned to a zzso zzso zzso upstream from the translation initiation zzso by primer extension zzso The zzso gene has no zzso and shares zzso zzso with the coding region of functional zzso suggesting that zzso is a processed zzso that arose from the zzso transcript about zzso million years zzso zzso zzso analysis has revealed that zzso is expressed in human liver, zzso brain, and zzso We have also examined a patient with zzso with no zzso zzso zzso in his zzso zzso 1-3 of the functional zzso gene from this patient are not amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso whereas those from control subjects zzso These results suggest a large zzso deletion (at least 30 zzso in the zzso Furthermore, we have devised a zzso zzso to estimate the number of zzso zzso by using zzso as an internal control and have confirmed the zzso and zzso of the deletion in the patient and his parents, zzso zzso information of zzso and zzso should facilitate the molecular analysis of zzso
