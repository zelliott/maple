zzso regulating retinal zzso in zzso are not clearly zzso In zzso events leading to the zzso of zzso have been proposed to participate in stringent regulation of retinal zzso The present study describes a novel approach of in zzso introductions of zzso and membrane proteins via zzso fusion to test their role in cellular zzso Both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are independently introduced in zzso of the purple zzso strain zzso zzso that initially contain neither zzso nor zzso zzso analyses of these cells indicate that the zzso of zzso triggers retinal zzso from zzso and its subsequent binding to zzso generates zzso When zzso and excess retinal were independently introduced into zzso of purple zzso cells, the introduction of zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso indicating an zzso of retinal zzso These results provide direct evidence that the formation of zzso acts as a trigger for lycopene conversion to zzso in retinal zzso The trigger for this event does not lie with either zzso or translation of the bop zzso It is clearly associated with the folded and the zzso state of zzso On the other hand, the trigger signaling zzso of retinal zzso does not lie with the presence of excess retinal but with the correctly zzso zzso form, zzso
