Using a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of the beta zzso the zzso relationship study of zzso zzso 2 zzso was performed with regard to its previously reported property to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso beta zzso prevents the thick filament formation and zzso the zzso structure of the zzso Furthermore, the zzso beta zzso stimulates the zzso activity by zzso toward zzso zzso as well as the intrinsic zzso of the zzso Such observations are in agreement with the proposed model of an activated state of zzso when the zzso structure is zzso zzso of the effects of zzso and zzso beta zzso on zzso structure and activity suggests that these two zzso molecules may function in a different zzso Our study suggests that the zzso region of the beta zzso of zzso could regulate the zzso activity by controlling the zzso structure of the zzso
