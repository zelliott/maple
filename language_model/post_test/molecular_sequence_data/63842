Three zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso roots of zzso zzso zzso plant via the screening of a zzso library, and their expressions were assessed to characterize functions of each zzso in relation to environmental zzso Three zzso were divided into two groups, designated the basic zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso values of mature zzso Fluorescence microscope analysis indicated that three zzso are zzso into the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso genes have diverse expression patterns in a variety of plant zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in stem zzso whereas the expression levels of zzso and zzso transcripts were high in zzso and thick pigmented zzso zzso and zzso showed abundant expression levels in suspension cultured zzso Three zzso genes responded differently in the leaf and zzso roots in response to a variety of stresses including dehydration, temperature stress, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
