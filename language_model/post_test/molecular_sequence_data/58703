A heat shock zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso The putative translation product of zzso contains zzso zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso and is more similar to the zzso zzso zzso heat shock zzso protein zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso gene product zzso zzso The zzso zzso was abundant during zzso growth at 23 degrees C and decreased upon heat zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso protein is also abundant and zzso zzso however, we could not observe significant change in the protein level upon heat zzso DNA zzso analyses indicated that zzso is localized in zzso zzso II, and suggested that the zzso zzso contains a relatively smaller number of zzso genes compared with the zzso zzso
