zzso analysis was carried out of a human clone zzso generated after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was not available in the zzso It revealed the presence of a zzso core motif of zzso zzso present 23 times, which was zzso and zzso in zzso zzso blots of zzso human DNA, when zzso with zzso generated a zzso of bands between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of 88 unrelated individuals belonging to four regions of India using this probe revealed zzso bands which were individual zzso The probability of identity ranged from zzso in Punjabis to zzso in zzso and was found to be zzso in zzso whereas in the case of South Indians, it was zzso Three sets of zzso bands at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were common between the individuals of all the regions and served as internal zzso The zzso band was observed to be Homo sapiens zzso Construction of zzso based on the zzso method with zzso zzso values suggested less genetic zzso genetic diversity in all the population groups, indicating that the samples taken were zzso zzso likelihood estimates through the zzso sampling method showed that Punjabis, zzso and zzso formed one zzso whereas South Indians formed a separate zzso altogether thus showing the proximity of these three population groups compared with that from South zzso A preliminary study by Northern zzso with zzso resulted in two transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This finding was zzso with zzso results where 2 zzso matching the expected size of two open reading frames within the zzso zzso were zzso The role of the two transcripts from the zzso sequence is not clear as yet, and it is probable that these messages may not get translated because of the absence of a zzso zzso sequence around the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
