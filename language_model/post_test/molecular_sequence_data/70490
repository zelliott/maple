The molecular mechanism leading to the imprinted expression of genes is poorly zzso While no zzso zzso elements have been identified within the known zzso many imprinted genes are located near directly repetitive sequence zzso suggesting that such repeats might play a role in imprinted gene zzso The zzso expressed mouse zzso gene is located approximately zzso zzso downstream from a zzso zzso repetitive zzso We have used a transgenic model to investigate whether this element is essential for zzso zzso Previous results demonstrated that a zzso which contains 14 zzso of zzso zzso exhibits zzso specific expression and zzso analogous to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have generated zzso lacking the zzso zzso One zzso containing a deletion of the zzso repetitive element but which includes an additional zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is imprinted similarly to the zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso repeat is zzso in other imprinted zzso zzso zzso additional zzso zzso sequences were cloned from the rat and zzso This element is zzso in the rat but not in human zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso repetitive element is not essential for zzso zzso
