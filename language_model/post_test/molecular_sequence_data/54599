zzso evolution zzso the emergence of viruses with unpredictable impacts on human zzso This study investigated zzso variations of the zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso gene of the avian H5N1 viruses obtained from the 2004 and 2005 zzso The results showed that the zzso frequency of the zzso ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso generated one consensus and several minor zzso The consensus population of the 2004 epidemic was transmitted to the 2005 outbreak with increased frequency zzso and zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulation was applied to predict the significance of the zzso The results revealed that the consensus sequence zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso with an zzso linkage zzso Although the zzso zzso and zzso sequences decreased the zzso binding capacity to zzso zzso they were shown to bind zzso zzso with increased zzso Moreover, the zzso at zzso 140 and 191 were zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso may represent a step towards human adaptation of the avian H5N1 zzso
