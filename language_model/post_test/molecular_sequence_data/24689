A central region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was replaced by the equivalent sequences from zzso and zzso to give the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the former construct failed to form zzso at the cell surface with zzso the later of these could be expressed together with the zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso Based on recent zzso work, the zzso region consists of two parts, one is the zzso end of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the other the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso exchanging the two component regions were zzso Of the four zzso zzso only the zzso zzso failed to support zzso zzso Thus the zzso specific zzso of this region affect the interaction with the zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso is zzso like with respect to zzso zzso the zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso are more adhesive than the zzso These results suggest that an authentic zzso zzso is, in part, required for maintaining the zzso in a resting zzso
