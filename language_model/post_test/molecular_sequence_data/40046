A novel zzso involved in the synthesis of a zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso from zzso was zzso to zzso from the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was estimated to be zzso The molecular mass of the zzso was estimated to be 184 zzso by gel zzso and 106 zzso by zzso These results suggest that the zzso forms a zzso zzso It was most active at pH zzso to zzso at 50 degrees C, and stable from pH zzso to zzso at up to 35 degrees zzso The addition of 1 zzso zzso enhanced the zzso stability of the zzso up to 40 degrees zzso It acted on zzso that have degrees of zzso of 3 or more, zzso and soluble zzso to produce zzso by an zzso zzso transfer zzso It also zzso the transfer of part of a linear zzso to another zzso by an zzso zzso transfer zzso Thus the zzso zzso was found to be a novel zzso We propose zzso zzso zzso as the trivial name of this zzso
