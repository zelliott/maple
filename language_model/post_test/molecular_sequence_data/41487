zzso zzso one of the most prevalent human zzso used to be thought to lack small regulatory zzso zzso which are otherwise considered abundant in all zzso However, our recent analysis of the primary zzso of zzso zzso discovered an unexpectedly large number of zzso and suggested that this model zzso also uses zzso to control the expression of its zzso Nonetheless, whereas most zzso zzso require the zzso zzso zzso for function, zzso including zzso zzso seem to have no zzso zzso which prompted us to search for other auxiliary proteins in zzso zzso zzso we have developed two zzso methods to isolate and investigate in zzso and in zzso assembled zzso complexes in zzso zzso zzso an affinity zzso strategy based on zzso zzso of interest to identify their protein binding zzso and zzso a rapid method for zzso zzso of proteins to facilitate zzso of associated zzso zzso Using these methods, we have identified zzso interactions between the zzso protein zzso and various zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, both methods reported a stable zzso complex between the abundant zzso zzso and zzso a protein of unknown function that is zzso downstream of zzso Given that 50% of all bacteria may lack zzso our methods can be useful to identify zzso interactions in a wider range of bacterial zzso
