The zzso gene family in zzso zzso consists of one zzso and two zzso genes zzso I and zzso We present here data indicating that zzso II is expressed only in male sexual stage zzso An zzso zzso zzso specifically reacted with stage III zzso zzso through mature zzso zzso male zzso and with emerging, zzso or freely moving male zzso No zzso was detected in female zzso female zzso zzso or asexual zzso zzso zzso also specifically recognized male zzso of the avian zzso zzso zzso and zzso a 50 zzso protein in extracts of male zzso from both zzso This 50 zzso zzso was localized by zzso zzso to zzso of male zzso in a pattern similar to that obtained with zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso specifically reacted with zzso zzso II protein obtained using the zzso zzso II gene from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso II and its zzso to zzso of the male zzso suggest a role for this zzso in the zzso changes that occur during zzso and in the zzso of the zzso zzso II and zzso zzso may prove useful tools in studies of the biology of sexual stage differentiation and development in zzso zzso in addition to the general understanding of zzso modifications of zzso zzso
