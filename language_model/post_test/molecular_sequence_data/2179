From a human fetal liver zzso library, a zzso clone zzso zzso containing the entire coding region for a form of zzso zzso related to zzso zzso was zzso The clone was zzso zzso long and had an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso were very similar to but clearly distinct from those of zzso and zzso zzso which code for forms of zzso zzso in adult human zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein was identical to that of zzso zzso
