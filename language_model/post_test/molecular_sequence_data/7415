zzso zzso is a member of a novel group of zzso which was initially identified as a zzso protein with a role in zzso zzso Three distinct zzso genes zzso I, II and zzso with a zzso ubiquitous or zzso zzso respectively, have been identified in zzso In man, only zzso I has so far been zzso We have previously isolated a zzso DNA zzso implicated in the correction of zzso C hypersensitivity of cells from a zzso anemia patient belonging to genetic zzso group D zzso Using this probe, we have cloned a human complementary DNA designated zzso II zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso The predicted protein consists of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso proteins exhibit a high degree of evolutionary zzso zzso II is zzso identical to rat zzso II and zzso identical to zzso zzso A unique zzso transcript is found in all human zzso examined and it is more abundant in skeletal muscle and zzso This transcript is also expressed in zzso zzso The zzso II message is present and not zzso in the zzso patient zzso In addition to the zzso domain and motifs associated with regulatory function, the zzso II protein contains a noticeable number of zzso motifs for zzso zzso zzso which may indicate a potential role at the zzso zzso The sequence reported here should allow a more complete analysis of zzso zzso in zzso
