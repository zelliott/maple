zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso expressed in the human B zzso cells, zzso but not in normal B cells, and with the zzso zzso zzso expressed in normal B zzso but not in transformed B zzso To characterize the zzso domain interacting with these two zzso zzso we zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso corresponding to its zzso zzso domain and analyzed its binding and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso on immobilized zzso was specific, zzso and totally inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso respectively, but not by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso properties of zzso were analyzed by zzso rabbits with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carried zzso zzso that recognized only the zzso domain of zzso In addition, zzso zzso also carried zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were not due to putative common structural or zzso zzso zzso between the zzso synthetic zzso and the zzso or zzso zzso These zzso and zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso mimicking either zzso or zzso binding sites of zzso These data clearly establish that despite its short zzso the zzso zzso tail of zzso is involved in direct zzso interactions with the two zzso regulatory zzso zzso and zzso An additional feature of these data is the demonstration that zzso zzso triggered zzso zzso zzso zzso restricted to either zzso or zzso zzso
