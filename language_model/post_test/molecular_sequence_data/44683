zzso of zzso by synthetic zzso and their zzso complementary to specific zzso regions of zzso zzso and corresponding sequences of zzso zzso DNA was zzso It was shown that zzso zzso inhibited zzso in zzso for above zzso interacting specifically with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso The zzso efficiency depended on zzso sequence and type of zzso zzso in zzso was suppressed most efficiently (up to zzso by zzso complementary to zzso region of zzso zzso also depending on their zzso zzso in zzso was inhibited most efficiently (up to zzso by zzso zzso of zzso complementary to sequences zzso and zzso of zzso zzso responsible for binding of zzso zzso protein zzso starting the assembly of zzso zzso zzso With the simultaneous use of the last two zzso the growth of zzso in zzso zzso medium rich in zzso sources of zzso was suppressed for over zzso It is supposed that under conditions where zzso have no free access to starting materials for their own synthesis of zzso acid these zzso could suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso are considered as zzso agents not leading to the development of resistance of zzso and believed to be the main future remedy against diseased caused by zzso lacking the system of zzso zzso
