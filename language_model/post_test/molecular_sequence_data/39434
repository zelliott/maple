zzso is widely found to play essential roles in zzso of new zzso and other animal zzso However, the zzso of zzso in plants has led to the assumption that plant zzso rarely evolve new gene zzso by zzso despite abundant zzso in plants and a reported long terminal repeat zzso zzso mechanism of zzso cellular genes in zzso zzso zzso We show extensive zzso in the rice zzso zzso zzso with zzso identified primary zzso We identified 27 of these primary zzso within zzso zzso confirming a previously observed role of zzso in generating plant zzso zzso analyses revealed that the vast majority are subject to negative selection, zzso along with expression data and evidence of age, that they are likely functional zzso In addition, zzso of these zzso have recruited new zzso from zzso regions, generating a large number of zzso zzso We also identified young zzso zzso suggesting that gene zzso through zzso is zzso with a rate an order of magnitude higher than the rate in zzso Finally, we observed that zzso have followed an unexpected spatial pattern in which functional zzso avoid zzso regions, while zzso are randomly zzso These observations suggest that zzso is an important mechanism that zzso gene evolution in rice and other grass zzso
