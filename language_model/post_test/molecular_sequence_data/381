The zzso zzso constitutes the initiating event of a zzso cascade leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in blood from healthy individuals, but there is a trend of increased prevalence in farmers exposed to zzso a group recently associated with higher risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso A direct connection between agricultural zzso use, zzso in blood, and zzso zzso however, has not yet been zzso We followed zzso zzso evolution over 9 zzso in a cohort of farmers exposed to zzso We show that exposed individuals bear particularly high zzso zzso in blood because of a dramatic zzso expansion of activated zzso B zzso We further demonstrate that such zzso clones zzso the hallmark features of zzso blocked FL cells, with some displaying zzso zzso zzso zzso activity linked to zzso zzso zzso our data establish that expanded zzso clones constitute bona fide precursors at various stages of FL development, and provide a molecular connection between agricultural zzso exposure, zzso frequency in blood, and zzso zzso
