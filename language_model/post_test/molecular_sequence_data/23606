The zzso module zzso is a class of zzso proteins that contains a zzso zzso zzso element known as the zzso zzso zzso module proteins include the zzso zzso the cellular slime mold zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These proteins possess a similar modular organization that includes an zzso module at their zzso and either a zzso domain or an zzso domain at their zzso As a result of this modular organization, zzso module proteins may serve as zzso between cellular zzso such as the plasma membrane and the zzso machinery, and the zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso module proteins bind to zzso In this report, we have determined the affinity of the zzso module proteins zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso for zzso and identified a zzso structural element that interferes with the zzso binding capacity of these zzso Our data support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso in native zzso and other zzso module proteins are cryptic and indicate that the zzso binding capacities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are regulated by zzso zzso of primary zzso zzso within the zzso zzso We have also found that the zzso module contains a zzso motif and zzso zzso filaments against zzso This activity may contribute to the function of zzso in cell zzso and the roles of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
