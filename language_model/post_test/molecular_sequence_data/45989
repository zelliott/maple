The b zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso serves essential roles as an assembly factor for the zzso and as a zzso during zzso zzso To investigate the functional importance of its coiled zzso zzso domain, a series of internal deletions including each individual zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as a control zzso zzso zzso were zzso All of the zzso supported assembly of zzso zzso but all zzso deletions failed to support growth on zzso indicating a severe zzso in zzso zzso and zzso displayed moderately reduced zzso The zzso zzso activities of these strains showed a related reduction in sensitivity to zzso indicative of zzso Analysis of zzso of the soluble zzso of zzso and the zzso deletions by zzso equilibrium revealed reduced zzso compared with wild type for all zzso with zzso most severely zzso In zzso studies it was found that zzso can mediate the zzso of some soluble b zzso but did not mediate zzso of zzso and zzso these two forms also were defective in F1 binding zzso We conclude that defective zzso of soluble b zzso severely affects F1 binding in zzso yet allows assembly of zzso zzso in zzso The highly zzso nature of zzso with zzso deletions in b indicates that the b zzso serves an active function in energy zzso rather than just holding on to the F1 zzso This function is proposed to depend on proper, specific interactions between the b zzso and zzso
