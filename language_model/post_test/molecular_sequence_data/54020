There is much zzso between individuals in the response to zzso zzso but it is not known why certain people develop disease when challenged with environmental agents and others remain zzso To address this, we investigated whether zzso zzso the zzso zzso which has been shown to affect zzso zzso responsiveness in mice, zzso the zzso in airway responsiveness to zzso zzso in zzso Here we show that common, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso affecting the zzso domain of the zzso zzso are associated with a blunted response to zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso cells demonstrates that the zzso zzso (but not the zzso zzso interrupts zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in either primary airway zzso cells or zzso zzso obtained from individuals with the zzso zzso Our findings provide the first genetic evidence that common zzso in zzso are associated with differences in zzso responsiveness in humans, and demonstrate that zzso changes can alter the ability of the host to respond to environmental zzso
