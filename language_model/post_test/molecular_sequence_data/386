The zzso zzso are zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso there are three zzso genes located in zzso zzso and zzso contained within a single zzso It has been suggested that these genes originated from two successive zzso with zzso being generated first and zzso and zzso zzso Despite gene conversion being considered the main mechanism of concerted evolution in gene families, previous studies of primates zzso failed to detect it, although the occurrence of gene conversion between zzso and zzso was recently reported in a human zzso The primary aim of our work was to initiate a broader study on the molecular evolution of zzso zzso zzso comparison leads us to confirm that the three genes appeared by two rounds of zzso In addition, we were able to detect multiple zzso events at the base of primates and within several zzso species involving zzso and zzso Gene conversion involving zzso and either zzso or zzso was also detected in zzso The extent of gene conversion between the zzso genes appears to be zzso possibly related to functional differentiation of these zzso With the exception of zzso gene conversion was not observed in the region coding the zzso part of the zzso zzso In this region, the number of zzso acids that are identical between zzso and zzso but different in zzso is higher than in other parts of the zzso The zzso meaning of this observation may be related to functional zzso
