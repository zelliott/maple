zzso zzso zzso mature zzso proteins zzso and zzso of zzso were amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso and cloned into the expression zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in high yield ( approximately zzso of the total soluble protein and zzso of the total expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were active on a variety of artificial and natural zzso at levels similar to those of their native counterparts isolated from zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed that both zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and their molecular sizes were identical to those of the native zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in native gels revealed that zzso zzso had the same zzso mobility and zzso specificity as their native zzso
