The insect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of the single insect zzso zzso zzso zzso which is structurally related to zzso However, in contrast to the fate of LDL, which is zzso by zzso we previously demonstrated that after zzso zzso is sorted to the zzso recycling compartment and recycled for zzso in a zzso zzso This means that the integrity of the complex between zzso and zzso is retained under zzso zzso zzso in this study, the zzso and zzso capacities of zzso were investigated by employing a new flow zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso At pH zzso the zzso complex remained stable, whereas that of zzso and LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso containing either the zzso or both the zzso and the hinge region of zzso appeared to be unable to release zzso at zzso zzso revealing that the stability of the complex is imparted by the zzso domain of zzso The zzso complex additionally appeared to be zzso excluding a low zzso concentration in the zzso as an alternative trigger for complex zzso From binding of zzso to the above hybrid zzso it was zzso that the stability upon zzso treatment is confined to zzso type A zzso zzso repeats zzso Additional zzso binding experiments indicated that the binding site of zzso for zzso most likely involves zzso It is therefore proposed that the remarkable stability of the zzso complex is attributable to this binding zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso and zzso travel in complex to the zzso recycling zzso which constitutes a key zzso for zzso recycling by zzso
