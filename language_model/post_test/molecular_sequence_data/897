In our recent publication, we defined core aspects of the zzso specificity of zzso of zzso zzso zzso from rat gastrointestinal tract zzso especially its potent interaction with the linear zzso zzso zzso The assumed role of zzso as a zzso raft zzso and as a zzso factor in zzso and gastrointestinal zzso called for further refinement of its binding zzso Thus, the effects of zzso of zzso and natural modifications of human blood group zzso zzso at the terminal zzso zzso were thoroughly examined by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso strongly favors zzso zzso These zzso were up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso more active than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso is a poor zzso its presence as zzso linked to terminal zzso zzso such as H active zzso markedly enhances the zzso of these zzso zzso when blood group A zzso or B zzso zzso are attached to terminal zzso (or zzso zzso the zzso are also zzso zzso with zzso linked to zzso zzso the zzso of these zzso are zzso and zzso short chain zzso and the short chains of zzso zzso are poor zzso These distinct binding features of zzso establish the important concept of affinity enhancement by high density zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and by introduction of an zzso key sugar to zzso core zzso The zzso zzso binding properties of zzso may help our understanding of its crucial role for cell membrane raft stability and provide salient information for the optimal design of blocking substances such as zzso zzso
