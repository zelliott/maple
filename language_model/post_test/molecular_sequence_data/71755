Hodgkin's disease and zzso zzso zzso occasionally occur in the same zzso The identification of a common precursor of the two types of zzso would show definitively that zzso cells originate from B zzso 

We studied zzso from two patients, one with a composite zzso zzso Hodgkin's disease and a zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso and the other with a zzso zzso zzso that was followed by classic Hodgkin's zzso Single zzso cells and zzso zzso cells from frozen sections were zzso The rearranged zzso zzso genes zzso zzso of the heavy and light chains were amplified by the zzso chain reaction from zzso DNA and zzso 

In both patients, the zzso cells were related zzso to the zzso zzso B zzso The V genes carried zzso zzso (a hallmark of zzso B cells and their zzso In both patients, some zzso zzso were shared by the zzso and zzso zzso cells, whereas other zzso zzso were found exclusively in one or the other cell zzso 

In two patients with classic Hodgkin's disease and zzso zzso lymphoma, we identified a common zzso zzso probably a zzso zzso for both zzso This finding suggests that the two types of zzso underwent both shared and distinct transforming events and provides proof of the zzso derivation of zzso cells in classic Hodgkin's zzso
