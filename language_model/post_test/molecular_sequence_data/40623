The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso contagious zzso a lethal respiratory infectious disease causing great economic losses in the zzso industry zzso In order to better interpret the genetic background of zzso diversity, nine zzso of zzso zzso reference strains of zzso 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 were zzso by using rapid zzso zzso Based on 12 zzso of corresponding zzso reference strains including three publicly available complete zzso zzso 3, zzso and 7) of this zzso we performed a comprehensive analysis of comparative zzso and first reported a global zzso characterization for this zzso zzso of zzso predicted zzso genes showed that the pan zzso of zzso zzso consists of zzso gene zzso which contain zzso core zzso zzso zzso distributed zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso components involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso O zzso relative to zzso diversity were zzso and their genetic diversity was zzso Our findings shed more light on zzso features associated with zzso diversity of zzso zzso and provide broader insight into both zzso research and zzso application against the severe disease caused by this zzso zzso
