The gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso marine strain zzso has been zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso with an apparent temperature optimum of 35 degrees C and a zzso of zzso at 40 degrees zzso The zzso acid sequence shows an identity of zzso to zzso from zzso zzso The primary structure was examined for features that could be related to the zzso of the zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso shows 22 differences with respect to the consensus sequence derived from bacterial zzso Features previously recognized in zzso zzso such as extended surface zzso or a decrease in the number of zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso were not zzso Because dominant features that could be related to the zzso of the zzso from zzso cannot be identified, more subtle modifications of the zzso seem to be responsible for its zzso
