Small zzso peptides are abundantly produced by zzso These peptides are active against a broad range of zzso notably bacteria, zzso and enveloped zzso but hardly anything is known about their zzso and zzso zzso We observed that zzso a zzso is strongly zzso to rat embryonic zzso fetal rat zzso and human zzso zzso This zzso is unique to zzso as a panel of zzso peptides from zzso and zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I, the zzso or zzso did not impair zzso zzso
