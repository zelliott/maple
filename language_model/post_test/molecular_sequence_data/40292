zzso use specialized zzso systems and targeting signals to zzso zzso proteins inside host cells, a process that is essential for promoting disease and zzso However, the zzso acid sequences that determine host delivery of zzso pathogen zzso remain mostly zzso The zzso zzso proteins of zzso plant zzso such as the Irish potato famine zzso zzso zzso are modular proteins with predicted zzso signals and zzso zzso sequence zzso Here, we provide direct evidence that zzso N zzso mediate protein transport into plant zzso zzso host zzso requires a zzso motif that is present in all examined plant zzso zzso including the zzso divergent species zzso zzso that does not form zzso specialized infection structures that have been implicated previously in delivery of zzso Several distinct zzso C zzso localized to plant zzso and, in the case of zzso required nuclear zzso to induce plant cell zzso These results reveal a large family of ubiquitous zzso zzso proteins that target the host zzso zzso appear to have acquired the ability to zzso zzso proteins inside plant cells relatively early in their evolution and before the emergence of zzso Finally, this work further implicates the host nucleus as an important cellular compartment where the fate of zzso interactions is zzso
