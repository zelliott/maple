Large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels control zzso in many zzso and are regulated by several protein zzso and zzso that remain associated with the channels in zzso patches of zzso Here, we report the identification of a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the C zzso of zzso BK channels that is required for zzso protein zzso zzso to associate with the channel and regulate its zzso A synthetic zzso encompassing the central d position zzso zzso in zzso blocks the regulation of zzso mouse BK channels by zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, neither an zzso zzso zzso nor a zzso corresponding to another, more zzso putative zzso zzso zzso had any effect on regulation of the channels by zzso zzso zzso of the central two zzso d position zzso to zzso in the BK channel also eliminated regulation by zzso zzso in zzso cells without altering the channel sensitivity to zzso by zzso or by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso insert in the BK channel zzso which switches channel regulation by zzso from stimulation to zzso did not alter the requirement for an intact zzso Although zzso does not bind directly to the channel protein in zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso of zzso and the respective BK channel zzso zzso from zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso acid fusion protein encompassing the functional zzso domain zzso a zzso complex from rat zzso Thus zzso is required for the association and regulation of zzso BK channels by zzso and other putative zzso zzso in the BK channel protein may provide zzso for other regulatory zzso zzso
