Cancer cells of microscopic zzso can be zzso as ideal constituents for the development of a genetically zzso zzso tumor cell zzso However, their extremely low number has thus far blocked this zzso 

The aim of this study was to culture zzso tumor cells present in bone zzso of patients with various forms of zzso cancer and to thereby establish immortalized cell zzso 

Bone zzso zzso from the upper zzso crest of 152 patients with cancer of the zzso zzso zzso breast, or zzso were cultured at 1 zzso zzso to 6 zzso zzso zzso cells zzso per flask in fetal calf zzso zzso medium supplemented with 10 zzso zzso growth factor and 10 zzso basic zzso growth zzso The proliferation of zzso cells on zzso zzso plates was monitored by sampling and zzso zzso with zzso zzso After 3-6 weeks in culture, the cells were transferred to zzso dishes, and zzso zzso cells per plate were zzso with DNA zzso for the zzso virus 40 zzso large T zzso zzso were screened at various time points for expression of large T zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso their bone zzso potential was tested in zzso zzso zzso severe combined zzso mice given subcutaneous transplants of the immortalized zzso 

Prior to culture, more than zzso of all samples presented with fewer than 10 tumor cells per 8 zzso zzso zzso In 68 cases zzso the established culture conditions allowed a two to four log transient expansion of these cells with rather small differences among the tumor types zzso zzso growth factor and basic zzso growth factor were found to be essential for this culture zzso After zzso of the zzso cells with zzso DNA, permanent cell lines were zzso some of these cell lines zzso and lung cancer cell zzso are now beyond culture passage zzso The cells showed no notable changes in the pattern of expressed zzso zzso and were able to zzso into bone zzso in zzso zzso 

This procedure allows the selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA and expression of T zzso did not substantially change the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

The established system will allow an in-depth molecular analysis of human zzso cancer cells and could become a useful source for the generation of zzso tumor cell zzso
