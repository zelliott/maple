zzso zzso is a zzso entity that includes zzso focal zzso zzso often of the collapsing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence supports a role for zzso infection of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso we previously demonstrated zzso gag and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells of patients with zzso zzso Here, to investigate whether zzso zzso cells were zzso infected by zzso we examined zzso tissue for the presence of zzso DNA and zzso by in zzso zzso and zzso and we zzso characterized the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were removed by zzso zzso from zzso of two patients, DNA was zzso and zzso zzso or zzso sequences were amplified from individually dissected cells by zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences as well as corresponding sequences from peripheral blood zzso cells of the same patients revealed evidence of zzso viral zzso In zzso trees constructed from zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences formed zzso zzso within the radiation of blood zzso zzso viral sequences from both zzso These data, along with the detection of zzso zzso DNA and zzso in zzso zzso cells, argue strongly for localized replication of zzso in the kidney and the existence of a zzso viral zzso
