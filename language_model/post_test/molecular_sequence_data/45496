zzso alignment of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso suggests the presence of an unusual active site structure in which two zzso zzso occupy the zzso and B10 zzso zzso In the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso such an zzso zzso pair at the putative zzso positions has been observed, although the zzso zzso is displaced toward CD region of the zzso zzso zzso data on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show that interactions of zzso zzso with neighboring zzso acid zzso are zzso Multiple zzso in the CO complex, termed the C, O, and N zzso are zzso The zzso are separated by a large difference zzso 60 zzso in the zzso of their zzso stretching zzso In the C zzso the zzso stretching frequency is very high, zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso stretching of the N zzso appears at an unusually low frequency, zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for the two zzso A population of an O zzso is seen in both zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso The C zzso is stabilized by a strong polar interaction of the CO with the zzso B10 zzso zzso The O zzso is similar to the ones typically seen in zzso zzso in which there are no strong interactions between the CO and zzso in the zzso zzso The N zzso possesses an unusual zzso in which a zzso charged group, assigned as the oxygen atom of the B10 zzso side chain, interacts with the zzso In this zzso the B10 zzso assumes an alternative zzso consistent with one of the zzso seen the crystal zzso zzso of the multiple zzso on the zzso zzso are zzso
