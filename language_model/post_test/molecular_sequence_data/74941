zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the last step of zzso acid zzso in many zzso however, it is missing in zzso animals such as humans, zzso and guinea zzso A zzso clone for this zzso was isolated by screening a rat liver zzso expression library in zzso zzso using zzso directed against the zzso The zzso clone contained 2120 zzso and an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso 440 zzso acids of the protein with a molecular weight of zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso of the zzso isolated from rat liver completely coincided with the corresponding part of the deduced zzso acid zzso The identity of the zzso clone was further confirmed by the agreement of the composition of the deduced zzso acids with that determined by zzso acid analysis of the zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed several zzso regions, suggesting that they anchor the protein into the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed no obvious zzso with the zzso regions of other eight zzso
