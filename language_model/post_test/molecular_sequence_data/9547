Variation in plant species richness has been described using only zzso zzso The species richness of roots and zzso has never been compared with zzso richness in natural plant zzso We made direct comparisons of zzso plant richness in identical volumes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso above and below the soil surface, using conventional species identification to measure zzso richness and zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso We described zzso and zzso richness at multiple spatial scales (from a zzso scale of zzso to a community scale of hundreds of zzso and related variation in richness to soil zzso Tests using reference material indicated that zzso sequencing captured patterns of species composition and abundance with acceptable zzso At zzso zzso zzso richness was up to two times greater than zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso richness was significantly different from zzso beyond a certain level of zzso zzso zzso richness did not increase zzso zzso richness also exceeded that of zzso at the community scale, indicating that some species are temporarily dormant and absent zzso Similar to other zzso studies, zzso richness declined with increasing soil zzso in contrast, the number of species found only zzso increased significantly with zzso These results indicate that conventional zzso studies of plant richness may overlook many zzso species, and that zzso richness becomes relatively more important in conditions where zzso richness zzso zzso plant zzso richness can considerably alter perceptions of zzso and its responses to natural and anthropogenic zzso
