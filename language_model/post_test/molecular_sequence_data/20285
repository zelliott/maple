We have characterized four new families of zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso all of which include members shown by previous work to be zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso families (where zzso is zzso protein of low zzso zzso proteins with a high proportion of zzso zzso We have also zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso a family of zzso protein genes first described in zzso and additional zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins identified by zzso Our zzso reveal multiple zzso expansions that are specific to zzso or zzso The zzso and zzso families occur within a large and dynamic tandem array on zzso zzso that includes sets of zzso evolving zzso Most gene families exhibit two or more different expression profiles during zzso
