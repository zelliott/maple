For both zzso and zzso prion zzso zzso zzso drives the phenomenon of zzso zzso The zzso conversion of a protein to its zzso prion state is associated with changes to host cellular zzso In zzso this change is synonymous with disease, whereas in zzso no notable zzso effect on the host is typically zzso Instead, zzso zzso can serve as zzso regulators of inheritance in the form of partial zzso zzso In the presence of environmental challenges, the prion state zzso with its resource for zzso zzso can be associated with a growth zzso The growing number of zzso proteins that can switch to a zzso zzso form represents diverse and metabolically penetrating cellular functions, suggesting that the zzso state in zzso is a functional one, albeit rarely found in zzso In this chapter, we introduce the zzso and genetic properties of zzso zzso many of which are shared by the zzso prion protein zzso and then outline the major contributions that studies on zzso zzso have made to prion zzso
