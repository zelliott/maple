The mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso tumor virus zzso transcripts zzso either the entire zzso zzso or segments of zzso In addition to these conventional zzso however, an zzso of about 1 zzso accumulates after induction of these cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this transcript is strongly inhibited by the zzso agent zzso zzso Its pattern of induction by zzso and suppression by zzso A is thus the same as seen for several zzso zzso in these cells, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso The short zzso transcript is the most abundant zzso transcript in zzso cells, but was not found in a series of other zzso tumor cell zzso It is initiated from a novel promoter within the zzso zzso and a segment of zzso zzso is then spliced zzso The major part of the transcript is a copy of the long terminal repeat zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso in these cells, and the short transcript, contain a zzso deletion in the zzso compared with the normal zzso zzso The resulting open reading frame could zzso a protein of molecular weight zzso which is a likely candidate for an zzso protein with a similar molecular weight recently described in this system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
