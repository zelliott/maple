The zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been previously cloned and zzso In the present work, the zzso zzso zzso was initially identified by primer zzso Next, zzso promoter strength in zzso coli K-12 was measured, and was found to be greater than that of the induced zzso zzso To define the zzso zzso zzso DNA including the zzso promoter and the putative first five zzso of the zzso protein was fused to the zzso of zzso and the fusion protein zzso by affinity zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing yielded the zzso zzso zzso Next, the zzso protein was zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso of an zzso zzso strain expressing a zzso zzso gene (five copies per zzso localized the intact zzso protein in the zzso membrane of zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was not zzso from a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso or in zzso coli zzso
