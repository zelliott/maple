The zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso constitute the nut regions of zzso zzso They zzso the formation of a zzso zzso zzso complex on the zzso zzso The complex includes zzso coli proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso N zzso A complex that includes the zzso proteins and other factors forms at the zzso zzso Whereas zzso by zzso and zzso has been described in quantitative terms, the interaction of zzso with these zzso sequences is less zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso equilibrium zzso show that zzso binds only the nut zzso sequence between zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso retain zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso eliminates complex zzso The affinity of zzso for zzso is 50% higher than for zzso In contrast, zzso zzso which includes an additional U zzso binds zzso in the absence of zzso The zzso values obtained for zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso and zzso lower, respectively, than those for zzso zzso These differences may explain why zzso requires an additional zzso zzso zzso to suppress zzso zzso of the different affinities now describes the assembly of the zzso complex in quantitative zzso
