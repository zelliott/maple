The recently devised domain zzso probe technique was used to identify and characterize critical zzso of the cardiac zzso zzso zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of the zzso designated zzso enhanced the zzso binding activity and increased the sensitivity of the zzso to zzso zzso the effects that resemble the typical zzso of cardiac zzso A single zzso zzso made in zzso mimicking the recently reported zzso human zzso abolished all of these effects that would have been produced by zzso On the basis of the principle of the domain zzso probe approach (see Model 1), these results indicate that the in zzso zzso domain corresponding to zzso plays a key role in the cardiac channel regulation and in the zzso zzso This domain zzso approach opens the new possibility in the studies of the regulatory and zzso mechanisms of the cardiac zzso zzso
