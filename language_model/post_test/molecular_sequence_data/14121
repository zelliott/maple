Various stocks of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be infected with zzso a zzso zzso that is known to cause zzso zzso and other zzso abnormalities in zzso Testing for the expression of zzso zzso in these two species showed partial zzso in zzso zzso but no expression of zzso in zzso zzso To determine whether absence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was due to either the bacterial or host zzso we transferred bacteria from zzso zzso into an zzso strain of zzso zzso a host species known to express high levels of zzso with zzso zzso We also performed the zzso transfer of the natural zzso zzso Riverside infection into a zzso stock of zzso zzso In each case, the ability to express zzso was zzso by the different host genetic zzso These experiments indicate that in zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso is determined by the bacterial strain and that zzso zzso harbors a neutral strain of zzso
