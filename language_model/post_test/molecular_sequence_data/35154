The zzso status of the brown dog tick zzso zzso zzso zzso which has long been regarded as the most widespread tick worldwide and a zzso of many pathogens to dogs and humans, is currently under zzso 

We conducted a comprehensive zzso and genetic study of zzso representative zzso which belonged to different species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso collected from Europe, Asia, Americas, and zzso After detailed zzso examination, ticks were zzso processed for the analysis of partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso 

In addition to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso three different operational zzso units zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso II, and zzso zzso zzso were found on zzso These operational zzso units were zzso and genetically different from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified as zzso zzso zzso which zzso to the so-called zzso zzso zzso northern zzso were found in all zzso and genetically it represents a sister group of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found on a wide range of hosts in Italy and also on dogs in zzso
