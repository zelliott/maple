The experiments presented in this study show that the zzso expression of the zzso zzso (formerly zzso gene is likely to be achieved through a variety of regulatory mechanisms operating on several zzso zzso mapping analysis suggested the possibility of multiple zzso transcripts arising from alternative zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso sequences revealed the presence of two zzso zzso the zzso zzso and further zzso an zzso zzso extension analysis to determine the start site of the zzso transcripts and nuclear zzso analysis suggested the use of a more upstream promoter than the one previously zzso The nuclear zzso analysis further suggested that zzso is under zzso zzso zzso H analysis showed that the size difference between the two zzso zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso was due to a zzso increase in zzso tail zzso Only a proportion of the zzso zzso in germ cells was found to be associated with zzso suggesting that zzso regulation may also operate as a means of control of zzso expression in this adult zzso
