A zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso region zzso of 16 bovine viral zzso virus zzso zzso was amplified by reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction, and zzso by zzso DNA zzso The sequence showed greater than zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso in this region, and greater than zzso zzso within a 72 base zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was then used as a probe for rapid detection of zzso and border disease virus zzso from cell culture samples by zzso zzso This probe zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to the zzso zzso cells or other bovine infectious zzso A shorter probe from the more zzso zzso also was tested for zzso with some of the zzso and the results were similar to those using the longer zzso These results suggest that the zzso is highly zzso among zzso and zzso zzso and may be used as a potential probe for rapid detection of zzso and zzso in clinical and cell culture samples from cattle and zzso
