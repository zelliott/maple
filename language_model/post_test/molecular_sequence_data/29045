The contribution of zzso to the microbial degradation of zzso zzso films in soil was zzso Various zzso zzso and grooves observed on the zzso surface of zzso films demonstrated that the degradation was a concerted effect of a microbial consortium colonizing the film surface, including zzso bacteria, and zzso The succession of microbial zzso in the soil around the zzso films during the degradation showed a distinctive increase in the zzso population, resulting in its zzso zzso of the degradation ability of microbial strains isolated from soil where zzso films were zzso revealed that zzso showed the highest contribution to zzso degradation, growing very rapidly along the film surface with their high degradation ability and then expanding their zzso in a three-dimensional zzso
