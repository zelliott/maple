zzso peptides are promising antibiotics as they possess strong zzso activity and very broad zzso of zzso However, administration of an zzso with a very broad spectrum of activity zzso normal zzso and increases the risks of other fatal zzso To solve the problem, we designed a novel zzso zzso that is activated by virulent zzso of zzso zzso We constructed a zzso composed of three zzso namely an zzso zzso zzso as the active center, a protective zzso zzso intervening zzso that suppresses zzso activity, and a specific zzso that joins these two components and is efficiently zzso by virulent zzso We zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso that produces zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso We screened for a zzso sequence efficiently zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified a zzso zzso as the most favorable zzso zzso we chemically zzso a zzso containing the zzso zzso The designed zzso possessed no zzso activity until it was activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it demonstrated selective zzso activity against zzso zzso but not against zzso zzso A designed zzso like the one described in this study may protect normal zzso resulting in enhanced safety as a zzso
