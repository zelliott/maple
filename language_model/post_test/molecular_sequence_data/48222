A series of zzso including derivatives of zzso bearing various functional groups and related zzso have been studied with a view to identifying molecular features which zzso zzso specificity for zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso species, and selectivity for zzso cells in zzso A broad spectrum of zzso specificity exists, but minor changes to the zzso nucleus have a significant effect upon zzso zzso zzso at the zzso are favorable in terms of zzso specificity as these positions are located at the binding site entrance as determined by molecular modeling zzso In contrast, zzso at the zzso position with bulky leaving groups or a group containing a chlorine atom result in compounds which are poor zzso some of which zzso zzso Modeling studies demonstrate that these groups sit close to the mechanistically important zzso acids zzso 156 and His 162 possibly resulting in either zzso within the active site or disruption of zzso zzso An zzso group at the zzso is essential for potency and selectivity to zzso cells under zzso zzso The most efficient zzso induced zzso greater zzso DNA breaks in zzso zzso via a zzso mechanism involving the production of hydrogen zzso zzso zzso This damage is unlikely to form a major part of their mechanism of action in cells since potency does not correlate with extent of DNA zzso In terms of zzso zzso modifications at the zzso generate compounds which are poor zzso for zzso but have high hypoxic zzso zzso
