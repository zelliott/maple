zzso sequences based on the zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso determining gene zzso have been used to isolate a zzso zzso zzso III Y zzso DNA zzso zzso and three human zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso These sequences detect at least four potential zzso on the Y zzso zzso zzso and zzso three on the X zzso zzso and zzso and three of zzso origin zzso zzso and zzso as determined by comparing the fragments detected by different zzso Analysis with zzso of zzso shows that zzso is unique to the Y and that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso are detected by the same zzso of zzso This is also the case for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus these zzso may contain further regions of zzso between the X, Y and an zzso zzso The zzso sequences all lie in zzso and studies with zzso males have placed the zzso sequences in zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso sequence zzso We have confirmed these zzso by in zzso zzso with zzso and have shown additionally that the zzso sequences of both the zzso sequence and zzso map to zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso differ in sequence from zzso at three restriction zzso sites, thus suggesting that they are transcribed from different but closely related genes and that zzso must be either zzso or zzso in zzso This indicates that more than one of the zzso containing zzso sequences are transcribed and potentially zzso functionally distinct roles in the human sex determining zzso Northern zzso analysis of human zzso zzso zzso has shown that three low abundance transcripts of 5, 6 and 8 zzso can be detected by zzso DNA zzso
