The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso promote zzso between DNA molecules that carry attachment zzso The two zzso are about zzso identical in sequence and catalyze nearly identical zzso but recognize different sets of zzso To identify the zzso acids that determine this difference in zzso we selected zzso of zzso zzso with increased ability to recombine zzso zzso This selection yielded zzso different zzso acid zzso at eight different zzso Three of the positions belong to a larger set that were identified as important for the zzso specificity difference by analysis of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for the corresponding zzso zzso at each of these three positions increased zzso of zzso sites, and one double zzso zzso increased zzso to nearly zzso zzso zzso zzso at the other five positions changed zzso that are identical in the zzso proteins or are at positions identified by zzso analysis as zzso for the zzso specificity zzso All of the zzso isolated by selection for increased zzso of zzso sites retained considerable ability to recombine zzso zzso However, we found that substitution of zzso for zzso zzso at three additional positions, zzso zzso and zzso specifically reduced zzso of zzso zzso These three zzso when combined with zzso and zzso were sufficient to change the specificity of zzso to that of zzso zzso The first three zzso act principally to prevent zzso of zzso sites, and the second two to remove a barrier to zzso of zzso zzso We suggest that many natural zzso in the specificity of zzso interactions occur by zzso changes that first relax and then restrict zzso
