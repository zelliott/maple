PAL zzso zzso the first zzso of zzso zzso is often zzso by zzso families in zzso A zzso approach was used to isolate zzso clones corresponding to the four PAL genes of tobacco zzso zzso By careful comparison of zzso and zzso zzso a new PAL gene zzso was zzso zzso amplification of PAL sequences from zzso led to the generation of zzso clones between zzso and zzso and incorrect zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso as zzso in the zzso database has given rise to a randomly shuffled tentative consensus zzso The zzso previously described in the literature was zzso by domain swapping experiments with zzso to possess a single zzso substitution leading to an inactive zzso The altered zzso acid resulting from this substitution maps to the base of the active site pocket in the three-dimensional structure of zzso The inactive zzso zzso could not be recovered from 13 different tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in multiple plant zzso and were also zzso following exposure of cell cultures to zzso zzso or zzso zzso All four tobacco PAL proteins expressed in zzso coli displayed normal zzso zzso with zzso values between 36 and 60 zzso zzso of different PAL proteins in zzso coli resulted in formation of zzso which possessed kinetic properties within the same range as those of the individual zzso The potential zzso function of zzso PAL forms is zzso
