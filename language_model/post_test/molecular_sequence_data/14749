Animal zzso comprise a community of many different zzso including bacteria and zzso Only scarce information is available about the diversity of viruses present in the zzso of zzso Here we describe a zzso which was zzso for the zzso of the total fraction of viral particles from pig zzso The zzso of the zzso DNA and zzso viruses were simultaneously amplified by zzso and subjected to deep sequencing followed by zzso zzso The efficiency of the method was monitored using a process control consisting of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso with different zzso and zzso zzso zzso amounts of the zzso were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative zzso during the preparation zzso 

The procedure was applied to a pooled zzso sample of five zzso From this sample, zzso sequence reads were zzso All of the added zzso were identified by sequence analysis of the zzso In total, zzso of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral zzso They mainly originated from zzso zzso and zzso viruses zzso zzso of the sequences showed identities to plant zzso The most abundant detected zzso viruses were zzso zzso C, zzso zzso B, zzso and zzso In addition, sequences with identities to the zzso zzso circular zzso virus were zzso Whole zzso analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively designated as pig zzso circular zzso virus zzso represents a novel pig zzso 

The established protocol enables the simultaneous detection of DNA and zzso viruses in pig zzso including the identification of so far unknown zzso It may be applied in studies investigating zzso epidemiology and ecology of zzso The implemented process control serves as quality control, ensures zzso of the method and may be used for further method zzso
