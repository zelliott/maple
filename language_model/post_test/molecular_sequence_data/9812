Of the six zzso regions zzso forming the structure of the zzso combining site, zzso of heavy chain is the most variable in length and zzso Diversity of this loop is determined by the number of gene segments involved, extent of addition to or deletion from the joining zzso and zzso of the site of zzso In zzso mice and zzso zzso the last two factors occur less frequently than in adults, which in zzso result in low affinity zzso responses that do not zzso In contrast, adult zzso zzso make zzso responses and are notorious for lifelong poor zzso The mechanism for this is not known, and in this study we cloned zzso zzso genes from the zzso and obtained zzso to these zzso gene segments by zzso zzso These sequences were analyzed for heavy chain zzso diversity and found to be even less variable than that in newborn mouse or zzso zzso although for different zzso Only zzso of the zzso loop in the zzso consisted of zzso generated zzso compared with zzso in zzso zzso in newborn mice, and 57% in both adult mice and zzso This distinguishing feature of zzso zzso results not only from shorter zzso zzso but also unusually extensive integration of zzso zzso zzso As the zzso loop is the most important portion of the zzso sequence for determining zzso combining site diversity, our data provide the molecular basis for a contributing factor in the deficient zzso zzso zzso zzso
