zzso is a strain variable zzso zzso surface zzso of zzso zzso We have derived the zzso zzso sequence for four cloned zzso zzso zzso with three other published sequences suggests that variation may be zzso and that the architecture of the gene can be zzso described by segregation into four distinct zzso The N and C terminal regions zzso 1 and 4) are highly zzso in all seven zzso Six of these seven zzso genes can be grouped in a single family, within which variation is largely limited to a region characterized by the presence of tandem repeats zzso zzso We have observed two new forms of repeat in a zzso zzso zzso block, and noted the absence of repeat in this block of the zzso zzso The region downstream of the repeat region zzso 3) is highly zzso within this zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso is one of the zzso recognized by immune zzso zzso from intact zzso zzso 2 and 3, expressed as zzso zzso are recognized by these zzso suggesting that these regions are exposed at the surface of the intact zzso
