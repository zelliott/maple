The zzso zzso b gene is widely used in systematic studies to resolve zzso of many different zzso To investigate zzso relationships among frogs of the large family zzso and to explore the utility of zzso b for this purpose, approximately one-third of the gene was zzso from representatives of this zzso zzso were chosen to represent a range of divergence levels within zzso zzso deep zzso zzso among species from around the world; zzso middle, among North American zzso and zzso shallow zzso zzso within a single species group (the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso b are highly similar in these frogs although most zzso comparisons of the zzso sequences are zzso zzso zzso insufficient information is available to generate robust zzso hypotheses for the older zzso silent differences are saturated and yet almost no zzso replacement differences zzso Among the younger zzso silent differences are not saturated and some resolution is zzso These results show that zzso the zzso acid sequence of zzso b zzso differently in zzso than expected based on other zzso zzso it consequently provides surprisingly little information about old zzso in zzso and zzso zzso studies applying particular genes to new groups should begin with preliminary surveys of zzso zzso representing the range of divergence times within the group to estimate the likely zzso utility of that gene in that zzso
