zzso zzso and related toxins of zzso coli and other zzso zzso bacteria form membrane pores in cells of the host immune system, causing cell dysfunction and zzso An insight into the mechanism by which zzso is zzso to zzso cell zzso was achieved by establishing in zzso zzso of the zzso precursor zzso By this approach we have discovered that conversion of zzso to the zzso active zzso toxin is determined by fatty zzso of zzso in an apparently novel process directed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and dependent upon the cellular zzso carrier protein zzso By further exploiting the in zzso zzso system it is now possible to obtain direct evidence that zzso binds to an internal recognition sequence in the zzso zzso in this way providing specificity for the transfer to zzso of a fatty acid zzso carried by the zzso It is possible that the fatty acid modification determines directly the binding of zzso to zzso membrane zzso thus initiating the toxin interaction with the target zzso
