We have used in zzso binding zzso to examine specific interactions between a number of zzso and nuclear pore proteins involved in nuclear protein import in zzso We demonstrate that nuclear transport factor 2 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Ran bind to the zzso zzso via its beta zzso The binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso interacts primarily with the zzso zzso rod domain of zzso zzso and not with the zzso domain that contains a number of zzso repeats based on the zzso sequence zzso The binding of Ran to zzso was sensitive to its zzso state, with zzso binding zzso whereas zzso binding could not be detected using our zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was able to zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso complex, suggesting that the binding sites for zzso and zzso on zzso zzso Moreover, zzso but not zzso weakened the interaction between zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso but did not zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso binding sites on zzso do not zzso The set of interactions we observed was not altered by the binding of zzso zzso such as zzso factor zzso to the zzso zzso Our results are consistent with models for nuclear protein import in which Ran zzso exchange zzso the binding of the zzso complexes during zzso through nuclear pore zzso
