zzso analyses have zzso the discovery of three internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the course of earlier studies and have emphasized the divergence of Type 2 from zzso 1 and zzso The application of molecular and zzso tools described below, revealed the existence of cryptic species within zzso zzso The markers used include sequences taken from the zzso end of the zzso large zzso zzso a zzso zzso partial zzso zzso partial sequence and amplified zzso length zzso zzso zzso Following initial sequencing of a single zzso amplified sample for each zzso mass analysis of specimens relied on zzso differences between the zzso Over 100 fruit bodies, 30 or more specimens for each ITS zzso were tested with each of the zzso The markers analysis divided the zzso into three groups, each correlated to a specific ITS zzso Two of the zzso traits zzso zzso proliferation and zzso formation, consistently showed responses zzso the ITS zzso the data presented suggest that zzso zzso is comprised of three cryptic zzso
