A zzso low cost, accurate zzso zzso device to detect influenza virus is needed for effective treatment and control of both seasonal and pandemic zzso We developed a zzso zzso chip that zzso solid phase extraction zzso and molecular amplification via a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify influenza virus type A zzso We demonstrated the ability of the chip to amplify influenza A zzso in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specimens collected at two clinical sites from zzso The zzso test was dramatically more sensitive than two currently used rapid zzso and had high specificity that was essentially equivalent to the rapid zzso and direct fluorescent zzso zzso zzso We report zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso specificity compared to conventional zzso top) zzso based on the testing of zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso zzso These results compare well with zzso performed on samples taken during the same time period zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso specificity compared to our gold standard zzso Rapid zzso tests on samples taken during the enrollment period were less reliable zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso The zzso test extracted and amplified influenza A zzso directly from clinical specimens with viral loads down to zzso zzso in 3 h or zzso The new test represents a major improvement over viral culture in terms of turn around time, over rapid zzso tests in terms of sensitivity, and over bench top zzso and zzso in terms of ease of use and zzso
