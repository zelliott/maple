The complete sequence of the pig zzso gene has been determined through the isolation and characterization of a 17 zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows relative conservation of about zzso with the zzso sequences determined in other zzso species, though there are several zzso changes scattered throughout the zzso In zzso zzso on pig zzso zzso days post zzso showed that zzso expression was confined to zzso and skeletal muscle zzso
