zzso are responsible in part for maintaining the size and charge zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso The major zzso of the zzso foot process zzso is a zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso raised against isolated rabbit zzso that recognized a zzso protein base upon size, zzso blue zzso wheat germ zzso zzso and distribution in zzso zzso were used to expression clone zzso from a rabbit zzso zzso On Northern zzso the zzso zzso to a zzso pair transcript predominantly present in zzso The overlapping zzso spanned zzso base pairs that contained an open reading frame of zzso base pairs and were not zzso with a previously described zzso The deduced zzso acid protein contained a putative zzso zzso signal zzso and a zzso acid zzso zzso The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55 zzso an zzso domain that contains putative sites for zzso and zzso zzso and a potential zzso attachment zzso The zzso domain contains potential sites for zzso zzso of the full-length coding region in zzso cells resulted in a zzso band, suggesting that the zzso core protein zzso extensive zzso zzso The relationship between the cloned zzso and the zzso zzso used for cloning was confirmed by making a fusion protein that inhibited binding of the zzso zzso to zzso cortical tissue sections and then raising zzso zzso against the zzso fusion protein that also recognized zzso zzso and zzso cells in tissue sections in a similar distribution to the zzso zzso We conclude that we have cloned and zzso a novel zzso core zzso from rabbit zzso which has many of the characteristics of zzso We have named this protein zzso protein zzso
