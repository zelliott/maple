zzso delta virus zzso a zzso zzso virus, bears a single coding region whose product, the zzso delta zzso zzso is expressed in two zzso small zzso and large zzso zzso is required for replication of zzso while zzso zzso viral replication and is required for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso B virus zzso Here we have examined the spatial distribution of zzso zzso and proteins in infected zzso with particular reference to specific nuclear zzso We found that zzso was zzso in specific nuclear zzso and that over half of these zzso were localized beside nuclear domain 10 zzso At later times, zzso proteins like zzso were found in larger zzso complexes that had developed into apparently hollow zzso In these larger complexes, zzso was found chiefly in the rims of the zzso while the known zzso components zzso zzso and zzso were found in the centers of the zzso Thus, zzso proteins that normally are closely linked separate within zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso whether expressed from zzso zzso or directly from introduced zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was distributed more zzso throughout the zzso These results suggest that different host protein complexes may assemble on viral zzso strands of different zzso and they also suggest that this zzso virus, like DNA zzso can alter the distribution of zzso zzso The fact that viral components specifically linked to repression of replication can associate with one of the zzso proteins zzso raises the possibility that this host protein may play a role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
