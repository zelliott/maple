zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of various zzso using zzso as a donor zzso A type of zzso was zzso zzso from zzso pairs of zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso and its accessory zzso The zzso activity was recovered as a single peak on any column zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso organ contained only one form of zzso Five steps of successive column zzso gave a single protein band on zzso gel zzso with estimated molecular mass of 28 zzso The molecular mass of the native zzso was also determined to be approximately 30 zzso by molecular sieve zzso indicating that the zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso acted on various zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values ranging from 20 to 50 zzso The optimum pH for these zzso was around zzso Internal zzso acid sequences derived from two zzso fragments of the zzso were determined as zzso and zzso both of which exhibited significant zzso to the zzso sequence of known zzso zzso however, zzso was less than zzso These results suggest that a unique zzso is present in the zzso zzso organ at high levels, and likely plays a role in the regulation of zzso zzso
