zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that causes tropical zzso an often fatal zzso disorder of zzso To characterize and identify zzso proteins suitable as diagnostic zzso and/or vaccine candidates, a zzso clone zzso a zzso stage protein was isolated and characterized (here designated zzso The zzso present as a single copy within the zzso zzso is transcribed in the zzso and zzso stage and codes for a protein of about 315 zzso zzso having a predicted molecular weight of 36 zzso zzso zzso were found within single zzso zzso and between zzso originating from different geographical zzso The zzso part contains a predicted signal zzso and the zzso section encodes zzso zzso zzso of a number of zzso clones showed that both these sequence regions are zzso while the central region shows both size and zzso acid sequence zzso High identity of the zzso and zzso regions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso the existence of a central zzso region and two short zzso within zzso clones suggest that the presented zzso may be the zzso zzso zzso of zzso However, the central region of zzso has no significant identity with zzso contains no repetitive zzso motifs and is zzso resulting in a lower molecular zzso The existence of the predicted zzso signal zzso and membrane spanning regions suggest that zzso is located at the zzso zzso
