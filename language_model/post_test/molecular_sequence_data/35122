zzso zzso a protein expressed in the zzso and zzso is involved in the control of metabolism and body weight zzso Different active zzso fragments are generated from zzso including zzso Previous studies of our group reported that this zzso zzso also in the regulation of zzso function in male rats, with zzso zzso zzso 

We report zzso a series of studies on the zzso effects of zzso in female rats, as evaluated by a combination of in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso modestly increased serum zzso levels after systemic administration and directly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso female rats, while acute central injection of zzso was unable to modify zzso zzso at this zzso zzso central administration of zzso during the zzso transition (between zzso and zzso to female rats fed ad zzso advanced the timing of zzso opening and increased the percentage of animals with signs of zzso Moreover, an analogous treatment slightly enhanced zzso maturation in zzso female rats subjected to chronic zzso but was unable to rescue the delay of zzso opening induced by food zzso In addition, zzso zzso modified zzso zzso in adult female rats depending on the stage of the zzso zzso it zzso zzso zzso when injected in the morning of zzso and decreased the magnitude of the zzso zzso (but not zzso surge when injected in the afternoon of zzso 

Our data are the first to document the potential involvement of zzso in the control of zzso function in female zzso
