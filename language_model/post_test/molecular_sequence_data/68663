The cardiac zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that exchanges three zzso zzso for each zzso zzso and plays a critical role in returning zzso zzso zzso to their resting zzso Because of the importance that the zzso zzso may play in maintaining zzso zzso zzso in the central nervous system, we zzso a 456 zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso isolated from primary cultures of rat zzso zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso This zzso zzso was zzso and shown to share zzso sequence identity with the human and zzso sequence identity with the canine cardiac zzso zzso The zzso amplification product was used to analyze the distribution of this portion of the zzso zzso zzso in various regions of the zzso by both Northern zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The Northern analysis showed that the rank order of abundance of this zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso data indicated that the corresponding zzso containing this portion of the zzso was present in numerous brain regions including multiple cortical zzso the zzso zzso zzso various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bulb, zzso in various regions of the zzso spinal zzso and to a lesser extent in the zzso The differential distribution of the zzso as revealed by the in zzso zzso pattern suggests that either additional molecular zzso exist or that different zzso exchange mechanisms may be operative in those cell types that contain low amounts of this zzso of the zzso zzso
