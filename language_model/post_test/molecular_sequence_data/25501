A zzso in zzso zzso system for the human zzso small nuclear zzso zzso promoter has been zzso This in zzso zzso system uses extracts of tissue culture cells to drive zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso promoter zzso to zzso template was constructed in which the sequences from zzso to zzso were replaced with a zzso sequence from a zzso zzso This DNA template thus retained all of the known zzso promoter zzso including the zzso zzso box zzso zzso to zzso which is responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear extracts were shown to drive specific zzso of this promoter by zzso zzso zzso This zzso system has many of the properties observed for zzso zzso promoters in zzso zzso was shown to initiate at zzso (and zzso relative to the zzso promoter and to efficiently zzso than zzso form a 3' end corresponding to the 3' end found in the primary transcript of zzso in zzso The zzso signal is responsive to either deletion or replacement of the zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso Additionally, the signal was shown by zzso experiments to be responsive to a protein called zzso zzso to zzso which has recently been shown to specifically bind sequences in the zzso zzso This in zzso zzso zzso system should facilitate the zzso analysis of the human zzso zzso promoter and lead to a better understanding of the differences between zzso and zzso zzso
