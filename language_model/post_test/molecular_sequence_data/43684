The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso contains two independent molecules that form a novel zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso pairs and base zzso A virtually identical zzso composed of zzso pairs was found by earlier zzso analysis of the linear zzso zzso when the DNA was zzso in the zzso The close correspondence between these two structures of markedly dissimilar zzso suggests that they are both examples of a previously zzso zzso Their zzso sequences have little in common except for two separated zzso zzso forming the zzso and by implication these so-called zzso could occur widely in natural zzso Such structures provide a mechanism for zzso linking of zzso in zzso Their capacity to associate by base zzso demonstrated in the crystal structure of zzso creates a compact molecular framework made up of four DNA chains within which strand exchange could take zzso
