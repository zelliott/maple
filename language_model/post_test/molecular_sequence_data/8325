A zzso zzso of zzso zzso unable to grow on a minimal medium containing high amounts of zzso was zzso On zzso zzso its growth is temperature zzso Tests in liquid synthetic medium show that growth of the zzso is partially restored by lowering the zzso and zzso zzso in the growth zzso The growth zzso is fully suppressed by a zzso zzso a putative protein having the structural features of zzso zzso C zzso This zzso of zzso zzso contains the characteristic X and Y zzso found in all zzso of higher and lower zzso and zzso in addition, an zzso motif zzso zzso zzso Like the corresponding zzso from zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is most similar to the delta form of zzso zzso The cloned gene zzso at the zzso site indicating that zzso codes for a putative zzso zzso physically maps on the left arm of zzso II between zzso and zzso
