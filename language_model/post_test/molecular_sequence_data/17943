Advances in molecular biology and medical biotechnology are continuously creating exciting possibilities for DNA based zzso It is now possible by simple procedures to detect zzso DNA zzso structural zzso and regulatory zzso of human zzso allowing detailed zzso of zzso The innovative combination of zzso techniques, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results in new DNA based tests for the determination of important zzso zzso in order to define more precisely the zzso and hence assess the individual zzso The application of these technologies to the analysis of zzso zzso and cardiovascular diseases may not only lead to a better understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of these zzso but also to their early recognition and better zzso
