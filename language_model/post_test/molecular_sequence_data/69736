The crystal structure of the complex between zzso and the zzso DNA zzso zzso duplex has been determined to a resolution of zzso A and a zzso of zzso The zzso binds to the DNA within the minor groove, with specific zzso interactions from the zzso groups to the bases and sugar groups of the DNA, via a zzso binding zzso A network of water molecules lies over the mouth of the minor zzso The structure provides a rationale for the superior zzso properties of zzso as compared to zzso zzso Edwards, zzso zzso Jenkins, zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso This is seen to result from zzso decreased minor groove zzso at the binding site and zzso reduced mobility of the bound zzso zzso
