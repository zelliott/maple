A human zzso library was constructed using zzso zzso zzso The simple and rapid procedures for sequencing zzso DNA by the zzso chain termination method allowed a screening of individual clones directly by DNA sequence zzso Some of these clones were identified as coding for: serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, a clone coding for zzso B was tentatively identified on the basis of high sequence zzso with rabbit muscle zzso
