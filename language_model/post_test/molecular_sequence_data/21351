The study aims to investigate the zzso diversity of the zzso bacteria communities in the sediments of the zzso East Lake, zzso based on zzso zzso gene zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso method and sequencing analysis, and to zzso community variation according to the environment zzso 

We collected the zzso samples from the four typical zzso of East Lake in zzso zzso Lake, zzso Lake, zzso Lake and zzso Lake, and measured the environmental parameters zzso After extracted the zzso DNA from the zzso four zzso gene clone libraries were successfully zzso The operation zzso units zzso were determined by zzso method and the representative zzso of every zzso was zzso The diversity, richness and zzso statistics of the zzso communities were calculated by using zzso zzso zzso zzso tree was constructed basing on the zzso acid sequences of zzso from the East Lake sediments and reference sequences retrieved from the zzso zzso The relationship between tested zzso communities and the references from different environments was also zzso 

Environmental parameters showed that zzso Lake zzso contains the highest amount of total nitrogen zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso Lake sediments contains the lowest zzso Among the four zzso zzso Lake zzso the highest diversity and richness of zzso zzso while the zzso in zzso Lake was the zzso zzso analyses suggested that zzso zzso zzso in the East Lake could be distributed into three groups, Group I to zzso Group I accounts for zzso of all tested zzso Eighty-one percent of sequences from zzso Lake were clustered into Group I, while zzso of sequences from zzso Lake were clustered into Group zzso Comparative analysis of communities from East Lake and artificial zzso found there are zzso zzso 

There are diverse and abundant zzso zzso inhabited in the sediments of East Lake, zzso The diversity zzso and spatial distribution of these communities are affected by the content of zzso zzso and zzso nutrients in the zzso
