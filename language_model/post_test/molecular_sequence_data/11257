zzso is the major zzso produced by pea upon microbial zzso The zzso that zzso the terminal step in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of two zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso made from zzso obtained from zzso zzso pea zzso The two clones were confirmed to zzso zzso activity by zzso expression in zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso in zzso coli was similar to the activity detected in zzso pea zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso and zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso and 360 zzso acid zzso which would zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso has zzso identity to zzso zzso identity to zzso a putative zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso to zzso a putative zzso induced in barley by zzso pathogens or zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso clones to zzso from other higher plants identified the binding sites of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed two closely linked genes with strong zzso to Hmm in the pea zzso
