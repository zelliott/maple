zzso has been recently identified as a major zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso canine kidney cells, a cell line widely used for the study of polarized zzso The determination of two internal zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso by zzso degradation enabled us to isolated the zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein backbone of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is a zzso membrane protein which has several characteristics in common with zzso A and other zzso zzso At least 14 zzso zzso were found to be used for zzso No potential sites for zzso were zzso zzso turned out to represent the canine zzso of a zzso zzso expressed by various zzso and zzso cells in rat and zzso Potential zzso sites, zzso and zzso zzso were found to be highly zzso in the three zzso zzso was detected in canine zzso zzso zzso brain and heart but not in liver and zzso The zzso II of zzso canine kidney cells was found not to express zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso is predominantly delivered to the zzso plasma zzso zzso and a zzso anchor, both proposed zzso targeting signals, are absent from zzso indicating that other zzso are responsible for its polarized zzso
