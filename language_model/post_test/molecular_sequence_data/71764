zzso protein C zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso factor Va zzso and factor zzso zzso zzso in addition to being the precursor of zzso has zzso zzso functioning in zzso with protein S as a zzso of zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from an individual zzso for zzso is less efficient as an zzso than normal zzso zzso To investigate the importance of the three zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso and zzso for expression of its zzso activity, four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso at position zzso instead of zzso zzso were found to be poor zzso whereas zzso to zzso zzso at positions zzso or zzso had no negative effect on the zzso activity of zzso The loss of zzso activity as a result of the zzso to zzso zzso suggested that zzso at zzso in zzso is important for the ability of zzso to function as an zzso Using Western zzso it was shown that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by zzso during the zzso zzso At optimum zzso of zzso zzso (11 zzso and protein S zzso zzso zzso was found to be highly sensitive to zzso with maximum zzso occurring at less than 1 zzso zzso zzso was inactive as an zzso at zzso zzso 1 zzso and only partially active at higher zzso zzso Our results show that increased expression of zzso zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso at zzso in zzso but not with zzso at zzso nor at zzso
