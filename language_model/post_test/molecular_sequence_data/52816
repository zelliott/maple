zzso bodies zzso bodies, zzso are nuclear zzso of unknown function and are characterized by a wide variety of components including various zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso numerous small nuclear zzso the survival motor zzso protein complex, and the marker zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso zzso in zzso we have cloned the zzso gene zzso and have mapped it to the zzso portion of zzso band zzso The approximately zzso transcript is zzso in all zzso zzso with the highest levels in brain and zzso zzso analysis shows that, like its human counterpart, the mouse zzso gene is composed of seven zzso and spans nearly 30 zzso of zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence reveals two zzso zzso and zzso zzso and comparison with the zzso zzso protein reveals that these three genes are indeed zzso These results should facilitate gene disruption experiments aimed at creating a genetic model system to study zzso
