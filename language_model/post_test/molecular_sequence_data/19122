The WAVE regulatory complex zzso controls zzso zzso dynamics throughout the cell by stimulating the zzso activity of the zzso complex at distinct membrane zzso However, the factors that recruit the zzso to specific locations remain poorly zzso Here, we have identified a large family of potential zzso zzso consisting of zzso diverse membrane zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cellular studies reveal that a sequence motif that defines these zzso binds to a highly zzso interaction surface of the zzso formed by the zzso and Abi zzso zzso this binding surface in flies resulted in defects in zzso zzso organization and egg zzso during zzso leading to female zzso Our findings directly link diverse membrane proteins to the zzso and zzso zzso and have broad zzso and pathological ramifications in zzso
