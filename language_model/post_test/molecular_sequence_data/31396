Thirty-one cases of Hodgkin's disease were examined for the occurrence of zzso virus zzso zzso by using the zzso chain reaction zzso of DNA in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The cases were subdivided into 17 cases of zzso sclerosis zzso nine cases of mixed zzso zzso four cases of zzso predominance zzso and one case of zzso depletion zzso zzso DNA was detected in eight cases including four cases of zzso three cases of zzso and one case of zzso The sensitivity of zzso was higher than that of Southern zzso zzso of DNA from fresh frozen zzso because Southern zzso zzso using the zzso zzso of zzso detected virus DNA only in two of three cases which were positive by zzso The results of in zzso zzso studies confirmed that zzso zzso was localized within the zzso of zzso zzso cells and their zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso studies combining in zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso as markers of zzso cells, as well as pan zzso zzso and pan zzso zzso zzso were performed to demonstrate the zzso of zzso zzso cells, confirming that zzso DNA was present in zzso cells but not in zzso The results of this study indicate a significant association between zzso and some cases of Hodgkin's zzso
