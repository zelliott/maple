Most zzso share a common secondary structure containing a T arm, a D arm, an zzso arm and an zzso zzso However, there are some zzso Most zzso zzso zzso and some animal zzso zzso lack the T arm, which is necessary for binding to zzso zzso factor Tu zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have a unique zzso named zzso whose structure has supplied clues as to how truncated zzso can work in zzso zzso has a zzso extension of about 60 zzso that is absent in zzso zzso Recent data from our laboratory strongly suggests that zzso recognizes the zzso instead of the T arm by a mechanism involving this zzso zzso Further zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso related zzso zzso zzso and sequence information on nuclear and zzso DNA in zzso suggest that zzso zzso may have arisen as a result of zzso of the zzso zzso These studies provide valuable insights into the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
