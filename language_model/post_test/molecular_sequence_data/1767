Variations in zzso composition and modification have been proposed to regulate the multiple functions of zzso zzso Here, we examine the role of the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso light zzso We show that the zzso light chain is a bona fide component of zzso zzso zzso and use P element zzso to generate flies that completely lack this zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is viable and the only observed zzso is complete male zzso During zzso zzso the zzso light chain is required for the zzso of a nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and for proper attachment between the zzso nucleus and zzso zzso zzso Our results provide evidence that the function of the zzso light chain in zzso is distinct from other zzso zzso and is not required for any essential functions in early development or in the adult zzso
