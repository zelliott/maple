In zzso of the key respiratory and zzso electron transfer protein called zzso zzso c zzso or zzso zzso the zzso zzso cluster domain of its zzso zzso assumes several zzso suggesting that it may move during zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso that have modifications in the hinge region of this zzso we were able to reveal this motion zzso Thus, the zzso complex (and possibly the zzso zzso complex in zzso employs the zzso cluster domain as a device to shuttle electrons from zzso to zzso zzso (or zzso zzso We demonstrate that this domain movement is essential for zzso zzso function, because a zzso zzso with a nonmoving zzso zzso has no zzso activity, and one with a slower movement has lower zzso This motion is apparently designed with a natural frequency slow enough to assure productive zzso site charge separation but fast enough not to be rate zzso These findings add the unprecedented function of zzso electron shuttling to large-scale domain motions in proteins and may well provide a target for zzso zzso zzso
