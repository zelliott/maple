zzso is zzso to the human zzso and Wilson copper zzso and is zzso studied as a model for human copper zzso Most studies to date have sought to understand how zzso in the human zzso or Wilson genes impair copper zzso and induce zzso Here we analyze whether eight zzso zzso acids of the zzso domain are important for copper zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in a zzso zzso strain to check whether they were able to restore copper transport by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also expressed in zzso cells using zzso to study their zzso properties on membrane zzso The latter system allowed us to measure a zzso zzso activity of about 20 zzso for the zzso zzso at 37 degrees zzso None of the zzso was as efficient as the wild type in restoring copper zzso The zzso of each zzso of the zzso motif into a zzso resulted in zzso proteins that could not restore copper zzso in zzso and had no zzso zzso zzso by zzso was still possible with the zzso zzso although it was not possible with the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of the zzso motif have a different role in copper zzso zzso would be necessary for copper zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso would be necessary for zzso zzso suggesting a role in copper zzso
