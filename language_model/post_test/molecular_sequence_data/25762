zzso zzso has been employed to alter the zzso of human protein C zzso such that the zzso acid zzso pair at positions 6 and 7 of the zzso zzso protein would be changed to zzso acid zzso This zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and its zzso zzso counterpart have been expressed in human kidney zzso zzso After zzso forms of zzso that were fully zzso and zzso and of zzso zzso gamma zzso that lacked only the two altered zzso at zzso acid sequence positions 6 and 7 were zzso zzso to its conversion to activated PC zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso displayed a greatly reduced activity in the activated partial zzso time of zzso zzso as compared to zzso and human plasma zzso In addition, the activity of zzso zzso gamma zzso toward zzso of zzso human factor VIII was reduced to less than zzso of that of zzso and human plasma zzso These results, with the first reported zzso at zzso of PC produced by zzso DNA technology, indicate that the paired zzso at positions 6 and 7, which are highly zzso in all vitamin K dependent zzso zzso are very important to generation of fully functional zzso Additional results demonstrate further that lack of zzso at positions 6 and 7 of PC does not substantially affect this same processing reaction at other relevant zzso acid zzso
