We have determined the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso segment from the clone zzso zzso of the zzso chicken zzso zzso which is called DNA binding zzso This segment overlapped another clone zzso zzso and contained three zzso which were 16, 17 and zzso They were classified as Type III repeat as originally shown in bovine plasma zzso The average zzso of these three zzso among the chicken, rat and human zzso in zzso acid level are very high zzso compared with that zzso of the zzso in the cell binding domain, indicating that this region is highly conservative during the zzso
