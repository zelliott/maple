zzso zzso a zzso zzso is known to be actively involved in zzso of zzso zzso including those affected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity is blocked by tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso Because both zzso and zzso are rapidly zzso into the zzso zzso their sites of synthesis remain zzso To determine the site and sequence of zzso and zzso expression in zzso wound repair, we examined partial and full thickness zzso of human burn wounds representing days 2 to 34 zzso zzso labeling for zzso and zzso was detected in zzso cells at the burn margin and at the edges of surviving hair zzso and zzso sweat structures in the wound zzso Within the zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso were at first zzso in location and later appeared at the interface zone between viable and zzso zzso A diversity of cell types including zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso appeared to express zzso for zzso and zzso Little if any labeling was detected in zzso regions, in adjacent zzso zzso or zzso Our data indicate that zzso and zzso are temporally and zzso regulated during zzso wound zzso
