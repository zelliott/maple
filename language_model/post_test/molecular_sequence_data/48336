zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso between active and inactive zzso and is known to exist as two distinct zzso zzso and zzso A third zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been zzso Human zzso which was characterized as a zzso zzso cortisol zzso appears to be specifically expressed in the zzso We previously reported that zzso and abundant zzso zzso are expressed in zzso pig zzso and the zzso for cortisol of zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso obviously differs from the same activity zzso by zzso from pig liver zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso pig zzso also expresses the third type of zzso zzso and we zzso examined further evidence regarding the expression of zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso acid on pig zzso zzso zzso cortisol zzso activity was clearly different from that of pig liver zzso zzso A highly zzso human zzso sequence was observed by zzso in a pig zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains the amplified zzso was evaluated by real-time zzso and was most strongly expressed in pig brain, and at almost the same levels in the kidney as in the zzso but at lower levels in the zzso Based on these results, zzso pig zzso appears to express zzso zzso zzso as a third zzso zzso and it may play a zzso important role in cooperation with the abundantly expressed zzso zzso in order to prevent zzso cell zzso or zzso suppression of testosterone production induced by high zzso of activated zzso in zzso pig zzso
