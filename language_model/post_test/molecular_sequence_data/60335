zzso responds to zzso stress of 400 zzso by a rapid reduction of its cell volume to zzso The reduced cell volume is maintained as long as these zzso conditions zzso zzso does not accumulate compatible zzso to counteract the zzso pressure zzso Using two-dimensional gel zzso we demonstrate that during the zzso shock the protein pattern remains zzso in zzso zzso However, when cells were zzso into membrane and zzso zzso zzso of specific proteins could be zzso In the crude membrane zzso a zzso increase in the amount of protein was measured upon zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the proteins zzso and the regulatory zzso light chain zzso were shown to be regulated in the zzso stress zzso The zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso were found to increase in the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso arrest upon zzso zzso Furthermore, the two main components of the zzso zzso and zzso II, are zzso as a consequence of the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso as the zzso site on zzso and three zzso in the case of the zzso II heavy zzso
