zzso analyses of ITS and zzso DNA sequences for 30 zzso zzso specimens from wide geographic and host ranges revealed four strongly supported zzso zzso Based on comparisons of zzso zzso and after consideration of previous zzso the lineages were recognized as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one new species, zzso zzso A new series zzso Series zzso was erected to accommodate this strongly supported zzso group of four species within zzso Expanded descriptions, illustrations and a tabular identification key are zzso The zzso differences among species are subtle but host association and combinations of other characters can be used successfully for zzso zzso zzso zzso has the zzso host range, within the tribe zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but it is less diverse than previously zzso The other three species are restricted to single zzso in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso on zzso or zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso size and surface zzso especially as seen by zzso germ pore number, shape of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were the main features used to differentiate zzso Relying solely on the symptom of zzso aligned zzso on zzso stripes on leaves, from which the common name zzso zzso was zzso is not recommended because zzso of other leaf rust species may also form in a linear zzso
