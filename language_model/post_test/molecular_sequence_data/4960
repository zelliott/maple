The zzso constitute a family of genes unified by the presence of a zzso zzso which has been zzso through zzso zzso The zzso family comprises both zzso and zzso molecules and is thought to be made up of zzso for as yet unidentified zzso The functions are not known, with the exception of those of zzso III (also referred as zzso D and zzso 1), zzso I, and zzso II, which have been shown to be involved in zzso zzso Here report the identification of a mouse zzso zzso termed zzso zzso Although zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso domain, it lacks the zzso domain or zzso repeats which are present in other described zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso During development zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso of the nervous system and is particularly prominent in zzso In adulthood, zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso contains several zzso potential zzso domain binding zzso Using an in zzso binding zzso we show that zzso zzso binds specifically the zzso domain of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso These results, along with our evidence that zzso zzso can form zzso suggests that the zzso family not only serves as zzso but may include members, especially those which are zzso which serve as zzso triggering zzso signaling via an zzso zzso
