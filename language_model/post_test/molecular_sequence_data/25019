The small heat shock proteins zzso and zzso differ in that the former occurs as zzso without zzso activity, whereas the latter forms zzso and is a good zzso To investigate whether the lack of zzso activity of zzso is primarily due to its zzso structure or rather to intrinsic sequence features, we engineered zzso proteins by swapping the zzso zzso and tail regions of zzso and zzso designated as zzso and zzso zzso Three of the zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso secondary and zzso structures as measured by circular zzso and gel zzso zzso Combining the zzso zzso domain of zzso with the zzso and tail regions of zzso zzso resulted in zzso complexes, but did not restore zzso zzso zzso the tail region of zzso with that of zzso zzso did not alter the zzso structure and lack of zzso zzso Similarly, providing zzso with the tail of zzso zzso did not substantially influence the zzso complex size, but it reduced the zzso ability, especially for small zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso domain of zzso is zzso zzso to zzso zzso activity and confirms that the tail region in zzso zzso zzso capacity in a zzso zzso
