In the last decade, advances in understanding the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso have translated into an increase in clinical trials assessing various potential zzso zzso At present, drugs used for the treatment of zzso only slightly delay the inevitable symptomatic progression of the disease and do not affect the main zzso hallmarks of the disease, zzso senile plaques and zzso zzso Brain zzso of zzso species of zzso (A zzso zzso the principal components of senile zzso is believed to play a crucial role in the development of zzso Based on this hypothesis, huge efforts are being made to identify drugs able to interfere with zzso regulating A beta formation from zzso precursor protein zzso zzso that stimulate zzso the zzso responsible for zzso metabolism of zzso are being developed and one of these, zzso has recently commenced evaluation in a phase II zzso The discovery of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that regulates the first step of zzso zzso zzso has proved to be particularly difficult because of inherent medicinal chemistry issues and only one compound zzso has proceeded to clinical zzso zzso several compounds that inhibit zzso the pivotal zzso that generates A zzso have been identified, the most advanced being zzso zzso presently in phase III clinical zzso There has been considerable disappointment over the failure of a phase III study of zzso a compound believed to zzso the activity of zzso after encouraging phase II zzso Nevertheless, other promising zzso zzso are being developed and are approaching clinical zzso All these therapeutic approaches increase the hope of slowing the rate of decline in patients with zzso and zzso the natural history of this devastating disease within the next 5 zzso
