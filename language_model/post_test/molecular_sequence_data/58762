zzso sequence comparison shows that sequence variations are mostly clustered in the P zzso and V zzso zzso of the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although these comparisons suggest the P domain as the primary zzso of zzso symptom severity, the potential contribution of the V domain has never been zzso in zzso To investigate the relationship between the structure of these zzso and zzso six zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed by exchanging P and V zzso between a mild and two different severe zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the P domain is directly responsible for the severity of symptoms induced in zzso The four zzso containing a P domain from a severe isolate caused severe symptoms including severe zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the two zzso containing the mild isolate P domain induced only mild zzso zzso of zzso zzso in plants infected with the various zzso suggests that, with the constructions used, symptom severity did not correlate with zzso zzso indicating that the P domain did not influence symptom production through this simple zzso
