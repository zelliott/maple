By using spinal zzso zzso cultured in chemically defined zzso a double labeling zzso and zzso with zzso zzso we show that induction of zzso and the subsequent zzso of the zzso gene are coupled events, triggered by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso to the culture, at zzso similar to that needed for zzso of the zzso zzso also significantly increases zzso zzso Furthermore, in rats depleted of zzso by zzso administration of zzso the induction of zzso after noxious stimulation is dramatically decreased compared with the induction in zzso zzso These results suggest that the expression of the zzso gene in spinal zzso is under the control of the zzso zzso containing zzso
