This paper is devoted to an analysis of the intrinsic structure of the gene from the point of view of the zzso of different structural zzso and zzso Human genes for which the zzso structure has been clearly established were zzso The zzso of each zzso and zzso in the gene was zzso It was shown that, in human zzso zzso are more redundant than zzso zzso is determined as the smallest length of a word zzso beginning with which all words in the studied zzso sequence are found exactly zzso zzso leading to the disruption of the general pattern of ratios of zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso
