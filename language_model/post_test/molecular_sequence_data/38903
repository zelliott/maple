zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to produce zzso zzso is considered as a potential regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene corresponding to the zzso zzso previously isolated has been cloned and zzso zzso protection analysis indicated that the expression of the zzso gene generates three zzso populations with zzso ends mapping zzso 254 and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso accumulates zzso in roots and zzso zzso analysis, with transgenic zzso zzso plants containing a zzso fusion of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene to the zzso zzso reporter zzso indicated that the zzso zzso region directs widespread expression of the zzso gene throughout development, although the highest levels of zzso activity are detected in roots zzso zzso and flowers zzso zzso zzso style and zzso zzso The expression pattern of the zzso gene suggests that the role of the zzso zzso is the production of a general pool of zzso for the synthesis of different classes of zzso involved in both basic and specialized plant cell zzso zzso promoter deletion analysis in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that regulatory elements between positions zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso region are crucial for high-level zzso gene zzso
