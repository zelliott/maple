zzso zzso zzso zzso the opening of the zzso ring with the release of iron in both plants and zzso In zzso red algae, and zzso HO is a key zzso in the synthesis of the zzso part of the zzso zzso In an attempt to study the regulation of this key zzso step, we cloned and zzso the zzso gene zzso this zzso from the red zzso zzso zzso The gene is located on the zzso zzso split into three distant zzso and is presumably expressed by a zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence is zzso to other reported zzso from organisms containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, to zzso zzso The expression is zzso activated under iron zzso a stress condition frequently encountered by algae, suggesting a second role for HO as an zzso agent in zzso zzso
