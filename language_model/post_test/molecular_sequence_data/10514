The heat shock response of a fish which inhabits a highly stressful environment zzso zzso a zzso from river systems of the Sonoran desert in northwestern zzso was zzso zzso derived from this fish exhibited a typical heat shock response when exposed to elevated temperature, zzso high levels of 90 zzso 70 zzso and 30 zzso heat shock proteins zzso zzso and zzso as well as lower amounts of other heat shock zzso Additional small heat shock proteins zzso including zzso were induced after a prolonged heat shock at a time when synthesis of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso clones for zzso and zzso revealed that both are members of the zzso zzso but belong to separate lineages within this gene zzso The multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso appear to be members of a zzso family and are most closely related to salmon and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is highly similar to zzso and avian zzso it was zzso as three zzso which represented zzso zzso forms of a single zzso In zzso the various zzso may each perform a subset of the roles attributed to zzso zzso The conservation of zzso sites in zzso may indicate an involvement in signal zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso genes appear to have zzso more rapidly than the corresponding zzso zzso the various members of the zzso family may function as molecular zzso and, in this role, may be less zzso zzso Finally, the presence of these two classes of zzso in a single zzso indicates that these two lineages arose by gene zzso early in the evolution of zzso and raises questions about the fate of zzso of zzso in zzso and of zzso in zzso
