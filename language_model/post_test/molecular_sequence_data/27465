zzso virus is a zzso isolated from Swedish and North American zzso zzso of zzso virus in cultured cells normally zzso a weak and delayed zzso effect compared to that of many other zzso However, efficiently replicating zzso virus zzso may evolve during serial passages in cell zzso In this study, we evaluate the significance of three zzso in zzso protein zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso of the Swedish zzso virus zzso zzso In contrast to the parental strain, this zzso zzso grows to high zzso in green monkey kidney cells and zzso a distinct zzso zzso zzso genetic analyses demonstrated that each one of the individual zzso zzso contributes to zzso replication in cell culture, but also that expression of all three zzso results in a zzso to zzso increase in viral zzso compared to viruses zzso single zzso zzso In addition, as indicated by detection of activated zzso and DNA zzso there seems to be an association between increased replication efficiency of zzso zzso virus zzso and induction of an zzso response in infected green monkey kidney zzso
