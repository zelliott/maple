Satellite zzso zzso associated with zzso mosaic virus zzso is dependent on zzso for replication and zzso zzso analyses of total zzso extracted from bamboo species collected worldwide revealed that 26 out of 61 zzso zzso zzso zzso Among them, two zzso distinguishable groups, A and B, with a genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso were zzso Greatest sequence diversity occurred in the zzso untranslated region zzso that contained one zzso region with variations of up to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso sequences support the existence of a zzso zzso hairpin zzso structure, which was earlier mapped by zzso zzso and functional analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso Lin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso sequences in the zzso region of satellite zzso of bamboo mosaic zzso zzso 311 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso generated by zzso the zzso region between groups A and B demonstrated the replication competence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The results suggest that an zzso zzso secondary structure exists in the zzso region of zzso zzso of zzso
