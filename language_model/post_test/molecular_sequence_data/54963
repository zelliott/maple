zzso zzso are low molecular weight proteins with zzso sequences that bind heavy metals with remarkably high zzso Plant zzso differ from animal ones by a peculiar zzso acid sequence organization consisting of two short zzso terminal zzso zzso from 4 to 8 zzso each) linked by a zzso free region of about 30 zzso In contrast with the current knowledge on the zzso structure of animal zzso there is a striking lack of structural data on plant zzso We have expressed and zzso a type III zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein is able to bind a variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso with different zzso as shown by mass zzso The protein displays a complete absence of periodic secondary structures as measured by zzso circular zzso infrared zzso and zzso exchange zzso When attached onto a zzso zzso no significant structural change was observed upon removing the metal zzso
