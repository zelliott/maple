Two promoters were previously shown to map to the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso was located upstream of the first zzso and is responsible for zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso is a stronger promoter than zzso and was located within the 10, zzso first zzso approximately 1000 zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso transcripts that initiated from zzso were previously identified in zzso cells by primer extension analysis and were observed to increase in abundance during differentiation of zzso cells to zzso By screening a zzso library with a probe derived from sequences downstream of the zzso start site, we have cloned and characterized a zzso that represents a zzso that appears to have been initiated from the zzso zzso We have designated the gene zzso this transcript zzso (the zzso designation is zzso The zzso is zzso zzso and is zzso downstream from a consensus zzso addition zzso The entire zzso zzso is derived from zzso 1 of the zzso zzso with no zzso having been zzso The zzso contains no major open reading frame although reading frame zzso contains a relatively low abundance of stop zzso compared to the other two reading frames and could possibly zzso a protein of 119 zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso reading frame shows a region of high zzso to a portion of the zzso domain of zzso These results indicate that a novel zzso transcript is zzso by the first zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso may be a zzso for a gene that may have zzso a zzso zzso zzso the transcript may have a function, since zzso transcripts of this gene are present in a number of human cells and their levels are induced during terminal differentiation of zzso leukemia cells such as zzso and zzso
