zzso zzso a normally zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso of specialized zzso to cause production of multiple zzso fatty zzso Evidence was presented that a single copy of the zzso gene present in the goose zzso codes for both the zzso form found in extremely low amounts in the liver and the zzso form found in large amounts in zzso zzso To zzso how a single gene encodes both forms, the zzso zzso gene and the zzso for both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso species were cloned and zzso The zzso zzso found in a zzso segment of cloned zzso DNA, is composed of five zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interrupted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 revealed two zzso in frame 150 zzso zzso zzso for the zzso form and zzso form showed identical zzso zzso except that the latter was longer than the zzso The longest zzso for the zzso form of the zzso extended only 44 zzso zzso to the second zzso and the position corresponded to the zzso initiation site of the zzso form revealed by primer extension and zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso form isolated from the library extended 19 zzso further zzso zzso extension and zzso protection indicated that transcripts for the zzso form initiated upstream from the first zzso The zzso segment of the open reading frame initiated at the first zzso showed an zzso signal sequence appropriate for zzso zzso A putative full length zzso for the zzso form of the zzso when translated in zzso yielded a zzso primary translation product which was processed by removal of about 5 zzso during zzso into goose liver zzso These results strongly suggest that in most zzso zzso zzso zzso to the first zzso generating a transcript that would generate a protein with an zzso leader for transport into zzso In the zzso zzso the use of an alternate promoter generates transcripts initiated between the two zzso and the translation product accumulates in the zzso since it lacks a zzso targeting zzso
