zzso of most cellular zzso involves cap binding by the translation initiation zzso Among this complex of proteins are zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translation generally zzso with zzso zzso of zzso when both are bound to zzso During the late phase of zzso zzso infection translation of cellular zzso is zzso which zzso with displacement of zzso from zzso by the viral zzso zzso protein and zzso of zzso Here we describe the molecular mechanism for zzso protein displacement of zzso from zzso and zzso a structural basis for zzso interaction with zzso and zzso proteins and Ad zzso of cellular protein zzso The zzso site is located in an zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is sufficient to bind zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso and inhibit zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso Ad zzso and zzso proteins possess a common zzso zzso but zzso protein binds more strongly to zzso than does zzso Unlike zzso for which binding to zzso is zzso dependent, competitive binding by zzso protein is zzso zzso These data support a model zzso zzso protein blocks cellular protein synthesis by zzso zzso and zzso complexes regardless of their association with zzso and zzso or blocking binding by zzso which occurs only on zzso complexes, resulting in zzso of zzso
