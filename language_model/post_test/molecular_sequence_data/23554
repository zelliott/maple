Group A zzso has evolved numerous mechanisms to evade the host immune system to survive, zzso and cause zzso Recently a zzso protein named zzso was identified and shown to enhance survival of the zzso A new zzso of zzso zzso zzso also was recently described and shown to differ from zzso by approximately 50% zzso acid sequence divergence in the middle one-third of the zzso To gain new information about the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso solution binding experiments were performed using surface zzso resonance and zzso Mac zzso zzso bound the same lower hinge region of human zzso as zzso receptors with zzso zzso zzso which lead to zzso zzso of the zzso Similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso values of the zzso zzso activity were obtained for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in contrast, bound human zzso poorly zzso zzso 16 zzso and had weak zzso activity against zzso Instead, zzso bound zzso and zzso with 5 and 75 zzso zzso zzso This binding competitively blocked zzso from recognition by zzso zzso Taken together, Mac proteins block zzso recognition by zzso receptors and degrade zzso thereby enhancing survival of the pathogen through the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these proteins may be potential therapeutic zzso
