A protein model was developed for studying the interaction between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to introduce zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso H in zzso zzso whale zzso Based on the difference in zzso zzso between folded proteins and an unfolded zzso the energy of interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso positions of the zzso were stabilized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso at the zzso position was stabilized by zzso zzso and may involve a hydrogen zzso In context with other studies, an zzso observed zzso zzso effect may be defined in terms of two distinct zzso A zzso component involves zzso interactions with zzso bond zzso in the first two turns of the zzso and affects zzso at all positions of the zzso a hydrogen bond component involves one or more backbone zzso groups and is only possible at the capping position due to zzso restraints zzso The nature and magnitude of the zzso zzso effect is, therefore, zzso zzso from this model system were used to interpret zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
