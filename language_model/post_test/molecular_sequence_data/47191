In zzso singing behavior is controlled by a discrete network of interconnected brain zzso known collectively as the song control zzso Both the development of this system and the expression of singing behavior in adulthood are strongly influenced by sex steroid zzso Although both zzso and zzso steroids have effects, zzso receptors zzso are more abundantly and widely expressed in song zzso than are zzso receptors zzso zzso The recent cloning of a second form of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso raises the possibility that a second zzso zzso is present in zzso and that zzso effects in the song system may be zzso via zzso zzso We therefore cloned the zzso beta complementary DNA zzso from a European zzso zzso zzso zzso library and used in zzso zzso zzso to examine its expression in zzso song zzso relative to the expression of zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso in the adjacent brain zzso The zzso zzso beta zzso has an open reading frame of zzso predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso This protein shares greater than zzso sequence identity with zzso beta in other zzso We report that zzso zzso beta is expressed in a variety of zzso including brain, zzso skeletal muscle, liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similar to reports in other zzso species, we detected zzso zzso cells in several song control zzso including the high vocal center zzso the zzso and lateral portions of the zzso nucleus of the anterior zzso and the robust nucleus of the zzso We detected zzso alpha expression in the zzso portion of zzso (also called zzso and along the zzso border of the zzso zzso zzso beta was not expressed in zzso in the zzso and lateral portions of the zzso nucleus of the anterior zzso in the robust nucleus of the zzso or in area zzso In contrast, zzso beta zzso cells were detected in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso area in a pattern reminiscent of zzso zzso expression in the same brain regions in other zzso These data suggest that zzso effects on the song system are not zzso via zzso zzso cells within song zzso Nonetheless, the overlapping expression of zzso zzso and zzso cells in the zzso zzso suggests that locally zzso zzso may act via zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso to mediate seasonal or zzso effects on nearby song zzso zzso zzso
