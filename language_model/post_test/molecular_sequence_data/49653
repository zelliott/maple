The ordered assembly of the zzso zzso virus zzso type 1 replication apparatus leading to replication compartments likely involves the initial assembly of five viral replication zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso complex zzso into replication zzso The zzso and zzso accessory protein are subsequently recruited to these zzso Four stages of viral infection zzso I to zzso have been described previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of these, stage III zzso are equivalent to the previously described zzso leukemia protein zzso zzso sites and contain all seven replication zzso We constructed a series of zzso in the putative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and have analyzed the zzso proteins for their abilities to form zzso leading to the formation of replication zzso The results shown in this paper are consistent with the model that the five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a scaffold and that formation of this scaffold does not rely on zzso functions of the zzso and zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that recruitment of zzso to this scaffold requires the presence of an active zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso recruitment to replication zzso requires primer zzso Furthermore, they support the existence of two types of stage III zzso in the formation of replication zzso stage zzso zzso which form the scaffold, and stage zzso zzso which contain, in addition, zzso zzso the zzso accessory zzso and cellular factors such as zzso
