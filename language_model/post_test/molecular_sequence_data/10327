In blood zzso units of the protein zzso pack together to form a zzso zzso but a crystal structure for zzso is needed to understand how this is zzso The structure of a core zzso zzso zzso from human zzso has now been determined to zzso A zzso The zzso zzso structure consists of a zzso region and two zzso zzso zzso oriented at approximately 130 degrees to each zzso Additionally, the zzso bound zzso of zzso D, known as zzso was isolated from human zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso which simulates the donor zzso site, and its structure solved by molecular replacement with the model of zzso zzso
