zzso related peptides zzso present in the zzso zzso and freshly dissected skin fragments of zzso zzso were investigated by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso along with their zzso zzso were characterized in the zzso by de zzso zzso sequencing and direct zzso imaging experiments of the zzso zzso These molecules revealed strong sequence similarities to the main plasma zzso of some zzso and zzso Such a diversity of zzso within the same zzso family, belonging to a single zzso species may be related to functional zzso of these peptides and a variety of corresponding receptors that might be present in a number of different zzso Also, a novel zzso zzso had its biological activity positively detected in cell culture expressing the human zzso B2 zzso and in guinea pig zzso zzso
