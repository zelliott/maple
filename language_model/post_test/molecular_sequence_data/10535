Members of the zzso zzso of zzso proteins contain a region of zzso acid sequence zzso zzso that is absent from other zzso proteins and is termed the zzso insert zzso To address the functional role of this domain, we have constructed a zzso zzso in which loop 8 from zzso was zzso for the region in zzso that contains the zzso acid insert zzso Our data indicate that the insert region of zzso is not essential for its interactions with various zzso molecules or for interactions with the zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso or the zzso zzso protein zzso However, the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is extremely sensitive to changes in the insert region, such that a zzso zzso that lacks this insert is no longer susceptible to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso to zzso activity is not due to the inability of the zzso zzso to bind to the zzso zzso and in fact, the zzso is fully capable of stimulating the release of this zzso from zzso
