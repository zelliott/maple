zzso zzso is a zzso green zzso thriving in environments ranging from fresh water to zzso lakes, such as the Dead zzso An unusual, internally zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located on the surface of this zzso is expected to function over a broad range of zzso It would therefore differ from other zzso zzso that already lose activity at low zzso and also from zzso proteins that require high zzso for zzso zzso zzso analyses indeed indicated that zzso I retained activity at salt zzso ranging from low salt to at least zzso M zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso M zzso for zzso activity and zzso M for zzso zzso Although zzso at higher zzso were constrained by the interference of salt in the respective zzso zzso activity was noticeable even at zzso M zzso Comparisons of the internally duplicated zzso I to zzso derivatives indicated that zzso interactions played a decisive role in the stability, activity, salt tolerance and pH responses of zzso zzso Hence zzso I is a uniquely zzso tolerant zzso retaining an active zzso over a large range of zzso and, as a zzso zzso largely immune to the specific zzso effects of zzso Its unique features make zzso I a useful model to understand the zzso basis of zzso and zzso interactions in zzso
