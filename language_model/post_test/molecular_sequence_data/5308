The zzso proteins are a family of highly zzso zzso acid binding proteins which are zzso from bacteria to zzso In this report we have identified a new member of this family from zzso zzso zzso was used to identify a zzso region within the highly zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso for this gene was zzso and the identified open reading frame was named zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of zzso indicates that this gene is expressed throughout development with the highest level of expression found in adult zzso In zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso is zzso loaded into the egg zzso In addition, there appears to be expression of zzso zzso in zzso tissue during zzso zzso while containing a zzso zzso is novel in that it completely lacks the alternating zzso and basic regions found in the zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso and zzso analysis showed that this domain can interact with zzso We predict that zzso would be an zzso protein due to these results and the motifs which have been identified within the zzso acid zzso
