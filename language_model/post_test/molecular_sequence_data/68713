In this study, we further examined the sequence selectivity of zzso in zzso zzso I zzso from human and Chinese zzso In the absence of zzso almost all the bases at the zzso of zzso sites are T for calf zzso and wheat germ zzso zzso In addition, wheat germ zzso I exhibits preference for C (or not zzso at zzso and for T at zzso zzso As for zzso zzso with zzso I, G (or not zzso at zzso is an additional strong zzso This sequence selectivity of zzso is similar to that previously found in zzso DNA, suggesting that zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso sites where G is the base at the zzso These results support the stacking model of zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of calf zzso and wheat germ zzso zzso zzso sites in the presence of zzso shows that many major zzso sites are zzso However, the relative zzso are often zzso One of the differences was attributable to a bias at position zzso where calf zzso zzso I prefers G and wheat germ zzso I prefers zzso This difference may explain the unique patterns of zzso sites induced by the two zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sites in the surrounding regions of point zzso in zzso I zzso which were found in zzso cell lines, reveals no direct relationship between DNA zzso sites in zzso and zzso zzso
