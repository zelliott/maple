It has previously been observed that the only specific requirement for zzso initiation on viral zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso yellow mosaic virus is the zzso at the 3' end of the zzso We now compare the abilities of this zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso an zzso capable of supporting the complete viral replication cycle in zzso to transcribe zzso templates containing multiple zzso boxes but lacking specific viral zzso Each zzso is able to initiate zzso from several zzso boxes within these zzso and no special reaction conditions are required for these zzso The zzso yields produced from templates comprised of multiple zzso or zzso repeats relative to templates derived from native viral zzso sequences vary between zzso and zzso for the different zzso Control of initiation by such redundant sequences presents a challenge to the specificity of viral zzso and zzso We identify zzso initiation and sensitivity to structural presentation as two specificity mechanisms that can limit initiation among potential zzso initiation zzso These two specificity mechanisms are used to different degrees by the three zzso The finding that three viral zzso representing two of the three zzso within the zzso zzso viral zzso zzso support substantial zzso in the absence of unique promoters suggests that this phenomenon may be common among zzso zzso A framework is presented arguing that replication of viral zzso in the absence of unique promoter elements is zzso
