The zzso is the zzso zzso The molecular basis of zzso gene expression and differentiation is zzso We previously identified an zzso zzso element, termed zzso in the zzso zzso We have now cloned the zzso zzso zzso the protein that binds to zzso zzso expression is initiated in the zzso zzso of the developing zzso is strictly restricted to cells of the zzso lineage thereafter, and is regulated by zzso and vitamin zzso zzso binds to and regulates the expression of multiple genes expressed in zzso Finally, forced expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso the expression of the principal zzso zzso This study identifies zzso as an zzso zzso factor and as a regulator of zzso zzso
