zzso free zzso levels are critical to the activity of BK channels in inner ear type I spiral ligament zzso However, the mechanisms for regulating zzso zzso levels in these cells are currently poorly zzso Using zzso technique, we have identified a zzso zzso zzso channel in type I spiral ligament zzso cultured from zzso inner zzso With 10 zzso zzso as the zzso zzso an inwardly zzso current was zzso with little zzso by membrane zzso The zzso zzso threshold and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso This inward zzso current reached its peak at around 10 zzso of membrane zzso The zzso of the peak current varied among cells ranging from 50 to zzso zzso with an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso significantly inhibited the inward currents by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that cultured type I spiral ligament zzso express the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso channels zzso by the zzso zzso The expression of this channel in zzso inner ear was confirmed by zzso analysis using freshly isolated spiral ligament zzso The zzso channel may function in conjunction with a previously identified zzso zzso zzso to regulate zzso free zzso levels in type I spiral ligament zzso and thus zzso BK channel activity in these zzso
