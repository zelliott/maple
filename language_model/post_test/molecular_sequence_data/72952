The structural gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and found to be expressed in zzso coli using its own zzso When the cloned gene zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso an 80 zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli carrying the lip gene indicated that the zzso protein was mainly associated with the membrane zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the gene is zzso zzso long, coding for a zzso zzso protein with an estimated zzso of zzso The deduced protein contains two putative signal zzso zzso sites: one is a typical signal zzso zzso site and the other bears a strong resemblance to known zzso leader zzso zzso from zzso was incorporated into the zzso protein when expressed in zzso zzso The deduced protein contains a sequence of zzso which is very well zzso among zzso It shows zzso and zzso overall identity to the zzso acid sequences of zzso from zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso respectively, but shows little zzso to those of other zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso of zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso the optimum chain lengths for the zzso zzso on the zzso were zzso to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso zzso
