The aim was to investigate the roles of zzso zzso in zzso loop 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 2, 5, 11 and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in determining zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso of human zzso with these zzso zzso to zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso disrupted cell surface zzso from zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso turnover zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso compared with zzso zzso so these zzso might be involved in zzso changes associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso by zzso compared with zzso indicating that the presence of these zzso zzso limits turnover of the zzso The zzso had few effects on apparent affinities of zzso or affinities of zzso except decreases in inhibitor affinities after zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and increases after zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso loop 2 and in zzso zzso have a range of roles in determining expression and function of the zzso
