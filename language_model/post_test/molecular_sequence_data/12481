zzso zzso clones of two genes have been isolated from the African malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences contain a putative signal zzso sequence and four potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso show highest similarities to the zzso gene from Aedes aegypti and three clustered zzso genes from zzso zzso Both genes are located at position zzso in the terminal division of the left arm of the third zzso zzso has very strict tissue and zzso zzso being expressed exclusively in the adult zzso The specificity of zzso is similar but appears slightly zzso transcripts of this gene are detected at a low level in the zzso and occasionally in the adult carcass after removal of the zzso
