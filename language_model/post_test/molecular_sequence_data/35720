zzso transformed human lung zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso a zzso type IV zzso (in addition to zzso type IV zzso identical to that found in zzso zzso zzso differentiated zzso cells, and zzso The expression of this zzso is induced by the tumor promoter zzso and zzso and was not detected in the parental human lung zzso The zzso zzso has a predicted Mr of zzso including a 19 zzso acid long zzso signal zzso The apparent zzso between the predicted molecular weight and the molecular weight of the zzso protein is due to a zzso modification of the zzso through zzso The zzso type IV zzso consists of five distinct zzso including a unique 54 zzso acid long zzso domain, and is a member of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Both the 72 and zzso type IV zzso contain a zzso collagen binding zzso The mosaic structure of the zzso zzso zzso is a result of a recruitment of the functional units from zzso structural zzso into an zzso protein in the process of zzso The zzso and zzso type IV zzso zzso form a zzso complex with zzso which is zzso by zzso yielding an zzso with similar if not identical zzso specificity zzso Our results demonstrate that while the zzso type IV zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso the zzso type IV zzso zzso from the same starting material, contains a novel zzso zzso
