A zzso zzso coli strain was constructed for the zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso using a zzso structural gene containing 9 of the rare zzso zzso zzso and zzso When high level zzso synthesis was induced in this strain, cell growth was inhibited and zzso accumulated to less than zzso of total cell zzso In addition, about zzso of the zzso zzso produced from this strain exhibited an altered zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 74 through 109 normally produce 2 zzso zzso but the altered form of zzso lacked these two peptides and instead had a new zzso which was missing zzso zzso 86 and one of the two zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso 86 was zzso and the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso 85 and 87 were zzso When 5 of the 9 zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso structural gene were changed to more preferred zzso zzso cell growth was not inhibited and zzso accumulated to about zzso of total cell zzso When zzso was zzso from this modified strain, which included changing the zzso zzso at position 86 from zzso to zzso none of the altered form of zzso was zzso These observations are consistent with a model in which zzso pausing occurs at the zzso zzso 86 zzso zzso because the corresponding zzso species is reduced by the high level of zzso zzso and a zzso hop occurs from the zzso zzso 85 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso 87 zzso zzso This observation represents the first report of an error in protein synthesis due to an zzso zzso hop within an open reading zzso
