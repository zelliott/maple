We have constructed a new genetic linkage map of the zzso syndrome zzso region, using zzso from a library which was developed by a zzso zzso and zzso amplification zzso These zzso were used to zzso members of zzso families using a simplified detection system of zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to assign 4 zzso markers relative to each marker and other markers reported in the zzso public data zzso We confirmed that these 4 markers are located to the zzso region, zzso Such zzso zzso from the zzso zzso region may be useful for zzso zzso
