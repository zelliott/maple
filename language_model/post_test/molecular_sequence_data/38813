zzso B is one of the major zzso peptides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso B gene zzso occurs rapidly after bacterial zzso Using 235 base pairs zzso of the zzso promoter region, a zzso protein and two additional zzso complexes zzso zzso and zzso were identified in nuclear extracts from zzso zzso fat body by the zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso Further zzso analyses indicated that the zzso site was zzso and that zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus after zzso In a recently established zzso zzso cell line, zzso 235 zzso of zzso promoter linked to a reporter zzso was activated zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso which is a major trigger of zzso expression in zzso zzso of the zzso site from the promoter reduced the zzso zzso zzso of either of two zzso motifs also reduced promoter zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso site and the zzso motifs resulted in the complete loss of zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso site is an zzso zzso that is necessary for full zzso of zzso
