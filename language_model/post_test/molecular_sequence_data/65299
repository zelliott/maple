The zzso position of a novel bacterial strain, zzso with zzso activity, isolated from the zzso of pepper in zzso South Korea, was studied using a zzso zzso zzso of the strain were zzso zzso zzso zzso It grew at a temperature of zzso degrees C zzso 28 degrees zzso Growth of the strain occurred between pH zzso and zzso with an optimum of pH zzso The strain inhibited zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and growth of zzso zzso The zzso content of the total DNA was zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of the strain was most closely related to species of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso % sequence zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso major polar zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso major fatty zzso zzso : zzso summed feature 3, zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso data and zzso and zzso characteristics strongly supported the zzso and zzso differentiation of strain zzso from species of zzso with zzso published zzso zzso zzso therefore represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
