We report here on the first analysis of zzso chain reaction zzso products amplified from a small amount of human blood DNA by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso gene zzso of about 50 base pairs zzso with a relative molecular mass zzso of approximately 15,000 zzso was amplified from human blood DNA by zzso The accurate molecular mass of the zzso products was determined with an accuracy of approximately zzso by zzso The amount of DNA used was only 100 zzso zzso 50 zzso the theoretically required amount of blood is therefore less than 1 zzso for zzso The zzso measurement of the zzso products proved to be a new accurate, sensitive and fast tool for gene zzso
