The zzso protein is one of the major factors involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and induction of zzso We determined the secondary structure of the zzso region of zzso zzso that includes two major translation initiation zzso zzso and zzso responsible for the synthesis of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso It turned out that a part of the coding sequence was involved in the folding of the zzso untranslated region for zzso The most characteristic structural elements in the zzso region of zzso zzso were two hairpin zzso In one of them, the initiation zzso zzso was embedded while the other hairpin has been earlier shown to bind the zzso zzso Alternative mechanisms of zzso zzso translation initiation were investigated in zzso using model zzso zzso The results confirmed that initiation from zzso was mostly zzso The process was zzso by a cap structure and strongly inhibited by a stable hairpin at the template zzso zzso Upon zzso the remaining protein fraction was zzso in a zzso process, which was strongly zzso by the addition of a cap zzso The translation initiation from zzso showed a largely zzso zzso The zzso cap structure actually decreased initiation from this site which argues against a leaky scanning mechanism but might suggest the presence of an zzso Moreover, blocking zzso translation from zzso by the stable hairpin did not change the level of initiation from zzso Upon addition of the cap zzso translation from this site was even zzso
