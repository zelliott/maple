We have proposed that the zzso action of Alzheimer's zzso beta protein might be initiated by the interaction with the zzso cell zzso and subsequent formation of toxic zzso zzso zzso A beta P toxicity can be explained on the basis of harmful zzso zzso across A beta P zzso The zzso of A beta P in zzso is not zzso However, several models suggests that a zzso zzso zzso structure is responsible for the zzso channel properties of the zzso A beta zzso To identify that portion of the A beta P zzso making up the conducting pore we have hypothesized that the region of the A beta P sequence in the vicinity of the hypothetical pore might interact with complementary regions in the adjacent A beta P zzso We have further hypothesized that an interaction by a zzso segment would block A beta P zzso To test this hypothesis we zzso peptides that zzso the zzso zzso zzso previously hypothesized to line the zzso We report here that peptides designed to most closely match the proposed pore are, in fact, the most effective at blocking zzso currents through the zzso A beta P zzso As previously shown for zzso zzso zzso blockade is also zzso The results also provide additional evidence for the zzso zzso of the A beta P molecules into zzso zzso and give support to the concept that rings of zzso line the entry to one side of the A beta P zzso
