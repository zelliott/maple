zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fall into two zzso (A and zzso according to preferences for their zzso zzso All published structural studies of zzso zzso complexes involve zzso zzso Here, we present the crystal structures of an zzso complex between zzso and zzso and of zzso zzso Although these structures are similar overall to their zzso counterparts, they reveal important differences that define zzso zzso The structures suggest that the zzso zzso zzso interactions involve smaller zzso in the interacting partners, better described by a zzso binding zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso mechanism defining the zzso zzso This model is supported by zzso zzso and by differential requirements for zzso zzso by the two zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the structure of the zzso zzso reveals a zzso assembly that might represent zzso zzso cell zzso zzso
