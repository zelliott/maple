Huntington disease zzso belongs to the group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by unstable expanded zzso zzso In the case of zzso the expansion of a zzso repeat occurs in the zzso zzso The detection of the expanded zzso repeats has usually involved the zzso separation of zzso chain reaction zzso amplification products using conventional zzso and zzso gel zzso We have undertaken the comparative analysis of zzso zzso repeats of the zzso gene using radioactive and fluorescent zzso amplification, and the subsequent separation of these products by slab gel and zzso zzso The zzso have been performed on both cloned and zzso zzso repeats, as well as zzso DNA from HD patients with a wide range of repeat zzso The mobility of the zzso repeat amplification products of the zzso gene is greater using zzso zzso compared to slab gel zzso The analysis of 40 DNA samples from HD patients indicates that the mobility difference increases with the length of the zzso However, we have devised an zzso zzso for zzso the zzso zzso This zzso provides a mandatory internal zzso system for diagnostic purposes and enables the confident use of either zzso or slab gel zzso for zzso HD zzso
