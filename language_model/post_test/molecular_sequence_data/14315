zzso zzso has been described as a species complex containing two cryptic species, referred to as groups I and zzso The first zzso zzso group I strains outside of Western Europe were collected in Hungary in 2008 from zzso and rape zzso zzso zzso zzso cryptic species were analyzed using a population genetic approach and zzso zzso zzso zzso but moderate population differentiation was found between the two groups in zzso Group I was originally typified by the lack of the zzso elements zzso and zzso However, all the Hungarian group I zzso carried the zzso element and one isolate additionally contained zzso indicating a much wider genetic variation than previously zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that twelve of the thirteen zzso zzso group I zzso studied belonged to a unique zzso zzso group zzso but zzso overlapped between zzso zzso markers such as zzso resistance or asexual spore size were found zzso to differentiate between the cryptic zzso The results did not confirm the complete separation of the two cryptic species, previously determined with zzso zzso of the zzso species recognition using multiple gene zzso and suggest instead the possibility of information exchange between zzso
