Many zzso zzso contain zzso cells that differ in their commitment states but cannot be readily distinguished or zzso zzso analysis is therefore restricted to mixed populations or cell lines which may also be heterogeneous, and the critical differences in gene expression that might determine divergent development are zzso In this study, we combined global amplification of zzso transcripts in single cells with identification of the zzso potential of processed cells on the basis of the fates of their sibling cells from zzso zzso 

We analyzed clones of from four to eight zzso precursor cells which had a variety of zzso zzso sibling cells generally each formed clones of identical composition in secondary zzso zzso amplified zzso was prepared from individual precursors whose zzso potential was identified by tracking sibling zzso Further zzso samples were prepared from terminally zzso homogeneous zzso cell zzso Together, the samples represented 16 positions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns in the sample set were determined for 29 genes known to be involved in zzso cell growth, differentiation or zzso The zzso from a zzso zzso precursor and a zzso zzso precursor were zzso zzso yielding numerous zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso of such clones to the entire precursor sample set identified transcripts with consistent patterns of differential expression in the precursor zzso 

Tracking of sibling fates reliably identifies the zzso potential of a single cell taken for zzso analysis, and demonstrates the existence of a variety of distinct and stable states of zzso zzso Global amplification of zzso from single precursor cells, identified by sibling zzso yields a true representation of zzso and zzso gene zzso as confirmed by zzso to a broad panel of zzso The results provide the first expression mapping of these genes that zzso between zzso in different commitment states, generate new insights and predictions relevant to zzso and introduce a powerful set of tools for zzso the genetic basis of lineage zzso
