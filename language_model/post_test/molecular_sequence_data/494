zzso transport promotes polar growth in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso along zzso and is crucial for polarity in infectious zzso zzso in the zzso domain cause loss of zzso However, it was unclear which zzso are bound and zzso Here, we applied in zzso zzso binding studies and live imaging to determine the molecular function of zzso This new combination revealed that zzso mediates zzso transport of distinct zzso zzso for example, the zzso fusion protein zzso and the small G protein zzso These transcripts accumulate in zzso particles zzso that move zzso along zzso and zzso with zzso zzso the 3' untranslated region of zzso containing a zzso binding site functions as zzso during zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso are not formed when the zzso domain of zzso is deleted, although the protein is still zzso Thus, zzso constitutes an integral component of the transport zzso We propose that zzso zzso trafficking is crucial for zzso growth introducing zzso zzso as attractive model for studying zzso transport in higher zzso
