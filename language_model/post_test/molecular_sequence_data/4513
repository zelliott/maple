The full length zzso sequence of a Type I transforming growth zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This new zzso designated zzso encodes a predicted 645 zzso acid sequence with an zzso zzso stretch which may act as a signal zzso The zzso portion zzso zzso is zzso and has three potential zzso zzso At positions zzso the protein contains the zzso rich motif characteristic of Type I zzso The closest zzso is a zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso which shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso in the most zzso zzso domain zzso zzso Other type I receptors such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show zzso identity in the same zzso Some zzso zzso in zzso and zzso are not present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification has been used to show that the transcript is expressed in the three main stages of the zzso zzso life zzso zzso zzso larvae and zzso The zzso remains unknown at this time but is likely to be most similar to that for zzso zzso zzso
