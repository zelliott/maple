zzso zzso receptors are selectively localized at the zzso membrane of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso were investigated by expressing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the first zzso zzso cassette zzso and zzso were located in zzso zzso zzso associated with the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking this zzso cassette zzso and zzso were distributed throughout the cell, with large amounts of zzso protein present in the cell zzso zzso of this zzso cassette into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to cause zzso to be localized to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, protein zzso C zzso of specific zzso within this zzso disrupted the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso acid sequences contained within the zzso zzso serve to zzso this zzso zzso to discrete membrane zzso in a manner that is regulated by alternative zzso and protein zzso
