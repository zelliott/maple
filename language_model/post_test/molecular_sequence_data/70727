We have identified a new zzso in the zzso gene of zzso in a zzso patient with zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso transition at position zzso which affects the zzso stem loop at a zzso zzso The zzso was neither found in 100 controls nor in the maternal relatives of the zzso The level of zzso zzso was 57% in muscle, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of muscle tissue revealed zzso c zzso fibers with abnormal zzso of zzso zzso of muscle zzso showed slight zzso c zzso zzso The mean ratio of zzso zzso to normal zzso in zzso c zzso muscle fibers was zzso whereas a mean ratio of zzso was found in zzso c zzso zzso The difference between zzso c zzso and zzso c zzso fibers was highly significant zzso zzso zzso The zzso was not found in muscle or zzso of the mother and daughter of the zzso This is the first report of a de zzso point zzso in the zzso gene in an individual expressing disease and the first report of lack of transmission of the zzso to the offspring of a patient expressing a zzso zzso caused by a point zzso in zzso
