zzso control plays a key role in regulating zzso proliferation and zzso Although ample information has been obtained on how zzso zzso is controlled in adult skin, less is known about the control of zzso of zzso zzso cells in the developing zzso zzso zzso a zinc finger protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso is expressed in embryonic zzso zzso cells that are zzso from proliferation to terminal zzso In this study, we demonstrate a function for zzso in zzso zzso zzso In its absence, developing zzso fails to properly restrict the zzso potential of zzso cells, and cultured zzso fail to efficiently undergo growth arrest in response to zzso zzso zzso We present molecular evidence that zzso expression is zzso in zzso zzso cells and that zzso zzso zzso zzso by directly binding to its zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso is required for proliferation exit of committed zzso zzso cells and identify zzso as an zzso zzso
