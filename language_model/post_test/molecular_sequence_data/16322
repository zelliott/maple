Eight species of novel zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso were constructed in which zzso zzso acid sequences were based on that of zzso from zzso cells with higher zzso than conventional zzso Two of this zzso group, zzso as zzso and zzso showed more zzso activity on zzso lung zzso cells and zzso zzso tumor cells than did zzso In addition to these cell lines, zzso revealed strong zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso cells, which are resistant to zzso Moreover, possible zzso activity of zzso seemed to be lower than that of conventional zzso suggesting that zzso has less side zzso Actually, toxicity as expressed by zzso value of zzso as well as others of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of conventional zzso Thus, newly constructed zzso and zzso should be more promising zzso zzso for clinical use, since they were shown to be superior to conventional zzso both in zzso effect and in less side zzso
