Nuclear factor I zzso proteins are zzso zzso factors that participate in the tissue specific expression of various zzso They are zzso by four different genes zzso B, C, and zzso each of which generates multiple zzso by alternative zzso zzso zzso binding sites have been identified in several genes zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso Our prior demonstration that zzso binds to these elements led to the hypothesis that zzso is involved in the regulation of these zzso To zzso the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso gene expression we have performed transient zzso experiments in zzso zzso cells using zzso that place zzso expression under the control of an zzso marker protein zzso zzso containing the zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso of this site revealed a negative zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have used in zzso zzso to zzso the tissue and cellular distribution of the four zzso gene transcripts during zzso and zzso mouse zzso We have simultaneously characterized the expression of zzso and zzso zzso factors known to regulate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that all of these zzso factors vary in specific zzso patterns during the development of the zzso zzso These data on zzso activity, and on zzso factor zzso provide a basis to understand the role of zzso in regulating gene expression in zzso zzso zzso
