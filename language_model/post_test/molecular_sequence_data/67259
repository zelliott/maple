zzso is one of the most common zzso diseases in the world, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in humans and affecting global livestock zzso Most infections are caused by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso bacteria that vary in their distribution in nature and rely on different modes of zzso We report the complete zzso sequences of two strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso that have distinct zzso and zzso These two strains have nearly identical genetic content, with subtle zzso and point zzso being a common form of genetic zzso zzso limited regions of zzso are shared between the large zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso probably the result of frequent zzso events between zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is approximately 700 zzso smaller and has a lower coding density than zzso zzso indicating it is zzso through a process of zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of gene function is not random but is centered on impairment of environmental sensing and zzso transport and zzso These features distinguish zzso zzso from zzso zzso a species with minimal genetic zzso and that survives extended passage in aquatic environments encountering a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is evolving toward dependence on a strict zzso transmission zzso
