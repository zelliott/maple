zzso Site directed zzso was used to alter the structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to identify zzso acid zzso which contribute to zzso zzso by zzso zzso receptors were expressed in zzso zzso zzso injected with in zzso zzso zzso and the whole cell currents induced by zzso zzso were recorded by two zzso zzso zzso zzso A series of zzso of a highly zzso zzso at position 209 of the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that positively charged zzso acids are required for functional zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso or His zzso zzso at position 209 shifted the zzso for zzso slightly from 5 zzso to 12 zzso and increased the zzso zzso channel activity zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso altered the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso by zzso The extent of zzso of zzso channel function by zzso was decreased as pH increased in both wild type and zzso zzso suggesting that the doubly charged form of zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso Further zzso at different positions of the alpha zzso suggest the contribution of Pro and zzso zzso at positions 211 and zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso did not have any zzso None of these zzso changed the sensitivity of zzso to zzso by a different zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings support a hypothesis that the zzso binding site is located in the zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, the quantitative effect of point zzso at alternate positions on the sensitivity of zzso zzso suggests that the secondary structure at the beginning of zzso region might be beta sheet zzso
