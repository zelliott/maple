In the zzso nucleus, zzso nuclear zzso exist in a complex with a specific set of proteins to form zzso nuclear zzso particles zzso The C zzso C1 and zzso are major constituents of zzso and appear to play a role in zzso zzso as suggested by zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the use of a previously described partial zzso clone as a zzso probe, full-length zzso for the human C proteins were zzso All of the zzso isolated zzso to two zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of a zzso clone for the zzso zzso zzso revealed a single open reading frame of 290 zzso acids coding for a protein of zzso zzso and two zzso signals, zzso approximately 400 base pairs apart in the 3' untranslated region of the zzso DNA sequencing of a clone corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso indicated that the sequence of this zzso is identical to that of the zzso zzso up to the first zzso signal which it zzso Both zzso therefore have the same coding capacity and are probably transcribed from a single zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso selected by zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated that it by itself can direct the synthesis of both C1 and zzso The difference between the C1 and C2 proteins which results in their zzso separation is not known, but most likely one of them is generated from the other zzso Since several zzso proteins appeared by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso as multiple zzso related zzso this raises the possibility that some of these other groups of zzso proteins are also each produced from a single zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the protein indicates that it is composed of two distinct zzso an zzso zzso that contains what we have recently described as a zzso consensus zzso which is the putative zzso site, and a zzso zzso that is very zzso charged, contains no aromatic zzso acids or zzso and contains a putative zzso zzso fold, as well as a zzso site for zzso zzso type zzso The zzso consensus sequence was also found in the zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso nuclear zzso proteins A1 and zzso and the zzso binding protein zzso All of these proteins are also composed of at least two distinct zzso an zzso zzso which possesses one or more zzso consensus zzso and a zzso zzso which is unique to each zzso being very zzso in the C proteins and rich in zzso in zzso and zzso and rich in zzso in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso of these proteins possesses a highly zzso zzso domain, whereas the zzso zzso contains a region essential to the unique function and interactions of each of the zzso zzso
