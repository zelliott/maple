The zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls zzso zzso and energy zzso Although physical exercise zzso zzso expression in muscle, the underlying mechanism of this effect has remained incompletely zzso We recently identified a novel zzso zzso of zzso transcript zzso zzso that is derived from a previously unidentified first zzso We have now cloned and characterized the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso this promoter through interaction with a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, either forced expression of zzso and zzso protein zzso IV zzso zzso A, or the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso activated the zzso promoter in cultured zzso through recruitment of zzso response element zzso protein zzso to a putative zzso located downstream of the zzso Our results thus reveal a potential molecular basis for zzso regulation of zzso expression in contracting zzso
