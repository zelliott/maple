A method has been developed to search for the zzso factor Tu zzso zzso that interact with zzso factor zzso zzso This method is based on the suppression of zzso coli zzso negative zzso zzso a zzso that exerts its effect by zzso zzso We have identified nine zzso zzso zzso suppression zzso in the region zzso of zzso These zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All suppression zzso but one zzso significantly affect zzso ability to interact with zzso under equilibrium zzso Moreover, with the exception of zzso zzso the zzso affinity of zzso appears to be relatively unaffected by these zzso These results suggest that the domain of zzso 154 to 199 on zzso is involved in interacting with zzso These suppression zzso are also capable of suppressing dominant negative zzso zzso and zzso to various zzso This suggests that dominant negative zzso zzso and zzso are likely to have the same molecular basis as the zzso zzso The method we have developed in this study is versatile and can be readily adapted to map other regions of zzso A model of zzso zzso exchange is zzso
