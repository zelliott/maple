The small heat shock protein zzso of zzso zzso was recently identified as a zzso protein with a zzso zzso domain at the zzso and a zzso zzso domain at the zzso Here, we report that the two identical tandem genes zzso and zzso which zzso the heat shock protein zzso show the zzso pattern of general stress zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso of the zzso zzso is induced by various environmental stress conditions: in addition to heat and zzso stress, an increase of the pH of the growth medium from zzso to zzso addition of the salt zzso zzso zzso or of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and lowering the incubation temperature from 37 to 25 degrees C resulted in zzso increased transcript zzso The promoter region deduced from the zzso end of the zzso has only limited similarity to the consensus promoter sequence of zzso zzso A zzso zzso repeat between this promoter and the initiation zzso is proposed to have a regulatory zzso Although zzso zzso is regarded as a strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that it can survive exposure to air or zzso and other zzso to various zzso
