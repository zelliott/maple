The zzso zzso of the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso encodes a sensory zzso system that regulates the expression of several zzso genes in response to environmental zzso In this study we have examined the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli show that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by the same environmental stimuli that result in the lack of expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso These observations were confirmed in zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion in zzso zzso initiation sites upstream of zzso were mapped by primer extension analysis in zzso coli and zzso zzso Two zzso regulated zzso promoters were zzso The zzso promoter is a positively zzso promoter located 90 base pairs upstream of zzso The zzso promoter is located 141 base pairs upstream of zzso and does not appear to require any positive regulatory factors for zzso These results suggest a model describing the regulatory events that take place upstream of the zzso zzso
