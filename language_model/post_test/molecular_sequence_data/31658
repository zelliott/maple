zzso overproduction is one of the major pathological features of zzso and zzso is the major zzso component of airway zzso However, whether zzso signaling is implicated in the regulation of zzso expression in airway secretary cells is still zzso 

The aim of this study is to examine whether zzso signaling can regulate zzso expression and explore the molecular zzso 

Mouse zzso cells and human zzso cells were zzso with zzso and zzso expression was zzso Using gene reporter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the activity of both mouse and human zzso promoter was zzso 

zzso signaling regulated zzso expression both in mouse zzso cells and in human zzso zzso Several zzso site zzso were identified in the zzso region of both mouse and human zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso report zzso revealed that zzso proteins might repress both mouse and human zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso confirmed that zzso binds to the zzso promoter both in mouse zzso cells and in human zzso zzso 

zzso signaling can directly zzso zzso promoter activity through zzso mechanisms, which may be identified as possible targets for zzso of airway zzso zzso in zzso
