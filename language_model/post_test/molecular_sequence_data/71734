The expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso gene was examined in normal zzso from zzso through zzso zzso zzso was detected in the brain, neural tube, and zzso root zzso and in several zzso zzso including the skeletal zzso Heart and skeletal muscle were consistently zzso At zzso zzso was expressed in the condensing zzso cells of the zzso whereas at zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso zzso The dynamic expression of zzso during cartilage differentiation may suggest a functional role in skeletal zzso
