F5 was identified originally as an zzso gene in zzso cells, a zzso helper zzso zzso In adult zzso F5 zzso was expressed at a modest level in zzso zzso at a high level in mature zzso in the nervous system, but not in other zzso Although the F5 sequence is highly zzso over evolution, the function of the F5 protein is zzso In the present studies, the putative F5 zzso region was translated in zzso using a zzso zzso system and in zzso coli, yielding a protein with the predicted molecular weight of 42 zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso was generated against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso of the F5 zzso This zzso specifically recognized zzso F5 zzso Western zzso studies demonstrated a zzso zzso band and a faint zzso band in extracts of adult mouse brain regions, the levels of which paralleled F5 zzso zzso zzso studies of adult mouse brain demonstrated F5 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso expressing the highest levels of F5 protein corresponded to those with the highest levels of F5 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also exhibited strong zzso localized to their zzso zzso These observations suggest that the F5 zzso expression of which appears to be regulated predominantly at the zzso level, may be involved in the maintenance of the functional or zzso polarity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
