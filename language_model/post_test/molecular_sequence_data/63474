The zzso interaction has been increasingly zzso using a variety of techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance zzso mass zzso zzso zzso atomic force zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso However, the detailed molecular mechanism of these weak, zzso zzso dependent interactions remains zzso and new models are needed to probe the nature of this phenomenon in term of key roles of the different zzso groups on zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso An interesting solution is to zzso a series of zzso zzso zzso derivatives in which one of the eight zzso groups of zzso zzso is replaced by a hydrogen zzso and to test the zzso induced by interaction of these zzso in order to gain insight into the functions played by the zzso groups of the zzso zzso This article describes the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to be used for study of the zzso zzso
