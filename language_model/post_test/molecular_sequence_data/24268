Two native zzso zzso zzso and zzso display very different affinities for zzso Since these gamma zzso differ in both primary structure and zzso zzso we examined the relative contributions of each to zzso interaction with zzso We constructed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with altered zzso (where A is an zzso zzso zzso motifs to direct alternate or no zzso of the gamma chains and a set of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso motif at the zzso zzso All the gamma zzso zzso with zzso in zzso cells yielded zzso zzso which were zzso to near zzso and their affinities for receptors and zzso were zzso zzso Whereas zzso of the zzso of zzso from zzso to zzso and of zzso from zzso to zzso had no impact on the affinities of zzso zzso for zzso the zzso zzso zzso had significantly diminished zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso change for the zzso zzso In each case with identical zzso the zzso zzso displayed significantly greater affinity for zzso compared with the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso containing zzso zzso chains with identical zzso modification displayed zzso affinities largely determined by the zzso one-third of the zzso These results indicate that zzso modification of the zzso zzso is essential for binding to both zzso and zzso The zzso type influences the binding affinity for zzso but not for zzso Finally, the primary structure of the zzso zzso provides a major contribution to zzso binding of zzso with the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso
