zzso disease is an zzso disorder of copper transport characterized by progressive neurological zzso and death in early zzso We have isolated a candidate gene zzso for zzso disease and find qualitative or quantitative abnormalities in the zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso Four patients lacking zzso showed zzso of the zzso zzso The gene codes for a 1,500 zzso acid zzso predicted to be a zzso zzso zzso The gene product is most similar to a bacterial zzso zzso and additionally contains six putative zzso motifs at the zzso The gene is transcribed in all cell types tested except liver, consistent with the expression of the zzso zzso
