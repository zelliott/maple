To screen zzso applied to zzso production, a zzso zzso was isolated and the zzso was zzso 

A strain with zzso activity against zzso oil was isolated from the soil zzso by zzso zzso zzso seed and cultivated on zzso oil as sole carbon zzso The organic zzso tolerance of the isolated strain and its zzso were zzso The zzso and zzso zzso by the isolated zzso were zzso The isolated strain was identified according to the zzso and zzso characteristics as well as zzso zzso sequences zzso 

The zzso activity of the strain zzso was zzso zzso The relative biomass of strain zzso in the media containing zzso zzso methanol was zzso The residual activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso could catalyze zzso between zzso acid or zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso or zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso oil with methanol could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as zzso zzso and named zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso had the ability to catalyze zzso and zzso zzso which suggested that it had potential of producing zzso
