zzso zzso cells contain zzso and zzso surfaces with distinct protein zzso To establish and maintain this zzso newly made plasma membrane proteins are sorted in the trans zzso network for delivery to zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso sorting are generally located in the zzso domain of the zzso whereas signals for zzso sorting can be in any part of the protein and can depend on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso to the zzso surface have not been zzso In this study, we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso delivered to the zzso zzso There the zzso can bind a zzso and, with or without bound zzso the zzso can then be zzso to the zzso zzso We found that the zzso of the zzso did not affect the zzso transport of the zzso However, zzso had an effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso tail of the zzso suggested that a short zzso segment was sufficient to zzso the zzso or a neutral reporter from the zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso zzso sorting signal was not involved in polarized zzso traffic of the zzso
