zzso A11 is one of the expanded set of zzso zzso box zzso genes with similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso genes have been shown to be expressed in the most zzso regions of the developing zzso zzso and in overlapping zzso within the developing zzso suggesting that these genes play important roles in pattern formation in both zzso and zzso regions of the zzso In this report zzso in zzso zzso in mouse zzso gave a precise description of zzso A11 gene expression in the developing limbs and in the zzso domain of the developing zzso In addition, we generated a targeted zzso in zzso A11 and characterized the resulting zzso to begin to dissect zzso functions of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A11 zzso mice exhibited double zzso zzso with the zzso zzso segment zzso to form an additional first zzso vertebra and with the zzso region zzso generating yet another zzso zzso Furthermore, skeletal zzso were observed in both forelimbs and zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and radius were zzso the zzso and triangular zzso bones were zzso and abnormal zzso bone development zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and fibula were joined incorrectly and zzso at their zzso zzso Also, an enlarged zzso developed zzso to the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso mice displayed zzso zzso adding an additional level of complexity to the zzso code zzso
