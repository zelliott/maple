The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in rye zzso zzso has been zzso We have used the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify sequences from a zzso domain of the reverse zzso gene of the zzso zzso in this zzso zzso analysis of 26 of these zzso products shows them to be a highly zzso population, a feature that is common in zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that there are about 100,000 individual zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso of a zzso probe, representing the whole population of rye zzso zzso zzso to zzso spreads of zzso zzso a zzso hybrid, shows that these sequences are present throughout all the rye zzso but absent from the zzso regions and, in particular, from the terminal zzso Southern analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso using as a probe zzso one of the rye sequences that is closely similar to the zzso element of zzso shows that close relatives of this zzso zzso are present in all these species in high copy zzso Northern analysis on zzso from zzso shows that the zzso zzso is transcribed in all these cereal plants but in variable zzso high in zzso moderate in wheat and zzso and extremely low in zzso
