The R and B genes of zzso regulate the zzso zzso zzso and constitute a small gene family whose evolution has been shaped by zzso and zzso element zzso To compare the evolution of regulatory genes in the distinct but related zzso of rice and zzso we previously isolated two R zzso from rice zzso zzso The zzso gene on zzso 4 can activate the zzso pathway, whereas the zzso zzso of zzso function, maps to zzso zzso In this study, rice R genes have been further zzso First, we found that an zzso zzso can induce pigmentation in zzso suspension zzso Second, another rice R zzso zzso was identified that is more closely related to zzso than to zzso zzso rice and its wild relatives harbor multiple zzso and zzso genes despite the fact that rice is a true zzso with the smallest zzso of all the grass species analyzed to zzso Finally, several miniature zzso zzso elements zzso were found in R family zzso Their possible role in zzso the divergence of R genes is zzso
