zzso leader zzso zzso zzso contributes the zzso zzso to zzso in a variety of zzso In contrast with some zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso spliced leaders are variable in both sequence and length in different zzso zzso However, an absolutely zzso and unique feature of all zzso spliced leaders is the presence of a zzso zzso We previously suggested that the zzso zzso spliced leader zzso might contribute a required translation zzso zzso to recipient zzso Here we identified and examined zzso zzso from a large set of newly available zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have the zzso zzso zzso with the major open reading frame of the zzso We identified over 40 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that require the zzso zzso as an zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using several zzso stages demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso can serve as a translation zzso zzso in zzso We also present in zzso translation studies of the zzso zzso zzso context and the effect of the spliced leader zzso added upstream and zzso with the main open reading of recipient zzso Overall, our data have provided evidence that another function of zzso spliced leader zzso is to provide some recipient zzso with an zzso zzso for translation zzso
