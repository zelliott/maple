The replication of zzso zzso requires the zzso protein zzso This protein has a double zzso it binds to three directly repeated sequences in the zzso origin and promotes replication of the zzso it binds to two zzso repeated sequences in its promoter region and regulates its own zzso A series of zzso protein derivatives carrying deletions of the zzso region were zzso for specific zzso We found that the last third of the protein is not needed for binding to the various specific zzso zzso proteins that still bind can also form zzso with a zzso zzso Analysis of band zzso zzso conducted with zzso and truncated proteins indicates that zzso binds to directly repeated sequences as a zzso and to zzso repeated sequences as a zzso
