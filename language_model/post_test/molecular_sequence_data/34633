The zzso class of zzso zzso zzso was initially recognized by zzso analysis of human sequence databases, and zzso sequences were subsequently discovered in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In humans and mice, two zzso genes have been recognized and their genetic structures and expression patterns zzso In both species, zzso zzso is expressed in liver and heart as well as a range of other zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the zzso although moderate levels of expression are seen in other zzso zzso zzso of rat and human tissue sections has demonstrated cellular and zzso specificity in the expression of zzso The crystal structure of zzso human zzso has been determined, and it adopts the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in place of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso found in other zzso was shown to form a mixed zzso with zzso zzso class zzso have zzso zzso and zzso activities and also catalyze the reduction of zzso an intermediate in the zzso of zzso zzso Other diverse actions of human zzso include zzso of zzso receptors and interaction with zzso release zzso zzso In addition, zzso has been linked to the age at onset of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's zzso Several zzso have been identified in the coding regions of the human zzso and zzso zzso Our laboratory has expressed zzso human zzso and zzso zzso as well as a number of zzso zzso The expression and zzso of these proteins and determination of their zzso activity is zzso
