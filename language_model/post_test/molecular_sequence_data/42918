The calcium binding protein zzso is involved in regulating various cellular and zzso zzso A gene for zzso has been isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso constructed in zzso zzso using a zzso zzso probe from electric zzso The zzso clone was found to contain a complete copy of a distinct zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso sequence with those from the other plant and animal systems reveals that the zzso zzso gene contains two zzso and a single zzso of 364 zzso The zzso splits the zzso zzso the 25th zzso acid of the zzso The zzso zzso protein appears to be distinct in containing a single zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso at the zzso position from the other known plant and animal zzso The zzso region of this zzso gene zzso contains several known zzso a few of which are known to be implicated in zzso zzso in response to light, zzso radiation and heat shock besides the presence of many small multiple zzso The Southern zzso analysis and a comparison of zzso sequence with those of the other zzso genes of zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso belongs to a small zzso family consisting of at least four members in the zzso zzso
