We investigated the role of the zzso zzso system zzso which allows proteins to be selectively zzso during zzso development in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso altering the UPS were isolated in the zzso zzso zzso they affect the Regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso which (along with zzso encodes one of the six zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso In the zzso state, all three zzso zzso displayed 50% zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is essential for male zzso zzso However, a fourth zzso in the Columbia zzso zzso did not display such a zzso because the zzso Col zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the male zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso does zzso Double zzso zzso zzso showed a complete male and female zzso lethal zzso in a Col background, indicating that zzso zzso are essential for both zzso zzso zzso divisions were affected in double zzso zzso zzso with an absence of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso expression is highly increased when zzso functioning is zzso allowing zzso of the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso are not only essential for both male and female zzso development but also display zzso zzso and are crucial in cell cycle zzso
