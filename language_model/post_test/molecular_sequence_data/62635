A new concept relating to the zzso protocol for biological proteins and peptides has been designed as zzso mass zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso using slices of zzso zzso zzso from the extract of zzso molecular cloning for the determination of the precursor structure, and zzso zzso analysis for zzso of its zzso zzso In an actual application, we identified an zzso zzso from the red swamp zzso zzso zzso zzso Initially, an zzso number of around zzso zzso was found by the direct zzso zzso analysis with slices of the accessory lobe of the zzso After two steps of zzso zzso separation with brain zzso the structure of a zzso Da zzso was zzso to the zzso (named zzso zzso the zzso has been characterized and encodes a 76 zzso acid precursor protein that contains a signal zzso one copy of zzso and one additional zzso The zzso analysis implied that the zzso of the zzso was expressed throughout the nervous system of the zzso Furthermore, zzso demonstrated that the zzso is distributed in the zzso zzso accessory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lobe zzso In addition, database searches revealed that there are zzso sequences of the zzso in the zzso library of zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from the giant tiger prawn zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso family might be widely distributed in zzso and plays a significant role in the nervous zzso
