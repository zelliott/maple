zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind with high affinity to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Basic zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso compete with zzso for zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso positive charge in the binding zzso A zzso zzso acid sequence with a zzso zzso core is perfectly zzso between the A- and zzso zzso and was therefore considered as a possible zzso zzso We have investigated the functional importance of positive charge within this region of the zzso zzso by using zzso zzso to convert the zzso core zzso acids to the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and charge zzso zzso proteins were expressed following stable zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso Proper assembly and zzso of zzso was verified by zzso labeling with zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso analysis under zzso and reducing zzso zzso was zzso as two major species of zzso zzso zzso identical in molecular mass to those observed for zzso (32 and 35 zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso to zzso and subjected to structural and functional zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso displayed a marked reduction in both binding affinity for zzso zzso and zzso activity in Swiss zzso zzso Large reductions were also observed in the ability of zzso zzso to stimulate calcium influx and the production of zzso zzso zzso of circular zzso zzso of highly zzso zzso and zzso revealed no significant difference in secondary zzso zzso these results indicate that the zzso zzso region plays a critical role in the biological activity of zzso by direct participation in zzso binding to the zzso zzso
