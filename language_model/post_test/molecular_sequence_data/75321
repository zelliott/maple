A DNA library from a virulent strain of zzso zzso was constructed in the expression zzso zzso zzso and the library was zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso were isolated and characterized by using zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognize a zzso protein zzso zzso is a major protein zzso of the vaccine strain of zzso zzso zzso and of virulent zzso zzso the zzso agent of bovine zzso Of 32 clones selected by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 were recognized by the zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso recognized all 5 zzso zzso of these clones showed that one clone containing a zzso insert expressed a zzso bound by all of the zzso zzso zzso Western blots zzso showed that this cloned protein was recognized by zzso from zzso zzso zzso although not all cattle with bovine tuberculosis produced zzso zzso to this zzso DNA sequencing of the clone showed that it coded for 84 zzso acids from positions 17 to 114 of the zzso zzso with a zzso deletion between positions 79 and zzso Apart from this zzso there were seven other variations between the cloned sequence and that deduced from zzso zzso zzso zzso
