Different genetic regions representing the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso gene have been used for zzso studies of viral zzso zzso virus zzso Since these analyses were performed on different virus zzso using various zzso regions, it has been difficult to evaluate how the choice of target region affects the output of the zzso To address this, we zzso and performed parallel zzso analysis of an N gene fragment, the entire zzso zzso zzso and G zzso and 4 different fragments of the G gene from a fixed virus zzso The overall zzso of the selected zzso was identical for the 7 target regions, but separation of zzso I zzso was best when the analysis was performed on the full length G gene zzso zzso zzso Good resolution was zzso obtained using smaller sequencing windows represented by a G gene zzso zzso 360 to zzso or the zzso gene zzso zzso although these regions had different characteristics with respect to resolution of zzso I zzso and resolution within zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the deduced zzso acid sequences was also zzso The zzso relationship between the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the zzso corresponded best in the case of the N zzso For the 6 other zzso regions, genetically distant zzso occasionally grouped together when compared at protein zzso No clear relationship between the G gene zzso and zzso with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was observed, stressing that zzso analysis based on zzso characteristics such as zzso could be zzso
