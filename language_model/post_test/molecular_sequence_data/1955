The sequence specificity and time course of zzso DNA zzso formation of the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 2; en zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated using restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and compared to the damage produced by the clinical agent zzso zzso zzso The rate of DNA binding of 1 and 2 was also monitored by atomic zzso zzso zzso zzso were chosen that cleave the zzso linkage at, or adjacent to, the predicted damage zzso While zzso 2 selectively protected zzso zzso from zzso by zzso and zzso zzso at their respective restriction sites, G downward zzso zzso and zzso downward zzso zzso 1 inhibited DNA zzso by zzso and zzso at A downward zzso zzso and G downward zzso zzso zzso mark zzso zzso more zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso revealed major zzso damage sites for 2 at zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso is efficiently stalled at zzso zzso primarily in the sequence zzso where the damaged zzso is flanked by two zzso zzso sites of zzso While 1 targets zzso zzso the binding of 2 appears to be dominated by the groove and sequence recognition of the zzso The zzso zzso used confirm previous structural information extracted from mass zzso of DNA fragments modified by 2 isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms and biological consequences of the unprecedented modification of alternating zzso sequences by 2, which occurred at a faster rate than binding to G, are zzso
