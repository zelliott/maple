A zzso DNA sequence element, termed zzso 1 zzso is found in the promoter regions of many zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso analyses and modification interference experiments show that this sequence specifically binds a nuclear zzso factor, zzso which is a protein with a molecular mass of 43 zzso It interacts with different affinities with the zzso sequence from a number of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso We show here that the level of zzso binding is induced in embryonic zzso by tumor necrosis zzso zzso treatment and that the zzso sequence from the zzso gene is a zzso zzso in these zzso The zzso protein is distinct from another zzso zzso factor, zzso B, by several zzso zzso several zzso zzso sites, although having sequence similarity with the zzso zzso cannot compete efficiently for zzso binding to zzso zzso the zzso sequence from both zzso and zzso does not respond to zzso zzso treatment as would an zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a novel zzso factor zzso by zzso and binds to a common element in zzso gene zzso
