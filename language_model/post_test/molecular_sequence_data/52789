zzso entry into zzso cells requires the sequential interactions of the viral envelope zzso with zzso and a zzso such as the zzso receptors zzso and zzso A plausible approach to blocking this process is to use small zzso zzso of zzso zzso One such inhibitor has been described for zzso the zzso zzso To facilitate the further development of entry zzso as zzso drugs, we have explored how zzso acts to prevent zzso infection, and we have mapped its site of interaction with zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso replication at the membrane fusion stage by blocking the interaction of the viral surface zzso zzso with zzso We could identify no zzso acid zzso within the zzso domain of zzso that affected the zzso action of zzso However, zzso scanning zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that the binding site for zzso on zzso is located near the zzso surface of the zzso within a cavity formed between zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, and zzso
