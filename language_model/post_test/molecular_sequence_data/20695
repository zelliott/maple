zzso zzso sequencing has focused attention on understanding differences between species and between zzso When this genetic variation affects protein zzso the rate of zzso acid substitution reflects both zzso selection for functionally advantageous zzso and selectively neutral evolution operating within the constraints of structure and zzso During neutral evolution, zzso zzso accumulate by random zzso zzso acid zzso are constrained by factors such as the formation of zzso and zzso interactions and the accessibility to water or lipids surrounding the zzso These constraints arise from the need to conserve a specific architecture and to retain interactions that mediate functions in protein families and zzso
