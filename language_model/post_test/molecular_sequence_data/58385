The zzso zzso of canine zzso zzso is analyzed following atomic refinement at zzso A zzso The zzso contains 60 copies of the zzso protein related by zzso zzso The atomic model has been extended from the first zzso zzso of the unrefined zzso A structure towards the N zzso The electron density shows that approximately zzso of the zzso proteins have N zzso on the inside of the zzso but for approximately zzso the zzso starts on the outside and runs through one of the pores surrounding each zzso zzso explaining apparently conflicting zzso zzso Analysis of potential hydrogen bonds reveals approximately 50% more secondary structure than previously zzso Most of the additional secondary structure are in the 71 and 221 zzso loop insertions between zzso E and F and G and zzso forming zzso sheets that likely add specificity to assembly zzso zzso analysis of the extensive zzso interactions around the zzso axes shows that assembly is a zzso process with zzso zzso following initial zzso zzso free energies of association suggest that the formation of 3 and zzso contacts likely takes zzso over zzso zzso zzso for initial association into zzso or zzso would be similar, but the zzso of zzso about the zzso axis adds an additional large zzso barrier to zzso Analysis of the surfaces of the assembled zzso shows a surprising lack of basic zzso acids that might have been expected to interact with the zzso charged zzso backbone of the zzso Instead, zzso polar and van der zzso interactions predominate in the packaging of zzso DNA into the zzso
