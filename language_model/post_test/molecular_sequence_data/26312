The zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso has been genetically manipulated to yield a zzso virus capable of expressing zzso the major core protein of zzso in insect cell zzso The expressed product is a zzso protein flanked by short regions of zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso It has been identified and characterized using zzso zzso on Western blots and by zzso sequence zzso The presence of zzso in the soluble fraction of infected cells following zzso by zzso or zzso combined with a high level of expression (in excess of 50 zzso of zzso zzso the enrichment of large quantities of zzso zzso zzso in a simple zzso procedure involving ammonium zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso zzso zzso in this way is shown to be an efficient diagnostic zzso
