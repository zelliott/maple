zzso is a zzso modification involved in zzso interactions as well as in zzso zzso to zzso zzso however, its role in targeting proteins to specific zzso compartments has not been clearly zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is integrated into zzso and zzso outer zzso via an anchor containing a stretch of 14 zzso zzso acids downstream to the zzso zzso zzso Since previous studies suggested that the zzso function could be adequately carried out by the 14 zzso zzso we investigated a possible role for zzso acid in zzso zzso The wild type zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cells, and their zzso was investigated by zzso zzso and cell zzso By all three techniques, the zzso protein localized to zzso and zzso while the zzso zzso was found only on zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that this altered steady state distribution was due to the zzso inability to target to zzso and not to its enhanced instability in that zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were resistant to zzso extraction and zzso into the zzso phase after treatment of a membrane fraction with zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso acid is not required for tight zzso of zzso to zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso by different mechanisms, and reveal a novel role for zzso acid in protein zzso
