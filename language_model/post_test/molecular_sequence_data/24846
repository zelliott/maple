zzso synthesis in zzso requires two kinds of zzso initiation and zzso The former zzso the process zzso zzso in zzso and special zzso zzso in zzso The latter zzso in the synthesis proper, recognizing the sense zzso zzso is also assisted by special zzso zzso zzso and termination zzso The termination factors are necessary to recognize stop zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to release the complete protein chain from the zzso zzso preceding a stop zzso No termination zzso capable of recognizing stop zzso by their zzso is zzso The termination factors are thought to do zzso In the large zzso zzso we found two sites that, like zzso contain the zzso hairpin but with triplets complementary to stop zzso One site is hairpin 69 from domain zzso the other site is hairpin 89, domain zzso By zzso we call them termination zzso zzso and zzso respectively, even though they transport no zzso zzso and suggest that they directly pair to stop zzso The termination factors only aid in this recognition, making it specific and zzso A strong argument in favor of our hypothesis comes from zzso zzso They are known to acquire two new stop zzso zzso and zzso In the standard code, these are two out of six zzso zzso We revealed that the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso have evolved in zzso of these zzso
