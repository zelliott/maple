zzso zzso bypass a 50 zzso coding gap in order to fuse the information found in the two open reading frames zzso of zzso T4 gene zzso This study investigates the underlying mechanism by focusing on the competition between initiation of bypassing and termination at the end of the first zzso While nearly all zzso initiate zzso no more than 50% resume translation in the second zzso Two previously described zzso zzso signals are critical for favoring initiation of bypassing over zzso zzso analysis of these signals supports a working model in which the first (a zzso structure at the junction between the first zzso and the coding zzso interferes with decoding in the zzso and the second (a stretch of zzso acids in the nascent zzso zzso by the first zzso zzso zzso zzso
