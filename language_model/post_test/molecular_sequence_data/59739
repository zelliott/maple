The zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso responsive zzso the combined zzso and a downstream zzso zzso The integrity of all three sites is essential for zzso zzso The zzso 74 zzso long DNA region zzso Cooperation zzso is in turn required for the synergistic action of the zzso and zzso zzso Here we present a characterization of the zzso zzso our results show that zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a structural role in the induction of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso structure zzso and zzso and each half contributes by about 50% to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function is strictly dependent on its position, but not on its orientation and neither the entire zzso nor individual zzso sites can directly zzso a test zzso zzso The requirement for zzso in zzso is partly eliminated by the deletion of zzso zzso However, also in the zzso zzso integrity of the zzso and zzso sites is essential for zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso proteins provide a structural surface which zzso the cooperation between the zzso proteins bound at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso are found in the promoters of other zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso and zzso for example, in the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso identity is found in a region zzso positive and negative functions in zzso zzso Thus, zzso elements represent a general zzso function which, although lacking an intrinsic zzso capacity, zzso the zzso between zzso factors bound to distant zzso
