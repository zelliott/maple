A sequencing method called zzso amplification with transcript sequencing zzso is described that is based on amplification with the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso cloning and increases the rate of sequence acquisition by at least zzso The method involves the attachment of a zzso promoter onto at least one of the zzso zzso The segments amplified by zzso are transcribed to further increase the signal and to provide an abundance of zzso template for reverse zzso zzso zzso An zzso reverse zzso primer complementary to the desired sequence generates the additional specificity required to generate zzso sequence zzso zzso can be performed on as little as a zzso of zzso zzso The rate of zzso can be increased by zzso and zzso of multiple regions as illustrated by two regions of the factor IX zzso Since zzso lends itself well to automation, further increases in the rate of sequence acquisition can be zzso
