zzso zzso is found in many zzso zzso where it may participate in local zzso zzso In this study we explore the feasibility of using zzso zzso to decrease zzso production in rat zzso zzso zzso An zzso shuttle zzso was modified to allow the production of high levels of stable zzso zzso from two regions of the mouse zzso gene under the control of the zzso sheep zzso zzso zzso transformed, zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso for zzso were isolated after selection with the zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso integrated copies of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso selection for zzso zzso activity carried on the shuttle zzso With a zzso to zzso induction of the zzso zzso the target zzso zzso level was reduced to zzso of control zzso The specificity of this effect was confirmed by showing no decrease in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso it should be possible to direct these effects to specific zzso in transgenic zzso However, in agreement with results from other groups, our findings suggest that it will not be possible to eradicate completely the target gene product using the zzso zzso zzso
