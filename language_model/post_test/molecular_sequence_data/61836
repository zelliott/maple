Post source zzso zzso analysis of precursor zzso generated from zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso is a powerful tool for zzso acid sequencing and primary structure analysis of zzso zzso zzso has become an effective zzso strategy in zzso de zzso zzso sequencing by the formation of predominate zzso zzso series in zzso zzso zzso Recently, an effective and inexpensive zzso zzso method has been reported using zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we report an improvement in the zzso procedure with this zzso that involves replacing an organic zzso with other chemicals and eliminating the use of organic zzso The method is demonstrated on a model zzso and on zzso zzso of two zzso The results indicate that the improved zzso reaction can be implemented with high efficiency under zzso conditions and that the sensitivity of mass detection can be increased zzso
