A strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso was isolated from an oil field at a depth of zzso zzso where the temperature was 92 degrees zzso The cells of this zzso were zzso straight, zzso rods zzso by 2 to 3 zzso with zzso zzso The cells occurred zzso or in pairs during the zzso growth phase, but were zzso and zzso zzso 15 zzso in old zzso Growth occurred at temperatures of 40 to 75 degrees C, and optimum growth occurred at temperatures between 55 and 60 degrees zzso The zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The products of zzso of zzso were zzso zzso ethanol, zzso and zzso The DNA base composition was 35 zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso sequence comparisons indicated that strain zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and these three organisms exhibited levels of zzso DNA sequence zzso of 98 to zzso The results of zzso zzso studies performed with the three organisms confirmed this close zzso and as base pairing values of zzso zzso were zzso these organisms belong to the same zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso should be reclassified as a subspecies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This automatically creates zzso zzso zzso zzso We also propose that strain zzso zzso should be classified as a member of a new subspecies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
