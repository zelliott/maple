The zzso regulatory region of the mouse zzso protein 4 zzso a remarkably versatile zzso protein responsible for zzso and zzso was cloned and functionally zzso Three potential zzso start sites were determined by zzso and found to be at zzso zzso and zzso relative to the translation initiation zzso The activities of the putative promoters were confirmed using a zzso zzso reporter gene zzso system, following transient zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso region and the minimal region required for zzso activity of the zzso promoter were determined by generating a series of deletion zzso and were found to be zzso by a sequence between zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso zzso recognition sequences for the zzso factor zzso were identified in the minimal promoter zzso These results are the first molecular characterization of the regulatory region of this important zzso
