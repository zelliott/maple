The solution zzso of eight zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli, characterized by long variable regions, and the interaction of four of them with bean zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso mapping with zzso zzso zzso in the variable regions agree with the existence of zzso zzso closed by zzso At the junction of these regions with the zzso zzso 48 is strongly protected, in contrast to small variable region zzso where zzso is zzso The constant protection of zzso is another characteristics of zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso zzso concern the zzso region, the zzso and the variable zzso In several parts of free zzso species, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are similar to those found in zzso of other zzso indicating zzso similarities among zzso zzso zzso of four zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso indicates that the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso and the hinge region between the zzso and zzso are in contact with the plant zzso
