zzso binding and zzso zzso T cell zzso studies have been used to characterize T cell recognition of an zzso T cell zzso from zzso basic protein in mice of the zzso zzso An important role for zzso class II molecules in zzso zzso is zzso zzso acids which determine interactions with either the restriction element of the major zzso complex zzso or the zzso T cell zzso are zzso This information enables the design of peptides which bind zzso yet do not zzso with the zzso Two such peptides compete with the zzso for binding to the disease associated class II zzso and inhibit induction of experimental zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso therapy are zzso
