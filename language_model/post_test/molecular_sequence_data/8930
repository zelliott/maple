zzso zzso with zzso and zzso finger zzso 1) plays an important role in DNA zzso zzso zzso function and gene zzso zzso of zzso has been suggested to contribute to zzso However, regulation of zzso is largely zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso interacts with zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso experiments, we demonstrate that both physical interaction and zzso activity of zzso are necessary for zzso zzso and stability zzso Mass zzso analysis identified zzso of zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain of zzso which was further confirmed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso identifies zzso zzso in zzso cells and consistently zzso can be zzso by the M zzso zzso zzso B in zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduces zzso interaction with zzso in zzso and in zzso which is correlated with a decreased zzso stability in the M phase of the cell zzso In contrast, zzso carrying the zzso zzso which renders zzso resistant to zzso at zzso is more zzso zzso cells carrying the zzso zzso grow more slowly suggesting that maintaining an appropriate level of zzso is important for cell proliferation zzso Taken together, our findings uncovered a cell zzso signaling event that zzso zzso from its interaction with zzso thus exposing zzso to zzso zzso These findings identify a molecular mechanism by which cellular zzso level is zzso which may impact cell zzso
