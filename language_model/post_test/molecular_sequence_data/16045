zzso zzso strains with a disrupted zzso gene and with an intact zzso gene zzso zzso zzso grew well on both zzso and zzso carbon zzso By constructing zzso zzso having a disrupted zzso locus and a randomly zzso zzso zzso zzso we obtained zzso strains with specific growth zzso The strain zzso was unable to grow on zzso carbon sources and zzso at 37 degrees C, while it could grow on zzso at the same zzso The zzso zzso gene in zzso cells zzso a protein with the zzso at positions 82 and 84 replaced by zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso were necessary for temperature zzso We also isolated a zzso zzso that was unable to grow on zzso carbon sources both at 30 and 37 degrees C, while growing on zzso at both zzso This zzso was caused by a single zzso zzso leading to the replacement of zzso acid 40 of the zzso protein by zzso A zzso zzso strain with a zzso zzso gene zzso the three zzso together did not grow at any temperature using zzso carbon sources, but it was able to grow on zzso at 30 degrees C, and not at 37 degrees zzso The zzso proteins were much less effective than the zzso zzso protein in the stimulation of zzso zzso but were efficiently expressed in zzso The possible roles of zzso 40, 82 and 84 of the zzso protein in the regulation of zzso zzso are zzso
