In mice, a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulates zzso embryonic growth, including zzso rate and zzso zzso has been zzso The objective of the current study was to identify the bovine zzso of the zzso gene and to characterize the zzso expression pattern of this gene during bovine zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso databases were searched for bovine zzso that were zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and the resulting zzso were aligned and assembled into a zzso zzso The zzso of the sequence to the zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso were designed for the zzso and the zzso expression pattern was characterized during bovine zzso zzso development in zzso and in zzso In zzso bovine zzso were cultured either in zzso in synthetic zzso fluid, or in zzso in the zzso zzso for zzso days and processed for quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso abundance increased at each stage of zzso However, the expression levels were consistently higher in in zzso zzso at all zzso with in zzso zzso showing a zzso increase in relative transcript abundance during culture from the zzso to the zzso stage in contrast to just under a zzso increase during the same culture period in zzso The zzso expression pattern of the gene was investigated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso collected at 25, 28, 32, and zzso h zzso zzso zzso relative abundance was highest in those zzso that had zzso by 28 zzso and decreased almost zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified a potential bovine zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso expression pattern of this gene during zzso zzso development in cattle and shown that a greater relative abundance of the gene transcript is associated with zzso of higher quality (in zzso zzso and greater zzso potential zzso zzso
