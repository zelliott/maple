In the human and zzso zzso the major zzso product of the zzso zzso zzso cells is zzso The expression of zzso is associated with elevated zzso levels as its production zzso during the late zzso phase of the zzso cycle and in early zzso zzso with our previous studies, we found that the majority of the zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso promoter was retained in the zzso region, a region devoid of zzso and zzso zzso Using serial zzso and 3' deletions of 10 zzso of the promoter within the zzso zzso we identified the zzso and 3' limits required for zzso responsiveness as zzso and zzso zzso When the same regions were cloned into the zzso zzso a construct that contains the zzso zzso promoter, zzso did not enhance zzso zzso of the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso which zzso its ability to activate the zzso response element, does not zzso its ability to induce expression via the zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso blocked the zzso induction as did an inhibitor of zzso zzso but not an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings imply that zzso induction in response to zzso involves a zzso mechanism through the zzso branch of the zzso zzso zzso The ultimate target may be a factor involved in the initiation of zzso gene zzso
