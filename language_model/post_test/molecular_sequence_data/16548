Nine potential zzso counterparts, designated zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed two types of zzso one with zzso I) and one without zzso zzso a zzso or zzso zzso extension, possibly representing a zzso zzso of zzso zzso type II zzso in zzso coli resulted in zzso zzso processing of the zzso into large and small zzso in zzso to animal zzso A detailed zzso characterization with a broad range of synthetic zzso and several zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins of both zzso 4 and 9 showed that both zzso are zzso zzso zzso and did not cleave zzso synthetic zzso These findings suggest that type II zzso are not directly responsible for earlier reported zzso activities in zzso
