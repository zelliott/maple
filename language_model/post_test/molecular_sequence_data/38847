During zzso of zzso zzso spore coat proteins zzso by cot genes are expressed in the mother cell and deposited on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso genes by final zzso zzso zzso is activated by a small, zzso protein called zzso The promoter region of each of these genes has two zzso binding zzso zzso deletions that eliminated the more upstream zzso site decreased expression of zzso fused to zzso and zzso by approximately zzso and zzso respectively but had no effect on zzso zzso The zzso fusion was expressed later during zzso than the other two zzso zzso extension analysis confirmed that zzso zzso increases first during zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso over a zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of zzso and another zzso factor, zzso A low concentration of zzso activated zzso zzso by final zzso zzso zzso whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate zzso of zzso or zzso zzso at low concentration zzso zzso transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially zzso zzso zzso and had little effect on zzso zzso zzso I zzso showed that zzso binds strongly to two sites in the zzso promoter region, binds zzso to one site in the zzso promoter, and does not bind specifically to zzso We propose that late in zzso the rising level of zzso and the falling level of zzso together with the position and affinity of binding sites for these zzso factors in cot gene zzso dictates the timing and level of spore coat protein zzso ensuring optimal assembly of the protein shell on the zzso zzso
