A zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a fat body zzso zzso The zzso has an open reading frame which codes a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso a zzso signal zzso and a zzso mature zzso of Mr zzso The zzso site of zzso for zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso was identified as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence with those of 11 members of the zzso zzso of proteins clearly confirmed the zzso of zzso with zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso identical with that of the zzso inhibitor from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the sequence around the zzso site shows no zzso and the zzso specificity for zzso is very zzso
