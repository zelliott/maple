The internal transcribed zzso region zzso and zzso of the zzso nuclear zzso DNA sequence and the intervening zzso region from five species of the zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction and subjected to direct DNA zzso On the basis of zzso studies some species of this zzso were zzso to be related by the number of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso among species are in good agreement with previous relationships established on the basis of zzso zzso We also identified a highly zzso sequence of six zzso in the zzso reported to be present in a wide range of flowering plants, but not in the zzso family to which the zzso zzso belongs zzso
