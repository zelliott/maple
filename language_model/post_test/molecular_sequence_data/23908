The zzso regulator zzso protein in zzso zzso and its better characterized zzso the diphtheria toxin zzso zzso from zzso zzso are zzso regulatory proteins that control gene expression in response to iron availability in zzso zzso regulates several genes required for iron zzso and storage including those involved in the synthesis of transition metal zzso called zzso that are linked to the zzso tuberculosis zzso In this study, the metal zzso and binding affinities for zzso binding to an zzso operator duplex DNA were estimated using zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso affinities of the two metal zzso binding sites in zzso that are involved in the zzso of the regulator DNA binding process in zzso were independently zzso zzso to the two metal zzso binding sites is apparently cooperative and the two affinities differ zzso zzso of the first metal zzso binding site causes zzso of zzso and the metal zzso affinity is about 4 zzso for zzso and much less for zzso and zzso zzso of the second metal zzso fully activates zzso for binding to the zzso zzso The equilibrium metal zzso zzso zzso for zzso operator binding are approximately 9 zzso for zzso 13 zzso for zzso and 23 zzso for zzso Interestingly, the natural zzso zzso zzso shows high affinities toward both binding zzso These results provide insight into the possible roles for each metal binding site in zzso zzso
