zzso segregate at zzso along zzso attached to the zzso an zzso that assembles at the zzso Despite major advances in defining molecular components of the zzso segregation apparatus, including discrete zzso sequences and proteins of the zzso relatively little is known of corresponding elements in more complex zzso We show here that human zzso a human zzso previously localized to the zzso assembles at zzso of divergent species, and that the specificity of this targeting is maintained by an inherent destruction mechanism that prevents the zzso of zzso and toxicity of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is not only required for zzso destruction but renders unstable proteins that otherwise possess long zzso The zzso targeting of zzso is underscored by the discovery of significant zzso between regions of zzso and zzso a protein of zzso zzso required for the correct segregation of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso impair the ability of zzso to assemble at the zzso Together, these data indicate that essential elements of the zzso segregation apparatus are zzso in zzso
