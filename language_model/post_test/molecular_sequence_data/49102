A specific zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed for the identification of goose zzso zzso mule duck zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso turkey zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in foie zzso A forward common primer was designed on a zzso DNA sequence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and reverse zzso were designed to zzso on zzso DNA sequences of each species zzso The different sizes of the zzso zzso separated by zzso gel zzso allowed clear identification of zzso mule zzso chicken, zzso and zzso in foie zzso Analysis of experimental zzso demonstrated that the detection limit of the zzso was approximately zzso for each species zzso This genetic marker can be very useful for the accurate identification of these species, avoiding zzso or fraudulent species substitution in foie zzso
