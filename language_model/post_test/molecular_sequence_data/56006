zzso microscopic analysis of zzso structures isolated from an zzso zzso zzso and composed of a zzso zzso show the functional unit to be a zzso zzso of protein arranged around a central channel which runs perpendicular to the plane of the zzso zzso of the molecular volume carried out on an averaged projection are consistent with a zzso mass of zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso indicates a high zzso content for the zzso supporting zzso predictions of four zzso alpha zzso The averaged projection shows a close resemblance to a zzso of the zzso protein built on the basis of a four zzso bundle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jackson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thompson, zzso Jones, zzso zzso & Findlay, zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso 5, zzso The reconstructed image is also similar to that obtained for zzso channels isolated from a related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose protein content was unknown but which we demonstrate may be composed of a related zzso zzso Previous studies have shown a high sequence identity of the zzso zzso protein with the zzso zzso zzso c of the vascular zzso both of which in turn bear similarity to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coding for the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso in which the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso has been zzso restores zzso activity and cell zzso
