Global zzso and regional zzso are supposed to be hallmarks of cancer zzso During gastric zzso in which zzso zzso infection is zzso involved, zzso zzso is already present in zzso zzso gastric zzso In contrast, little is known about global zzso which can be caused by zzso of individual repetitive elements and other zzso zzso therefore, investigated zzso of individual repetitive elements and the global zzso content in four groups of gastric zzso samples that represented the time course of zzso zzso infection and gastric zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gastric cancer patients zzso zzso zzso 34) and zzso zzso gastric cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and 52 primary gastric zzso Major zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were identified, and their zzso levels were zzso by zzso zzso Compared with zzso the zzso zzso level was decreased in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of that in zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso level was decreased in zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso level was decreased only in zzso The zzso content was at similar levels in zzso zzso and zzso and highly variable in zzso These results showed that zzso and zzso zzso is induced in gastric zzso by zzso zzso infection during gastric zzso possibly in different target cells, and that global zzso is not always present in human gastric zzso
