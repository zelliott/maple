The zzso zzso is expressed in a wide range of zzso during zzso zzso This zzso along with the zzso capacity of this zzso has led to the suggestion that zzso plays an important role in early zzso However, due to the complexity of the expression pattern and the difficulty of manipulating zzso zzso little progress has been made towards understanding the zzso function of this zzso To enable a more detailed analysis of the role of this gene in early development, a study of the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated from a zzso library using a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the timing of expression of zzso zzso and of the distribution of zzso protein during zzso development indicate that this gene may be playing an important role in the formation of a number of embryonic structures, including the nervous zzso zzso is initially expressed as a maternal zzso but this zzso is zzso by the zzso stage of zzso zzso expression does not zzso until late zzso zzso of the distribution of the zzso protein by zzso zzso indicates that the early embryonic expression occurs in the central nervous system, the neural zzso the zzso and the zzso Later expression is mostly within the head and zzso zzso structures within the head that express the protein include the eye, zzso zzso fore and zzso and a number of zzso zzso The results demonstrate that while zzso is expressed in the developing nervous system of zzso the timing of expression indicates that it is unlikely to be involved in regulation of the very first stages of zzso
