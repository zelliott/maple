zzso is an zzso strain derived from the Japanese wild zzso zzso zzso zzso It is believed that subspecies zzso has contributed substantially to the zzso constitution of common laboratory strains of mice, although the majority of their zzso is derived from the west European zzso zzso zzso Information on the zzso zzso is thus essential not only for genetic studies involving zzso but also for characterization of common laboratory zzso Here, we report the construction of an arrayed bacterial artificial zzso zzso library from male zzso zzso DNA, covering approximately zzso zzso zzso Both ends of zzso zzso clone zzso were zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso pairs were mapped onto the zzso zzso zzso mouse Build zzso covering zzso zzso or zzso of the total zzso Taking advantage of the zzso map data, we established a computer-based clone screening zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sequences revealed zzso candidate single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso substitution rate was as high as zzso The distribution of zzso along the zzso zzso was not zzso The majority of the zzso showed a high zzso rate, and only zzso of the zzso showed an extremely low zzso rate zzso identity zzso zzso these sequences are likely derived from the zzso zzso
