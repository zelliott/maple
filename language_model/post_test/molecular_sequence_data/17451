The response to zzso availability in zzso zzso was characterized by measuring transcript levels of zzso genes represented on a zzso zzso We found that zzso of the zzso genes were regulated at least twofold in response to zzso zzso Several sugar zzso zzso were found to be regulated by zzso zzso analysis of one of these, zzso indicates that it encodes a zzso zzso zzso Comparing zzso zzso profiling data with the published zzso shift data from zzso zzso revealed that the two zzso share similar, but not zzso zzso response zzso zzso of transcript levels measured by zzso analysis is consistent with previous zzso of central metabolism zzso activities for zzso zzso zzso of genes for ethanol zzso and the zzso acid cycle are abundant in zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso carrying out a high rate of both zzso and zzso zzso
