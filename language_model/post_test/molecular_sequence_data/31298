Relatively little is known about the factors maintaining zzso DNA zzso sequence diversity in zzso A detailed understanding of the transmission zzso of zzso has been partly hampered by the lack of evidence for zzso zzso Among families with zzso zzso zzso zzso we found a maternal lineage with individuals zzso for a single zzso change, and we were able to follow the segregation of zzso zzso zzso over 3 zzso The results show that rapid segregation can occur but also that the level of zzso can be maintained from one generation to zzso In this family the disease zzso is associated with the zzso sequence change, confirming the involvement of the zzso in the zzso
