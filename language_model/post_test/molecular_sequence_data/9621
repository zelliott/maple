The zzso of the outer zzso membrane to most zzso is believed to be based in an outer zzso zzso protein known as zzso zzso zzso zzso Although multiple zzso of zzso have been identified in zzso organisms, the zzso zzso zzso has been thought to contain a single zzso zzso designated zzso However, cells missing the zzso gene zzso zzso were able to grow on zzso media containing a zzso carbon source zzso but not on such media at elevated temperature zzso degrees zzso If zzso normally provides the zzso for zzso to pass through the outer zzso some other zzso must be able to partially substitute for that zzso To identify proteins that could functionally substitute for zzso we have screened a zzso zzso library for genes which, when zzso can correct the growth zzso of delta zzso zzso grown on zzso at 37 degrees zzso This screen identified a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso with zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the previously identified zzso zzso protein zzso zzso can functionally complement defects present in delta zzso strains only when it is zzso zzso of the zzso gene alone had no zzso zzso while zzso with deletions of both the zzso and zzso genes were viable and able to grow on zzso at 30 degrees C, albeit more slowly than delta zzso single zzso Like delta zzso single zzso they could not grow on zzso at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso which distinguish zzso and zzso indicate that zzso is normally present in the outer zzso zzso However, no zzso channels were detected zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso made from zzso cells, delta zzso cells, delta zzso delta zzso cells, and delta zzso cells zzso zzso were incorporated into zzso and the zzso of resulting zzso to zzso of different sizes was zzso The results indicate that zzso does not zzso any additional zzso to these zzso suggesting that it may not normally form a zzso In contrast, when the zzso gene from zzso zzso was expressed in delta zzso zzso cells, zzso channels could be detected in the zzso by both zzso and zzso techniques, yet the cells failed to grow on zzso at 37 degrees zzso Thus, zzso activity does not seem to be either necessary or sufficient to restore growth on zzso carbon sources, indicating that zzso mediates cellular functions that do not depend on the ability to form zzso
