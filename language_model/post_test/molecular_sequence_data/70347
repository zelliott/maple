Thirteen zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 or more and zzso zzso 20 or more, zzso have been isolated from a partial zzso library of brown trout and zzso On average, a zzso repeat sequence occurs approximately every 23 zzso and a zzso repeat sequence every 76 zzso in brown trout zzso zzso for DNA zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso were zzso for three single locus zzso zzso inheritance of the observed zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso Four brown trout populations (10 unrelated individuals per zzso were screened for zzso with these three zzso zzso The total number of zzso detected in the four populations is five at one zzso six at the other two zzso zzso and is three, on average, per zzso zzso range from zzso to zzso The largest differences in zzso zzso occurred between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic zzso this result is zzso with previous zzso zzso The zzso distances of the three zzso markers were determined on zzso zzso zzso rates range from zzso to zzso For all the three zzso zzso the zzso designed from brown trout sequences can be used in another closely related species of zzso the rainbow trout zzso zzso This last aspect supports the view that zzso markers may have wide application in genetic studies in zzso species and zzso in zzso
