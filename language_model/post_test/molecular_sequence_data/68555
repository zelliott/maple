A pair of synthetic zzso zzso designed from the gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso surface protein of zzso zzso were used to amplify zzso DNA from the blood of zzso zzso cattle by means of the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso DNA was examined by zzso and by dot zzso or zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso was specific for zzso zzso since no amplification was detected with DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This method was sensitive enough to detect about zzso zzso per zzso of blood with a zzso sample zzso Moreover, of 66 specimens from grazing zzso 40 were microscopically positive, whereas zzso revealed that 54 samples were zzso zzso zzso provides a useful diagnostic tool for detecting zzso zzso zzso and it is significantly more sensitive than the current zzso
