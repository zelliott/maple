The envelope proteins of human zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso were found to be modified by fatty zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso The precursor zzso was also zzso prior to its zzso into the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acid label was sensitive to treatment with zzso or zzso indicating that the linkage is through a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso did not prevent the incorporation of zzso acid into the zzso envelope zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso which are zzso at zzso zzso within or close to the zzso zzso domain, the zzso of the zzso envelope proteins occurs on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are 59 and 132 zzso zzso respectively, from the proposed zzso domain of zzso zzso comparison revealed that one of these zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso of almost all zzso zzso and is located very close to an zzso region which has been zzso to bind to the plasma zzso
