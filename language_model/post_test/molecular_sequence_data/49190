zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso C zzso that is active against a broad range of zzso bacteria, including spores of zzso zzso An improved zzso method was developed for zzso in which zzso and zzso extraction are zzso Mass spectral characterization of the two zzso zzso A zzso and zzso B zzso showed that both components are zzso into the medium by zzso zzso as mature peptides consisting of 59 and 43 zzso zzso zzso Separate expression clones of zzso and zzso were constructed previously in zzso zzso zzso but the products were not chemically zzso zzso by the new protocol showed that zzso is expressed as the mature zzso zzso but that zzso is produced by zzso zzso as a fragment, zzso which is zzso at an internal zzso zzso This zzso is not zzso by itself, but in combination with zzso it displays the full activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a high zzso content in the secondary structure of both zzso and zzso as well as in a zzso zzso zzso Separate expression clones of zzso and zzso were also constructed in zzso coli, but these clones only produced multiple fragments of the desired peptides with little or no zzso
