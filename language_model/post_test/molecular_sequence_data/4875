The majority of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso or zzso leukemia cells are carried by zzso zzso having a tandem repeat zzso domain through which zzso zzso zzso are zzso However, determination of structure and adhesive function of carbohydrates in zzso is extremely difficult because of the extensive structural zzso and the zzso of material for functional zzso We have overcome this difficulty through use of zzso zzso isolated from a large quantity of ( approximately zzso L zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ito, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso zzso We identified two major types of zzso zzso without the zzso zzso as being capable of binding to zzso zzso those having a single zzso zzso at internal zzso but not at the penultimate zzso and zzso those having double zzso zzso at internal zzso excluding the penultimate zzso zzso from group i above did not show any zzso under zzso conditions, but showed strong zzso under dynamic flow zzso zzso from group zzso above showed zzso under both zzso and dynamic conditions, as did zzso zzso structures in previous zzso However, zzso zzso zzso are virtually absent or present in only trace quantities in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from groups i and zzso above, lacking zzso structure, are the major membrane components of zzso and zzso zzso These zzso bound to zzso or to zzso may therefore be the zzso zzso for zzso binding of these cells, particularly under dynamic flow zzso
