The zzso of the human zzso virus zzso exists as a zzso of two identical zzso molecules hydrogen bonded to each other near their zzso zzso The zzso known to be important for viral zzso is formed by two zzso interacting through a zzso structure called the zzso initiation site zzso An initially formed zzso the zzso zzso is unstable and zzso to the stable, duplex zzso In this report we use zzso zzso gel zzso to measure the zzso equilibrium constant of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso of the zzso isolate of zzso zzso in which the zzso was zzso at various temperatures before zzso revealed that zzso is rapid for all the zzso so that they reach equilibrium in the loading well of the gel at 5 degrees C before they enter the gel zzso However, zzso zzso in the gel are slow, so zzso spot zzso can be used to measure the amounts of zzso and zzso present when the sample entered the zzso After correction for the amount of zzso added with the zzso and dilution of samples in the loading well of the zzso zzso equilibrium zzso were calculated from spot zzso The calculated values of the zzso constant K at 5 degrees C were approximately zzso approximately zzso and approximately zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in solutions of zzso strength, I, of about 100 zzso The decrease in K by three orders of magnitude between the zzso and zzso is due in part to the change in zzso zzso of zzso molecules on zzso and in part to the increased zzso zzso of the zzso As expected, increased zzso strength increases the zzso constant for all three zzso For the zzso however, K has a maximum value at I approximately 140 zzso The origin of the decrease in K for higher I is unknown but it may be due to formation of species (perhaps higher order zzso that do not enter the zzso The zzso exists in two zzso forms assigned to the kissing and duplex zzso The ratio of kissing to duplex form at 5 degrees C is zzso zzso zzso at I zzso 113 zzso and zzso zzso zzso at I zzso 183 zzso The observed decrease in K with zzso length suggests that the zzso constant of the packaging region of zzso is small, zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso that the zzso protein is important in promoting zzso in the zzso of the zzso
