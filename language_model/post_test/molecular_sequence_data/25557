zzso resemblance of the human zzso family with a subset of zzso zzso was zzso Of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which comprise a structurally related family, zzso is the most similar to the human zzso zzso Of the 76 zzso in zzso zzso (including the zzso zzso 47 are similar to the human zzso family zzso zzso The secondary structure of the human zzso family corresponding to the zzso and zzso stem regions of the zzso appears to be very zzso The zzso zzso which is a zzso of the human zzso family, is less similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the secondary structure of the zzso zzso folded like a zzso is less stable than that of the human zzso family folded zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is an important region of the second promoter for zzso zzso III in the zzso zzso occurred during the deletion and zzso process to generate the zzso sequence from the parental zzso zzso These results suggest that the human zzso family was generated from the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso which thus modified the ancestral zzso sequence so that it could form a structure more closely resembling zzso zzso The similarities of several short zzso sequences to the zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso type 2 family, which was reported to be derived from a zzso zzso zzso was also found to be similar to the zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso structures are widespread in zzso in the animal zzso The implications of these findings in relation to the mechanism of generation of the human zzso family and its possible functions are zzso
