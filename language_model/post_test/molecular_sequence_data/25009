The zzso zzso gene is an invasion zzso contributing to zzso coli zzso invasion of the zzso zzso This gene has been cloned and characterized from the zzso of an invasive zzso fluid isolate of zzso coli zzso strain zzso zzso zzso In the present study, a genetic island of zzso zzso coli containing zzso zzso has been zzso A zzso zzso DNA island unique to zzso coli zzso strains has been cloned and zzso from an zzso zzso coli zzso zzso DNA zzso Fourteen new genes have been identified in addition to the zzso The DNA sequence analysis indicated that the zzso gene cluster was localized to the 98 zzso region and consisted of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content zzso of unique regions of the island is substantially different from that zzso of the rest of the zzso coli zzso By zzso analysis of the sequences with DNA and protein databases zzso and zzso zzso the functions of the gene products could be anticipated, and were assigned to the functional categories of proteins relating to carbon source metabolism and zzso zzso zzso was shown to enhance zzso coli penetration of human brain zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso was able to block the stimulating effect of zzso suggesting that zzso regulation may play a role in control of zzso coli zzso invasion gene zzso Our data suggest that this genetic island may contribute to zzso coli invasion of the zzso barrier through a zzso zzso
