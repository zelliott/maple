zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in the zzso of many drugs, other zzso zzso and zzso We previously described a human zzso zzso that zzso a protein similar in sequence to that of rat zzso zzso a related human zzso zzso was zzso In the present study, we set out to characterize further the human zzso zzso and then to zzso structurally zzso and map its zzso As an initial step, we performed zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Those experiments demonstrated that a small number of zzso transcripts contained an zzso which we later showed resulted from alternative zzso that involved an zzso sequence in zzso 3 of zzso We then cloned and structurally characterized the zzso gene from a human zzso zzso zzso Because the sequence of zzso was closely related to that of zzso and because the genes for other human zzso zzso occur in zzso we screened the zzso clones that had been positive for zzso to search for zzso and discovered a clone that contained both zzso That zzso was used to sequence and structurally characterize zzso zzso and zzso were approximately 21 and 10 zzso in zzso zzso Both genes contained seven zzso that zzso zzso and both had structures that were similar to those of other genes that zzso members of the zzso zzso Finally, human zzso and zzso mapped to zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The cloning and structural characterization of zzso and zzso will now make it possible to perform molecular genetic and zzso studies of these zzso zzso in zzso
