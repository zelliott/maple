The zzso external region zzso of zzso is considered as a prime target for the induction of zzso zzso since it contains the zzso for three broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we present a novel zzso construct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fused to two zzso zzso zzso at both zzso zzso is zzso has a high zzso content in solution and forms zzso structures as revealed by negative zzso electron zzso zzso of rabbits with zzso induced zzso directed against zzso which failed to exert significant zzso capacity against envelopes from primary zzso Thus zzso of zzso regions does not suffice to induce a potent zzso zzso response specific for zzso regions within zzso
