The intermediate filament zzso of zzso zzso cells is composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso dominant disorder causing fragility of the anterior zzso zzso where zzso and zzso are specifically zzso We zzso that zzso zzso in these zzso might be the cause of zzso zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso gene cluster on zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso cluster on zzso using radiation zzso We obtained linkage to the zzso locus in zzso original German zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and we also showed that the zzso zzso with either the zzso or the zzso locus in two Northern Irish zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso completely zzso with zzso in the families and were not found in 100 normal unrelated zzso All zzso occur in the highly zzso zzso zzso boundary zzso where dominant zzso in other zzso have been found to severely compromise zzso function, leading to zzso fragility zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso
