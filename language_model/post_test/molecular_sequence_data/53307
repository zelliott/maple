zzso zzso zzso the replacement of chlorine atoms on zzso and zzso with hydrogen atoms during the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso The sequence of the active site region of zzso zzso is very similar to those of the corresponding regions of zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso of a zzso double bond in zzso to the trans zzso during the zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso (an analogue of zzso at a rate nearly comparable to that of a bona fide bacterial zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is involved in a common and presumably ancient zzso for zzso of zzso while zzso zzso zzso a more specialized reaction, it is likely that zzso zzso arose from a zzso zzso The zzso and overall transformations involved in the zzso and zzso reactions are zzso zzso This zzso provides a remarkable example of Nature's ability to recruit an zzso with a useful structural scaffold and elaborate upon its basic zzso capabilities to generate a catalyst for a newly needed zzso
