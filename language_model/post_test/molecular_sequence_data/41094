Oil bodies of similar sizes were observed in the cells of zzso and zzso layer of rice seeds, and remained their structural integrity zzso after zzso zzso two abundant zzso zzso were found in both preparations of oil bodies isolated from the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso detection and mass zzso analyses indicated that the two zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso in the zzso and those in the zzso layer were identical proteins zzso by the same genes zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, one zzso was found in oil bodies isolated from the zzso but not those isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of rice seeds confirms that zzso is present in both zzso and zzso layer while zzso exists only in zzso zzso extracted from oil bodies of rice zzso migrated faster on zzso in the presence of zzso in a manner identical to zzso extracted from zzso oil zzso Similar to other known zzso zzso the rice zzso possesses an zzso appendix that is absent in zzso zzso
