We have investigated the function of zzso and zzso zzso of the human ETA zzso by expressing truncated zzso in zzso zzso Three kinds of ETA receptors truncated in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the entire zzso zzso or zzso zzso domain completely zzso the zzso binding zzso However, the deletion of one half of the zzso zzso domain of the ETA zzso missing one of two zzso zzso sites, maintained complete binding zzso zzso zzso zzso detected all the truncated ETA receptors in the cell membrane fraction of zzso zzso zzso The size of the ETA zzso was zzso due to differential zzso and distributed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso bands in Western zzso zzso These results demonstrated that a part of the zzso domain in close proximity to the first zzso region is required for the zzso binding activity of the ETA zzso and the zzso domain is perhaps necessary as an anchor for maintenance of the binding zzso
