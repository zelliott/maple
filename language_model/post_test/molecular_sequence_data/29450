Polar side chains constitute over zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of membrane zzso where they may serve as hydrogen bond interaction sites for zzso polar zzso that arise in membrane zzso zzso To systematically explore the structural consequences of zzso between TM zzso we focused on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso zzso peptides corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences both adopt zzso structures in zzso zzso and display zzso bands on zzso arising from zzso bond formation via zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso additionally forms a zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a hydrogen bond network involving zzso side zzso chain zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence indicated that zzso formation minimally required the simultaneous presence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso As random zzso sequences containing these three zzso at zzso equivalent positions did not zzso specific van der zzso packing interactions between zzso side chains were also shown to play a crucial zzso Overall, the results suggest that polar zzso in membrane zzso in conjunction with critically positioned polar partner zzso potentially constitute a source of zzso zzso interactions that could contribute to loss of function when they arise in protein zzso zzso
