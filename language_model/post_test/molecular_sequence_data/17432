zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and other zzso In order to investigate the relation between the structure and the function, and understand the reaction mechanism of the zzso a zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso was built by zzso zzso The zzso model was zzso by zzso molecular dynamics zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso model was assessed by comparison of specific properties with two known protein zzso From the final zzso model, we find that the main zzso involved in the active site in zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso especially zzso was the key zzso zzso in zzso zzso A reaction model including zzso and the zzso zzso was then constructed and used to characterize explicit zzso zzso In order to further illustrate zzso properties, the equilibrium zzso zzso and zzso of stationary points zzso products, and transition zzso of the reaction model were calculated at the zzso level of theory in both gas phase and zzso The results showed that the reaction in gas was zzso more favorable than in zzso
