zzso are comprised of zzso DNA sequences and associated binding zzso Their structure functions to protect the ends of linear zzso and ensure zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso by binding to zzso zzso DNA zzso Because the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso progressive zzso zzso and zzso in human cells, respectively, a proposed major role of zzso is that of a negative regulator of zzso zzso Here we report another crucial function of zzso in zzso In conditional mouse zzso zzso zzso embryonic stem cells, zzso deletion induced growth zzso and zzso zzso Although no clear zzso zzso or zzso was observed in short term cultured zzso cells, abnormal zzso signals were observed, and zzso zzso factor, zzso lost zzso zzso Furthermore, another zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso also showed decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso signals at fusion points accumulated in zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso interacts with other zzso molecules and zzso into the functional zzso zzso
