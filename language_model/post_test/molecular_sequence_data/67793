zzso amplification of clinical specimens can lead to the identification of novel zzso 

To identify novel viruses in human stool specimens from patients with zzso and to investigate the ecology and clinical significance of such zzso 

zzso acid extracted from stool specimens from patients with zzso with no known zzso were subjected to random zzso amplification and zzso zzso Novel viruses identified were genetically and zzso zzso 

Four zzso chicken anemia virus zzso human zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 zzso and a novel zzso zzso designated as zzso 4 zzso were identified in human stool zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso were also detected in chicken skin and meat used for human zzso 

A novel zzso zzso was identified in human stool and in chicken meat sold for human zzso This virus was zzso distinct from previously reported zzso in chicken and humans zzso anemia virus, human zzso avian zzso 2 and recently reported zzso zzso The epidemiology and zzso of this virus in humans and in chicken needs to be further zzso
