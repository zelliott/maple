zzso droplets zzso are emerging cellular zzso that are of crucial importance in cell biology and human zzso In this study, we present our screen of approximately 4,700 zzso zzso zzso for abnormalities in the number and zzso of zzso we identify 17 zzso zzso zzso and 116 zzso (many zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso is caused by the deletion of zzso a previously zzso open reading zzso zzso lacking zzso contain zzso enlarged zzso zzso and zzso from zzso cells demonstrate significantly enhanced fusion activities both in zzso and in zzso Interestingly, the expression of human zzso whose zzso forms are associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso disorders, zzso zzso defects in zzso zzso zzso profiling reveals zzso in zzso chain compositions of major zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that an zzso zzso function of zzso in zzso metabolism and zzso formation may be functionally important in human zzso
