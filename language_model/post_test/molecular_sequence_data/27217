The insect zzso hormone, zzso zzso and its zzso zzso specifically bind to the zzso zzso Previously, we zzso various zzso containing the side chain zzso of zzso A zzso and measured the binding activity against zzso zzso cells to study the zzso zzso Here we zzso analyzed the zzso relationship for the zzso binding of zzso including zzso and zzso Since the hydrogen bonding zzso is one of the important zzso properties for zzso binding to the zzso zzso the number of possible zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso was manually counted in the modeled zzso complex for all zzso The construction of the zzso model was executed by the zzso modeling system zzso in which calculation was done by simulated zzso The binding potency of 15 zzso to zzso were zzso correlated zzso with the number of zzso which are observed between zzso and zzso zzso Contribution of zzso and zzso effects on the zzso binding was also examined using a three-dimensional quantitative zzso relationship zzso zzso comparative molecular field analysis zzso
