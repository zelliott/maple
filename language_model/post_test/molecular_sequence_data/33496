zzso zzso family member zzso a zinc finger zzso factor that mediates zzso zzso is implicated in the progression of an ever-growing number of human zzso including prostate and pancreatic cancer, as well as zzso cell zzso of the zzso Its expression is zzso by transforming growth zzso zzso in a variety of cell types, both normal and zzso We report zzso that zzso zzso expression is zzso and does not result from stabilization of zzso zzso We describe the characterization of the zzso sequence of human zzso zzso the identification of a zzso start site, the cloning of approximately zzso zzso of the regulatory promoter region and the identification and functional analysis of a zzso region mapped to a zzso sequence between zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso This region harbors zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell factor binding sites that allow functional cooperation between zzso and zzso recruited to the promoter in response to zzso to drive zzso gene zzso
