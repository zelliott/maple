zzso zzso zzso are small, zzso peptides zzso by zzso coli that are able to induce zzso through the stimulation of an zzso zzso zzso known as zzso A zzso acid zzso zzso was recently zzso from rat zzso and proposed to be a potential zzso zzso of this zzso We describe here the cloning and characterization of human and mouse zzso zzso precursor proteins of 115 and 116 zzso zzso respectively, having zzso present at their C zzso zzso of the human zzso in zzso cells leads to the zzso of zzso an inactive zzso acid zzso zzso generated by either zzso or acid treatment of zzso was zzso and found to bind to, and zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso show high-level expression of zzso zzso restricted to the zzso with zzso to zzso cells at the base of the small zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is an zzso zzso of zzso
