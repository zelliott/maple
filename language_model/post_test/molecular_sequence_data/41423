zzso zzso zzso are likely to encounter higher zzso of zzso oxygen species induced by the host innate immune zzso In this study, we characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso the only zzso zzso found within zzso zzso species, by assessing its role in resistance to zzso zzso stress and during infection in zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria had a zzso survival rate under zzso zzso stress than did zzso zzso zzso bacteria, and this was predominantly zzso zzso We also characterized zzso the only zzso zzso found within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso zzso confirmed specific zzso activity, while protein zzso experiments localized zzso to the bacterial zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso bacteria drastically diminished zzso viability in the presence of zzso zzso and reduced zzso in an zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso resistance to zzso oxygen species induced by the host innate immune zzso
