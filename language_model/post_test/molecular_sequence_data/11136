Four closely related zzso specific zzso zzso genes have been identified in both humans and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have now cloned zzso for multiple zzso zzso of human zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a fetal lung zzso The longest open reading frame zzso of 791 zzso acids zzso is zzso by zzso which is similar to a recently described zzso zzso zzso Sullivan, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso except that an alternative zzso sequence upstream of the first zzso extends the zzso zzso by 79 zzso The zzso zzso contains 3 insertions that are located zzso to the zzso domain and zzso several zzso stop zzso The predicted zzso zzso protein zzso at a zzso 365 zzso within zzso A zzso clone starting at this zzso expressed an zzso active zzso Two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso contained a novel zzso region and a deletion of 162 zzso the predicted protein zzso 54 zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso protein produced in zzso cells was zzso active and sensitive to zzso zzso The zzso protein is similar to zzso but has an additional 55 zzso deleted in the zzso zzso it lacked zzso zzso Analysis of zzso total zzso from 4 tissue sources by zzso chain reaction zzso confirmed the presence of zzso with the two deletions and three insertions that we observed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found only in zzso and the zzso region of zzso was seen only in lung and the melanoma cell line zzso zzso zzso expression of various zzso zzso should be considered in understanding how these gene products zzso cellular responses to zzso
