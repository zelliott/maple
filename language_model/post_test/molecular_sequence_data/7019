The zzso gene is primarily expressed in immature zzso cells, and it is zzso in many zzso We have investigated the role of negative regulatory sites in the zzso promoter in the zzso T cell line and in the zzso B cell zzso A potential binding site for either the zzso or zzso protein was identified by in zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso in a region of negative regulatory activity in T zzso We showed by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso Western that zzso zzso and zzso bound to this zzso A zzso of this site which prevented protein binding increased the activity of the zzso promoter by zzso In the zzso B cell line, this site was zzso however, we found a potential zzso site located more 3' in a region of negative regulatory zzso We showed that zzso zzso and zzso bound to this site, and that zzso of this site increased the activity of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso of a zzso expression zzso zzso the activity of the zzso promoter in both cell lines, and this repression was relieved when the zzso sites were zzso zzso of either an zzso or zzso expression zzso had no significant effect on the activity of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso expression in both T and B cell zzso
