The zzso zzso gene is an important zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso gene zzso of cell cycle zzso The zzso protein is considered to be a negative regulator of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso gene has been found in various zzso zzso including zzso lymphoma, and may play a role in zzso aggressiveness of those zzso However, the zzso protein expression in primary gastric zzso has not been zzso In this study, we characterize protein expression and promoter zzso of the zzso gene in zzso primary gastric zzso from zzso In all, 43 cases of zzso primary gastric zzso were zzso They consisted of 24 zzso cases of diffuse zzso lymphoma, 12 zzso cases of zzso marginal zone lymphoma, six zzso cases of zzso marginal zone zzso with zzso transformation and one zzso case of zzso zzso Loss of zzso protein expression was found in 34 zzso out of 43 cases, while the remaining nine zzso cases showed zzso for the zzso zzso All 43 cases were further characterized by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to analyze zzso promoter zzso zzso In total, 11 zzso of 43 cases were positive for zzso promoter zzso Among those, 10 zzso out of the 33 cases negative for the zzso zzso showed promoter zzso whereas only one zzso out of the 10 cases that were positive for the zzso zzso displayed promoter zzso Of the 43 cases, 30 had limited zzso data at the time of zzso zzso gastric zzso involved zzso sites zzso zzso or zzso in 17 zzso of 30 cases, while the remaining 13 zzso cases were only limited to the zzso Loss of zzso protein expression was found in 14 zzso of 17 cases with zzso involvement and in 11 zzso of 13 cases without such zzso In conclusion, loss of zzso protein expression is frequent in those zzso primary gastric zzso and approximately one-third of such loss correlated with promoter zzso Despite limited zzso data, loss of zzso protein expression appears not to be correlated with zzso zzso
