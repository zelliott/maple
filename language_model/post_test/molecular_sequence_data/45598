zzso zzso biology examines how changes in zzso zzso give rise to zzso and, ultimately, zzso zzso To this end, comparisons of related but distinct organisms have to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed as a satellite system for a detailed comparison of various zzso processes to the model zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso In addition to zzso and genetic studies, a zzso platform has been established to zzso the biology of this zzso However, only little is known about where and how zzso zzso and its relatives live in the zzso Here we show that zzso of the zzso zzso live in close association with zzso zzso and the Colorado potato zzso In total, we generated 371 zzso female lines from zzso zzso collected at 25 sampling sites all over zzso zzso female lines were subjected to sequence analysis and mating experiments for species zzso The 371 zzso fell into six zzso Two zzso species account for about zzso of the collected zzso We found zzso zzso almost exclusively on zzso and zzso zzso predominantly on zzso zzso Colorado potato zzso carried the zzso species zzso zzso which was only rarely observed on zzso zzso We describe the initial evidence for the association of zzso zzso with zzso and provide a zzso based on sequence analysis of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso
