Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso gene is an zzso dependent zzso zzso This is the first report of an zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso isolated zzso zzso contains two zzso bonds and only a trace amount of any metal and requires the presence of both zzso zzso and 4 zzso of zzso for maximum zzso The zzso zzso could be indicative of the presence of a zzso system, which would regulate the activity of this as well as other zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso or zzso showed that only the zzso and zzso zzso showed a significant drop in activity indicating that the zzso bond responsible for regulating activity was likely between zzso and zzso We propose that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso reduction of their zzso are two additional metal binding zzso that alter the metal specificity of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso
