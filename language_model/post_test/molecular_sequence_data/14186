The use of zzso zzso is advantageous for the breakdown of zzso biomass toward the commercial production of zzso Previously, we have demonstrated the engineering of an enhanced zzso family 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso using random zzso zzso and a combination of three beneficial zzso dominated by an intriguing zzso substitution zzso Anbar, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we used a zzso approach involving sequence alignment of zzso family 8 zzso zzso to create a library of consensus zzso in which zzso of the zzso module are replaced at specific positions with the most prevalent zzso acids in the zzso One of the zzso zzso displayed a higher zzso stability than the zzso zzso zzso this zzso into the previously engineered zzso triple zzso resulted in an zzso zzso increasing the zzso of activity by zzso at zzso zzso no loss of zzso activity was observed compared to that of the zzso zzso The structural changes were simulated by molecular dynamics analysis, and specific regions were identified that contributed to the observed zzso zzso most of the proteins used for sequence alignment in determining the consensus zzso were derived from zzso bacteria, with optimal temperatures well below that of zzso zzso zzso
