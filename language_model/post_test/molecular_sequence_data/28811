The 17 zzso and zzso activities of zzso lead to the production of 17 zzso (17 zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in different zzso The mechanisms of differential regulation of these two activities are not yet fully zzso It has been previously shown that zzso zzso zzso could facilitate the zzso activity of human zzso Recently, a zzso zzso 2 zzso sharing zzso zzso with type 1 zzso has been isolated from human zzso Since high zzso activity is required for the production of zzso in the zzso we wanted to determine the importance of this second zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso activity and zzso its role in the formation of active zzso We therefore isolated type 2 zzso from human zzso by zzso and zzso by transient zzso in transformed human embryonic kidney cells zzso of various amounts of zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso its ability to zzso the zzso activity of human zzso zzso show that, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso increases zzso activity to a level comparable to that of type zzso These results support the idea that types 1 and 2 zzso could be involved in the differential zzso of 17 zzso and zzso activities of zzso Furthermore, the analysis of zzso expression of types 1 and 2 zzso by zzso using zzso specific to each type showed that both types are present in the liver but also in the adrenal and zzso
