The first and so far the only form of isolated growth hormone zzso to accede to molecular genetic analysis is zzso zzso which has an zzso zzso mode of zzso Several sizes of growth hormone gene zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso It has been reported that children with zzso zzso have an initial good response to growth hormone treatment, followed by growth failure associated with the development of blocking zzso against growth zzso The effectiveness of treatment has been associated to the size of the gene zzso We performed a molecular genetic analysis of the growth hormone zzso using Southern zzso and zzso techniques, to a 12 years old girl who fulfilled the criteria for zzso zzso and her closer zzso The results showed a 7 zzso deletion for the growth hormone gene in the girl and one of her zzso
