In animal models, kidney formation is known to be controlled by the proteins zzso zzso and zzso however, no human studies to date have shown an association between abnormal kidney development and zzso of these zzso We hypothesized that zzso fetuses with zzso zzso zzso or severe zzso would possess zzso in zzso zzso or zzso We zzso for zzso in these genes in 33 zzso fetuses that had bilateral or unilateral zzso zzso (29 subjects) or severe zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso in zzso were found in 7 of 19 fetuses with bilateral zzso zzso zzso and 2 of 10 fetuses zzso with unilateral zzso In two zzso there were two different zzso zzso found, and a total of ten different sequence variations were zzso We also investigated whether these zzso affected zzso zzso in each case, zzso zzso was either absent or zzso zzso A zzso zzso was identified in only one fetus with unilateral zzso this subject also had two zzso zzso No zzso zzso were seen in any zzso These data suggest that in humans, zzso in zzso and zzso may contribute significantly to abnormal kidney zzso
