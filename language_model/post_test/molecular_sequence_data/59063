zzso secondary and zzso structure is involved in zzso regulation of gene expression either by exposing specific sequences or through the formation of specific structural zzso An overview of zzso secondary and zzso structures known from zzso studies is followed by a review of examples of the elements of zzso processing, zzso stability and translation of the zzso These structural elements comprise zzso zzso zzso hairpin and zzso structures, and more complex structures such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures formed during zzso folding zzso are also zzso The examples presented are mostly chosen from plant systems, plant zzso and zzso Examples from bacteria or zzso are discussed only when unique regulatory properties of zzso structures have been zzso in these zzso
