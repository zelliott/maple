zzso binding proteins of the major zzso complex consist of the zzso class zzso and zzso class zzso zzso The gene organization and zzso relationship of the various zzso zzso class I proteins are very similar among the class zzso and class zzso zzso Although the zzso patterns of expression of these two gene families are zzso many class zzso genes are distinguished by relative low abundance and/or limited tissue zzso Further, many of the class zzso genes serve specialized roles in immune zzso Given that the coding sequences of the class zzso and class zzso genes are highly zzso we sought to examine the promoter regions of the various class zzso genes by comparison to the well characterized promoter elements regulating expression of the class zzso zzso This analysis revealed a surprising complexity of promoter structures among all class I genes and few instances of conservation of class zzso promoter regulatory elements among the class zzso zzso
