In this paper, we describe the structure and zzso expression pattern of the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso located at locus zzso zzso zzso zzso the tumor zzso gene zzso described previously and exhibiting a gene within gene zzso The zzso protein coding region, zzso zzso is divided into two zzso by an zzso zzso zzso harboring the genes zzso zzso from the same DNA zzso and zzso zzso from the opposite DNA zzso located zzso zzso zzso To determine proteins zzso by the genes described in this study zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso Western blots with the zzso zzso resulted in the identification of a zzso zzso zzso which is smaller than the zzso protein predicted from the zzso Its zzso in zzso zzso zzso was established by zzso zzso of zzso zzso Schneider 2 zzso zzso shows significant zzso to zzso zzso protein acting as a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It is zzso zzso throughout embryonic zzso The protein predicted from the zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso to the zzso protein of the yellow fever zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso analysis by zzso Northern zzso and by in zzso zzso zzso as well as the results of the protein analysis via Western zzso and zzso suggest that zzso is transcribed but not zzso Since zzso zzso by the genes zzso and zzso are complementary and zzso is presumably not translated we performed preliminary experiments on the function of the zzso zzso as a natural zzso zzso zzso regulator of zzso zzso expressed in the same zzso and spatial manner as the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso yielded late embryonic zzso resulting from multiple zzso zzso
