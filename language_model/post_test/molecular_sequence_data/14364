zzso regulation of gene expression is one major zzso of zzso control and stress adaptation in virtually all living zzso In recent years numerous zzso factors controlling various aspects of plant life have been zzso The activity of zzso factors needs to be regulated to prevent zzso prolonged or inappropriate zzso The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as one of the main regulators of drought and heat responses, and it is regulated through protein zzso In the present paper we describe evidence that the interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) contributes to the control of zzso under a range of zzso The interaction is zzso by a novel protein motif in zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso which lacks the interaction domain accumulates during heat stress and zzso In addition zzso is rapidly zzso during heat stress, thus our results suggest that removal of zzso protein or the loss of the interaction domain in zzso appears to be required for proper zzso function under stress zzso
