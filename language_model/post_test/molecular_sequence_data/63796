zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that causes cold water disease zzso in zzso By means of zzso zzso a zzso named zzso deficient in growth on zzso zzso was previously zzso zzso recovered the parental zzso in the presence of zzso The gene disrupted by the zzso in this zzso zzso a protein with similarity to zzso zzso which are members of the zzso complex system involved in iron zzso zzso by zzso Analysis of the DNA surrounding the zzso zzso showed the presence of a zzso cluster of genes composed of zzso two zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso studies indicated that these genes are transcribed as an zzso and that the zzso : : zzso zzso was caused by the lack of zzso zzso showed decreased zzso and zzso a high level of protection in rainbow trout zzso after zzso This is believed to be the first report of a zzso zzso attenuated strain that zzso a protective immune response in rainbow trout against zzso These results suggest that the zzso locus from this particular zzso system is a suitable target to generate a live attenuated zzso
