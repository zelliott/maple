The human genes coding for growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are related zzso but are expressed in zzso distinct cell types despite their zzso sequence zzso We show here that the promoters of the human zzso and zzso genes contain zzso sequences that zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso Similar data are obtained with the human zzso zzso consistent with earlier work by zzso zzso analysis shows that neighboring sequences in each of these three promoters are protected from zzso I zzso by rat zzso cell zzso zzso competition experiments and gel zzso zzso with synthetic zzso suggest that a single factor is responsible for the zzso zzso seen on the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso They also suggest that this factor is identical or closely related to the zzso factor zzso zzso with and differences from the rat zzso and zzso genes are zzso
