To explore the zzso vaccine approach against infectious zzso disease virus zzso five zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared and their binding peptides were screened against a zzso zzso zzso zzso After three rounds of zzso 12 zzso were selected for each zzso and their specificity to zzso was verified by sandwich and competitive zzso zzso Seven zzso per zzso were zzso and their zzso acid sequences were zzso The five representative sequences of zzso corresponding zzso were zzso An artificial zzso designated zzso (5 zzso and consisting of the five zzso arranged in tandem zzso with four zzso zzso was chemically zzso and cloned into a zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso was efficiently expressed in zzso coli and showed a size of zzso in zzso The zzso protein reacted with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Western zzso zzso zzso of SPF chickens with zzso protein (with Freund zzso zzso per injection on day 0 and zzso evoked high levels of zzso zzso by zzso by virus zzso zzso at day zzso and protected zzso of the chickens against a challenge of 200 zzso of zzso zzso strain, which sharply contrasted with the, respectively, zzso and zzso survival rate in the zzso group and the zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso promises to be a novel zzso vaccine candidate for zzso
