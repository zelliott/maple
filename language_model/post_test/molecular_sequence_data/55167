zzso diseases are caused by the zzso of the host cellular prion protein zzso into an infectious zzso zzso called zzso While zzso zzso zzso T cells and zzso partially protect zzso mice from disease, the potential zzso of zzso zzso T zzso zzso received little zzso zzso or zzso influence of zzso zzso was evaluated by stimulating a zzso zzso response against zzso in zzso zzso zzso To circumvent immune tolerance to zzso five zzso zzso peptides identified using prediction zzso were zzso to improve binding affinity for zzso and zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso a significant number of zzso zzso zzso T cells that better recognized the zzso than the zzso three of them induced T cells that were zzso in zzso for zzso target zzso zzso zzso and 192 were naturally processed and presented by the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inserted into zzso zzso zzso enhanced the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso before zzso zzso significantly prolonged the survival of infected zzso This effect was attributable to a significant lengthening of the symptomatic phase and was associated with enhanced zzso T cell recruitment to the zzso However, zzso with zzso in zzso mice induced zzso zzso T cells that were not zzso in zzso and did not influence disease progression nor infiltrated the zzso In conclusion, the data suggest that zzso zzso zzso T cells interact with zzso into the zzso during the clinical phase of the zzso
