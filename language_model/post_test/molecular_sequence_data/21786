This study aimed to characterize the zzso zzso in weaning zzso and to establish their possible relationships with main bacterial zzso German zzso zzso were weaned zzso zzso at 28 days of age or kept with the zzso until day 39 without creep feed zzso zzso The experiment was performed at an experimental and a commercial farm zzso zzso were collected from the zzso zzso and pen floors on days 28, 33 and 39 for isolation of DNA and zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the D1 domain of zzso zzso gene were amplified and separated by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso No zzso could be cultured from water and feed zzso No or only low numbers of zzso were detected among all zzso In zzso at zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dominated among the cultured zzso It was the only zzso species detected by zzso zzso especially zzso zzso established in the zzso gastrointestinal tract after consumption of zzso feed and may zzso with the zzso zzso The study provides data indicating importance of zzso zzso for the development of balanced zzso gut zzso
