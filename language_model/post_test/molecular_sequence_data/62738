zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso of the family zzso Surface zzso are important for the colonization of many zzso bacteria, and here we report the zzso sequence and analysis of the expression of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene cluster contains 11 genes with an organization similar to that of the zzso locus from zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso the first gene in an apparent zzso of nine other zzso are expressed from divergent zzso The zzso zzso region contains zzso repeats zzso the zzso zzso This region was shown to be capable of zzso consistent with an zzso regulation of the zzso In in zzso liquid cultures, both zzso were zzso Nevertheless, when we analyzed the expression of all of the genes in the zzso locus by zzso reverse zzso during infection of zzso zzso zzso wax zzso larvae, expression of zzso was not detected until 25 h zzso preceding the death of the larvae at 32 zzso In contrast, zzso (a putative inhibitor of zzso zzso was expressed throughout zzso zzso of zzso was also detected only late in infection zzso to 30 zzso indicating a possible increase in inversion frequency at this zzso In both in zzso liquid cultures and in zzso zzso infections, the zzso genes of the zzso were expressed at substantially lower levels than zzso These results indicate the complex regulation of the zzso cluster during zzso
