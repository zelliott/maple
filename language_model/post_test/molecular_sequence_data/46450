The zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the central zzso zzso of zzso isolated zzso part of zzso zzso in the inhibited complex zzso zzso zzso Montgomery, zzso Leslie, zzso Walker, zzso To explore its role in the different steps of zzso zzso zzso of zzso of the isolated and zzso zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso derivatives modified in zzso zzso First, we studied peptides truncated in zzso up to the zzso acid immediately preceding zzso a zzso zzso thought to play a key zzso These deletions did not affect or even improve the access of zzso to its zzso They decreased the stability of the inhibited complex but much less than previously zzso We also zzso zzso and found this zzso acid not mandatory for the zzso zzso The most striking finding came from experiments in which zzso a 8 zzso zzso zzso was attached in zzso of zzso zzso such a modification did not appreciably affect the rate of zzso zzso Taken together, these data show that zzso plays no role in the recognition step but contributes to stabilize the inhibited zzso Moreover, the data obtained using zzso zzso suggest that before binding zzso presents to the zzso with its middle part facing a zzso interface and its zzso zzso folded in the opposite zzso
