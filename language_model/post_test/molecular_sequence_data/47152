The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that has zzso to both the zzso protein of zzso coli and the zzso protein of zzso zzso both of these latter proteins are members of a growing family of zzso zinc zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso resulted in a zzso that grew more slowly than the zzso parent strain in zzso unless zzso was provided at a final concentration of 100 zzso Other zzso tested did not restore growth of this zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein was localized to the zzso where it is believed to function as the binding component of a zinc transport zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene provided in trans restored the ability of this zzso zzso zzso to grow normally in the absence of zzso added zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was also able to complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso when tested in the zzso rabbit model for experimental zzso This decreased zzso was not observed when the zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene provided in zzso
