To investigate the reported zzso regarding the zzso expression of zzso zzso we produced a new zzso against synthetic zzso containing the same zzso acid residual sequence as rat zzso Although the zzso showed zzso against zzso other than zzso zzso these zzso were excluded by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso with zzso showed specific zzso zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso the inner layer of the median zzso and the zzso in the rat zzso zzso were more intense in the adult female rats than in the zzso This sexual zzso became zzso at the 7th day after zzso These zzso intensified with zzso zzso enhanced the zzso in the Arc in the female zzso In contrast, regarding zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso only a few zzso fibers were detected in the adult zzso We applied this zzso for the investigation of the interaction between zzso fibers and zzso hormone zzso zzso No direct zzso interaction between the cell bodies of zzso zzso and zzso fibers was observed in the zzso zzso zzso Many projections of zzso fibers were found close to the zzso fibers in the lateral part of the median zzso However, we did not observe any direct contact between zzso fibers and the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso not via the synaptic contact but via another information transmission process that is not zzso such as volume zzso
