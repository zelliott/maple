zzso zzso is a member of a family of bacterial zzso that cleave the aromatic rings of their zzso between two adjacent zzso groups, a key reaction in microbial metabolism of varied environmental zzso In an appropriate genetic background, it is possible to select for zzso strains containing spontaneous zzso blocking expression of zzso or zzso genes zzso the alpha and beta zzso of zzso 3, zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso has been determined, and this knowledge zzso us the opportunity to understand how zzso alter function in the zzso An earlier investigation had shown that a large fraction of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are either insertions or large zzso zzso the prior procedure of zzso selection was modified to isolate zzso strains in which zzso within zzso or zzso cause a zzso zzso These zzso affected zzso distributed throughout the linear zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso and impaired the zzso to various zzso Four of 16 zzso had insertions or deletions in the zzso ranging in size from 1 to 10 zzso acid zzso highlighting areas of the protein where large structural changes can be zzso To further understand how protein structure influences function, we isolated strains in which the zzso of three different deletion zzso in zzso or zzso were suppressed either by a spontaneous zzso or by a zzso random zzso introduced into the zzso zzso by natural zzso The latter procedure was also used to identify a single zzso acid substitution in zzso that zzso activity towards zzso sufficient for growth with zzso in a strain in which zzso zzso was zzso
