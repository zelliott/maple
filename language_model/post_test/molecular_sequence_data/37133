During zzso particle assembly and zzso the zzso structural zzso proteins organize into two different zzso an immature form assembled by precursor zzso zzso zzso and a mature form, composed of proteins processed from zzso Central to both zzso protein arrangements is the zzso zzso zzso a domain of zzso which is zzso from the precursor to yield a mature zzso protein composed of an zzso domain zzso a flexible zzso region, and a zzso domain zzso Because zzso interactions have proven difficult to examine in zzso a number of investigations have focused on the analysis of structures assembled in zzso We have used electron microscope zzso image reconstruction techniques to examine assembly products formed by two different CA zzso of both human zzso virus type 1 zzso and the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso Interestingly, two types of zzso protein arrangements were observed for each virus zzso One organizational scheme featured zzso composed of putative zzso zzso zzso with sharing of zzso between neighbor zzso The second arrangement used apparent zzso zzso to coordinate zzso involved no zzso sharing, and employed putative zzso interactions to connect zzso zzso between the two assembly forms may be achieved by making or breaking the proposed zzso zzso zzso contacts in a process that appears to mimic viral zzso
