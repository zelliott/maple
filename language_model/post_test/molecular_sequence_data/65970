zzso was previously identified in zzso zzso zzso as a protein involved in loading zzso zzso zzso into the zzso of roots and its expression was associated with the vascular zzso Seven genes zzso to zzso zzso have been identified in the moss zzso zzso The corresponding proteins harbor an SPX zzso domain in the zzso zzso portion and an zzso domain in the zzso zzso zzso portion, both common features of the plant zzso zzso zzso analysis showed distinct expression patterns for the zzso zzso both at the tissue level and in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso reporter gene under three different zzso promoters revealed distinct expression profiles in various zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was specifically induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes also responded to zzso zzso by increased zzso zzso zzso changes associated with zzso zzso included zzso of zzso with zzso of the formation of side zzso resulting in colonies with greater diameter, but reduced mass compared to zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso also increased the synthesis of zzso and of an acid zzso and increased the ratio of zzso over zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and higher plants share some common strategies to adapt to zzso zzso although zzso changes are zzso and that the zzso proteins are well zzso in zzso despite the lack of a developed vascular zzso
