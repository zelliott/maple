A significant portion of the total carbon fixed in the zzso is attributed to the zzso metabolism of zzso In zzso and many zzso bacteria, zzso fixation is zzso by zzso zzso zzso most if not all of which is packaged in protein zzso called zzso These structures play an integral role in a cellular zzso mechanism and are essential components for zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso shell zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that has an evolutionary lineage distinct from those previously recognized in animals, plants, and other zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso were also identified in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which dominate the zzso oceans and are major contributors to primary zzso The location of the zzso CA in the shell suggests that it could supply the active sites of zzso in the zzso with the high zzso of zzso necessary for optimal zzso activity and efficient carbon fixation in these zzso which are important contributors to the global carbon zzso
