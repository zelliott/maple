zzso binding protein 2 zzso forms a specific zzso zzso complex with the zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso analysis showed that binding requires the zzso zzso sequence at positions zzso This sequence is predicted to zzso to a specific zzso within a zzso secondary structure element at the zzso of the viral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso binding reaction results in the formation of a zzso complex, whose zzso mobility is further zzso These properties are consistent with those described for the unidentified cellular protein in the zzso complex described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Baltimore D, 1993, zzso J zzso zzso zzso containing zzso in the zzso zzso structure of zzso that abate zzso binding show a decrease in zzso replication and translation of gene products directed by the zzso zzso zzso region in zzso suggesting that the interaction of zzso with these sequences performs a dual role in the virus life cycle by zzso both viral protein synthesis and initiation of viral zzso zzso
