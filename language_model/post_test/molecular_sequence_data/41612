This study compared the complete zzso sequences of 16 zzso strain human zzso zzso from respiratory specimens of zzso patients with respiratory disease in Colorado, USA, and characterized the epidemiology and clinical characteristics associated with circulating zzso viruses over a zzso zzso From 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, 92 of zzso respiratory specimens were found to be positive for zzso zzso by zzso an overall prevalence of zzso zzso viruses were circulating during all 3 years, but there was considerable yearly variation in prevalence and the month of peak zzso zzso analysis comparing the zzso sequences of the 16 Colorado zzso viruses with those of the zzso zzso and three other zzso viruses from the Netherlands demonstrated that there were three zzso zzso B and zzso circulating in Colorado from 2005 to 2010, and evidence of zzso between virus strains was zzso zzso B and C zzso in Colorado in 2005, 2009 and 2010, but zzso A circulated only in 2005 when it was the zzso zzso zzso zzso C represents a new lineage that has not been described zzso The greatest zzso in the zzso virus zzso was found in the zzso domain zzso of the spike gene zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten different zzso acid sequences were found in the zzso of the spike protein among these zzso strains and the 75 partial published sequences of zzso from strains found at different times throughout the zzso
