We measured the binding of zzso heat shock factor zzso to DNA in zzso by using an interference zzso in which zzso excludes zzso from a synthetic promoter element containing overlapping binding sites for each zzso The results show that zzso binds to DNA in zzso cells and that binding is not sufficient for zzso zzso
