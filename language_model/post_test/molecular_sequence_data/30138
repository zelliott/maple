zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is proposed to react with the zzso zzso group zzso of zzso to form a zzso zzso that lies zzso within the minor groove of zzso While zzso experiments using zzso have revealed the favored bonding sequences for zzso and related drugs on DNA, the zzso at the zzso bonding site zzso and orientation in the minor groove were not established by these zzso In previous studies using a combined fluorescence, zzso zzso and molecular modeling approach, we have shown that for zzso there are two zzso species zzso and zzso on both calf zzso DNA and zzso Although we were able to zzso the identity zzso at zzso and orientation in the minor zzso of the two species on zzso by zzso zzso and zzso studies, in combination with molecular mechanics calculations, definitive experimental evidence was zzso We have designed and zzso a zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso that bonds zzso two zzso zzso each having a defined orientation and zzso Thus the zzso zzso maintains the zzso of the original duplex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso (I zzso zzso unequivocally shows that zzso of zzso zzso bonds through zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso in the sequence zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
