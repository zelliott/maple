We used a zzso group of four natural populations of zzso zzso expanded from a single zzso along the zzso River zzso 90,000 zzso ago to study the molecular mechanism of the divergence in their freezing zzso in order to gain an insight into the genetic basis of their local zzso to low zzso zzso tolerance zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of variation in forms of zzso zzso factors were conducted on the four zzso zzso trait locus mapping was adopted with zzso populations of the zzso and least zzso zzso The degree of freezing tolerance among the four populations was zzso correlated with the lowest monthly average temperature of January in their native zzso and positively correlated to the expression level of some zzso zzso We identified a major locus harboring three zzso zzso factor genes zzso and found a zzso zzso in zzso in all populations except zzso which generated a dysfunctional zzso zzso The zzso in zzso experienced a stronger natural selection in the cooler environment after zzso lost its response to low temperature, which possibly reflects a local adaptation of these populations during the expansion from a common zzso
