The coding sequences of the zzso and zzso genes from zzso coli, which zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso were modified for expression in zzso cells and introduced into zzso L zzso A number of fusion genes zzso the zzso or zzso coding sequences joined to the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso gene and various portions of the zzso growth hormone zzso gene were zzso zzso differences in the level of zzso were observed, depending on the amount and arrangement of the zzso gene sequences used, the highest levels being obtained with the zzso zzso and zzso which contained only the zzso 3' untranslated gene zzso These two zzso were fused to produce the gene zzso In this single DNA zzso each bacterial gene is under independent zzso promoter zzso zzso of the zzso sequence in this construct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated compared with expression of the zzso gene in zzso However, expression of the zzso sequence in zzso was only zzso of that of the zzso gene cloned into zzso The zzso zzso which enhances the expression of the second gene in zzso is proposed as a model for the modification of bacterial genes in zzso
