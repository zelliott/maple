The discovery of a steadily growing number of tumor zzso zzso has made zzso zzso zzso cancer vaccines a possible alternative to zzso zzso cellular cancer zzso The major drawback of zzso vaccines, however, is the poor zzso of zzso It is commonly thought that for the induction of an effective zzso immune response, zzso cells zzso have to display zzso peptides to T zzso zzso zzso acids have been employed in the past to enhance transport of proteins into zzso In a systematic study, the ability of different zzso zzso to transfer zzso peptides to zzso was zzso We were able to show that several compounds enhance zzso of zzso peptides by zzso to different zzso The most efficient compound identified, zzso zzso enhanced zzso delivery by more than 2 logs as compared with cells treated with zzso alone, whereas zzso zzso treatment resulted in approximately zzso increased levels of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso and the molecular weight of zzso or zzso also influenced zzso zzso Furthermore, highly zzso charged peptides appear to be delivered with higher efficiency, although neutral peptides were also taken up at enhanced zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso by zzso appears to be due to an at least transient zzso of cell zzso zzso delivery in the presence of zzso may rely on zzso zzso zzso peptides applied as cancer vaccines in conjunction with zzso afforded zzso protection in animal zzso
