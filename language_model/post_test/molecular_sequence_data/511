The zzso interaction has been invoked as an important process in the zzso of Parkinson's zzso zzso we report binding zzso and zzso under zzso conditions for the binding of zzso to human zzso Specifically, we compare the binding of zzso to zzso zzso protein and two separate single zzso proteins that are associated with familial Parkinson's zzso zzso and zzso zzso binds to all three zzso proteins with a zzso zzso The zzso binding constants, however, vary among the proteins zzso zzso binding to zzso and zzso at 37 degrees C is similar with a zzso binding constant zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso however, exhibits two binding zzso The major binding site of zzso characteristic of zzso of the bound zzso has binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso respectively, slightly lower ( approximately zzso than that characteristic of zzso or zzso at the corresponding zzso The second less populated binding exhibited by zzso has a large binding constant, approximately zzso zzso Our size exclusion analysis ruled out the contribution of zzso to the strong zzso zzso Previous studies indicated that zzso had a larger proportion of intermediate species zzso small zzso species, such as zzso and zzso relative to zzso and zzso Thus, we propose that the high affinity site is attributed to the binding of zzso to those small zzso zzso
