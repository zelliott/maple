The investigation of zzso zzso zzso structure and function has moved rapidly over the past 10 zzso The isolation of replication origins, zzso and zzso has allowed the development of zzso a zzso artificial zzso zzso cloning system and investigations into zzso segregation and zzso during zzso and zzso Many zzso have been isolated which are defective in zzso zzso The development of the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso technique for use in zzso zzso has allowed the zzso of zzso and zzso throughout zzso and zzso In combination with indirect zzso to detect zzso and zzso zzso the FISH technique should further advance our understanding of zzso zzso zzso structure and zzso The recent discovery of a zzso structure zzso zzso repression at zzso reinforces the notion that zzso zzso zzso are similar to those of larger zzso Further characterization of such phenomena will accelerate the genetic dissection of this important zzso zzso
