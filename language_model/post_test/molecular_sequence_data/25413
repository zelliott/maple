zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso DNA duplex, zzso was determined by two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso phase zzso time zzso zzso correlation zzso The solution structure of the zzso was calculated by an zzso hybrid relaxation zzso method combined with zzso restrained molecular zzso The distances from the zzso zzso zzso were calculated from the relaxation rate zzso which were evaluated from a hybrid zzso volume zzso zzso elements from the experiment and those calculated from an initial zzso The hybrid zzso distances were then used in a restrained molecular dynamics procedure to obtain a new structure that better zzso the zzso zzso The resulting partially refined structure was then used to calculate an improved theoretical zzso volume zzso which is once again merged with the experimental zzso until refinement is zzso zzso zzso zzso for each of the zzso of the zzso were obtained from zzso zzso selective zzso flip zzso zzso By using a modified zzso relationship the zzso zzso angles zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso chemical shifts and zzso zzso zzso of this sequence has allowed a greater insight into the various factors responsible for zzso chemical shift variations in zzso It also provides an important probe of the zzso structural variation of the zzso zzso backbone of DNA in zzso These correlations are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in local zzso structure zzso the zzso zzso zzso The variation of the zzso chemical shift, and the degree of this variation from one base step to the next is proposed as a potential probe of local zzso zzso within the DNA double zzso The pattern of calculated zzso and zzso zzso angles from the restrained molecular dynamics refinement agrees quite well with the measured zzso zzso zzso Thus, the local zzso parameters determine the length of the zzso backbone which in turn zzso the zzso in various allowed zzso
