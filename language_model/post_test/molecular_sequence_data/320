Mouse tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso is produced in three alternatively spliced zzso that differ in domain structure and mechanism for cell surface zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in mice was characterized as an initial step for identification of their zzso zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso existed over 430 Ma while zzso and zzso evolved more zzso In zzso zzso studies of heart and lung did not reveal any cells exclusively expressing a single zzso Although our previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso is more prevalent than zzso or zzso zzso in mouse zzso western zzso studies demonstrated that zzso is the primary protein zzso produced in adult zzso while zzso is expressed during embryonic development and in zzso zzso with zzso as the primary zzso produced within adult vascular beds, the zzso zzso in mouse plasma zzso like zzso in zzso and mice have a much smaller zzso pool of plasma zzso than zzso 

The data demonstrate that alternatively spliced zzso of zzso are temporally expressed in mouse zzso at the level of protein zzso zzso and zzso are produced in embryonic zzso and in zzso while adult zzso produce almost exclusively zzso
