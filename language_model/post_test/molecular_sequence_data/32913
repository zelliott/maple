The recently identified zzso early gene 3 zzso belongs to the gene family of zzso zzso factors and is zzso immediately after zzso zzso To explore the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso control, zzso zzso zzso were performed in order to determine regulatory zzso within the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we monitored the zzso zzso and mapped putative nuclear zzso signals zzso We provide evidence that the zzso of zzso is essential to repress the zzso and that the loss of the zzso interacting domain zzso zzso the repressive effects of zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso we also demonstrate that the zinc finger containing zzso domain zzso alone is able to activate the zzso of a reporter zzso zzso analysis of the zinc finger region revealed no similarities to known zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso disclosed zzso as a nuclear zzso Further, we identified the zzso as being essential for the nuclear zzso of zzso We detected two closely located putative zzso zzso within the second and third zinc finger, which are zzso among the members of the zzso family of zzso Together these results may help to increase the understanding of zzso zzso control and to characterize this zzso zzso zzso zzso
