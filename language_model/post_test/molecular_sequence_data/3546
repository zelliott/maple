The zzso zzso protein zzso domain is a zzso zzso containing eight zzso found in a characteristic zzso core arrangement, that is present in a number of otherwise unrelated zzso zzso motifs are present in zzso and zzso two zzso located on zzso zzso in a locus rich in poorly characterized zzso domain zzso One of these zzso which contains two zzso zzso is zzso (also known as zzso originally described as an zzso specific protein but more recently suggested to be a putative serum zzso marker for zzso zzso We have shown that zzso is expressed in a number of normal human zzso outside of the male zzso system, including regions of the respiratory tract and zzso as well as in a subset of lung zzso cell zzso zzso of multiple zzso zzso and zzso products with zzso sequence allowed the zzso of the zzso zzso These studies revealed that zzso can undergo a complex series of alternative zzso events that can potentially yield five distinct zzso domain containing protein zzso These results cast doubt on the potential role of zzso as a serum zzso marker specific for zzso cancer and open the door to understanding the function of multiple zzso domain containing protein zzso arising from a single zzso
