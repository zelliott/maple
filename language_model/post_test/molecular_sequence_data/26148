The zzso isolate B12 and its zzso zzso element zzso have provided a fruitful system for detailed analysis of certain aspects of zzso molecular biology, especially those concerning gene zzso In the course of clarifying this zzso zzso position, we determined DNA base zzso ability to grow zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and level of total zzso zzso to other zzso zzso Although the results generally demonstrate a similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence data indicate that isolate B12 in fact represents a distinct zzso
