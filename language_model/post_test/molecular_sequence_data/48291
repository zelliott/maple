The zzso zzso zzso group 4) is a widespread zzso zzso that makes up an important fraction of marine zzso zzso This group has low genetic divergence and is composed of a small number of putative zzso We combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ITS zzso zzso zzso clone libraries to study the zzso of this marine zzso examining both spatial and zzso trends in zzso zzso and associated environmental zzso The most represented zzso zzso appeared adapted to different temperature zzso and their zzso did not suggest clear geographical barriers for zzso Distant samples sharing the same temperature had very similar zzso especially in cold temperatures, where only one zzso zzso zzso The most highly represented zzso A and zzso showed very little differentiation between populations from distant geographical zzso Within a single site, zzso variation also followed patterns governed by zzso Our results contribute to the general discussion on microbial zzso by showing strong environmental selection for some zzso in the marine zzso
