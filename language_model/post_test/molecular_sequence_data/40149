The major royal jelly zzso zzso family possesses several zzso and chemical functions in the development of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each protein of the family has a zzso domain named zzso However, there is no report of zzso family proteins in the zzso 

Using the zzso protein sequence in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso database, we found a gene family composed of seven members with a zzso zzso domain each and named it zzso protein family of zzso zzso We completed the zzso sequences with zzso zzso The protein of each member possesses a zzso domain and a putative zzso signal zzso consisting of a zzso zzso In view of genetic evolution, the whole zzso zzso protein family composes a zzso group, which is distinctly separate from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We then showed the tissue expression profiles of zzso zzso protein family genes by zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso protein family is found to be composed of at least seven zzso The low zzso and unique pattern of gene expression by each member among the family ensure us to prophesy that the members of zzso zzso protein family would play some important zzso functions in zzso zzso
