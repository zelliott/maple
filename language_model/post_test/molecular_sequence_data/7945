In the present study, insulin is shown to rapidly stimulate by 8- to zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso a zzso zzso domain containing zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of protein zzso C by zzso zzso had almost no effect on the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a shift in molecular weight of the zzso alpha zzso and the activated zzso was zzso by treatment with a zzso indicating that insulin activated the zzso by stimulating its zzso This zzso shift in zzso was also observed in primary rat zzso zzso as well as in a muscle cell line called zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso alpha activity was inhibited by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso in a zzso manner with a zzso zzso of 10 zzso but not by 20 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso alpha activity was also observed in a zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso alpha activity can be regulated by the insulin zzso zzso alpha may therefore play a general role in zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso zzso
