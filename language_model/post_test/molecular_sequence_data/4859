The zzso zzso gene is expressed in a subset of adult blood cell types and may play a role in the differentiation of the zzso and zzso zzso In a search for zzso genes involved in cardiovascular development, we have independently isolated a zzso zzso zzso which appears to be the zzso zzso of zzso Based on high sequence similarity in a number of regions, particularly the critical zzso we have named this gene zzso This zzso regulated gene is first expressed in the zzso zzso of the zzso stage zzso This tissue goes on to contribute to the structures of the embryonic liver and zzso continues to be expressed in the liver throughout zzso From the zzso stage, zzso is expressed in vascular zzso cells throughout the developing vascular zzso zzso expression of zzso is transient and zzso slightly after expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to be essential for vascular zzso This observation raises the possibility that zzso is one of the zzso factors that responds to the zzso signal zzso zzso leading to differentiation of vascular zzso zzso zzso is unique amongst zzso genes in displaying expression in the zzso layer throughout the developing zzso zzso of zzso sequences in the zzso zzso causes disruption to developing vascular structures and an increase in the number of vascular zzso cells, suggesting a possible role in regulation of cell zzso
