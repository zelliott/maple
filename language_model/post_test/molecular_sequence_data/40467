Aedes aegypti larvae are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso toxin from zzso zzso which is not able to bind to its target tissue in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso larvae are highly susceptible to that zzso which targets its zzso brush border zzso zzso through the binding of the zzso zzso to specific zzso the zzso zzso zzso The identification of an zzso aegypti gene zzso a zzso zzso here named zzso led to the major goal of this study which was to investigate its zzso The zzso transcript was found in larvae and adults from zzso aegypti and a zzso protein was recognized by an zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein displayed zzso activity and localized to the zzso zzso bound through a zzso anchor, similarly to zzso However, no binding of native zzso was observed to the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of both proteins with zzso led to changes in the molecular weight of zzso but not zzso zzso that the former was zzso The findings from this work rule out lack of receptors in zzso zzso or its expression as soluble zzso as a reason for zzso aegypti zzso to Bin zzso
