It was reported previously that zzso delta virus zzso the only animal virus in which replication is performed by cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the previous zzso zzso system was somewhat limited in terms of practical zzso zzso cells were zzso with plasmids expressing zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso to develop a better system for studying the fundamental aspects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso species were examined using restriction zzso length zzso and sequence analysis of cloned zzso zzso This novel experimental system generated efficiently zzso between the two parental zzso zzso but not between zzso zzso zzso The zzso organization of the zzso zzso produced in this system resembled that observed previously in cultured cells zzso with zzso I and zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by host zzso zzso in cultured cells zzso with two cloned zzso zzso This new zzso system is simpler than the previous zzso method of study, and generates a higher zzso frequency, zzso study of zzso zzso zzso
