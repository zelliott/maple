An zzso zzso gene promoter zzso due to an zzso zzso to zzso zzso transition 78 base pairs upstream from the zzso initiation site, was studied by amplification of the corresponding region of the zzso zzso DNA sequencing, and zzso zzso zzso The frequency of the zzso was studied on female and male individuals classified into three groups according to the high density zzso zzso cholesterol zzso The zzso zzso for the A zzso were zzso zzso zzso in women and zzso zzso zzso in men in the zzso in the intermediate (between 10th and 90th zzso and the highest zzso of HDL cholesterol levels, zzso zzso analysis showed a significant difference of zzso zzso between the highest and the lowest zzso zzso less than zzso and between the highest and the intermediate zzso of HDL cholesterol in women zzso less than zzso but not in zzso As the sequences surrounding the zzso are known to be involved in zzso zzso it is possible that the zzso transition zzso may have an influence on zzso synthesis and, in consequence, on the HDL cholesterol levels in zzso
