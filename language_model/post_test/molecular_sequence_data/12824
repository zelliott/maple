The extracts from bovine lens capsule with zzso acid zzso after reduction, three major zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were specifically zzso with zzso IV collagen zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso and zzso zzso were akin and were distinct from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, evidence that the zzso and zzso zzso from bovine lens capsule both originated from alpha zzso was obtained on the basis of zzso with a zzso zzso that recognizes alpha zzso chain at the zzso sequence contained in zzso The zzso sequence was identified from the following three zzso zzso zzso from human zzso were zzso by affinity zzso on the zzso column and zzso The restriction map of the clones positively zzso with the zzso zzso from human zzso zzso library was superimposed on that of human alpha zzso zzso at a specific zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the sequence were zzso for zzso activity against the reaction between zzso zzso fragments and the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso showed similar zzso in protein zzso as well as in zzso with the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso did not react with the zzso zzso indicating that it is a genetically distinct type IV collagen chain, presumably alpha zzso from its zzso The zzso a major type IV collagen zzso is a short form of alpha zzso present as a tissue form in bovine lens zzso
