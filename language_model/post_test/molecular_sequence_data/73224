A number of X zzso DNA sequences have been isolated from a zzso plant, zzso album zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Six DNA clones were selected and further characterized by zzso zzso techniques to check their copy numbers, zzso zzso patterns, species specificity and positions on zzso These clones were moderately to highly repetitive zzso zzso copies per zzso zzso and none of them gave a positive signal on Northern zzso One of the clones yielded a zzso zzso zzso its abundant zzso zzso island was found only in zzso All the clones also zzso to two closely related zzso zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences of two zzso clones showed a number of internal short direct zzso one of them zzso resembled a plant conservative zzso sequence zzso None of the clones zzso to the X zzso only, but all were localized at the zzso zzso regions zzso zzso of both arms of a vast majority of zzso album zzso using the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso arm of the Y zzso zzso to the arm zzso to the X zzso possessing the zzso zzso showed neither a zzso zzso zzso nor a FISH signal with any of the DNA zzso tested, thus indicating its evolutionary zzso
