Besides zzso zzso which play key roles in basic zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 65 zzso of apparent molecular zzso an zzso zzso zzso has been described in pea zzso This zzso protein is devoid of any zzso activity, and shares many zzso and molecular features with late zzso zzso zzso In a first step toward understanding the role of this peculiar zzso we have demonstrated the role of zzso acid zzso and of the zzso environment on its expression using northern zzso analysis from immature zzso cultured in zzso and zzso mature zzso Moreover, the cloning and characterization of its gene zzso to as zzso zzso allowed us to define various potential zzso elements within the promoter region to account for the observed strict zzso zzso The results described in this paper are consistent with a model in which zzso zzso at least in part, expression of this zzso However, unlike most zzso zzso zzso regulation of the zzso gene seems to occur in a very restricted fashion, being confined only to particular stages of zzso zzso Such a strict spatial and zzso expression pattern is dependent on the zzso environment of the developing zzso and on zzso factors, presumably preventing zzso depletion in cells requiring this essential zzso for basic zzso zzso
