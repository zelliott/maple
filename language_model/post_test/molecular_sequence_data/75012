Small DNA fragments of approximately 350 zzso in zzso either with or without zzso zzso are zzso into zzso DNA zzso to generate zzso rings with different zzso linking numbers, zzso These zzso differing by an zzso of one, can be separated by zzso gel zzso Furthermore, zzso can be used to reveal DNA double zzso zzso changes that are induced by zzso such as left-handed zzso When zzso zzso are added to such zzso their binding leads to a selective zzso of the zzso migration of the zzso containing zzso This effect is not seen with relaxed zzso and those with insufficient zzso stress to induce a zzso zzso Thus the technique of zzso gel zzso presents a very sensitive zzso for the identification of proteins that selectively bind to DNA zzso stabilized by negative DNA zzso
