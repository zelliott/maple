zzso studies of the zzso group have been biased towards zzso and zzso zzso and relatively few studies have examined zzso species from marine zzso Here we took zzso zzso strains from diverse marine environments and zzso their zzso zzso Using molecular zzso we separated the strains into thirteen zzso zzso and identified 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three indistinguishable zzso In addition, we zzso the zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso gene and assessed its zzso power in identifying zzso zzso trees of zzso zzso genes separated each zzso according to their zzso positions and were supported zzso The resolution of zzso on the zzso zzso tree was approximately zzso times greater than on the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso zzso gene can be used to identify zzso species, providing an improved identification scheme for zzso zzso
