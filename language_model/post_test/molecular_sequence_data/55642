zzso zzso clones representing the fusion zzso and zzso zzso proteins of two zzso virus strains different in zzso were zzso Upon zzso of zzso cells, extensive cell fusion was observed only when cells expressed the F protein of the fusing strain together with the zzso protein derived from either zzso zzso analyses further showed that the zzso acid at position 195 of the F protein plays a critical role in determining the extent of cell fusion induced by zzso virus, since replacement of zzso by zzso significantly reduced the fusion zzso of otherwise zzso F zzso
