We demonstrate that the major in zzso targets of zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso of budding zzso are the three members of the zzso domain family of zzso exchange factors: zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain are important for zzso zzso of zzso exchange activity, since zzso in these zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and of zzso zzso to zzso reverse the sensitivity of each to zzso in zzso and in zzso We show that the target of zzso zzso of zzso exchange activity is an zzso domain protein complex, and that zzso acts to stabilize this complex to a greater extent for a zzso zzso domain than for a resistant zzso
