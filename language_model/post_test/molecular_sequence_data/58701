We determined the zzso sequence zzso zzso upstream and zzso zzso downstream of the toxin genes A and B of zzso zzso Nine zzso were zzso Based on zzso approaches, two were attributed to the zzso locus zzso The other seven were found in every zzso zzso isolate obtained from the human gastrointestinal zzso zzso of their zzso The zzso zzso and zzso upstream of the zzso displayed similarity to zzso of zzso bacteria zzso and to an zzso zzso described for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the locus a putative ABC zzso zzso was zzso With a set of three paired zzso used in zzso chain reactions we succeeded in zzso the zzso zzso of the appropriate stretch of DNA in zzso zzso zzso and four additional zzso strains proved a high conservation of the borders of the zzso in all these zzso Our data define the locus as a distinct genetic zzso Comparing the sequences of five zzso and five zzso strains the integration site of the zzso was zzso This showed that a stretch of 115 zzso found in zzso strains is replaced by the zzso locus in zzso zzso Analysis of the boundary sequences showed that the locus is obviously not a mobile genetic element by zzso Instead we propose that it is the independent zzso part of a more extended genetic element associated with zzso The 115 zzso of zzso strains replaced by the locus in zzso strains carry the putative zzso zzso of the zzso a predicted zzso zzso A possible polar effect of the loss of this zzso on zzso of the zzso genes is zzso Such an effect would explain the zzso zzso of the zzso at a single site of the zzso zzso zzso and might give a rationale for the development of the disease which is induced after zzso zzso
