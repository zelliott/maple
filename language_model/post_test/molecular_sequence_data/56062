A humanized zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso is known to be zzso both in zzso and in zzso So as to improve therapeutic potency through protein engineering strategies, we wish to define the structural motifs underlying some of the documented differences in function between human zzso zzso and zzso forms of the zzso By the creation of heavy chain zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have established an important role for the zzso half of the zzso domain in determining differential zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in complement zzso If this same region were necessary for the zzso mechanisms that operate in zzso then it might be possible to improve zzso zzso functions by construction of novel zzso that possess within the one zzso multiple copies of the crucial zzso associated zzso Although our previous work suggested that the zzso zzso zzso was ineffective at zzso we found this to be so only in some zzso In others, zzso and indeed all the zzso zzso were able to mediate zzso Overall, though, zzso remains the best choice zzso for zzso therapy in zzso
