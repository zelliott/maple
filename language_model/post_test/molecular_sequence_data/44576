A native bovine zzso rod outer segment membrane zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso to show its linkage consistent to the process of zzso In the present study, a second form of the membrane zzso zzso has been cloned from the bovine zzso This zzso shares a high sequence identity with zzso is specifically expressed in the bovine zzso and, like zzso is modulated in low zzso by a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso For this reason, this zzso has now been named zzso and the previously described zzso as zzso The tail end of zzso contains a stretch of five zzso zzso a structural feature unique to zzso These findings support the existence of a zzso zzso of zzso and indicate that zzso embodies a five zzso acid signature element at its tail zzso
