Very little information is currently available concerning the zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso the zzso agent of the zzso disease of zzso We screened a zzso library of this fungus and identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene named zzso The complete coding sequence is 22 zzso long and encodes a large protein zzso zzso showing typical zzso modular zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed four complete zzso zzso two of which have zzso zzso In the vicinity of zzso a second gene (named zzso which encodes an zzso cassette zzso was zzso Increased expression of zzso and zzso was observed during zzso zzso However, while physically linked, these two genes are probably not functionally zzso as their expression patterns zzso
