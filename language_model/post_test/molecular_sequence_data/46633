The iron sulfur protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is central to energy metabolism in zzso zzso including those with zzso Thus, revealing the evolutionary history of zzso is critical to understanding the zzso of zzso zzso energy zzso We determined a complete zzso sequence for zzso zzso a large zzso of a zzso sequence from zzso zzso and a zzso of a new zzso from zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso zzso genes suggest a complex history for zzso including possible gene zzso and horizontal transfers among zzso Our analyses favor a common origin for zzso zzso and zzso zzso from a single zzso source, rather than from separate horizontal transfers as previously zzso However, with the present sampling of genes and species, we were unable to zzso a specific zzso sister group for zzso zzso Thus, we find no direct support for the published hypothesis that the donor of zzso zzso was the common zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We also report that several zzso and zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso that are likely zzso with zzso from zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso combine with fragments of other zzso proteins to form fusion proteins which participate in zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the view that zzso an zzso previously considered to be specific to energy metabolism in zzso zzso was present in the common zzso of contemporary zzso and was zzso wholly or in part, during the evolution of zzso and zzso zzso
