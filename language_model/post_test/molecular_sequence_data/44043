A low degree of zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso proteins zzso has been obtained for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso coli trigger factor zzso that was thought to be significant with regard to the zzso properties of the bacterial zzso We examined whether the zzso of a zzso charged zzso at position 37 zzso zzso and a zzso at position 99, both highly zzso through both types of zzso leads to parallel effects on the zzso activity of both zzso and zzso domain in a series of zzso zzso with different zzso zzso For the latter zzso substitution of zzso by Val or zzso which zzso to zzso in human zzso enhanced the zzso activity, whereas a strongly decreased zzso activity was determined for the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Regardless of the zzso zzso of the zzso used for the zzso zzso of zzso generated a protein zzso of the zzso domain with about zzso of the wild type zzso zzso zzso on the zzso nature, a moderate decrease as well as a zzso increase in zzso could be determined for the corresponding zzso zzso zzso Neither of the zzso of the zzso domain was able to implant zzso zzso found as a major characteristic of the zzso family of zzso
