The zzso fish zzso zzso zzso from Kenya has adapted to living in waters at pH zzso by zzso the end product of nitrogen metabolism as zzso rather than as zzso directly across the zzso as occurs in most zzso The level of activity in liver of the first zzso in the zzso cycle pathway, zzso zzso III zzso zzso is too low to account for the observed high rates of zzso zzso We report here the surprising finding that zzso III and all other zzso cycle zzso activities are present in muscle of this species at levels more than sufficient to account for the rate of zzso zzso in addition, the basic kinetic properties of the zzso III appear to be different from those of other known type III zzso The sequence of the zzso III zzso is reported as well as the finding that zzso zzso activity is present in liver but not in zzso This unusual form of adaptation may have occurred because of the apparent impossibility of packaging the needed amount of zzso cycle zzso in zzso
