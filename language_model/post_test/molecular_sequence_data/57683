The last decade has witnessed major breakthroughs in the study of zzso zzso The currently described zzso zzso and zzso receptors have been zzso and cloned from various zzso zzso A far greater variety of zzso zzso are now available for use as selective zzso and zzso zzso potent zzso zzso highly selective for the zzso and zzso receptors have been developed zzso These improved tools for zzso zzso characterization have enabled us to describe at least three distinct zzso zzso Furthermore, novel zzso have yielded zzso binding and functional data strongly favoring the existence of putative zzso of zzso and especially zzso zzso Whether these zzso are species zzso or true zzso zzso awaits further zzso As yet undiscovered zzso zzso or zzso fragments, may have superior potency at a specific zzso zzso The common C zzso of zzso permits varying degrees of interaction at essentially all zzso zzso Although the exact zzso significance of this inherent capacity for zzso zzso zzso remains unknown, one implication is for multiple zzso zzso at a single zzso For example, zzso gamma and zzso appear to be the preferred zzso and binding competitors at some zzso zzso previously thought of as exclusively zzso Current evidence suggests that zzso coexistence and expression of multiple receptors may also occur with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other zzso receptors may recognize zzso and the N zzso of zzso In light of these recent developments, the convenient working hypothesis of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for three basic zzso types zzso zzso and zzso may be too simplistic and in need of amendment as future developments occur zzso et zzso zzso In retrospect, the 1980s contributed greatly to our understanding of the structure, function, and regulation of zzso and their various zzso The development of improved, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to recent advances in molecular biological techniques, may lead to a more conclusive pharmacological and zzso characterization of zzso zzso The 1990s may prove to be the decade of application, where a better understanding of the roles played by zzso zzso (at various zzso zzso under zzso conditions will no doubt zzso the realization of clinically useful therapeutic zzso
