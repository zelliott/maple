In the heart, individual cardiac muscle cells are linked by gap zzso These junctions form low resistance pathways along which the electrical impulse flows rapidly and repeatedly between all the cells of the zzso ensuring their zzso zzso To obtain zzso for mapping the distribution of gap junctions in cardiac zzso zzso zzso were raised to three synthetic zzso each matching different zzso exposed portions of the sequence of zzso the major zzso protein reported in the zzso The specificity of each zzso for the zzso to which it was raised was established by dot zzso New methods were developed for zzso enriched zzso of gap junctions from whole heart and from zzso adult zzso in which zzso and raising the temperature zzso damaging steps in previously described zzso are zzso Analysis of these zzso by zzso gel zzso revealed major bands at 43 zzso zzso the molecular mass of zzso and at 70 zzso Western zzso experiments using our zzso indicated that both the zzso and the zzso bands represent cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of isolated gap junctions and zzso zzso zzso of zzso whole tissue demonstrated the specific binding of the zzso to zzso defined gap zzso One zzso zzso to zzso zzso was found to be particularly effective for zzso zzso Using this zzso for zzso zzso in combination with zzso scanning laser zzso enabled highly sensitive detection and three-dimensional mapping of gap junctions through thick slices of cardiac zzso By means of the serial optical zzso ability of the zzso zzso images of the entire gap junction population of complete en zzso disks were zzso These reconstructions reveal the presence of large junctions arranged as a peripheral ring around the zzso with smaller junctions in an interior zzso an arrangement that may facilitate efficient zzso transfer of zzso By applying our zzso techniques to tissue from hearts removed from transplant patients with advanced zzso heart disease, we have demonstrated that gap junction distribution between zzso at the border zone of healed zzso is markedly zzso This zzso may contribute to the genesis of zzso zzso in zzso heart zzso
