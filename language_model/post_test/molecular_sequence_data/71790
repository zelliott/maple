A zzso coding for soluble type alkaline zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso acid sequence showed high identities to various zzso and partial similarities to zzso of zzso zzso Using this zzso sequence as a probe, the molecular basis of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso type zzso zzso was zzso As for zzso the result suggested that zzso modification was important for the proteins to express activity and to represent their extensive zzso nature, whereas the magnitude of activities was mainly regulated by zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso showed poor zzso but one exception was the zzso zzso in which the zzso gene was largely zzso Interestingly, the zzso gene was shown to be transcribed into two zzso of different sizes, zzso and zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso of zzso we found a zzso zzso for zzso Both of these zzso seem zzso silent, suggesting that the functional differentiation between these zzso is not perfect, so that they can still work mutually and complement each other as an indispensable zzso for zzso zzso
