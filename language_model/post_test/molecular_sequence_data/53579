Type 1 and zzso are zzso members of Class I zzso produced by zzso zzso Despite common structural zzso the low level of zzso acid sequence conservation among the Class I major zzso zzso zzso indicates considerable evolutionary distance between members of this zzso We highlight here structural zzso between Class I zzso from their two-dimensional sequence analysis using zzso cluster analysis zzso and secondary structure predictions zzso zzso We present evidence that all members of the Class I zzso family have clear structural zzso and suggest that zzso based on zzso analysis of Class I zzso into seven zzso zzso with differences in structural properties of the zzso acid zzso Using a sensitive alignment process zzso we identified 29 zzso in zzso positions which probably play a prominent role in zzso The most striking aspects that distinguish the different zzso zzso are zzso large variation in the length of the zzso connecting the structurally zzso regions and zzso zzso sequence signature motifs located on regions predicted to be in the zzso We suggest that these zzso sequence signature zzso are part of interactive surfaces which participate in zzso zzso These motifs prove highly useful in characterizing and zzso new Class I zzso that have not yet been described and whose sequence zzso appreciably from those of characterized zzso zzso the submission of our zzso the experimental structure of Class I zzso zzso was zzso In light of these actual zzso structures, a comparison has been made between the predicted results and the crystal structure in the Note zzso in zzso
