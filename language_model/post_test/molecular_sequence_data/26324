zzso cluster analysis zzso zzso is a very efficient method to zzso and compare protein zzso Despite its effectiveness, this method is not widely used because it relies in part on the experience and training of the zzso In this article, detailed guidelines as to the use of zzso are presented and include discussions on: the definition of the zzso clusters and their relationships with secondary and zzso zzso the length of the zzso the zzso acid zzso used for zzso the zzso plot programs; and the working zzso Various procedures for the analysis of a single sequence are zzso structural zzso structural zzso and secondary structure zzso Like most sequence analysis methods, zzso is more efficient when several zzso sequences are zzso zzso for the detection and alignment of zzso related proteins by zzso are described through several published examples along with 2 previously zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso is clearly related to the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso although they display a reverse organization of their zzso zzso the alignment of the sequence of human zzso zzso protein with that of the zzso zzso is zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso in the identification of important zzso for zzso as well as in the preparation of zzso zzso is zzso
