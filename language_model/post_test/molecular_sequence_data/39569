Three closely related zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso are activated by zzso zzso Here we have taken a genetic approach to further dissect their possibly unique and/or shared roles during early mouse zzso A zzso reporter zzso was created to zzso zzso expression zzso zzso is initially expressed only in the visceral zzso zzso zzso zzso and shows a highly restricted pattern of expression in the zzso proper at later zzso In addition, zzso conditional and zzso zzso were zzso All zzso clearly demonstrate that adult zzso zzso zzso are viable and zzso To zzso gene dosage effects, we manipulated expression ratios of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso also lacking one copy of zzso or zzso did not exhibit overt zzso and the tissue disturbances seen in zzso or zzso zzso zzso were not exacerbated in the absence of zzso However, we discovered a profound genetic interaction between zzso and zzso Thus, as for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso die by zzso and display defects in zzso zzso cardiac looping and primordial germ cell zzso zzso These experiments demonstrate for the first time that zzso and zzso function zzso to govern zzso target gene expression in the early zzso zzso
