The complete zzso zzso sequence of the cloned zzso gene from zzso zzso is zzso The gene encodes a zzso zzso that represents a sequential fusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities from the zzso to the zzso zzso This genetic organization is characteristic of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso start sites and the zzso sites of the gene have been zzso The two zzso zzso transcripts have a short leader of 13 and 18 zzso while minor species with significantly longer leaders are also zzso zzso 50 zzso and 70 zzso upstream from the major zzso start points, sequences that match the zzso zzso zzso and zzso boxes, respectively, are zzso Two major zzso signals are located approximately 50 and 70 zzso downstream from the zzso zzso Three closely clustered minor zzso sites map to roughly zzso zzso 3' to the termination zzso The zzso gene is the first and only zzso gene that has been cloned and zzso The information regarding the promoter and zzso of a zzso gene derived from these studies should benefit strategies aimed at gene zzso in this zzso
