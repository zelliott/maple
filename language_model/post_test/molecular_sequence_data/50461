zzso systems can protect bacteria against viral zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso one of the three zzso of type I zzso systems, have been determined for four strains of zzso zzso with the known sequences of zzso and zzso indicates that all are zzso though they fall into three families zzso by zzso zzso and zzso the first two of which are apparently zzso The extent of zzso acid sequence identity between zzso and zzso is so low that the genes zzso them might be better termed zzso this almost certainly reflects genetic exchange among highly divergent zzso Within the zzso family the ratio of zzso to zzso divergence is very zzso The extent of divergence between the genes from zzso coli K-12 and zzso zzso zzso is similar to that for other genes with the same level of zzso usage zzso In contrast, zzso divergence (between zzso coli strains B and zzso is extremely high and may reflect the action of zzso selection zzso by zzso There is also evidence of lateral transfer of a short sequence between zzso coli and zzso zzso
