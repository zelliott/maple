The ability of different synthetic cell penetrating zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso flock house virus, and zzso peptides to form complexes with a zzso zzso zzso was compared and their zzso was determined by circular zzso zzso The efficiency for zzso delivery into cells was measured using peptides labeled with a zzso zzso showing blue zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showing green zzso Fluorescence due to the zzso energy transfer confirmed the interaction of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most efficient zzso delivery was found for zzso zzso of the two types of zzso shows that the zzso zzso proved to be more efficient than zzso zzso The paper also emphasizes that the attachment of a fluorescent label may have an effect on the zzso and flexibility of zzso peptides that must be taken into consideration when evaluating biological zzso
