We studied the interaction of wheat germ zzso zzso with synthetic zzso whose zzso acid sequences were similar to that of the second zinc finger of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso The results clearly show that in addition to weak zzso zzso binding activity zzso not zzso these two 30 zzso acid long zzso zzso some zzso bonds of wheat germ zzso zzso The zzso pattern of plant zzso zzso is very specific and the cuts occur only after the zzso zzso The same properties of these peptides were zzso observed for zzso coli zzso We found that the zzso specificity of both the zinc finger peptides is very similar to that of a pancreatic zzso zzso zzso
