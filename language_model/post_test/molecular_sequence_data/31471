The novel, zzso zzso zzso acid bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 18 were obtained from throat samples of healthy zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analyses indicated that these zzso belong to the zzso zzso specifically the zzso zzso group, with zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the nearest zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to the respective type zzso zzso zzso by fluorescent amplified zzso length zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso comparative sequence analysis of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso tests revealed that these bacteria formed a zzso well separated from its nearest zzso and other species of the zzso zzso with zzso published names and, therefore, represent a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
