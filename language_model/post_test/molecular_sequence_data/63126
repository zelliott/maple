zzso a wild temperate grass with a small zzso was recently proposed as a new model zzso for the zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated gene content and zzso between zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso and rice at a local zzso region harboring the major wheat zzso gene zzso Gene density was much lower in zzso zzso (one per 41 zzso because of gene zzso and an abundance of zzso elements within zzso regions as compared to zzso zzso (one per 14 zzso and rice (one per 10 zzso For the Q gene region, zzso was more zzso between wheat and rice than between wheat and zzso because zzso zzso contained two genes apparently not present within the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso analysis of Q and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which were zzso among the three species, showed that zzso is more closely related to wheat than rice, which agrees with previous zzso We conclude that zzso will be a useful tool for gene discovery, comparative zzso and the study of evolutionary relationships among the grasses but will not zzso the need to conduct large-scale zzso experiments in the zzso
