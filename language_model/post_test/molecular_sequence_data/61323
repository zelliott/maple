The sequence of the zzso gene from zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from zzso zzso cultures exposed to zzso were isolated, and by partial sequencing of their zzso zzso seven different point zzso affecting five different zzso acids zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso which led to zzso of zzso to 100 zzso for the organisms, were zzso These zzso showed various deficiencies for growth at 42 degrees C, with only one being comparable to the zzso zzso The interaction of these zzso zzso with human zzso cells was examined by using an zzso zzso Three zzso failed to zzso while three showed a reduced interaction compared to that of the wild zzso It is believed that these zzso zzso have arisen as a result of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso
