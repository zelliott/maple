The positive zzso zzso factor b zzso regulates zzso zzso II zzso In cells, zzso partitions between small active and larger inactive zzso In the latter, zzso binds to zzso zzso and recruits as well as zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Several stimuli can affect this zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that protein zzso C zzso zzso the zzso at zzso zzso in zzso This zzso zzso protein neither binds to zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso zzso or the engagement of the T cell zzso zzso which activate zzso and the expression of the zzso active zzso zzso zzso which is found in T cells, inhibit the formation of the zzso zzso All these stimuli increase zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso proteins block effects of these zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso by zzso represents a major regulatory step of zzso activity in zzso
