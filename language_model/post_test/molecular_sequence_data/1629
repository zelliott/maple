zzso zzso a fastidious zzso causing disease in over 100 plant species, is classified as a single species, although genetic studies support multiple zzso To determine the zzso zzso among strains of zzso zzso we conducted zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso region using 26 strains from 10 zzso Under stringent conditions zzso zzso degrees zzso the DNA zzso for most zzso zzso strains was zzso However, at high stringency zzso zzso degrees zzso three distinct zzso zzso B, and zzso were zzso zzso A included strains from cultivated zzso zzso almond zzso and zzso interrelated by zzso zzso zzso B included strains from zzso zzso zzso pigeon zzso zzso and almond zzso interrelated by zzso and zzso C included only strains from zzso interrelated by zzso The mean zzso zzso between zzso A and B, A and C, and B and C, were 58, 41, and zzso zzso ITS results also indicated the same zzso zzso A and B, A and C, and B and C had identities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous and present zzso data supports the molecular zzso zzso A strains grow faster on zzso disease zzso medium whereas B and C strains grow more zzso zzso B and C strains are susceptible to zzso and resistant to zzso whereas A strains are zzso Each zzso can be differentiated zzso as well as by structural zzso We propose zzso A, B, and C be named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strains of the subspecies are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso multiplex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
