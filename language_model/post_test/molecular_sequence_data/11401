zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the adrenal zzso by its own zzso zzso has been a matter of zzso In the present study, whether zzso regulates the expression of zzso for its own zzso in the adrenal zzso was studied in human subjects and in rats in zzso In the human study, adrenal zzso zzso as well as adjacent normal zzso were obtained at surgery from two patients with typical zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed two zzso zzso species with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were much more abundant than those in the normal zzso from the two patients, suggesting that the zzso in normal adrenal tissue is either suppressed by cortisol excess or the absence of zzso To examine the mechanism involved in zzso zzso regulation, the changes in the zzso zzso caused by zzso were studied in zzso zzso Administration of zzso for 5 days resulted in a marked decrease in zzso zzso to an zzso zzso A zzso administration of zzso zzso or zzso zzso to the zzso rat did not cause any significant change in zzso zzso from zzso to 12 h after the zzso However, a significant increase in the zzso zzso was observed at 24 h after the zzso and the level was further increased until 48 h followed by a sustained increase at 72 h when it was given once every 24 zzso These data suggest that the zzso is increased by zzso at a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
