Animal zzso is one of the major constraints of livestock industry in developing zzso In the present study, prevalence of zzso zzso was assessed in the blood of zzso camels zzso zzso brought to Al zzso zzso Cairo, Egypt, by mouse zzso test out of 84 tested zzso 4 animals zzso were zzso zzso analysis was achieved by zzso amplification and sequence analysis of part of zzso zzso gene including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite the zzso nature of zzso region, ITS region showed obvious zzso compared to analogous sequences in zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso showed variable repertoire in the studied zzso which may indicate to a novel structure of zzso zzso population from Egypt and/or a difference in host zzso Furthermore, analysis of variable surface zzso zzso zzso gene marker revealed some zzso at this gene zzso To our knowledge, this is the first molecular analysis of zzso zzso in zzso
