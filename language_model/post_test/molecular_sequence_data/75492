The envelope protein of human zzso virus zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso and zzso zzso to a zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso site was removed by zzso zzso and replaced with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be indistinguishable from zzso zzso when analyzed at the level of zzso zzso zzso processing, protein zzso and viral zzso However, the zzso zzso was not zzso and the zzso zzso were biologically zzso until and unless they were exposed to limiting zzso of zzso As is the case for other enveloped zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso envelope protein and release of a unique zzso domain appear to be necessary for the full expression of viral zzso
