A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso was isolated by zzso zzso zzso The zzso exhibited growth rates on L zzso and minimal medium zzso plates similar to those of the parent strain zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso on all host plants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was not impaired in attachment ability to carrot zzso The zzso had one zzso of zzso in its zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was shown to be due to the zzso zzso in the zzso by the marker exchange zzso A zzso target zzso segment zzso zzso which included the site of zzso was cloned and zzso Two open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso DNA zzso zzso was inserted in the middle of zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso gene into the zzso zzso strain zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso search found no genes zzso to zzso although it had some similarity to the open reading frame downstream of the zzso gene on the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso gene identified in this study seems to be a new zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso
