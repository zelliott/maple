The zzso zzso zzso gene regulates the transition between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for cells to exit the cell cycle and undergo zzso The zzso zzso interaction trap was used to identify protein partners for zzso Here we report the identification of one of these, zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso a zzso protein with zzso to the beta zzso of zzso G zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso although its function remains zzso In zzso cells, zzso physically associates with some signal zzso zzso including zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso cells containing a zzso zzso zzso are viable but cell cycle zzso zzso cells fail to accumulate in zzso when starved of zzso This leads to defects in zzso and zzso zzso studies show that although zzso and zzso zzso physically associate, zzso does not alter zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Using a zzso zzso fusion to green fluorescent zzso we show that zzso of the zzso is impaired in zzso zzso Thus, in parallel with the proposed role of zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso may function as an zzso protein for zzso zzso zzso All defects associated with loss of zzso are reversed in cells expressing zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso and zzso gene products are indeed functional zzso
