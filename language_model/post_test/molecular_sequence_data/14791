The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide and threatens to shorten zzso zzso insulin action in peripheral zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso in zzso tissue through the zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso tissue zzso expression or function regulate systemic insulin zzso zzso of human and mouse zzso tissue zzso occurs early in diabetes zzso Here we report that zzso tissue zzso regulates the expression of zzso protein zzso also known as zzso a zzso regulator of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin zzso We find a new mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of a novel, potent zzso zzso that is transcribed from an alternative zzso zzso expression in human zzso tissue predicts insulin sensitivity, indicating that it may be an effective target for treating zzso
