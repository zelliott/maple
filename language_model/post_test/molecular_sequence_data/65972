Wood cells, unlike most other cells in plants, grow by a unique combination of intrusive and zzso zzso zzso grow in diameter by diffuse zzso growth, but they zzso solely by intrusive zzso growth penetrating the zzso middle zzso that zzso neighboring cells zzso In contrast, vessel elements grow in diameter by a combination of intrusive and zzso zzso We demonstrate that an abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso of hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a negative regulator of both zzso and intrusive growth of developing wood zzso When zzso expression was zzso and zzso in transgenic zzso trees, the zzso activity in zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso removes zzso zzso groups from zzso zzso and transgenic trees had modified zzso zzso patterns, as demonstrated by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso revealed changes in zzso zzso in transgenic trees that were specifically localized in expanding wood zzso The results show that en block zzso of zzso by zzso zzso both zzso growth and intrusive zzso zzso is therefore involved in mechanisms determining fiber zzso and length in the wood of zzso zzso
