To study zzso bacteria isolated from zzso Bay and their molecular zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso and 49 zzso bacterial zzso from surface seawater of zzso Bay were selected for zzso More than zzso of these zzso were resistant to zzso Half of the zzso bacteria zzso the zzso gene pair, and six zzso carried zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso plasmids containing the zzso gene cluster were characterized in two environmental zzso coli zzso zzso zzso was first identified on a zzso zzso zzso which also carried zzso zzso and zzso genes responsible for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso to zzso and zzso or zzso was found with high zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to the wide distribution and spread of the zzso gene pair in zzso zzso The detection of zzso zzso zzso from zzso Bay seawater bacteria and human bacterial pathogens from USA indicates its global dissemination and transmission, across different components of the zzso on zzso 

zzso resistance can be recognized as an important zzso of environmental quality, zzso to its association with anthropogenic pollution and the zzso zzso
