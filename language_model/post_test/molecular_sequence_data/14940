Since the discovery of the zzso responsible for initiating the Alzheimer's zzso cascade as a novel zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso huge efforts have been devoted to an understanding of its biology and structure in the subsequent zzso This has paid off in many respects, as it has been zzso its structure zzso novel zzso zzso of the zzso discovered, and numerous zzso of its activity developed in a relatively short space of zzso The zzso of zzso activity in zzso remains one of the most viable strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, although progress in getting zzso to the clinic has been slow, partly as a consequence of its zzso zzso character, which poses considerable problems for the production of zzso selective and zzso zzso This review reflects on the development of zzso biology and chemistry to date, highlighting the diverse and innovative strategies applied to the zzso of its activity at the molecular and cellular zzso
