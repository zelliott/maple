zzso studies of zzso zzso have provided reasonable knowledge of the rules determining zzso zzso This knowledge can be used to stabilize proteins against chemical and zzso zzso This has been done in two zzso the zzso protein from zzso coli, zzso Y (a 129 zzso zzso parallel protein with five zzso which shows an accumulating intermediate during zzso and the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso (a 81 zzso alpha + beta protein domain, with two zzso which follows a two-state zzso As the introduced stabilizing interactions are local in nature, the energy balance between the contribution of local and zzso interactions changes zzso Recent theoretical analyses of protein folding using simplified models have indicated that zzso of folding speed requires this balance to be biased towards zzso zzso To determine whether this is the case, we study here the folding zzso of two zzso zzso in which zzso 1 zzso zzso or 2 zzso zzso has been stabilized through local zzso as well as the equilibrium and kinetic zzso of a double zzso zzso in which both zzso have been zzso 

The stability of zzso is considerably enhanced with respect to wild type zzso and this zzso can be considered as a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso parameters obtained by chemical zzso zzso and zzso show that zzso is approximately zzso zzso zzso more stable than zzso The effects on folding zzso are different in each of the single zzso zzso shows very little effect in zzso while its unfolding is greatly zzso with respect to zzso zzso shows, together with a zzso in zzso a significant acceleration in zzso As with equilibrium zzso the zzso of the double zzso can be explained by the simple addition of the effects found in each single zzso Interestingly enough, the zzso slope zzso in zzso zzso and zzso is smaller than in the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso can be zzso in some cases, by increasing zzso native local zzso The balance between local and zzso interactions can be significantly changed in some proteins and still keep a cooperative unfolding transition similar to that of the wild zzso The introduction of zzso local interactions by zzso redesign can also be used to increase the folding speed of certain zzso showing that not all proteins in nature have been zzso for rapid zzso contrary to what has been theoretically zzso This zzso is probably also shared by other zzso with highly zzso zzso zzso All these phenomena have been shown zzso in zzso by zzso that increase zzso zzso However, the effects promoted for such an approach in proteins with residual structure and/or zzso in the zzso ensemble could be zzso This has been shown by experiments performed on zzso in which the zzso of the folding process was greatly zzso
