In this study, DNA binding and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were compared with their zzso zzso determined using indirect zzso zzso Following zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were rapidly zzso into the nucleus and displayed a zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and DNA binding of both zzso and zzso However, nuclear zzso of only zzso but not zzso was zzso This selective nuclear zzso appears to be zzso via the zzso sequences in zzso Furthermore, zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso but did not block zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the induction of a zzso zzso reporter zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso by zzso may occur by a mechanism distinct from that employed in zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, resulting in the selective nuclear zzso of zzso
