A zzso study was carried out on strain zzso which was isolated from an zzso bacterial zzso enriched by the surface seawater from around the zzso zzso The isolate was zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Growth was observed at zzso from zzso to 15 % and at temperatures from 4 to 37 zzso the strain was unable to degrade gelatin or to reduce zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso with the highest sequence similarity zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso while the similarities to other species examined were all below zzso The principal fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso and summed feature 8 zzso : zzso The major zzso of strain zzso was zzso The major polar lipids of strain zzso were zzso and zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The combined zzso and zzso data show that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
