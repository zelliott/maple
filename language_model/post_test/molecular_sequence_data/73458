To investigate the importance of the zzso virus zzso zzso 110 zzso tail domain in the zzso zzso of zzso and virus zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso of 16 zzso acids from the zzso tail resulted in zzso zzso zzso which was indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso whereas deletion of either 41 or 56 zzso acids from the zzso tail of zzso resulted in loss of retention of zzso in the zzso zzso and nuclear zzso None of the zzso zzso zzso was able to complement zzso zzso cell lines in transformation zzso indicating the importance of the zzso tail domain in virus zzso zzso In electron zzso analysis, no zzso or enveloped viruses were detected in zzso zzso cell lines induced for zzso zzso
