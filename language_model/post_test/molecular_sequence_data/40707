The availability of highly variable markers for the partners of a zzso zzso enables the integrated investigation of ecological and evolutionary processes at the symbiotic zzso In this article we analyze the specificity of the first and to date only zzso markers that had been developed for an zzso zzso zzso zzso We used DNA extracts from cultures of the zzso and of the green zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as total DNA extracts from related zzso species associated with the same zzso partner, and got evidence that five of the previously described zzso zzso proposed to be zzso are indeed zzso zzso highly variable zzso primer sets available for both, the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are now at our hands, which allow us to investigate so far unexplored biological processes of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso In a broader sense, our work evaluates and discusses the challenges in developing zzso molecular markers for zzso forming close associations with other zzso
