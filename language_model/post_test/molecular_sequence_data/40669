zzso of the zzso context for members of the zzso zzso family zzso such as the protein zzso by the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that 13 of them are zzso with genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that is involved in microbial methane zzso Here, the first crystal structures from zzso are zzso representing two bacterial and one zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso contain two zzso an zzso zzso zzso core domain zzso consisting of a zzso mixed zzso flanked by several zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso on the other hand, is composed solely of the zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso is best characterized as a zzso zinc zzso Two significant structural differences between zzso and zzso involve their metal zzso First, zinc is bound to the putative active site on the zzso of zzso but is absent from the zzso of zzso Second, whereas the structure of the zzso of zzso shows four zzso side chains within coordination distance of the zzso zzso the structure of zzso is zzso for a zzso zinc finger in that three zzso side chains and an zzso side chain are within coordination distance of the zzso
