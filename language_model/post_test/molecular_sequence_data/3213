Adjustment of the synthesis of abundant protein to the requirements of the cell involves processes critical to the zzso of energy zzso The regulation of zzso genes might be a good model for such processes because expression must be controlled, such that the zzso proteins exactly cover the surface of the zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso sap and zzso zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso We report that the production and surface zzso of zzso and zzso are under zzso control, suggesting that an exponential phase zzso zzso is subsequently replaced by a stationary phase zzso zzso This switch is controlled at the zzso zzso sap is most certainly transcribed by zzso zzso containing zzso whereas zzso expression depends on zzso More importantly, zzso is required for the zzso control of zzso and zzso is involved in strict feedback regulation of zzso This control may be direct because both zzso proteins zzso in zzso the zzso promoter, specifically suggesting that they might act as zzso zzso
