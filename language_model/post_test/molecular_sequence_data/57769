zzso receptors on B and T zzso zzso signals by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso A family of zzso zzso contains zzso insert regions with the sequence zzso (where X is any zzso zzso that when zzso mediate the binding and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso membrane protein of B cells enhances zzso through membrane zzso M zzso and was found to contain a functional analog of the zzso insert zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso of zzso and association with zzso zzso Thus, zzso serves as a surrogate zzso insert region for zzso by providing the means for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso
