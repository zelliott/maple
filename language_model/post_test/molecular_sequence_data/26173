A zzso procedure for analysis of zzso parameters in dynamic structure of DNA is zzso The performance of the procedure is illustrated by analysis of a 20 zzso dynamics simulation of the zzso zzso zzso which is a part of DNA from zzso zzso The dynamics trajectory of the duplex shows zzso fluctuations of zzso zzso
