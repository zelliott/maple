zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat brain and liver, referred to as zzso and zzso respectively, were isolated and zzso The zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso of which the deduced zzso acid sequence matched partial zzso acid sequences directly determined for peptides generated by zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso When expressed in zzso coli, these zzso produced zzso zzso activity and zzso proteins with molecular masses similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These expressed proteins and zzso activity were zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso had 84 and zzso identity with zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso However, the zzso of the former zzso which contained the zzso coding region of zzso was entirely different from the corresponding region of zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso may be generated by alternative use of zzso of the same zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was expressed zzso in the rat brain and zzso whereas its expression in the liver was zzso by treatment with the zzso zzso This study demonstrated the molecular diversity of zzso and suggested the presence of zzso mechanisms to regulate the zzso gene zzso
