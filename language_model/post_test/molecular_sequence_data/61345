The zzso DNA zzso is the most commonly used zzso in DNA zzso However, all versions of zzso zzso are deficient in two zzso zzso these zzso incorporate each of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso at widely different rates during sequencing zzso for example, is incorporated 10 times faster than the other three zzso and zzso these zzso show uneven zzso or zzso patterns in zzso or zzso DNA sequence profiles, zzso We have determined the crystal structures of all four zzso closed zzso complexes of the large zzso of the zzso DNA zzso zzso The zzso complex structure differs from the other three zzso complex structures by a large shift in the position of the side chain of zzso zzso in the O zzso resulting in additional hydrogen bonds being formed between the zzso group of this zzso and the base of zzso When zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso has a marked and selective reduction in zzso incorporation zzso As a result, the G track generated during DNA sequencing by these zzso zzso zzso does not terminate zzso and higher zzso G bands are zzso Another property of these zzso zzso zzso is that the sequencing patterns produced by these zzso are remarkably even in zzso and zzso distribution, thus resulting in a significant improvement in the accuracy of DNA zzso
