We have selected zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso B cell zzso that are negative on the cell surface for one or both zzso zzso The molecular analysis of two such independently selected cell lines, zzso and zzso is reported zzso This analysis revealed that the genes zzso Ad beta zzso and Ed beta zzso contained identical zzso transitions that resulted in the substitution of zzso zzso for zzso zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 1 zzso This conservative substitution caused a zzso zzso of I-A or zzso molecules in the respective cell line although predicted zzso analysis suggests a minimal effect on protein zzso Thus, the zzso appears to have either created a negative signal that stops transport or eliminated a positive signal that is required for transport and targeting to the cell zzso
