zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso complementary zzso was cloned from the zzso of the giant freshwater prawn zzso zzso using zzso zzso and a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Both zzso and zzso were isolated by the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence revealed that the zzso clone has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso including a zzso signal zzso The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein zzso zzso was zzso zzso with an estimated zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence contains zzso three putative zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso site, zzso four protein zzso C zzso sites, zzso four zzso zzso II zzso sites, and zzso a putative recognition zzso zzso comparison showed that the deduced zzso acids of zzso of zzso zzso had overall similarities of zzso to those of known zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso The zzso transcript of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso but was zzso in the zzso when injected with zzso and zzso after 12 zzso The zzso zzso zzso expression of prawns in the zzso stage was significantly zzso in zzso but zzso in the zzso which revealed a complementary relationship between zzso and the zzso in the zzso zzso
