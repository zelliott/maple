zzso zzso factors (or zzso zzso bind to zzso elements found in the promoters of many plant zzso Although the binding specificity and the zzso activity of some members zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso the regulatory function of this family of zzso factors remains largely zzso In this work, we have zzso a new zzso factor, namely zzso and a closely related member, zzso We show that zzso they can form either zzso or zzso but do not interact with zzso zzso they are predominantly expressed in floral buds and zzso zzso zzso cannot bind to the binding sites of zzso or zzso but binds to the zzso and zzso gene promoters via the zzso zzso which has been previously shown to be the core of the Site 1 type of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso belong to a distinct zzso of zzso factors and that each zzso of zzso factors binds to a functionally distinct type of zzso zzso zzso
