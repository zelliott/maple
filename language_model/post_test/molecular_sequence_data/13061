The human and rat zzso of a novel zzso zzso with unique structural features were cloned by zzso chain reaction amplification and zzso library zzso Their deduced zzso acid sequences are highly zzso zzso identical zzso zzso zzso identical zzso within the coding zzso and comprise all six of the zzso motifs presumably involved in zzso zzso Because the sequences exhibit some similarity with members of the zzso factor zzso family zzso identity with zzso factor 1 zzso zzso identity with zzso zzso the protein was designated zzso zzso zzso In contrast to all other members of the zzso family, zzso lacks the zzso site at position 2 and comprises an zzso of 8 zzso acids in the region between zzso and zzso zzso was found in most rat zzso examined zzso muscle, fat, liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso against zzso zzso showed a zzso protein in zzso from rat liver, zzso and zzso Thus, the protein appears to be zzso modified for membrane zzso Unlike zzso the zzso zzso was detected in plasma zzso but not in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited specific and zzso zzso gamma S zzso zzso binding and, unlike zzso zzso zzso activity in the absence of tissue extracts or zzso Thus, the structural and functional characteristics of zzso indicate that it represents a novel zzso of zzso presumably exerting a unique function and possibly involved in plasma zzso signaling zzso
