zzso true zzso having zzso and alkaline stability are highly attractive for their industrial production of zzso zzso cosmetics, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remains active at temperatures zzso with an optimum temperature of zzso and an optimum pH of zzso stable over a range of zzso zzso understanding of the structure and insight into the activity of such zzso would aid in engineering zzso that would function in the desired extreme industrial zzso In the present study, we carried out in zzso characterization and structural modeling of zzso which is zzso alkaline and zzso zzso of zzso with other zzso zzso indicates that zzso is a true zzso having the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso and the calcium binding site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Conservation in sequence implies that zzso zzso mechanism is possible in zzso with the lid formed by zzso zzso zzso and loop zzso zzso Three zzso zzso structure model of zzso has been predicted for the first time and aims at understanding its function and zzso characteristics of possessing relatively high zzso and pH zzso
