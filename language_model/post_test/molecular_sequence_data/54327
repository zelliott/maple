The existence of direct zzso actions on zzso zzso to stimulate zzso is not widely acknowledged because it has only been demonstrated in members of the family zzso In the present study, zzso stimulation of zzso zzso was investigated in a zzso southern flounder, and the potential role of membrane zzso zzso alpha zzso or zzso in zzso this action was zzso The major zzso produced in zzso by zzso zzso fragments zzso with zzso zzso during zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with 5 zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso in zzso whereas zzso and other steroids were zzso A single class of high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sites zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso was identified on zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso suggesting the zzso zzso couples to a G zzso The membrane zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso activates zzso G zzso Finally, zzso zzso was cloned and characterized from zzso zzso The zzso protein is expressed on the zzso of zzso zzso and is more abundant in individuals with high zzso zzso than low zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso stimulates zzso zzso in zzso through zzso of zzso G zzso likely through zzso The finding that zzso directly stimulate zzso zzso in a zzso a highly derived species not belonging to the zzso family zzso suggests this phenomenon is widespread among advanced zzso
