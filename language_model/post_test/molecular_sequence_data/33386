The proteins found in tears have an important role in the maintenance of the zzso surface and changes in the quality and quantity of tear components reflect changes in the health of the zzso zzso In this study, we have used quantitative zzso zzso technology coupled with zzso and with a statistical model to uncover proteins that are significantly and reliably changed in the tears of dry eye patients in an effort to reveal potential zzso zzso zzso patients with dry eye and 40 healthy subjects were recruited for this zzso In total, 93 tear proteins were identified with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Associated with dry eye were 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso A8 zzso zzso zzso A9 zzso B), zzso A4 and zzso A11 zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso operating zzso zzso were evaluated for individual zzso candidates and a zzso zzso With the use of a zzso zzso panel, the diagnostic accuracy for dry eye was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso candidates zzso and zzso zzso generated from zzso experiments were successfully verified using an zzso zzso The levels of these 10 tear proteins reflect zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso inflammatory status of the zzso zzso The clinical zzso of the severity of the dry eye condition was successfully correlated to the zzso by using three proteins that are associated with zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso A8 and zzso zzso The nine tear protein zzso candidates (except zzso zzso 1) were also verified using an independent zzso patient sample zzso This study demonstrated that zzso technology combined with zzso quantitative zzso is a powerful tool for zzso zzso
