zzso breast cancer is a rapidly growing, distinct form of locally advanced breast cancer that carries a guarded zzso To identify the genes that contribute to this aggressive zzso we compared zzso and zzso sequences in an inflammatory breast tumor cell line with those of actively replicating normal human zzso zzso cell lines using differential zzso Of the 17 transcripts isolated and characterized from these experiments, zzso of zzso zzso and loss of expression of a novel gene on zzso zzso zzso in inflammatory breast zzso were highly correlated zzso and zzso zzso with the inflammatory zzso when a panel of archival inflammatory breast zzso was compared with zzso stage III breast zzso by in zzso zzso This study suggests two new molecular markers specific for inflammatory breast zzso
