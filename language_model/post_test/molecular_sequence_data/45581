zzso is an zzso capable of infecting and replicating in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso virus particles consist of an inner zzso surrounded by a zzso zzso zzso which in turn is surrounded by a protein shell consisting of the E1 and zzso zzso While a zzso of the E1 zzso has been structurally zzso the amount of structural data on the zzso zzso is considerably zzso In this study, the organization of the zzso zzso was zzso by surface zzso of intact zzso The virus remained fully zzso demonstrating that the zzso did not alter the zzso of the proteins involved in zzso Seven sites of modification were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while one site of modification in the E1 zzso zzso was identified, confirming that the E1 protein is almost completely buried in the virus zzso
