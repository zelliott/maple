Many applications required protein zzso We routinely use zzso proteins to select single chain zzso from zzso and/or zzso display zzso During zzso selection the zzso zzso are bound to zzso coupled magnetic zzso while during zzso display, the zzso zzso are used during flow zzso for both analysis and zzso The zzso zzso zzso a rapid straightforward zzso kit that avoids the need for dialysis, is particularly useful when the amount of available protein is zzso During routine screening of zzso libraries we identified a specific clone that bound a universal zzso generated only when zzso are zzso with the commercial zzso zzso with an affinity of zzso zzso zzso and those zzso using alternative methods - the zzso Fisher commercial kit or in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso et zzso 2004) - were not recognized by this zzso Using deep sequence analysis, the specific zzso was identified as being the most abundant in a number of different zzso This indicates the need for caution when using such zzso zzso because of the possibility of selecting zzso against the zzso rather than the target zzso and also highlights the value of deep sequencing analysis during display based zzso Furthermore, this zzso may have great utility in the analysis of proteins zzso using this zzso
