zzso brain zzso zzso have only rarely been zzso for zzso heavy chain zzso zzso In this study, DNA was extracted from zzso blocks in 23 cases of zzso and examined for zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify the zzso region III zzso of rearranged zzso zzso Fifteen of the cases were zzso on zzso tissue using a zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The remaining eight cases were not zzso for lack of zzso For comparison, we used DNA extracted from zzso blocks of normal brain, zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products were examined by zzso gel zzso Among the ten zzso zzso four had a pattern indicative of zzso zzso one had a zzso pattern, and five had no zzso zzso zzso Among the five zzso zzso one had a zzso pattern and four had no zzso zzso Among the eight zzso zzso two had zzso zzso four had a zzso pattern, and two gave no zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso gave a consistent zzso pattern, while DNA from zzso zzso populations zzso zzso had a pattern of zzso zzso zzso In a dilution study, a zzso zzso could be detected as long as the zzso DNA constituted at least 10 per cent of the total zzso zzso to amplify zzso can be successfully applied to DNA extracted from zzso blocks, and it detected a zzso zzso in 50 per cent of cases that gave a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
