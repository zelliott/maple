zzso of zzso zzso genes zzso requires binding of the zzso zzso complex zzso to zzso that is complementary to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso folds into a zzso zzso structure that is required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that disrupt the zzso structure impair binding of zzso the large zzso of zzso to zzso and abolish targeting of zzso to zzso zzso to zzso results in a zzso change of zzso as shown by enhanced sensitivity of zzso towards zzso zzso Our results indicate an zzso mechanism that targets zzso to zzso and zzso the interaction with zzso that promote zzso formation and zzso zzso
