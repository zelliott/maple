Early region zzso zzso of human zzso zzso has been the focus of over 30 years of investigation and is required for the zzso capacity of zzso in zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso transcript generates zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso is particularly interesting due to the unique properties it displays relative to all other zzso zzso zzso zzso does not contain any of the zzso regions zzso present in the other zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso protein contains a unique sequence compared to all other zzso zzso which results from a zzso generated by alternative zzso The zzso zzso protein is thought to be produced zzso at the late stages of zzso Here we report the first study to directly investigate the function of the species C zzso zzso zzso protein during zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso have been generated that are capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso can also detect zzso zzso zzso by zzso and indirect zzso zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso is expressed late and is localized to the zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso was able to activate the expression of viral genes during infection and could also promote productive replication of species C zzso zzso zzso was also found to interact with the zzso component of the zzso and zzso of zzso was zzso to viral replication dependent on zzso zzso
