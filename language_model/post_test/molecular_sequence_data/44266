zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso terminal zzso and functions as a zzso zzso pump in the zzso respiratory chain of zzso zzso On the basis of deletion and chemical zzso analyses on zzso IV, we proposed that zzso IV is essential for zzso binding to zzso I and that it is present in a zzso between zzso I and III zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To extend previous studies, we carried out zzso zzso for selected zzso acid zzso in zzso IV to explore zzso interactions in zzso zzso zzso We found that only the replacement of zzso in zzso III resulted in the reduction of the zzso activity but that this did not significantly affect the zzso zzso properties and the copper zzso This suggests that individual zzso acid zzso including the six zzso zzso are not enough to alter such properties of the metal zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated for the zzso zzso Ala zzso of zzso IV and identified as zzso zzso in zzso zzso and VIII in zzso zzso These observations provide further support for specific interactions of zzso IV with zzso zzso and/or VIII, the zzso binding domain, of zzso I and suggest that zzso IV functions as a zzso molecular zzso in the zzso zzso
