We describe here the cloning of mouse complementary zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso neural cell zzso zzso zzso with a predicted zzso region of five zzso zzso zzso followed by two zzso type III zzso Alternative zzso is likely to generate two zzso zzso which are differently attached to the cell zzso These structural features and overall sequence identity identify this protein as a novel member of a cell zzso zzso zzso together with zzso neural cell zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In insects, zzso II is present on a restricted subset of embryonic central nervous system zzso where it controls selective zzso zzso zzso zzso likewise is expressed in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso defined zzso zzso The spatial expression zzso zzso precisely to that of certain zzso zzso expression zones of the zzso zzso These expression patterns thus render zzso the first described cell zzso zzso with a potential regulatory role in formation of selective zzso projections important for zzso sensory information zzso
