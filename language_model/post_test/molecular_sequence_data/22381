zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso cell behavior in zzso and during development, zzso immune response and tumor growth of adult zzso in zzso In zzso these proteins are a major component of cortical rods in mature zzso A zzso of a zzso gene was generated by screening a zzso zzso library constructed from the zzso of Chinese shrimp, zzso zzso The full length zzso zzso zzso of zzso was cloned by zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso and zzso The complete zzso zzso named zzso is zzso zzso and the open reading frame of the zzso encodes a zzso protein that contains three zzso zzso an zzso domain, a zzso domain and a common zzso zzso zzso The protein shares a high sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The expression and distribution of zzso in both challenged and unchallenged zzso were studied by Northern zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso transcripts were detected in the zzso heart, zzso stomach and zzso of both challenged and unchallenged zzso but the signal was much stronger in the challenged zzso A strong zzso signal was detected only in challenged zzso with no signal in the unchallenged zzso The zzso showed that the zzso was detected in both challenged and unchallenged zzso including the zzso heart, zzso stomach, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Except for the zzso and zzso the signal of challenged zzso was relatively stronger than that of unchallenged ones, especially in zzso These results suggest that the zzso was zzso in the zzso heart, zzso and stomach of challenged shrimp, and induced in the zzso of challenged zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the defense responses of the zzso
