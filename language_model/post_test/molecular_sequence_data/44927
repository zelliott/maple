The zzso and zzso alpha zzso of the signal recognition particle zzso and the zzso zzso zzso undergo a tightly coupled zzso cycle that mediates the signal zzso attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso alpha are in the empty site zzso prior to contact between the zzso complex and the zzso zzso Cooperative binding of zzso to zzso and zzso alpha zzso the zzso complex and zzso signal sequence transfer from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso perform distinct roles, with zzso alpha performing a zzso role in complex zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso alpha is a prerequisite for zzso of the zzso zzso
