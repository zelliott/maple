The zzso leukemia line zzso can be terminally differentiated in zzso to either zzso or zzso We used this cell line to test whether the state of differentiation of a cell changes its response to zzso zzso The characteristics of expression of several zzso and zzso genes in zzso and differentiated zzso cells were zzso zzso an zzso zzso was induced similarly in three cell types, whereas another zzso zzso zzso was induced strongly only in zzso zzso In contrast, two zzso of zzso were induced better in differentiated cells in response to either zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were induced much more strongly in zzso than in zzso or in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using the zzso response element of gene zzso and nuclear extracts of zzso cells revealed the appearance of one complex and the disappearance of another one, zzso with differentiation of the cells to zzso These observations suggest that expression of zzso genes in zzso cells is regulated by zzso factors whose activity changes with the state of differentiation of the zzso Our study may have implications in the optimal clinical use of zzso zzso cellular differentiation may augment the efficacy of zzso as zzso zzso
