Two types of zzso zzso viruses zzso expressing the zzso gene of the human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso were reported zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso the authentic zzso zzso In the other zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was inserted within the signal sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso so that the reading frame for the zzso gene was in phase with that for the zzso zzso Comparative studies were performed on the mode of expression and processing of the zzso proteins in relation to their zzso In zzso cells, translation was initiated exclusively from the initiation zzso of the zzso to produce zzso the zzso zzso zzso including the altered zzso signal zzso Both this altered zzso signal zzso and the zzso zzso signal zzso functioned as zzso signals for the zzso zzso Although about half of the nascent zzso protein was zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signal zzso to produce the authentic zzso zzso the other half was zzso at the zzso zzso of the altered zzso signal zzso alone to zzso the zzso zzso These events led to a less efficient transport of the zzso protein produced by zzso from the rough zzso zzso to the zzso apparatus than that of the authentic zzso protein zzso by zzso The efficiency of the processing and transport of the zzso protein affected the zzso of these two zzso zzso
