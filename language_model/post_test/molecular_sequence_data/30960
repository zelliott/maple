The production of zzso human zzso zzso began with a search for the gene coding for human zzso zzso Two zzso pools of zzso zzso were zzso based on zzso acid sequence information obtained from human urinary zzso Each probe, consisting of complex zzso of 128 short synthetic sequences of DNA, was used to search a human zzso library for clones containing the human EPO gene zzso To verify that the isolated clones contained the complete functional gene zzso human EPO, these sequences were expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells, and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and compared with the human urinary hormone using a variety of different zzso zzso of these studies indicate that zzso is virtually indistinguishable from human urinary EPO in its zzso and zzso zzso It is a zzso acid protein whose primary sequence is identical to that of zzso zzso The subsequent development of large-scale cell culture and production techniques has made available sufficient amounts of zzso for clinical use in the treatment of the debilitating anemia that almost invariably accompanies chronic zzso zzso
