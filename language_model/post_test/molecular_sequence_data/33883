zzso zzso mobilize their own genes by generating zzso breaks at individual target sites within potential host zzso Because of their high zzso these proteins are used for zzso zzso in higher zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso specificity is quite zzso Here we describe the identification and zzso analysis of over 200 naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural characterization of zzso from one zzso within the zzso tree demonstrates strong conservation of protein structure contrasted against highly zzso DNA target sites and indicates that a significant fraction of these proteins are sufficiently stable and active to serve as engineering zzso This information was exploited to create a targeting zzso to disrupt the zzso zzso zzso B gene in human zzso The ubiquitous presence and diversity of zzso described in this study may facilitate the creation of many tailored zzso for zzso zzso
