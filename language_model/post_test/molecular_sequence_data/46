A zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso was used to generate zzso zzso zzso which were used to determine the zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that zzso can be found in both the nucleus and zzso but is primarily located in the zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses indicated that, during the larvae stage, zzso expression levels are highest in the silk zzso followed by the zzso and are lowest in the fatty zzso Additionally, zzso expression begins during the egg stage, increases during the larvae stage, reaches a peak during the zzso stage, and decreases significantly in the zzso zzso we propose that zzso may play an important role during zzso stage development, especially in the silk zzso
