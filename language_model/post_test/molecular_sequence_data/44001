A zzso was isolated from the culture medium of zzso zzso a zzso fungus that grows on lawn and wheat zzso under the snow in winter and zzso the snow mold zzso zzso acid was a better zzso of this zzso than zzso when the activity was determined by measuring the reducing sugar zzso However, when the activity was measured by zzso change, the zzso of zzso decreased more rapidly than that of zzso zzso The results of zzso change apparently indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a poor zzso as determined by zzso of reducing sugar production and zzso zzso It is suggested from the results that the zzso group of zzso affects the zzso zzso A reaction mechanism was proposed for the zzso zzso zzso mass of this zzso was 40 zzso and its zzso point was pH zzso zzso pH of the zzso reaction was zzso and its optimum temperature was zzso degrees zzso Thirty percent of the maximum activity was observed at 5 degrees C, but it was only slightly active above 60 degrees zzso The activity was preserved for more than 2 years at 5 degrees C and pH zzso but it was lost when kept at room temperature overnight or heated at 50 degrees C for 30 zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso borealis is compared with those of zzso of zzso zzso The function of this zzso against the target plants is discussed with reference to the reaction of zzso of zzso zzso
