Previous reports have demonstrated that the zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein enriched in skeletal muscle and heart, is a major zzso zzso in response to insulin and zzso zzso Here we describe the isolation and characterization of human and rat zzso zzso from the zzso Both zzso proteins share significant zzso and zzso acid sequence and structural similarities with the previously published canine zzso and, to a lesser degree, with zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite the functional diversity, all these proteins are quite small and possess a single zzso zzso Human zzso appears to be a unique gene localized on zzso zzso The zzso zzso is widely distributed in human zzso with the highest expression in skeletal muscle and heart, suggesting a functional role in muscle zzso Like canine zzso both human and rat zzso induce a zzso zzso current when expressed in zzso zzso The high degree of sequence and functional conservation among the zzso zzso proteins indicates that this gene is zzso throughout zzso
