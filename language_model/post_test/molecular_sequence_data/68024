zzso zzso binding to operator DNA and subsequent zzso of the complex was monitored continuously by a zzso measuring surface zzso zzso In this analysis a zzso zzso zzso containing the operator site was immobilized on the sensor surface and zzso protein was passed over the zzso The formation of the zzso complex was specific and could be inhibited by zzso zzso From the association curve, the apparent zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complex was, for the first time for the zzso zzso determined as an zzso reaction and the zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso As a reference, the zzso interaction was analyzed by zzso mobility shift zzso under similar reaction zzso With this method the equilibrium binding constant was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding value calculated from zzso data was zzso zzso zzso zzso
