The bone, zzso and zzso of the mature individual are comprised from a dense zzso fiber network into which the zzso mineral phase is zzso It is hypothesized that a set of zzso zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso zzso These proteins then interact specifically with the collagen and zzso zzso formation on and within the zzso These zzso may also regulate the zzso rate of growth, and stability of the mineral phase zzso The zzso zzso zzso may thus be considered as the crucial regulators of zzso and tissue zzso In the zzso system, these regulatory proteins are zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso different from the collagen zzso zzso zzso occurs as the regulatory proteins are deposited on the zzso zzso This model requires testing in the bone zzso In zzso in the absence of tissue zzso the resident zzso are zzso in zzso over time, perhaps changing the properties of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso pathways and retention of integrity within the zzso are thus important areas for further zzso
