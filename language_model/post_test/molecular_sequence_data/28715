A full-length zzso clone of an zzso virus zzso strain zzso isolated from aborted zzso fetus was constructed and zzso zzso comparison showed more than zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence identity with two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso zzso sequence showed only about zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso of this zzso clone was infectious upon zzso of zzso cells, as shown by zzso effects and identification by zzso test, and by propagation of the virus released into the culture zzso The transcript zzso led to the production of infectious particles despite the presence of two zzso zzso zzso at the zzso end, the short zzso tract zzso the short zzso tail zzso and the presence of six zzso zzso at the 3' zzso The rescued virus was also found to be highly zzso for mice by zzso zzso producing a fatal disease indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso An important finding concerning the molecular basis of zzso was that the in zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript is zzso although it contains a very short zzso The availability of the infectious zzso clone of the zzso failure strain of zzso should prove to be useful for studying the molecular basis of the zzso of zzso in zzso
