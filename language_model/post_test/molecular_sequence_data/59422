A zzso and a gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso were isolated, and were cloned for the first zzso Two zzso zzso which were zzso based on the partial zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso were used to screen a zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso A single open reading frame, consisting of zzso was found to zzso a zzso that comprised a zzso acid signal zzso and zzso acid mature zzso All the partial zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso were discovered in the deduced zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso had similar sequences to those of zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso was also isolated and zzso The same zzso with zzso clone as zzso There were no zzso in the zzso zzso
