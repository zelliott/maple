zzso which stimulates the zzso of zzso from anterior zzso cells, is a zzso of the zzso of zzso Two species of zzso (A and zzso have been zzso from zzso zzso fluid and zzso We have been able to zzso produce zzso human zzso A by constructing stable cell lines expressing the zzso for the beta A zzso of human zzso These cell lines zzso a 24 zzso beta A zzso which zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso The ability of this protein to stimulate zzso zzso was sensitive to reduction of zzso bonds, exhibited a slow onset of action, and was blocked by zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data show that zzso zzso A has the zzso properties and biological activities that have been ascribed to native zzso zzso In addition, these results provide an independent confirmation, and thereby a final proof, of the structure and function of zzso
