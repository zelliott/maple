zzso zzso a class zzso zzso with strong zzso activity, is produced by zzso zzso zzso To express a zzso version of zzso zzso we constructed a synthetic gene that encodes the mature zzso zzso zzso and then zzso the gene in zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso promoter in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso fusion protein with zzso and accumulated in the cell zzso in a soluble zzso active zzso The fusion protein was then zzso and zzso to obtain zzso zzso folded zzso zzso zzso per 20 zzso of zzso This paper describes the first design of a synthetic zzso gene and the first zzso expressed in the zzso coli zzso
