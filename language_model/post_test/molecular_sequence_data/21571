zzso are zzso inherited zzso well known for inducing a variety of zzso abnormalities in the diverse zzso hosts they zzso Despite their zzso zzso lifestyle which usually protects bacteria from zzso infection, zzso harbor a widespread temperate zzso called zzso zzso of horizontal zzso transfers indicate that this zzso could promote genetic exchanges between strains leading to evolutionary changes in the zzso of zzso and could be involved in the zzso these bacteria zzso In this study, we report the survey of zzso and zzso zzso infections in 20 populations of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso collected from different geographic regions of zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso is associated with positive zzso fitness effects in this zzso zzso chain reaction using the zzso gene zzso for a zzso cell division protein and the zzso zzso protein gene of the zzso showed that all flies checked were infected by zzso and its zzso zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso surface protein gene revealed zzso of double infections by the zzso zzso A and zzso These results can serve as a valuable basis for understanding the evolution of zzso bacteria and may provide information about the dynamics of zzso zzso This knowledge could be exploited for the use of zzso for effective control strategies of the zzso a serious menace of the zzso zzso zzso
