The zzso domain zzso mediates zzso zzso interactions that assemble large zzso signaling complexes such as the zzso during innate immune zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso demonstrate that their zzso bundle folds belong to the zzso zzso whereas such studies have not been reported for other zzso Here, the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso was identified that contains an zzso zzso domain and a zzso domain typical of the zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso domain and a zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso The structure of the zzso zzso as a fusion with zzso protein was determined at zzso zzso zzso This revealed a zzso bundle fold similar to the zzso zzso structure with the bent zzso zzso typical of all known zzso zzso The zzso zzso surface contains a positively charged patch near its zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso charged patch near its zzso zzso and zzso zzso which may mediate its interaction with partner zzso Further studies using binding zzso and other analyses will be required in order to address the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso
