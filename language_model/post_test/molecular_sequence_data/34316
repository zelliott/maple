The blind subterranean mole rat zzso zzso zzso is a model animal for survival under extreme environments due to its ability to live in underground zzso under severe hypoxic stress and zzso Here we report the zzso sequencing of zzso zzso a zzso type of zzso zzso zzso pools from muscle and brain zzso isolated from animals exposed to hypoxic and zzso conditions were zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Assembly of the sequences yielded over zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso rat or human zzso Based on these results, it was possible to detect large numbers of zzso zzso zzso and novel transcribed zzso In addition, multiple differential expression patterns were detected between zzso and zzso The results presented here will serve as a valuable resource for future studies aimed at identifying genes and gene regions evolved during the zzso radiation associated with underground life of the blind mole zzso
