The zzso zzso zzso contains a region spanning about 14 zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The small and large zzso of the zzso are zzso by the structural genes zzso and zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso are located zzso zzso downstream from zzso and are required for the formation of a zzso active zzso In this study, we determined the zzso sequence of a zzso region immediately upstream from zzso This revealed four additional closely linked zzso which we designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso these genes potentially zzso zzso with predicted masses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This cluster of genes was shown to be essential for zzso activity by zzso zzso using zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of DNA beginning zzso zzso downstream from zzso and including the zzso region, was able to complement zzso and zzso zzso supporting earlier evidence for a promoter downstream from zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso gene products, zzso Of particular interest is the fact that there is no zzso of the zzso gene product in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso had little effect on zzso activity in a strain also carrying a zzso fusion, showing that zzso and zzso are not major factors in regulating the zzso of the zzso structural zzso
