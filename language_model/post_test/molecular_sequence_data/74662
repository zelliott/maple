Several zzso for the zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso are under zzso Although previous studies identified viral resistance zzso there is little information on the natural zzso of zzso from the different viral zzso Here, we aimed to determine both the natural zzso and presence of resistance or zzso zzso to new zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso from worldwide zzso zzso 

A comprehensive analysis was performed in 380 zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso 1; 105 other zzso from public zzso databases zzso and Los zzso zzso acid zzso and signature patterns were deduced in the zzso domain, including all sites associated with resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Few of the zzso in the zzso zzso or in zzso sites were zzso and were identified in only zzso zzso However, a relevant zzso was found in sites associated either with resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, some unique zzso signature patterns associated with resistance to zzso were also zzso 

We describe for the first time the relevant natural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in worldwide zzso Although the prevalence of major resistance zzso is very low, many zzso sites are naturally zzso among zzso from several zzso zzso These data will help to determine whether zzso resistance is likely to be selected with new zzso and will aid the design of zzso resistance zzso
