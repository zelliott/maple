zzso gene is a member of the zzso zzso gene family coding for zzso factors in zzso zzso Its expression pattern was zzso using Northern zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in many zzso but most strongly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and lateral root zzso zzso was induced in leaves and stems following zzso and in root zzso by zzso zzso zzso populations were screened and two zzso zzso were identified, both of which were partially male zzso more than 50% of the zzso grains being distorted in shape and lacking zzso zzso is closely related to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grains were produced in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In an zzso zzso zzso the transcript levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes decreased while the level of the zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso Change in the levels of zzso and zzso expression may influence zzso development by changing the flux along the zzso zzso affecting the composition of the zzso zzso
