Cystic zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso serves as a zzso zzso channel in a wide range of zzso zzso and its dysfunction is a hallmark of zzso Over zzso zzso in the zzso gene are known, but functional data exist only for a minority of the zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to functionally characterize a novel zzso zzso identified in a patient with zzso zzso Full length sequencing of the patient's zzso gene revealed a zzso C to T transition at zzso position 331 zzso which results in a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents were studied using the zzso zzso zzso Channel surface expression was assessed by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in functional zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso expressing the zzso channel averaged only zzso of that in zzso expressing zzso zzso Similarly, surface expression of the zzso channel was zzso In contrast, the zzso did not alter the zzso selectivity of the channel, and Western zzso analysis indicated a similar protein expression level of zzso and zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso channel function by reducing channel surface zzso The mild disease zzso of the patient indicates that the residual function of the zzso channel is sufficient to prevent the development of severe zzso zzso
