We report the first complete zzso sequence zzso base zzso of a biologically active zzso leukemia virus zzso designated zzso (or zzso and the molecular zzso biological activity, and zzso terminal repeat zzso sequence of another zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso component of the zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso and was isolated from tissue DNA of a cat following experimental transmission of naturally occurring zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso clones were derived from a zzso zzso tumor cell zzso Both are unusual relative to other zzso cloned zzso studied to date in their ability to induce zzso in zzso zzso cats and in their failure to induce acute zzso The zzso zzso is organized into zzso zzso the gag and pol open reading frames are separated by an amber zzso and zzso is in a different reading zzso The deduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A isolate of zzso zzso Stewart, zzso zzso zzso Wheeler, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso despite having been isolated from naturally infected cats 6 to 13 years apart and from widely different geographic zzso As a group, their envelope gene sequences differ markedly from those of the zzso zzso B and acutely zzso zzso C zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso to members of a highly zzso family and represent prototypes of the zzso zzso minimally zzso zzso present in all naturally occurring zzso
