The structural gene zzso of the class 4 outer membrane protein of zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The derived zzso acid sequence reveals a zzso protein following a zzso signal zzso The protein shows zzso zzso with protein III of zzso zzso and shares its two potential zzso zzso The protein also shares limited zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso zzso protein III has been shown to elicit blocking zzso that prevent the killing of zzso strains by immune zzso zzso zzso Rice, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Blake, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The very close zzso of zzso class 4 protein with zzso protein III suggests that zzso outer membrane preparations containing class 4 protein may similarly stimulate blocking zzso In order to investigate the role of the class 4 protein in the zzso of zzso infection, we have used an zzso resistance gene in developing two zzso strains that lack class 4 zzso
