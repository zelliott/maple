zzso zzso zzso the most common form of zzso is characterized by normal to elevated levels of serum zzso In order to understand the molecular zzso involved in the production of zzso in zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from these patients were zzso in this zzso zzso transforming growth zzso 1 zzso 1) and zzso have previously been shown to be involved in zzso zzso We show here that zzso expression was increased zzso in these zzso However, expression of zzso 1 in serum levels was comparable to zzso In zzso stimulation of zzso with a zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in synthesis of both zzso zzso with a preference for zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies also showed a zzso increase in the numbers of zzso and zzso cells, but the zzso distribution was similar to the zzso Furthermore, using the zzso primer zzso chain reaction zzso for amplifying switch zzso zzso zzso zzso we could demonstrate that in zzso zzso the switch frequency did not differ from that of control zzso zzso analysis of the amplified switch zzso and the I alpha regulatory region from patients showed no structural zzso Although we have previously demonstrated a correlation to in zzso zzso zzso expression and class zzso no I alpha transcripts were detected in zzso zzso from these zzso However, stimulation of zzso with zzso 1 resulted in I alpha zzso Taken together, results from in zzso and in zzso studies suggest that increased zzso production and zzso to zzso stimulation may play an important role in the increased synthesis of zzso The preference for zzso is due to increased production of zzso per cell, and the absence of I alpha zzso indicates that additional zzso in immune regulation may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
