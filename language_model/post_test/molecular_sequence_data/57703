Evidence is presented that the zzso bat gene is essential for zzso replication and for spontaneous induction of the zzso response in zzso zzso zzso preventing zzso DNA production, needed for zzso zzso zzso also prevent the induction of the zzso zzso The following experimental design was zzso zzso we identified the zzso rep region, defined as the minimal DNA sequence necessary for zzso zzso replication and, zzso analyzed the zzso sequence of this zzso This identified structures and functions zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to those found in zzso and plasmids replicating by the zzso zzso Finally, zzso were introduced either in the replication protein zzso site or in the zzso site consensus zzso which caused the zzso zzso to lose its ability to induce the zzso zzso We conclude that, in this system, the in zzso zzso signal appears to be the zzso DNA produced during zzso zzso
