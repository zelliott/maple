Recent sequencing studies of clear cell zzso zzso cell zzso zzso have identified zzso point zzso in the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To investigate whether zzso zzso is a mechanism of zzso of these tumor zzso genes in zzso we zzso the promoter region within a bona fide zzso island of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso DNA of a representative series of 50 primary zzso 4 normal zzso zzso specimens and 5 zzso cell zzso We also interrogated the promoter zzso status of zzso and zzso in the Cancer Genome zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in all tumor and normal zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso 219 zzso and 119 adjacent normal zzso zzso promoter zzso of zzso zzso and the other zzso genes examined here is therefore absent or rare in zzso
