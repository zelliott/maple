zzso are a family of zzso peptides that act as zzso molecules of the innate immune system with zzso zzso zzso These evolutionary zzso zzso zzso peptides are integral components of the immune response of fish, which are generally believed to rely heavily on innate immune zzso to invading zzso In this study we showed that Atlantic salmon zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso increasing the zzso of the zzso zzso Further, functional differences were identified between the two zzso In the presence of serum, zzso displayed greatly diminished host zzso activity, while the zzso expressed zzso had no zzso activity with or without zzso These findings support our hypothesis that fish zzso exert their primary zzso action at the site of pathogen invasion such as zzso zzso Further, we zzso that like their zzso counterparts in the presence of serum they act as zzso of the innate and zzso immune response via the release of zzso thus indirectly protecting against a variety of zzso We highlight the importance of this zzso role from the involvement of zzso during an infection with the fish pathogen zzso zzso While we were able to demonstrate in zzso that zzso and 2, possessed direct zzso activity against the fish zzso zzso zzso and a common gram negative zzso zzso coli, little or no zzso activity was found against zzso zzso The contribution of either zzso in the immune response or as a potential zzso factor during zzso is highlighted from the increased expression of zzso and 2 zzso during an in zzso challenge with zzso zzso zzso We propose that Atlantic salmon zzso participate in the interplay between the innate and zzso immune systems via the release of zzso enabling a more effective response to invading zzso
