In this study, DNA zzso analysis was used to expand our understanding of the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso were isolated originally as specifically increasing the steady state level and the zzso of zzso zzso As such, zzso offer a unique opportunity to study rapid zzso zzso zzso pathways in zzso These zzso show a zzso to fourfold increase in zzso abundance for two zzso and an zzso zzso all containing zzso zzso when examined by zzso gel zzso zzso however, they show no visible zzso zzso Here, we use DNA zzso to identify genes with altered expression levels in zzso compared with the parental zzso In addition to zzso the increase in the zzso zzso levels, which were used to isolate these zzso we were able to identify new genes with altered zzso abundance in zzso zzso gel zzso analysis confirmed the zzso data for all genes tested and also was used to catalog the first molecular differences in gene expression between the zzso and zzso zzso These differences revealed previously unknown molecular zzso for the zzso zzso that will be helpful in future zzso zzso analysis of genes altered in zzso revealed new zzso patterns that prompt new hypotheses regarding the nature of the zzso zzso and a possible role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
