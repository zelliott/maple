zzso is an important functional protein that regulates shell and pearl zzso In this study, we cloned the zzso gene from the freshwater pearl zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso The full-length zzso transcribed from the zzso gene was zzso zzso long, zzso a putative signal zzso of 20 zzso acids and a mature protein of 141 zzso zzso The mature zzso zzso contained six zzso zzso zzso and a zzso recognition domain, similar to other members of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso and an zzso zzso motif near the zzso region were also found, which are extremely important for zzso recognition and calcium binding of zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso expressed in all tested zzso zzso zzso with the highest expression levels observed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso was used to detect the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso and the result showed that the zzso was specifically expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso mantle zzso an area known to express genes involved in the zzso of the zzso layer of the zzso The significant zzso zzso expression was detected on day 14 post shell damage and zzso suggesting that the zzso might be an important gene in shell zzso layer and pearl zzso The change of zzso expression in pearl zzso also confirmed that the mantle transplantation results in a new expression pattern of zzso genes in pearl zzso cells that are required for pearl zzso These findings could help better understanding the function of zzso in the shell and pearl zzso
