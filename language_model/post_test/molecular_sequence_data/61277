zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that exerts zzso actions during zzso skeletal and neural zzso To identify zzso molecules that participate in zzso repression by zzso we applied a zzso expression cloning strategy to identify transcripts zzso proteins that bind zzso A zzso expression library from mouse brain was screened with zzso zzso fusion protein encompassing the core zzso domain of zzso A zzso was isolated that encodes a novel protein zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso binding activity was confirmed by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso protein fragment, and interactions in zzso require zzso zzso necessary for zzso suppression in zzso On the basis of zzso zzso this novel protein was named zzso an zzso for zzso nuclear target zzso The original clone is part of a zzso zzso transcript expressed at high levels in zzso and at lower levels in zzso zzso and zzso Multiple clones isolated from a mouse zzso library were zzso to construct a zzso zzso zzso of 11 zzso Starting from an zzso Met in good zzso context, a large nascent zzso of zzso zzso acids is predicted, in zzso open reading frame with the zzso interaction domain zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis reveals that zzso has three zzso zzso recognition motifs zzso and four nuclear zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso cell extracts reveals that mature approximately 110 zzso zzso and approximately 250 zzso zzso zzso protein fragments accumulate in zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso In gel shift zzso the zzso zzso domain selectively binds zzso and zzso DNA zzso this includes a large zzso zzso repeat element present in the zzso rat zzso zzso promoter, overlapping three zzso that support OC expression in zzso zzso and OC zzso are zzso regulated during differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with its proposed role as a nuclear zzso factor, transient expression of zzso suppresses the zzso OC promoter, does not significantly regulate zzso promoter activity, but markedly zzso the zzso zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso In zzso these data indicate that the novel nuclear protein zzso binds the zzso zzso and zzso OC during zzso zzso zzso and zzso both target an zzso zzso regulatory region of the OC zzso promoter, zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain represents an authentic zzso binding module for this novel zzso nuclear zzso zzso Acting as a scaffold zzso zzso potentially exerts both positive and negative regulatory actions by organizing zzso complexes in the nuclear zzso
