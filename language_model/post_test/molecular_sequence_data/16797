zzso instability plays a major role in cancer, zzso zzso progression and zzso zzso zzso simple sequence repeat zzso zzso is a sensitive tool for detection of whole zzso zzso In zzso oral cancer patients, using tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue DNA, we investigated zzso instability regions using zzso zzso The zzso fragments were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso and zzso were used in the zzso About zzso fragments were observed on zzso gel zzso with 25 distinct fragments of less than 2 zzso The zzso pattern highlighted several distinct fragments in tumor adjacent normal zzso The distinct fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso 600 and 900 zzso sizes using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 675 and 800 zzso using zzso zzso in the normal zzso showed partial zzso or complete loss in multiple tumor zzso These fragments were zzso from the zzso cloned in zzso Blue zzso and subjected to zzso zzso zzso analysis defined the specific zzso zzso given as zzso zzso () on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso () and zzso () on zzso zzso () on zzso zzso () and zzso () on zzso zzso () on zzso zzso () on zzso and zzso () on zzso The sequences of our clones have been submitted to zzso gene bank, zzso numbers to , and zzso The zzso zzso Index was calculated and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the oral cancer samples, excluding one case where zzso instability was not zzso Thus, our results indicate presence of widespread zzso zzso in zzso associated oral zzso
