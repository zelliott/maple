zzso zzso zzso are relatively nontoxic zzso that induce zzso long-lasting zzso zzso We have previously shown that these zzso also induce zzso immunity including zzso production by zzso T cells and zzso responses by zzso T zzso These zzso are thought to zzso zzso adhesive interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso We sought to test the hypothesis that zzso facilitate zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cells zzso using an in zzso model zzso Our data show that zzso zzso zzso enhanced presentation of soluble zzso zzso to the major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso T cells and zzso class zzso zzso T cells, zzso zzso of zzso via the class I zzso was enhanced by zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso did not enhance binding of peptides to the zzso molecules on zzso presentation of zzso zzso zzso or presentation of zzso zzso delivered by zzso These results provide additional evidence that these zzso zzso zzso can serve as powerful zzso for zzso both zzso and zzso immunity to protein zzso
