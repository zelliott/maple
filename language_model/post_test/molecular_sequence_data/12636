zzso are a family of widespread small animal viruses about 110 zzso in diameter, composed of an inner core surrounded by an outer envelope formed of a zzso zzso of cellular origin in which are anchored viral zzso The inner core is formed by an outer shell of zzso protein molecules zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso in close association with about 2000 molecules of zzso protein zzso zzso and molecules of reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso DNA by zzso takes place in the zzso zzso and involves two DNA strand transfers to generate the long terminal repeats zzso required for zzso integration of the zzso DNA into the cellular zzso and its zzso In this review we have summarized some of the properties and functions of the zzso protein of the most intensely studied zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Recent zzso and genetic data on zzso NC proteins have shown that this small viral protein endowed with a strong affinity for zzso acids exhibits zzso acid zzso and strand transfer activities and is required for the formation of infectious viral zzso These new activities of NC protein are most probably necessary at the early steps of zzso DNA zzso The 3-D structures of zzso and zzso NC zzso deduced from zzso studies, are characterized by a central zzso domain with one zzso or two zzso zinc zzso This should facilitate a rational approach of new zzso therapies based on zzso of NC protein zzso Due to space limitations and the very abundant literature on zzso references to articles prior to the publication of the second volume of zzso zzso zzso in 1985 zzso et zzso zzso will be zzso We also direct the reader to an excellent review which summarizes recent insights into zzso and structural aspects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and IN zzso & zzso zzso
