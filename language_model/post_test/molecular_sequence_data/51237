The nuclear zzso is a zzso structure composed of intermediate filament type zzso It zzso the inner nuclear membrane and zzso mechanical stability to the nuclear zzso In addition, it interacts with zzso and may thereby participate in determining the three-dimensional organization of the zzso zzso During zzso the nuclear zzso is zzso zzso most probably through zzso of zzso proteins by the protein zzso zzso a key regulator of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is necessary but not sufficient for nuclear envelope zzso zzso microscopic analyses have begun to provide insights into the principles that govern zzso assembly in zzso and sequence motifs required for targeting newly zzso zzso to the nuclear envelope have been zzso Of particular interest, zzso were shown to undergo a type of zzso modification known as zzso Finally, recent studies addressing the nature of zzso interactions may provide the basis for zzso the role of zzso in organizing the distribution of zzso zzso
