Gene 1 product zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to promote DNA replication of the zzso Although its role in the DNA replication is not clear, zzso is reported to exhibit multiple zzso including zzso zzso cell membrane zzso and zzso To investigate these zzso we undertook the isolation of a series of zzso zzso of gene 1 bearing zzso at various zzso During cloning of gene 1, we found that its expression severely inhibited the growth of its host zzso coli zzso In this study, we zzso this zzso phenomenon to screen a random library zzso by zzso zzso expecting that zzso which could not inhibit cell growth would be affected in the authentic functions of zzso Using this approach, we obtained 31 different zzso bearing single zzso acid zzso at 26 positions along the entire length of zzso As a preliminary analysis of these zzso we compared the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso from zzso and its related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these sequences revealed three zzso regions, zzso a zzso region near the zzso zzso zzso to be involved in the membrane zzso and zzso of zzso zzso motif zzso for zzso and a region of unknown function near the zzso zzso Interestingly, many of the zzso in the isolated zzso occurred at strongly zzso zzso in these regions and affected characteristic features of the regions zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso are expected to affect authentic functions of zzso and the zzso will be useful for studies of the structure and functions of zzso
