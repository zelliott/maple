Many zzso have been isolated which zzso marine zzso and they may play a potentially important role in regulating the biomass and population composition of zzso However, little is known about the diversity and population dynamics of zzso zzso in marine zzso Using a set of newly designed zzso zzso which specifically amplify the DNA pol from zzso a total of 221 DNA pol sequences were retrieved from eight zzso Bay zzso communities collected at different times and zzso All DNA pol sequences clustered with the eight known zzso that zzso different marine zzso and could be divided into at least 10 different zzso zzso The presence of these zzso zzso based on zzso of DNA pol gene sequences was supported by the existence of similar DNA pol zzso with zzso libraries of zzso Bay zzso zzso The composition of zzso in the Bay also exhibited distinct winter and summer patterns which were likely related to corresponding seasonal changes in the composition of zzso zzso Our study suggests that diverse and dynamic populations of zzso are present in the zzso zzso The zzso method developed in this study provides a specific and sensitive tool to explore the zzso distribution and zzso diversity of zzso in aquatic zzso Linking the dynamics of host and viral populations in the natural environment is critical to broader characterization of the ecological role of zzso within microbial zzso
