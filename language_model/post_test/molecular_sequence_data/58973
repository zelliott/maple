zzso is a new type of zzso channel with two P zzso and is abundantly expressed in human heart and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso can zzso to give zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso This assembly involves a 34 zzso acid domain that is localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 69 which is part of this interacting domain is implicated in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso this zzso with a zzso zzso results in the loss of functional zzso channel zzso This is the first example of a zzso association of functional zzso in zzso channels via a zzso zzso
