zzso molecules are important factors involved in different cellular processes and have a multitude of roles in the zzso These roles include serving as a temporary copy of genes used for protein synthesis or functions in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is so far the only biological zzso that serves both as a catalyst (like zzso and as information storage (like zzso However, in contrast to proteins well known to be able to zzso in order to maintain the architecture of the cell, such zzso zzso are not prevalent in cells and are usually not favored by the flexibility of this zzso In this work, we present evidence that such a zzso of a natural zzso the zzso zzso exists in the bacterial zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli that acts by zzso to zzso in order to control the translation and the turnover of some zzso including zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in bacterial stress zzso A putative model is proposed for the structure of this zzso zzso Although the function of this zzso is not known completely, we propose that the formation of such a structure could be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso concentration in zzso or in a quality control mechanism used by the cell to eliminate zzso zzso
