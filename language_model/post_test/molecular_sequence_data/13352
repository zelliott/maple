Evidence for at least four zzso zzso zzso were obtained from a zzso zzso library using zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso analysis of thirty zzso clones showed that: zzso the zzso changes are in the hairpin structures I, II and zzso zzso the majority of the base changes in stem structures between a zzso silk zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as well as among the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso although the base differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and among the zzso zzso zzso are not the same, they are located in similar positions in moderately zzso sites, frequently at the bases of zzso zzso when comparing the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso twelve out of zzso stem differences generate stronger pairing resulting in a more stable hairpin II in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso proteins binding site sequences are highly zzso among these zzso zzso Although a comparison of sequences changes associated with zzso zzso from different species indicate that there are no common base changes with the zzso zzso zzso clones reported here, similarities in the multitude and location of base differences in zzso I, II and III are observed in mouse and/or zzso It is possible that zzso zzso like the ones reported here play a role in alternative zzso zzso by way of different zzso factor zzso
