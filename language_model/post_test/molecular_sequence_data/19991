zzso zzso zzso zzso the fatty acid synthesis and allow the transport of fatty acids out of the zzso which are the important zzso of cellular zzso zzso is a member of FAT zzso that has been described previously in most of the zzso In zzso cloning is a new method that zzso the zzso on the complete zzso and available zzso zzso In this study, a full-length zzso clone of zzso gene was isolated from zzso zzso using this zzso It is 1,450 zzso in length and the open reading frame encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shows significant zzso with those from other plant species, which contain typical zzso owned by zzso zzso The transcripts of zzso were abundant in leaves, and less in roots detected by using zzso zzso When the shoots were subjected to the stress treatments zzso dry, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso was only slightly reduced under the treatment of low zzso This suggests that the expression of zzso is in a zzso zzso This study provides the basis not only for the identification and characterization of this gene but also for the improvement of cold tolerance by controlling the expression of the zzso gene in trees in near zzso
