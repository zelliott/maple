zzso is believed to be a zzso gene family with at least eight members restricted to the major zzso complex zzso Although the function of zzso genes is not known, one of the family members, zzso was found previously to be specifically transcribed in zzso cells and zzso In this study, we used computer programs zzso and zzso and dot plot analysis to show that the major zzso family members are related in sequence to human zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequences have at least zzso sequence identity with zzso within the pol region but differ significantly within the gag and zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso sequences share about zzso identity with the repeat element zzso zzso analysis of open reading frames zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso is characterized by many stop zzso and short putative coding regions resembling the patterns found in the zzso zzso sequence rather than those found in an zzso sequence such as expressed by zzso class I zzso A 159 base pair zzso zzso at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may code for a zzso of 52 zzso acids with a domain identical in sequence to the signal zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso is complementary in sequence to zzso pol zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence appears to be an example of an zzso within the zzso that expresses an zzso transcript with a possible role in immunity to zzso zzso
