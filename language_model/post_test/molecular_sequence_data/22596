zzso zzso coli zzso is an important cause of infantile zzso especially in developing zzso zzso a key zzso factor of zzso is required for the attaching and zzso effect characteristic of zzso and zzso zzso coli and has been zzso to play several functions in the process of zzso zzso and zzso activity is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso beneath adherent bacteria as measured in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether different zzso of zzso are responsible for different functions, 42 plasmids carrying zzso zzso were introduced into an zzso deletion zzso Two major groups of zzso zzso were zzso One group of 17 zzso exhibited positive zzso results and normal levels of zzso zzso Another group of 22 zzso exhibited negative zzso results and low levels of zzso zzso Three zzso were zzso One zzso was zzso positive but had significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso a second zzso was zzso negative but had full zzso zzso A third zzso had a significantly reduced zzso level compared to the wild type but full zzso zzso The results of zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso insertions disrupt zzso zzso and zzso with zzso insertions retain protein zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has distinct domain functions involved in zzso zzso that can be distinguished from its role as a component of the zzso zzso
