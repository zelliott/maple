The human zzso gene has been shown to have unique roles in regulating cell survival and zzso pathways and it has been related to zzso zzso syndrome and increased zzso to zzso It encodes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso Despite the important zzso and medical interest in human zzso up to now only microbial zzso of PO have been expressed as zzso protein and fully zzso By using a zzso analysis aimed at identifying the zzso domain and the regions with a high intrinsic propensity to structural disorder, we designed deletion zzso of human PO that were successfully expressed in zzso coli as soluble proteins in fairly high amounts (up to zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was isolated as an active (the specific activity is zzso zzso zzso zzso showing the typical spectral properties of zzso zzso zzso These results pave the way for zzso zzso relationships of this human zzso and clarifying the effect of the reported zzso associated with disease zzso
