On the basis of zzso and zzso isotope effects, zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso by an zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso followed by rotation of the zzso group and zzso to the zzso at zzso With the zzso zzso zzso isotope effects were zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso at pH 7, with the values increasing to zzso and zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at pH 7 gave values of zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso 69 and zzso at zzso zzso Secondary zzso isotope effects at zzso were zzso at pH 7 and zzso at pH zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso at pH 7 with zzso At zzso the corresponding values were zzso 14, and zzso These data suggest that zzso shows no zzso while the zzso zzso has an external commitment of approximately zzso at pH 7 and an internal commitment independent of pH of approximately zzso The zzso zzso shows only the internal commitment of zzso The sequence of the zzso is similar to those of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso in the active site of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso may be metal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso may form a zzso binding zzso The pH profile of zzso for zzso zzso is zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso The CD zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ sufficiently that the zzso reaction can be followed at 300 zzso
