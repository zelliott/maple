As global aquaculture fish production continues to expand, an improved understanding of how environmental factors interact in fish health and production is zzso zzso advances have been made toward economical alternatives to costly zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and toward defining the effect of rearing density on fish health and zzso Little research, however, has examined the effects of zzso and zzso diets in combination with zzso in rearing zzso Moreover, it is unknown whether interactions between rearing density and diet impact the composition of the fish zzso zzso which might in turn impact fish health and zzso We fed zzso adult rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso reared them under zzso or zzso conditions for 10 months in a single aquaculture facility, and evaluated individual fish growth, production, fin zzso and zzso zzso composition using zzso zzso gene zzso We found that the zzso zzso were dominated by a shared core zzso consisting of 52 bacterial lineages observed across all individuals, zzso and rearing zzso Variations in diet and rearing density resulted in only minor changes in zzso zzso composition despite significant effects of these variables on fish growth, performance, zzso quality, and zzso zzso interactions between diet and rearing density were observed only in evaluations of fin zzso and the relative abundance of the bacterial zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso rainbow trout can achieve remarkable consistency in zzso zzso composition and suggest the possibility of developing novel aquaculture strategies without overtly altering zzso zzso zzso
