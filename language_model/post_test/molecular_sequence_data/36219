zzso a modified zzso zzso fusion zzso we have generated a panel of zzso cell hybrids containing various overlapping fragments of the zzso zzso This region of the human X zzso is known to carry genes for several zzso eye diseases including zzso zzso zzso zzso stationary night zzso zzso and zzso zzso These hybrid cell lines were employed to isolate 17 new DNA zzso by making use of the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method and subsequent cloning of the zzso products in a zzso zzso With these zzso we have characterized two previously described zzso spanning the zzso zzso these deletions have enabled us to zzso the zzso region into three defined zzso
