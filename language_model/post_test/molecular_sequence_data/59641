The zzso major regulatory element zzso zzso positioned far upstream of the gene cluster is essential for the proper expression of the zzso zzso Analysis of the human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has identified three zzso genes in the order zzso Further characterization of the whole region indicates that the alpha zzso and several other zzso zzso zzso are associated with the zzso unit of the zzso zzso In this paper we describe the characterization and zzso of the mouse zzso zzso and compare it with its human zzso the zzso zzso and another human zzso sequence named zzso Our results show a strong conservation between the zzso gene and the mouse zzso gene with the exception of the first zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso is absent in the zzso zzso but is present and zzso in the human zzso zzso indicating that the human zzso gene is alternatively spliced or zzso The zzso gene encodes a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids zzso whose function is not zzso In the zzso of this zzso a zzso repeat zzso is zzso which is highly zzso among laboratory zzso mice zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that the zzso zzso arose during the divergence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Besides its use in evolutionary studies and zzso zzso the zzso zzso might be invaluable for monitoring the expression of a transgenic zzso zzso The cloning of the zzso gene will be helpful to analyze its possible role on zzso as well on zzso expression in the zzso
