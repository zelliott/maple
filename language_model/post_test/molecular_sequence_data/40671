zzso VI from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso have both previously been characterized as highly specific zzso acid zzso The crystal structure of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso at zzso resolution revealed that it contains two zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso domain that is ubiquitous in the very large family of zzso zzso zzso A bound reaction product zzso enabled the identification of zzso sequence and structural signatures for recognition of zzso and zzso and, therefore, provides a clear framework for understanding the zzso specificity observed in zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso in zzso The first zzso domain plays an important role in defining zzso specificity by contributing to the formation of the active site, such that only zzso peptides with a free zzso zzso are zzso A zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso is correlated with the presence of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain and both zzso interact with the free zzso group of the zzso This structural feature allows the definition of a zzso of zzso zzso with the same zzso zzso requirements, including a previously characterized zzso zzso zzso that contains the two key components (an zzso domain attached to an zzso zzso for assembly of a zzso active zzso
