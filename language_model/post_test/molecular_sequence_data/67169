Human organic zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is localized to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells and plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso variation in the zzso zzso level corresponded to zzso differences in the rate of zzso zzso of zzso However, there is little information available on the molecular mechanisms regulating the gene expression of zzso zzso in the present study, we examined the zzso regulation of human zzso A deletion analysis of the zzso promoter suggested that the region spanning zzso to zzso base pairs was essential for zzso zzso zzso This region contained a perfectly zzso zzso element zzso and a zzso here led to a reduction in promoter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso bound to zzso The activity of the zzso promoter was increased through the zzso of zzso and zzso by treatment with zzso This paper reports the first characterization of the human zzso promoter and shows that zzso and zzso function as zzso and zzso zzso regulators of the human zzso gene via zzso
