The independently folding zzso zzso zzso domain of the 434 zzso zzso contains a buried zzso salt zzso A corresponding salt bridge is found in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso Here, the zzso solution structures of zzso and the zzso protein zzso were determined to investigate the structural role of this salt zzso Both proteins contain the same type of global fold, with five zzso and a zzso motif formed by the zzso II and zzso The primary structural difference caused by the zzso zzso Met zzso is a translation of zzso I along its axis relative to the zzso zzso III zzso This limited zzso change is paralleled by a 9 zzso zzso decrease of the stability of the folded zzso protein in zzso solution at pH zzso It affects the zzso value of zzso as well as the population of a hydrogen bond between the backbone zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso group of zzso Using the crystal structure of the 434 zzso zzso zzso with the operator DNA as a basis, model building of the DNA complex with the zzso structure of zzso shows that zzso which is located on the protein surface, makes direct contact with the DNA and indicates that the point zzso zzso zzso Met should also lead to modifications of the zzso contacts in the zzso
