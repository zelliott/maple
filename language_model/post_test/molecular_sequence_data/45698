The zzso zzso zzso comprise a branch of the zzso zzso family whose members are characterized by zzso to the zzso virus B1 zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso play an essential role in cell zzso however, zzso that mediate this role have yet to be zzso zzso can complement the temperature sensitivity of a zzso B1 zzso zzso that zzso and B1 have overlapping zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso efficiently zzso the extreme N' zzso of the zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso binds to both DNA and zzso zzso proteins of the inner nuclear zzso in lower zzso zzso has been shown to play an important role during the zzso of the nuclear envelope at the end of zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso and/or zzso abrogates the interaction of zzso with DNA and reduces its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso greatly diminishes the association of zzso with the nuclear zzso and leads to its zzso throughout the zzso zzso our data suggest that the zzso may zzso the association of zzso with nuclear components and hence play a role in maintaining appropriate nuclear zzso
