Basic zzso zzso zzso factors are characterized by a zzso zzso bundle that recognizes a specific zzso DNA sequence in the major zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso acids in the basic region make zzso zzso whereas the zzso region is responsible for zzso zzso data suggest that portions of the loop region may be zzso to the zzso however, the role of the loop in zzso affinity and specificity has not been zzso 

zzso recognition by the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso A series of zzso zzso libraries that zzso zzso acid content and length in the loop region was screened with DNA and zzso affinity zzso and analyzed using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso A functional zzso zzso with reduced loop length was found, and zzso was zzso identified as the sole loop zzso critical for DNA zzso zzso zzso acids were zzso at this position to assess contributions of the terminal zzso group and the zzso chain length to zzso affinity and zzso 

Using zzso zzso zzso synthesis methods and zzso we were able to rapidly identify a key zzso acid involved in DNA binding by a zzso zzso Our approach provides a powerful alternative to current zzso DNA methods to identify and probe the zzso of zzso zzso
