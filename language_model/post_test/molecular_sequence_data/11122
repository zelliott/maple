The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence contains 354 zzso The zzso acid sequence is very similar to that derived from the gene coding for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame is interrupted by four zzso Northern analysis revealed that zzso of the gene is zzso upon addition of ammonium to the culture but the repression was not as strong as that of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities are low in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso and do not correlate with the zzso levels revealed by Northern zzso This suggests that zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso is also zzso regulated by the nitrogen zzso
