To assess biological roles of the zzso protein zzso four independent transgenic mouse lines expressing human RB with different deletions in the zzso region zzso were generated and compared with mice expressing zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso of both RB and zzso caused zzso growth zzso but the zzso protein was more zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the zzso proteins were unable to rescue zzso mice completely from embryonic zzso zzso survived until zzso day zzso but displayed defects in the terminal differentiation of zzso zzso and skeletal zzso In zzso mice, expression of the zzso zzso failed to prevent zzso zzso tumors but delayed tumor formation or zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso regions are crucial for embryonic and zzso development, tumor suppression, and the functional integrity of the entire RB zzso Furthermore, these transgenic mice provide models that may begin to explain human families with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso regions of zzso
