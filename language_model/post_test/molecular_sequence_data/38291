In an attempt to identify unknown target genes for zzso total zzso from a stable Chinese zzso zzso cell line zzso expressing a mature form of human zzso zzso acids zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso System was subjected to a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso One of the fragments was found to have 90 and zzso zzso with rat and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso cells are cultured under either zzso or zzso conditions, expression of the gene is induced approximately zzso by zzso zzso To investigate the direct effect of zzso on transcription, zzso zzso using the promoter of the human zzso gene were zzso These deletion studies indicated that a minimum zzso pair segment contains the information required for the zzso regulation brought about by enforced expression of zzso zzso zzso using zzso reporter genes revealed that zzso zzso regulation is zzso by two nearby zzso the zzso site (a zzso zzso and the zzso site (a zzso zzso It was confirmed by gel mobility shift zzso that zzso zzso binds to the zzso Data from studies with transgenic mice and reporter zzso show that the zzso gene promoter is activated by zzso more strongly than zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso and LDL zzso gene zzso which exhibit the same preference for the two zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso activity, which generates the zzso zzso zzso required for both cholesterol and fatty acid zzso
