zzso we report the geometry zzso of four zzso of zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The analysis of several geometrical parameters indicates that all zzso possess bond zzso angles, and zzso that agree fairly well with the zzso structure of zzso However, only three of them zzso resemble the polar character of CDs and show zzso zzso patterns that agree with experimental zzso zzso Among them, zzso 3 appears to be the most stable species both in the gas phase and in zzso therefore, it is expected to be the most suitable representative structure for zzso zzso The purpose of selecting such a species is to identify an appropriate structure to be employed as a starting point for reliable zzso studies on zzso zzso Our results indicate that the choice of a particular zzso zzso should affect the results of zzso zzso zzso studies on the inclusion zzso with this zzso since both the direction and the magnitude of the zzso moment depend strongly on the zzso of zzso
