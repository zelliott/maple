zzso are among the most potent zzso agents, acting through the zzso zzso zzso to suppress gene expression of a variety of zzso This appears to be via zzso interference (or zzso of key regulatory factors such as nuclear zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso can also activate gene zzso zzso via direct binding to zzso response zzso zzso by zzso is zzso by accessory zzso such as steroid zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso 1, whereas the role of these proteins in zzso is zzso we show that zzso can recruit several zzso zzso interacting zzso in a zzso zzso All interactions require the charge clamp defined by zzso while a subset also requires a second charge clamp defined by zzso within the zzso zzso zzso A point zzso zzso abolished all zzso interacting domain interactions and led to a decrease in zzso zzso but did not significantly affect zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso but did not affect zzso of zzso or zzso zzso promoter zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso did not recruit zzso to zzso but maintained the ability to zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that different zzso zzso distinct contact points to interact with zzso Although zzso interactions with specific zzso are critical for zzso they appear to be zzso for at least certain aspects of zzso zzso of nuclear zzso This is consistent with the notion that all zzso zzso repression is not zzso linked to zzso and can be separated zzso
