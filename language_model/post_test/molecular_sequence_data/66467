Phase variation of genes in bacteria enables zzso zzso to zzso interactions within a host as conditions zzso To promote zzso in animals and disease in humans, zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso for zzso In addition to tight zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso also controls zzso zzso by phase zzso In this study, an unusual zzso mechanism controlling production of zzso the response regulator of the zzso zzso system required for zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso Phase variation of zzso production is due to loss or gain of a zzso in zzso zzso or zzso tracts within zzso This mechanism occurs during zzso in poultry to alter the colonization capacity of zzso zzso presumably by influencing the zzso zzso of the zzso These findings provide more understanding into the genetic and colonization strategies zzso zzso employs to achieve zzso in a natural zzso Second, due to the richness of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso and the apparent lack of the normal set of mismatch repair zzso the results from this study may suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is more unstable and variable than previously zzso Furthermore, phase variation of zzso zzso by targeting zzso may be a phenomenon specific to zzso zzso that is absent in other zzso species and contribute to reasons why zzso zzso is more frequently found as a zzso zzso in poultry and as the cause of disease in zzso
