A serious problem during zzso of the zzso coli initiation factor zzso is a significant loss of native zzso due to partial zzso We have previously shown that the major fragment, zzso gamma (65 zzso is the result of zzso of zzso alpha at the zzso bond between zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this paper we demonstrate that the zzso is a result of zzso by outer membrane zzso zzso occurring immediately after cell zzso and in the zzso zzso By protein engineering we have constructed an zzso zzso zzso than Met and shown that the zzso gamma zzso site in this zzso protein is insensitive to zzso by zzso However the zzso protein is zzso by zzso between zzso 279 and zzso zzso which is a novel sequence specificity for this zzso
