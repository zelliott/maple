zzso zzso is a highly successful autonomous zzso zzso and a major force shaping zzso zzso Although there are about 600 zzso zzso copies covering zzso of the rat zzso full-length rat zzso zzso with intact open reading frames zzso representing functional master copies for zzso have not been identified zzso In conjunction with studies to zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso we isolated and characterized 10 different zzso from transcribed full-length zzso elements in rat zzso zzso cells, each zzso intact zzso proteins zzso We identified the first functional zzso zzso from this pool of zzso determined its activity in zzso cells and in the zzso cell line the zzso originated from and demonstrate that it is mobilized in the tumor cell line in which it is zzso Furthermore, we generated zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyzed the expression of zzso proteins and found zzso predominantly in the zzso Our results support the hypothesis that the reported explosive amplification of zzso zzso sequences after their zzso zzso in zzso cells is based on zzso zzso zzso zzso activity might be one cause for zzso instability observed during the progression of zzso
