We report the zzso zzso and zzso characterization of three zzso zzso that contained characteristic zzso zzso zzso The zzso features in all three cases fit the disease spectrum of so-called zzso zzso zzso All cases expressed zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso but no zzso pattern of cellular zzso expression was zzso Cell lines zzso and zzso established from two of the cases showed rearranged beta zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso of full-length beta zzso zzso and therefore not helpful in unequivocal establishment of lineage zzso The common zzso feature was a zzso zzso between zzso 2 and 5, involving bands zzso and zzso near the reported zzso locations of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and truncated zzso zzso were observed in both cell lines, whereas no zzso transcripts were zzso zzso analysis of the truncated zzso zzso showed that it consisted of the 3' half of the zzso zzso but its derivation was not the result of a structural zzso of the zzso zzso Our studies show that the zzso does not involve the zzso and zzso zzso and that this zzso zzso may be characteristic of a subset of primitive zzso with an indeterminate lineage but with zzso features of so-called zzso
