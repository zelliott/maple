zzso is a key regulator of the process controlling the zzso of zzso zzso II and possesses a zzso activity that can zzso the zzso domain of the largest zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of the small zzso of zzso zzso and the finding that it encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso comparison suggests that a protein with zzso identity, zzso could be the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was suggested by zzso analysis of an zzso zzso II promoter with zzso nuclear extract depleted of zzso Because the depleted extract lost the ability to produce long zzso transcripts and this loss was reversed by the addition of zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso is a component of human zzso In addition, we found that zzso associated with the zzso domain of zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that the effect of zzso on zzso zzso requires zzso and suggests that the enhancement of zzso zzso by zzso is attributable to enhanced function of zzso on the zzso zzso
