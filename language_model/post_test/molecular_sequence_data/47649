To examine whether the zzso autonomous zzso element zzso can be used for the functional analysis of the rice zzso we used Southern zzso analysis to analyze the zzso of zzso in 559 rice plants of four transgenic families through three successive zzso All families showed highly active zzso of zzso and 103 plants zzso contained newly zzso zzso zzso In nine of the 12 independent zzso zzso their zzso transmission was zzso zzso sequencing of 99 zzso sequences revealed that 21 clones exhibited significant similarities with zzso genes in databases and four of them matched rice zzso zzso These results indicate preferential zzso zzso into zzso rice zzso To examine the feasibility of zzso screening of gene zzso in rice zzso plants, we prepared zzso zzso DNA from the leaves of approximately zzso rice zzso plants and pooled the DNA according to a three-dimensional zzso Of 14 randomly selected zzso two gene zzso were identified, and one zzso a rice zzso zzso zzso gene was shown to be zzso inherited to the zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso can be efficiently used for the functional analysis of the rice zzso
