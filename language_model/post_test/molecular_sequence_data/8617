The zzso cactus and zzso proteins are required for the development of embryonic zzso polarity and probably also for the innate immune response of the zzso Like their zzso counterparts (the zzso anchor protein I zzso B and the zzso zzso B zzso zzso cactus and zzso are regulated at the level of nuclear zzso We showed previously that increased zzso calcium levels induced by the zzso zzso can activate zzso complexes in the zzso cell line zzso In order to study further the zzso of zzso complexes by zzso we have prepared a cell line zzso in which zzso is expressed zzso In this paper we show that in zzso cells zzso zzso a rapid destruction of cactus and zzso of zzso These results suggest a role for the protein zzso zzso in calcium zzso zzso of zzso zzso They also indicate that in the resting cell zzso zzso of zzso is in equilibrium with calcium dependent zzso
