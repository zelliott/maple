zzso I is an zzso which cuts duplex DNA at a rate that depends strongly upon its zzso zzso In combination with zzso sequencing zzso technology, it can be used to zzso zzso landscapes of open zzso zzso Using this technology, systematic identification of hundreds of thousands of zzso I hypersensitive sites zzso per cell type has been possible, and this in turn has helped to precisely delineate zzso regulatory zzso However, to date there has been relatively little investigation into possible biases affecting this zzso 

We report a significant degree of sequence preference spanning sites cut by zzso I in a number of published data zzso The two major protocols in current use each show a different pattern, but for a given protocol the pattern of sequence specificity seems to be quite zzso The patterns are substantially different from biases seen in other types of zzso data sets, and in some cases the most constrained position lies outside the zzso fragment, zzso that this constraint must relate to the zzso process rather than events occurring during library preparation or zzso 

zzso I is a zzso zzso with a specificity that may depend on experimental zzso This sequence specificity is not taken into account by existing pipelines for identifying open zzso zzso Care must be taken when interpreting zzso I results, especially when looking at the precise locations of the zzso Future studies may be able to improve the sensitivity and precision of zzso state measurement by zzso for sequence zzso
