The primary structure of a zzso isolated from the red zzso zzso zzso was established by combination of zzso degradation of sets of overlapping peptides and mass zzso It contains 91 zzso acids and two zzso zzso The primary structure of the zzso zzso zzso does not show zzso acid sequence similarity with known plant and animal zzso zzso zzso this protein may be the paradigm of a novel zzso zzso
