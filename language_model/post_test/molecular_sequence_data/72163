zzso protein zzso zzso beta zzso expressed on the surface of zzso cells binds to the zzso zzso recognition zzso zzso on zzso cells leading to zzso zzso We describe the cloning of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a mosaic of zzso implicated in zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains a zzso factor zzso domain, a region related to zzso zzso zzso growth zzso repeats, zzso motifs as well as unique zzso repeats found in a zzso adhesive zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains a zzso sequence capable of binding to a zzso of zzso zzso of signaling zzso zzso and zzso exist as a complex in rat brain and are bound to each other by means of lateral zzso interactions in the plasma zzso We propose that zzso may function as a signaling component of zzso enabling recruitment and zzso of zzso signaling pathways in zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso complex could provide a mechanism for zzso communication between zzso cells and zzso during zzso
