zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso line have an activity that stimulates zzso from early zzso gene zzso One such promoter, that of the zzso zzso is transcribed efficiently in zzso zzso cells and is activated further as these cells differentiate to zzso zzso cells zzso zzso The sequences required for this in zzso regulation include the zzso zzso factor zzso site, and consistent with this we show that complexes formed on this site are regulated as zzso zzso cells zzso Another zzso zzso promoter is that of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso promoter, the zzso promoter is zzso inactive throughout zzso a feature that zzso with distinct binding activities on its zzso zzso We define five zzso zzso activities in zzso cells that can be distinguished from each other by their precise sequence requirements and their regulation during zzso From these activities, we define those that bind in a zzso or zzso fashion to the zzso and zzso zzso These data indicate that members of the zzso family of zzso factors are zzso and support the idea that they provide diverse zzso zzso
