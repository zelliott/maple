zzso is an immediate early gene product and a member of the nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso as a probe, we isolated the zzso DNA zzso zzso from a mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is approximately zzso zzso long and is organized into 7 zzso separated by 6 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso reveals that this gene shares a similar structure with that of the nuclear zzso zzso As in zzso the promoter region of zzso lacks an identifiable zzso box, but is zzso The zzso promoter region also contains an zzso consensus binding site that may participate in zzso induction of this immediate early gene zzso Isolation and structural characterization of the zzso gene provides information for further zzso and zzso regulation studies of this zzso
