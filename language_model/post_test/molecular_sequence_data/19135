Satellite cells are resident stem cells of skeletal muscle, zzso zzso for zzso muscle growth, zzso and zzso Many regulatory networks control satellite cell function, which includes zzso zzso via the zzso family of zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso binding zzso zzso in regulation of zzso stem cell proliferation and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso binding protein that is implicated in cell growth, zzso and differentiation in many cell zzso Of the two main zzso zzso only zzso was expressed in satellite cells and zzso zzso Although not present in zzso satellite cells, zzso was strongly induced during zzso remaining at high levels during proliferation and zzso While zzso zzso of zzso had only minor effects, zzso zzso zzso inhibited both proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells and zzso zzso with a clear failure of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso levels, yet zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells did not rescue zzso zzso was also expressed by muscle cells during zzso zzso in zzso Since zzso is zzso between mouse and zzso we switched to chick to examine its role in muscle zzso In chick zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso and zzso differentiation of muscle zzso was inhibited by specific zzso zzso using zzso zzso These observations demonstrate a zzso function of zzso in the regulation of embryonic muscle zzso and adult muscle stem cells, which likely operates independently of zzso zzso
