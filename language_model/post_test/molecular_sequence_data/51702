We have characterized the variable zzso 9 T cell zzso zzso repertoire expressed in zzso membrane zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of five zzso arthritis zzso zzso The experimental approach was to sequence the zzso regions of zzso chain reaction zzso V gamma 9 zzso gamma chain sequences were compared with those found in normal zzso For normal zzso a large proportion of V gamma 9 transcripts used the joining zzso P gene segment whereas a few used J gamma zzso Despite this restriction in J gamma zzso there was extensive zzso region diversity with a unique sequence observed in each transcript zzso In contrast to normal zzso J gamma usage of V gamma 9 transcripts in zzso of two patients was skewed towards J gamma zzso This zzso in J gamma usage was more pronounced in zzso since all patients expressed V gamma 9 transcripts in zzso which predominantly used J gamma 2, as opposed to J gamma P in normal zzso Further, approximately zzso of V gamma 9 transcripts in zzso of each of three patients had identical zzso region zzso although the specific sequences were unique in each zzso For two of these patients the dominant transcript found in the zzso was detected in the corresponding zzso at about zzso and zzso zzso Overall, our findings indicate that V gamma zzso T cells in zzso peripheral blood are largely derived from zzso expansion whereas in the zzso there is expression of a population of these cells that are mainly zzso This may reflect in zzso expansion in response to a V gamma zzso gamma 2 zzso zzso The data presented in this report suggest that V gamma zzso T cells may play a role in the development of zzso
