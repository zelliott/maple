In this study, a high value-added and zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced by excess activated zzso The effects of the nutritional condition, zzso mode, sodium zzso concentration and initial pH value on zzso zzso in the activated sludge were zzso The maximum zzso content and zzso yield of zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso chemical oxygen zzso respectively, were attained by the sludge in the presence of zzso sodium zzso with an initial pH value of zzso and intermittent zzso The analysis of the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso sequencing indicated that the microbial community of the sludge was significantly different during the process of zzso zzso Three zzso zzso which were affiliated with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in the excess activated sludge under different operating conditions for zzso zzso
