The sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes of five zzso zzso bacteria isolated from contaminated sites in Europe, Japan, and the United States and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences showed less than zzso sequence zzso and all zzso zzso clearly belonged to the zzso zzso All strains shared a completely zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso genes were recently derived from a common zzso The genetic organization of the zzso gene region in each of the zzso zzso was examined by zzso analysis and DNA zzso Three different groups could be defined on the basis of the extent of the zzso zzso zzso The minimal structure present in all strains consisted of a zzso region of zzso zzso which included the zzso gene cluster that was previously found in strain zzso zzso of different sizes were found in all zzso Southern zzso analysis with a zzso gene probe suggested that all zzso zzso carry the zzso gene region both on the zzso and on a zzso zzso to 100 zzso This suggests that an ancestral zzso was transferred between these zzso strains and subsequently has undergone insertions or zzso In addition, zzso events and/or zzso integration may be responsible for positioning the zzso gene region on the zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso gene regions of these zzso zzso bacteria are composed of a single zzso gene cluster that was recently distributed zzso
