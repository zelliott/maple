zzso factor A zzso from zzso coli is a zzso adaptation zzso It is essential for efficient processing of zzso zzso and is suspected to interact with the zzso zzso zzso I) of zzso zzso zzso is a member of a large family of small proteins found in most bacterial organisms, making it an important target for structural zzso Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of zzso a 108 zzso construct with 25 zzso removed from the zzso zzso of full-length zzso determined in solution at pH zzso by zzso zzso zzso The structure determination was carried out using largely automated methods for determining resonance assignments, interpreting nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso zzso and structure zzso zzso has an zzso fold containing three zzso and three zzso zzso The structure has zzso zzso fold zzso related to zzso zzso sequence family proteins whose zzso zzso are characterized by a zzso motif with sequence signature zzso at the zzso In zzso this zzso zzso is characterized by a zzso motif in which the zzso sequence is replaced by a zzso zzso zzso including a strongly zzso Ala zzso at position 75 forming an zzso zzso The zzso field distribution about zzso is zzso one side of the zzso is strongly negative and the opposite face has a strong positive zzso zzso A zzso hot zzso of zzso has been identified in the vicinity of a zzso at strongly zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso relaxation rate and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso of zzso field and internal zzso together with evolutionary implications of fold and sequence zzso suggest that zzso is indeed a zzso zzso zzso and identify a potential zzso site in or around the zzso zzso segment zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso While the structure of zzso is most similar to that of the zzso domain of the zzso Era zzso its zzso field distribution is most similar to the zzso domain of the zzso protein from zzso zzso another zzso associated zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are regulated in the same zzso zzso zzso and functional similarities between zzso zzso and other bacterial type II zzso zzso suggest previously zzso evolutionary relationships between these zzso associated zzso
