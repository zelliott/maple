In April 2009, a novel zzso zzso influenza A zzso virus zzso also known as zzso was detected and spread globally as the first influenza pandemic of the zzso zzso zzso has since been conducted at an unprecedented rate globally in order to monitor the diversification of this emergent virus and to track zzso that may affect virus zzso 

By zzso sequencing, we determined consensus zzso sequences for zzso viruses sampled nationwide in Canada over 33 weeks during the 2009 first and second pandemic zzso A total of 235 virus zzso sampled from unique subjects were zzso providing insight into the zzso and spatial trajectory of zzso lineages within zzso Three zzso zzso 3, and 7) were identifiable within the first two weeks of zzso appearance, with zzso 5 and 6 appearing zzso further diversification was not zzso Only two viral sites displayed evidence of zzso evolution, located in zzso zzso corresponding to zzso in the zzso zzso site, and to zzso at zzso position zzso Among the Canadian sampled zzso we observed notable genetic diversity zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso per zzso in the gene zzso zzso particularly within the viral zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso This zzso data set supports the conclusion that zzso is evolving but not excessively relative to other zzso influenza A zzso zzso analysis was used to investigate whether any zzso zzso protein zzso were associated with infection zzso however no virus zzso were observed to trend with infection zzso One virus that zzso zzso coding zzso including zzso zzso was attributed to a severe and potentially mixed zzso yet the functional significance of this zzso zzso remains zzso 

These findings contribute to enhanced understanding of zzso zzso viral zzso
