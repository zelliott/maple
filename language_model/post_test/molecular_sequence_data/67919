zzso zzso remove zzso acids from zzso zzso and zzso zzso are widely distributed in nature and zzso zzso is implicated in normal and pathological zzso However, mechanisms by which zzso exert their biological effects remain obscure, in part because zzso zzso preferences are poorly zzso Here we report the design and zzso of a zzso zzso specificity zzso based on zzso labeling of zzso We show that this zzso identifies components of zzso zzso that contribute to zzso zzso We demonstrate that specificity of zzso can depend on structure of the underlying zzso a characteristic difficult to discern using typical zzso zzso Moreover, we discovered that zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly prefers zzso containing the zzso form of zzso acid versus those that contain zzso We propose using this approach to evaluate zzso preferences for diverse potential zzso
