The ability to deliver zzso and zzso specifically to zzso cells zzso in the skin could impact vaccine zzso However, zzso targeting of therapeutic molecules remains a challenge in zzso Using zzso display technologies, we have developed a protocol that identifies peptides that mediate zzso into target cell zzso zzso this approach, we have isolated a zzso zzso that mediates specific zzso by zzso zzso The zzso is functional outside the context of the zzso and is able to deliver a zzso to zzso in zzso Although selected on cells in zzso the zzso is able to direct zzso and genes to zzso in zzso zzso bearing the zzso targeting zzso are able to deliver a zzso active gene to zzso in a mouse zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that a zzso injection into mice of zzso bearing the zzso zzso yields faster and higher immune responses against zzso zzso than zzso zzso
