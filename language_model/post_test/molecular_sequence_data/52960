The zzso actions of ethanol on central nervous system activity appear to be zzso by its actions on a number of important membrane associated zzso channels including the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although no specific site of action for ethanol on the zzso zzso has been found, previous studies suggest that the ethanol sensitivity of the zzso may be affected by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso that regulate the zzso zzso of the zzso In the present study, zzso of the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso that lacks the alternatively spliced zzso C1 cassette did not reduce the effects of ethanol on channel function as measured by zzso zzso Full zzso was also observed in cells expressing an zzso zzso truncated at the end of the zzso domain zzso However, the zzso effects of ethanol were reduced by expression of an zzso zzso domain deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso to Ala, zzso to Ala, and zzso to Ala at zzso previously shown to significantly reduce zzso zzso A similar reduction in the effects of ethanol on zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso receptors was observed after zzso of full-length or truncated human skeletal muscle zzso proteins that produce a functional knockout of the zzso zzso The effects of ethanol on zzso and cortical zzso currents were similarly attenuated in low calcium recording conditions, suggesting that a zzso zzso process may zzso additional ethanol sensitivity to zzso zzso
