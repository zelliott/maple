The class zzso zzso chain zzso zzso region of the zzso chain zzso directly influences zzso class II presentation by occupying the zzso class II zzso groove, thereby preventing premature loading of zzso Different zzso class II zzso exhibit distinct affinities for zzso and a low affinity interaction has been associated with decreased dependence upon zzso and increased zzso to zzso arthritis, suggesting that decreased zzso affinity alters the zzso class zzso zzso repertoire, thereby promoting zzso To examine the role of zzso affinity in determining the zzso class II zzso repertoire, we generated transgenic mice expressing either zzso human zzso or human zzso containing a zzso region of low affinity for zzso class zzso Our data indicate that although degradation zzso of zzso containing a zzso region with decreased affinity for zzso class II do not remain associated with zzso this does not substantially alter the zzso repertoire bound by zzso class II or increase zzso zzso in the zzso This implies that the affinity of the zzso class II interaction is not a strong zzso factor in determining the probability of developing zzso In contrast, in the absence of zzso zzso class II zzso repertoire diversity is enhanced by decreasing the affinity of zzso for zzso class II, although zzso class II cell surface expression is zzso Thus, we show zzso in zzso the critical zzso function of zzso which preserves zzso class II molecules for high affinity zzso binding upon zzso of zzso degradation zzso
