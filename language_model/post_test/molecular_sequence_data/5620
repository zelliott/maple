The third human tissue zzso to be identified, zzso could be an alternate or complementary marker to zzso zzso zzso zzso for prostate zzso Most of the zzso in seminal plasma forms an inactive complex with protein C inhibitor zzso a zzso zzso by seminal zzso As zzso zzso behave as suicide zzso that are zzso early in the interaction with their target zzso and zzso have different sensitivities to zzso zzso we prepared a series of zzso with zzso zzso zzso based on the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso They were used to compare the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which both have zzso zzso and thus differ from zzso zzso The zzso peptides behaved as zzso zzso whose sensitivities reflected the specificity of the parent zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso were the most sensitive for both zzso and zzso with specificity zzso of about zzso zzso zzso Those derived from zzso III and zzso were more specific for zzso while a zzso zzso was specifically zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of greater specificity were obtained using zzso peptides based on the sequence of zzso zzso zzso The main difference between zzso of zzso and zzso arise because zzso can accommodate positively charged as well as small zzso at zzso and requires an zzso zzso at zzso Thus, unlike zzso zzso does not cleave zzso zzso overlapping the region of zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso
