To examine the relationship between gene expression and DNA zzso zzso activated genes were screened in zzso transgenic tobacco plants expressing an zzso zzso zzso Among 16 genes initially identified, one clone was found to zzso a zzso protein zzso earlier reported to be responsive to zzso zzso When detached leaves from wild type tobacco plants were treated with zzso zzso transcripts were induced within 6 zzso and corresponding zzso zzso were zzso at zzso sites within 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that zzso sites in coding regions were selectively zzso and that promoter regions were totally zzso regardless of the zzso Salt and low temperature treatments also induced similar zzso zzso Such effects could be attributable to zzso stress, since zzso oxygen species generated by zzso efficiently induced the same pattern of zzso at coding zzso zzso infection induced neither transcripts nor zzso zzso These results suggested a close correlation between zzso and expression of zzso upon zzso stresses with a zzso zzso Since DNA zzso is linked to zzso zzso it is conceivable that zzso at coding regions might induce zzso of zzso structure, thereby enhancing zzso We propose that environmental responses of plants are partly zzso through active zzso of the DNA zzso zzso
