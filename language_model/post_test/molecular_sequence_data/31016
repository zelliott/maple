The genes zzso the two C4 zzso zzso and zzso lie 10 zzso apart in the class III region of the human major zzso zzso The two zzso exhibit extensive structural zzso zzso of a number of zzso and zzso zzso has established the pattern of zzso in C4 and this has provided a structural basis for the observed functional and zzso differences between the C4 zzso An intriguing feature in the zzso of C4 is the unusually high frequency of zzso zzso forming half zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of one of the zzso has also been zzso In addition the genes can differ in size due to the presence or absence of a large zzso near the zzso end of the zzso These differences in gene size and gene number can be observed directly on different zzso using zzso field gel zzso
