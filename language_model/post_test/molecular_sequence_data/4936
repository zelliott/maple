The zzso zzso from zzso zzso a member of a recently defined family of zzso involved in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso was isolated and shown by zzso studies to form a zzso in zzso A zzso zzso analogue was zzso by incorporating zzso at the two zzso sites and zzso to the zzso zzso The complex was subjected to protein zzso and the results implicated an zzso sequence and a sequence region immediately zzso to a putative zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso positioned within a third zzso binding region, was shown to be involved in zzso by zzso The zzso zzso was localized on the central zzso and the two 3 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso motif by zzso zzso zzso comparison with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso demonstrates that the latter is a zzso repeated zzso of the former, where alternating segments within each protein half zzso after the zzso zzso Another zzso event, in the zzso domain, produced two different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The data provide strong evidence that the zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso associated zzso each similar to one zzso zzso and each consisting of two zzso where one face of zzso 1 and the opposite face of zzso 2 are involved in zzso zzso
