Cornelia de zzso syndrome zzso is a rare zzso zzso syndrome zzso by mental zzso growth zzso distinctive facial features and limb reduction zzso The vast majority of zzso cases are zzso We carried out a high density bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso screen but no evidence was found for a consistent pattern of zzso As an alternative, we focused on identifying zzso regions spanning associated zzso zzso We zzso the zzso zzso region because of the zzso in a classical zzso patient, of a de zzso balanced zzso with a zzso at zzso and of reports of zzso overlap between cases of mild zzso and individuals zzso for the zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso a previously zzso giant zzso zzso containing at least 32 zzso spanning zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis identified up to six different transcripts in the zzso zzso range with strongest expression in kidney and zzso embryonic expression was largely confined to zzso and stomach zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified extensive alternative zzso leading to multiple zzso and 3' untranslated regions and variable coding zzso Multiple protein zzso were defined by different zzso regions (with at least four alternative initiating zzso zzso and by differential protein zzso of alternative zzso sequences attributable to alternative zzso Outside the zzso regions, the predicted proteins showed significant zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso screening of zzso in a panel of zzso patient DNA samples failed to identify zzso zzso We discuss the possibility that the zzso zzso could nevertheless contribute to zzso
