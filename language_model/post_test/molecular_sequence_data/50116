zzso under which the zzso capacity of cells is limited provide an opportunity for studying the efficiency of zzso zzso and the role of zzso in the maturation of zzso zzso disorders of zzso type 1 zzso provide such a zzso zzso is characterized by zzso of zzso due to defects in the assembly or transfer of the common zzso zzso precursor of zzso zzso Human plasma zzso is normally fully zzso at three zzso zzso zzso 83, and zzso but zzso zzso zzso and fully zzso forms of zzso were detected by zzso PAGE in the plasma from patients with zzso The state of zzso of the three zzso zzso was analyzed in all the zzso forms of zzso by zzso mass zzso using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso It was found that zzso 46 was always zzso and that zzso 83 was never zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso This showed that the zzso zzso are zzso zzso in the order zzso in the mature zzso forms of zzso found in zzso It is concluded that the zzso of zzso sites is not random under conditions of decreased zzso capacity and that the efficiency of zzso site occupancy depends on structural features at each zzso The implications of this observation for the zzso transport and sorting of zzso are zzso
