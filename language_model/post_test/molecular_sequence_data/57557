The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso comprises 435 zzso zzso of which the zzso 114 zzso have been implicated in controlling both zzso and function of this zzso zzso of the sequence of the zzso segment reveals a number of potential sites of zzso We show that zzso is zzso on zzso zzso in zzso Increased zzso of zzso is seen to accompany the transition from zzso to M phase of the cell zzso Two major zzso zzso appear in two-dimensional maps of zzso from zzso zzso One of these zzso with the zzso generated following zzso of zzso in zzso at zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The site of zzso that is responsible for the pronounced zzso in the zzso mobility of zzso from zzso cells has been identified by site directed zzso as zzso The identify of the zzso responsible for this modification is presently zzso We also show that stimulation of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso of zzso Two zzso zzso mapping reveals that the bulk of the zzso is in a single zzso zzso The site, identified as zzso is also the site of zzso by protein zzso C zzso in zzso Thus the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso appears to result directly from zzso by zzso The effect of zzso on the activity of zzso has been examined in zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment does not appear to affect activity directly, whereas the activity of zzso from zzso cells is only zzso of that from zzso zzso
