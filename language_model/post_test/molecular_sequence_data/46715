A direct zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso has been zzso to identify zzso obtained by zzso zzso of zzso The separation zzso was made compatible with the requirements of a direct zzso using zzso made of ammonium zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso The different parameters of the zzso interface were zzso using a standard mixture of zzso flow rate and composition of the sheath liquid, flow rate of the sheath gas and position of the zzso in the zzso Different combinations of positive or negative zzso zzso polarity and positive or negative zzso zzso modes were zzso They allowed for detection orders to be easily reversed and for complementary structural information to be zzso Finally, the zzso methodology was applied to the separation and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso II and zzso
