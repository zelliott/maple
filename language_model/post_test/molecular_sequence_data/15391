Although a large number of microbial zzso have been discovered as zzso of bacterial zzso zzso only a few zzso were reported for the zzso of zzso formation, partly because of the lack of zzso appropriate for natural product zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are particularly attractive as zzso targets, because these zzso are essential for growth and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso we established a zzso zzso to measure the sequential reactions of zzso zzso and zzso coupled with zzso zzso This zzso is sensitive and robust enough to screen zzso of microbial zzso and enables us to distinguish the zzso for zzso formation, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was successfully detected by this zzso zzso zzso zzso In a large-scale screening of natural products, we have identified zzso for zzso synthesis pathway, zzso and zzso zzso
