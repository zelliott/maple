The zzso zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso domain zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso triggers the selective zzso of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of zzso are still zzso To clarify the role of the zzso zzso as a putative partner for zzso interactions with the zzso we carried out a zzso zzso of the whole motif zzso Upon zzso with zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso we identified four positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a completely zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso effect occurred periodically, we zzso that zzso elements exist within the zzso with a gap near position zzso The combination of these results with the analysis of transient sensing currents of the zzso revealed distinct roles for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso motifs in the zzso zzso According to our functional results, the zzso structure prediction zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso structures within the zzso with a short zzso around zzso in the activated zzso zzso the position zzso may be a candidate for interacting with the zzso rather than for binding to the zzso This provides the first insight (to our zzso into the direct intervention of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
