A number of zzso proteins are known to bind to the zzso zzso and may be involved in zzso replication and in zzso zzso zzso diseases such as zzso syndrome zzso are flanked by common direct zzso To study protein binding to these zzso DNA regions we used gel mobility shift binding zzso zzso present in nuclear or in zzso extracts from normal or zzso zzso bound to a zzso zzso DNA zzso encompassing a deletion zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, nuclear and zzso protein bound to a nearby surrounding zzso and to a synthetic zzso with a related consensus DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the DNA binding ability resided in a zzso zzso The zzso terminal sequence of the zzso protein was very similar to human high mobility group zzso These results suggest that this protein may be involved in zzso DNA zzso
