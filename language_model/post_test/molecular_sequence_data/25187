We previously cloned a DNA zzso from zzso zzso that suppressed the zzso sensitivity of zzso coli zzso deficient zzso and we showed that it apparently contained a gene for zzso DNA zzso zzso Here we establish the identity of the zzso gene by sequence analysis and describe its in zzso function and expression in zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso specifically protects zzso cells against the killing effects of zzso zzso It does not protect cells against zzso indeed, it appears to generate zzso which presumably result from those zzso sites produced by the zzso that escape further zzso The zzso zzso which we mapped to zzso zzso is not zzso with any of the zzso genes and appears to be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso From its sequence the zzso zzso is predicted to contain 296 zzso acids and have a molecular weight of zzso zzso A 137 zzso acid stretch of the zzso zzso displays zzso identity and zzso similarity with the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso like that of the zzso coli zzso zzso is greatly increased when zzso cells are exposed to relatively zzso levels of zzso zzso
