Two novel zzso of human zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso was zzso by Met and zzso by Ala, and 2) bovine zzso zzso hybrid II zzso zzso zzso composed of 13 zzso zzso acid of zzso and zzso by two zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso acids of zzso were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso CD zzso indicated that the zzso content of the zzso proteins was similar to that of the native zzso Both zzso retained their full ability to stimulate the proliferation of zzso zzso cells, and their binding to the zzso receptors in zzso of zzso cells and in zzso fraction from bovine zzso zzso zzso was only slightly zzso However, their ability to bind to the zzso receptors in intact zzso zzso and bovine liver was reduced by 7- to zzso zzso hybrid zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Both zzso were able to zzso the respective zzso and zzso receptors in intact zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity of both zzso in the zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso was almost completely zzso and the zzso hybrid II exhibited a remarkable zzso zzso These results further indicate that the zzso receptors in different species or zzso are not zzso We have shown that the new zzso zzso of zzso that recognize both zzso and zzso receptors but have modified zzso effects are helpful in zzso these zzso
