zzso is a zzso degradation zzso that is involved in the maintenance of normal cell differentiation and zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is an important component of the zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso as an zzso gene in zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso Using targeted gene replacement, an zzso zzso was generated and zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso had poor zzso zzso development, including a shortened aerial zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso formation, delayed zzso zzso and zzso formation, postponement of zzso zzso transfer during zzso formation, and reduction in formation of the penetration zzso zzso of zzso matter in the zzso zzso was also affected, as demonstrated by defects in the formation of zzso zzso zzso and in the degradation of zzso zzso deposits during zzso zzso zzso droplets and zzso are necessary to generate adequate zzso in zzso for invading the host zzso As a result of the decreased zzso zzso and differentiation in the penetration zzso zzso zzso was deficient in two host plants zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were restored by the introduction of an intact copy of zzso into zzso demonstrating that the zzso deletion was responsible for the cellular zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso promotes cell differentiation through turnover of zzso matter during zzso development, and is thus essential for the zzso of the rice blast zzso
