zzso of small zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was studied utilizing a zzso zzso A DNA zzso probe of sequence zzso was zzso with zzso In this zzso the zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso the zzso zzso in zzso Upon zzso binding of one probe per zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso increases by two orders of zzso the zzso zzso increases, and a long zzso lifetime component of 140 zzso zzso With addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases in a concentration dependent manner and the long lifetime component is zzso This observation most likely reflects displacement of the zzso probe from the proposed zzso acid binding site II of zzso zzso The effect was zzso to access binding affinities of different zzso to this site in a reverse zzso zzso zzso In 10 zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso at 16 degrees C, equilibrium zzso zzso for different template zzso and zzso zzso were calculated to be in the zzso zzso In general, the minus and plus zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso during zzso exhibited zzso zzso while their hybrid bound less efficiently than either of the single zzso Different zzso zzso also bound to the zzso with comparable zzso zzso By zzso with DNA zzso it was shown that the zzso site on zzso zzso does not require a 2' zzso group for binding zzso zzso but recognizes zzso zzso Its interaction with zzso is lost in an zzso zzso while that with zzso is retained after zzso zzso These findings can explain the affinities of zzso zzso interactions reported here and in earlier zzso The sensitivity of the described zzso zzso allows detection of zzso amplification by zzso zzso in zzso
