A combined strategy to obtain a partial zzso assignment of the zzso zzso protein is zzso Confronted with the extreme spectral zzso that the spectrum of this zzso zzso acid long zzso protein zzso we have introduced a zzso procedure based on zzso zzso product zzso Combining this strategy with the search for zzso zzso and combining the zzso of different zzso zzso and even of peptides derived from the native zzso we arrive at a partial assignment that is sufficient to map the interactions of zzso with its molecular zzso The obtained assignments equally confirm the absence of regular secondary structure in the isolated zzso
