zzso zzso via the subcutaneous or oral route is associated with local and, in some cases, systemic side effects and suffers from low patient zzso Due to its unique zzso features, the skin represents a promising target tissue for effective and painless treatment of type I zzso The current study was performed to compare the efficacy of zzso zzso via zzso zzso to subcutaneous zzso 

zzso mice were zzso by zzso injection of zzso grass zzso zzso zzso p 5 together with zzso zzso lung inflammation was induced by repeated zzso zzso During the treatment phase, zzso zzso p 5 was applied in solution to zzso skin or was zzso zzso Lung function and cellular zzso zzso p zzso serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso as well as in zzso of zzso cultures were zzso 

Both therapeutic approaches reduced airway zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso Whereas subcutaneous zzso induced a systemic increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso application revealed a general zzso of zzso zzso zzso therapy was associated with induction of zzso and an increase in zzso T zzso 

zzso zzso via laser zzso is equally efficient compared with conventional subcutaneous treatment but avoids zzso boosting of systemic zzso zzso zzso via zzso skin combines a painless application route with the high efficacy known from subcutaneous injections and therefore represents a promising alternative to established forms of zzso
