The zzso model of zzso disease was used to determine the role of inflammatory induced zzso oxide zzso during infection by the zzso zzso zzso The outer surface zzso of zzso zzso are potent zzso of inflammatory zzso and NO production by cultured zzso in zzso The addition of NO to cultures of zzso zzso prevents growth, suggesting a protective role of NO for the infected zzso NO is also a crucial zzso in some models of zzso zzso the involvement of NO in controlling zzso zzso infection and its participation in pathological development of arthritis were zzso Both mildly zzso zzso and severely zzso zzso strains of mice zzso produced high levels of NO 1 week after infection with zzso zzso as determined by urinary zzso NO production remained high throughout the infection in zzso mice, while in zzso mice NO production returned rapidly to zzso zzso The in zzso inhibitor of the NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was given to mice to investigate whether decreasing NO production would alter the course of zzso zzso effectively blocked NO production in infected zzso however, there was no significant difference in arthritis development, zzso infection of zzso or production of specific zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is able to persist in the host even in the presence of high levels of zzso Furthermore, NO is not involved in the control of zzso infection of zzso nor is it involved in the development of zzso The potent activity of NO against zzso pathogens and the in zzso resistance of zzso zzso to NO suggest that this zzso is not located in an zzso compartment during an essential portion of its infection of the zzso zzso
