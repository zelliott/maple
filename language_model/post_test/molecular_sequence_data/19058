zzso play an important role in zzso and data obtained in the zzso model indicate that they can act even during the zzso period of zzso Using zzso with specific zzso zzso distinguishing among all members of the zzso zzso family, we examined expression of zzso receptors in bovine and rabbit zzso zzso and zzso We found several profiles of zzso zzso zzso zzso for some zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected at all examined zzso which suggests zzso expression throughout (or at most zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not at later stages was found in only one zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso for several zzso was found in zzso but not in zzso zzso beta zzso and rabbit zzso zzso sequences of our zzso products amplified in rabbit zzso and zzso zzso represent the first published zzso sequences zzso sequences coding at least one zzso zzso of rabbit zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the expression of zzso receptors can be a general feature of zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, comparison of three zzso species zzso rabbit and zzso revealed possible zzso differences in the expression of particular zzso zzso Our results support the opinion that stress zzso can act directly in cells of zzso zzso
