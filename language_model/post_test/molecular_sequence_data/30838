zzso zzso zzso encodes several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose expression is potentially lethal to zzso coli host zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso replication zzso gene zzso are zzso by various combinations of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso This regulatory network is called the zzso zzso Presented here are studies on the structure, product, and expression of zzso zzso mapping revealed the precise location of zzso in a region near zzso zzso We determined the zzso sequence of this region and identified the zzso structural gene by analysis of zzso zzso zzso analysis predicts the zzso product to be a zzso of 85 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified in zzso by expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted structure of zzso zzso has a net positive charge and a zzso region similar to those of known zzso zzso These properties are consistent with the zzso function of zzso zzso and we discuss the evidence that zzso and zzso proteins act as zzso in the control of the zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso is expressed from the zzso promoters within the upstream zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso interrupted a zzso zzso that may have originally included zzso and zzso
