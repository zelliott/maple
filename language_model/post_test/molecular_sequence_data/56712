zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso from zzso coli is zzso by the membrane proteins zzso B and zzso zzso zzso B is a member of the so-called zzso binding cassette zzso zzso which includes the zzso resistance zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the major zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is dependent on a signal sequence mapped to the zzso 50 or so zzso acids of the zzso zzso We show that the zzso 70 zzso acids of zzso from zzso zzso can substitute functionally for the zzso signal zzso This zzso acid sequence contains no primary sequence similarity to the zzso signal zzso however, structural motifs of zzso followed by zzso can be deduced for both zzso We also demonstrate by zzso zzso that changes to these predicted motifs affect transport zzso It thus appears that the transport signal of zzso may be defined by a zzso structure and that the zzso zzso may recognize a much wider diversity of primary sequences than previously zzso This finding may have implications for understanding the basis of zzso specificity of other zzso binding cassette zzso
