The zzso zzso zzso zzso in adult skeletal muscle is composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is localized at the zzso zzso in contrast, the more zzso distributed fetal form is composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso To define sequences necessary for the zzso regulation of the mouse zzso zzso we zzso and analyzed 1036 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso Using deletion analysis of the zzso region linked to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso of the resulting zzso into established cell lines, we demonstrate that a 151 zzso zzso exhibits cell zzso and zzso promoter zzso This activity was independent of a zzso factor putative binding site zzso However, zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso or zzso showed that the zzso was functional and that zzso zzso zzso the zzso Thus, like other zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso contains information for cell zzso and zzso regulation of zzso and can be zzso by zzso factors in cultured cell zzso Unlike the other zzso promoters characterized to date, zzso function can be partially independent of zzso factors of the zzso zzso
