Comparative sequence analysis of zzso zzso protein sequences in conjunction with known zzso zzso and genetic data was used to determine zzso and zzso that play key roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses have been used to find and analyze six complete protein sequences that are related to the zzso zzso The protein sequence identity of these six zzso ranged from 25 to zzso in comparison to the zzso zzso zzso motifs were found associated with each of the three zzso zzso zzso that play roles in zzso zzso protein zzso and DNA hairpin formation were also found to be zzso in addition to other zzso of unknown zzso On the other hand, some zzso sequences did not appear to be competent to zzso the inhibitor regulatory zzso The results were also used to compare the zzso zzso with the more zzso related zzso zzso by zzso
