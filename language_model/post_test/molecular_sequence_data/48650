zzso zzso zzso is a widely expressed member of the protein zzso family of membrane skeletal zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso and zzso proteins through binding to zzso zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso region zzso Here we identify a novel mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso interactions using a combination of zzso X-ray zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso We document that zzso zzso zzso coiled structure switches to a stable compact structure upon binding of zzso This dramatic zzso change of zzso zzso in turn zzso zzso domain interactions due to zzso zzso Based upon sequence zzso with the zzso motif in protein zzso zzso region, we establish that the zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso As observed for zzso the random coiled structure of zzso changes to a relaxed zzso shape upon complex formation with zzso The resilient coiled structure of zzso maintained even in the presence of zzso singles it out from any previously published zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso binding to zzso and more specifically to zzso has profound effects on other functional zzso of zzso
