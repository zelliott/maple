zzso zzso have therapeutic potential as zzso of gene zzso However, the mechanism by which an intact zzso reaches the zzso site of action is zzso In this study, we use an zzso zzso complementary to the translation initiation zzso of the zzso zzso to study the mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso into zzso Red zzso zzso We find zzso and zzso surface zzso in addition to zzso zzso is partially energy dependent and inhibited by charged zzso including DNA, zzso a random sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso does not appear to occur via a traditional zzso zzso zzso because zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso does not significantly decrease zzso An zzso channel zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly decrease zzso zzso Whether zzso occurs via a channel or a novel zzso mechanism is still zzso A model is proposed which reasonably simulates the experimental zzso
