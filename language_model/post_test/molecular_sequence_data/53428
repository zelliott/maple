zzso are zzso expressed proteins that reduce zzso using zzso compounds as electron zzso zzso zzso have been classified in two groups dependent on the presence of either one zzso zzso or two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso also named zzso zzso have zzso zzso activity with the use of zzso as biological electron zzso However, the biological reducing agent for the zzso zzso has not yet been zzso We report here the characterization of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso that we have named zzso zzso is located in zzso and it is zzso when cells use the respiratory pathway, as well as in response to zzso stress zzso We show also that zzso has zzso zzso activity in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso system as electron zzso In addition, a zzso form of zzso containing the absolutely zzso zzso as the only zzso zzso also shows zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first example of zzso zzso that has zzso zzso zzso Finally, exposure of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso conditions reveals an important role of the zzso zzso zzso in protection against zzso zzso
