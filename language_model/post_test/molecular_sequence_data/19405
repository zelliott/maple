The dramatic acceleration in identification of new zzso therapeutic molecules has provided new perspectives in pharmaceutical zzso However, their development is limited by their poor cellular zzso and inefficient zzso Here we describe a short zzso zzso zzso that combines a zzso domain with a zzso zzso zzso zzso forms stable zzso complexes with zzso acid zzso and promotes their efficient delivery into a wide variety of cell lines, including primary and suspension lines, without any associated zzso We demonstrate that zzso delivery of zzso zzso blocks zzso growth in zzso upon zzso and intravenous zzso Moreover, we show that zzso of zzso significantly improves complex stability in zzso and consequently the efficiency of zzso zzso B1 administered zzso Given the biological characteristics of these zzso we believe that zzso delivery technologies hold a true promise for therapeutic applications of DNA zzso
