We zzso the zzso zzso protein coding sequences zzso and compared it to other zzso The analysis focused on signals, zzso biases of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids and zzso secondary zzso zzso is the preferred start zzso in all zzso independent of their zzso content, and seems to induce less stable zzso zzso However, it is not zzso between zzso genes neither is it preferred in highly expressed zzso In zzso the zzso binding site is very zzso We found that downstream boxes do not seem to exist either in zzso coli or in zzso zzso stop zzso usage is correlated with the zzso content and is strongly selected in highly expressed zzso We found less stable zzso structures at both zzso which we related to zzso and zzso zzso This pattern seems to impose a peculiar zzso zzso and zzso usage bias in these zzso Finally the analysis of all proteins from zzso revealed a similar zzso acid bias near both zzso of proteins consisting of zzso of zzso zzso This bias near the stop zzso is partially zzso zzso
