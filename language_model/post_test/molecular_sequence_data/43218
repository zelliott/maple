We have used a rat model of zzso zzso cancer to identify a gene that shows decreased or lost expression in independently transformed rat zzso surface zzso cell lines compared to the normal zzso zzso zzso we refer to this gene as zzso zzso on transformation 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of the likely human zzso and its initial zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso for rat and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contain seven zinc finger motifs of the zzso type as well as zzso and zzso rich zzso The genes share zzso identity at the zzso level, zzso at the zzso acid level and zzso within the seven zinc finger zzso zzso is zzso expressed in normal human zzso but was not expressed in four of 11 zzso human zzso cancer cell lines or spontaneously transformed human zzso surface zzso zzso The human gene maps to zzso 6 at band zzso We show that there is a 38% zzso of zzso loss at this zzso location in human zzso zzso This zzso region has also been implicated in the genesis of breast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso We suggest that this newly identified gene is not only of intrinsic interest as a zzso expressed probable zzso factor but is a plausible candidate for the tumor zzso gene which likely resides in the region of zzso 6 defined by band zzso
