Diagnosis of African animal zzso is vital to controlling this severe disease which zzso development across 10 million zzso of Africa endemic to zzso zzso Diagnosis at the point of treatment is currently dependent on zzso detection which is zzso and on clinical signs, which are common to several other prevalent bovine zzso 

the repeat sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso from several zzso of zzso zzso and found to be almost identical despite the fact that zzso zzso is known to have high genetic zzso The zzso repeat was zzso expressed in zzso coli and zzso An indirect zzso for bovine zzso based on this zzso was zzso The zzso indirect zzso had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the period following 10 days post experimental infection with zzso zzso which decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso one month post zzso With field zzso from cattle infected with zzso zzso from two locations in East and West Africa, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso specificity was obtained for the zzso zzso using the whole zzso zzso zzso as a zzso For zzso zzso zzso field infections, the zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

this study is the first to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the first to test the zzso zzso on a large collection of zzso from zzso and naturally infected zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso is an excellent candidate zzso for the development of a zzso test for diagnosis of zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso African animal zzso in zzso
