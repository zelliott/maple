zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso identified by its zzso zzso zzso generally represents zzso acquired zzso Previous studies showed that frequent DNA transfer occurs between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Currently, it is unknown whether zzso regions are also transferred between these zzso The zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso was assessed by a strategy that enables the selective isolation of zzso using zzso with recognition sites that are overrepresented in zzso Of eight regions with zzso five displayed similarity to zzso zzso zzso Of three zzso fragments with limited or no similarity to zzso zzso one encodes a novel putative zzso The remaining two fragments are adjacent in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a novel putative zzso zzso zzso A similar zzso is present in the zzso of different respiratory tract zzso The identification of zzso from zzso zzso with similarity to zzso zzso shows that genetic exchange between the zzso is not limited to the zzso core zzso The discovery of zzso in zzso zzso similar to a locus in other pathogens substantially expands the zzso gene zzso
