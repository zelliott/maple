zzso cell and organ transplantation provides promise for maintaining normal zzso conditions in patients with zzso organ zzso The approach however poses serious risk of zzso pig pathogens to zzso Among many potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are of particular concern due to their ubiquitous nature in pigs and capability of infecting human zzso Major zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso on zzso remain unclear until zzso Two zzso zzso zzso named zzso and zzso capable of zzso zzso infection in zzso cells are isolated at an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in this zzso zzso location for zzso zzso was mapped to zzso acids zzso residing at the zzso region of the zzso component of type A zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso bound directly to the zzso indicating that the zzso is exposed on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was assigned to the region zzso zzso acids zzso on the zzso component of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the zzso zzso bound native zzso zzso suggesting that its zzso is accessible only after the virus interacts with its zzso Finally, both zzso variable regions were cloned and zzso sequence zzso All together, these results reveal that both zzso zzso and zzso effectively neutralize zzso infection and may be used as a mean to prevent zzso infection in patients receiving zzso
