zzso elements of the gene for mouse zzso an zzso membrane zzso were determined by transient and stable zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso elements zzso to the zzso start site of the gene can be separated into the zzso promoter zzso to 191 zzso and the zzso element zzso to zzso The zzso promoter contained zzso and zzso motifs and the zzso element contained zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso site and its neighboring sequence and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso analysis indicated that induced nuclear factor binding to zzso and its neighboring sequence may be required for expression during zzso cell differentiation induced by zzso zzso zzso The zzso site was also shown to be essential for the promoter zzso An approximately 400 zzso far upstream region zzso to zzso containing the binding motifs for zzso zzso and zzso showed no enhancing activity when this region was examined by transient zzso zzso but it did show enhancement of the zzso promoter activity in the stable zzso zzso The far upstream region of mouse zzso gene may have a function similar to that of the locus control region zzso of human zzso gene zzso
