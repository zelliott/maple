Clearly, zzso zzso has evolved very elaborate mechanisms to maintain itself in the human zzso Three different proteins zzso zzso toxin and zzso have been implicated in zzso Furthermore, a number of toxins are produced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which destroy the clearance mechanisms of the respiratory zzso or suppress the immune zzso There is evidence that zzso zzso may survive zzso and the possibility that it is a zzso zzso zzso should certainly be zzso The availability of a large number of cloned zzso zzso and a system to construct well defined zzso by zzso exchange zzso et zzso zzso will greatly facilitate the study of zzso zzso factors at the molecular zzso It opens the possibility to construct zzso zzso which are still able to colonize and stimulate the local immune zzso Such strains may be used as live, oral vaccines, to present zzso zzso to the zzso immune system of the respiratory zzso
