Genome projects for many zzso and zzso species have been completed and more new zzso projects are being zzso zzso The availability of a large number of zzso sequences for researchers creates a need to find graphic tools to study zzso in a zzso zzso The Z curve is one of such tools available for visualizing zzso The Z curve is a unique three-dimensional curve representation for a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the zzso The Z curve database for more than 1000 zzso have been established zzso 

The database contains the Z zzso for zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso sequences are currently zzso All the zzso Z zzso and their three component zzso are stored in the zzso The applications of the Z curve database on comparative zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso content with a zzso technique, prediction of replication origins and zzso of bacterial and zzso zzso and study of local zzso from the zzso Parity Rule 2 zzso are presented in zzso The Z curve database reported here is a treasure trove in which biologists could find useful biological zzso
