In zzso the neurotransmitter zzso zzso has been linked to a variety of biological roles including zzso maturation and zzso The possible involvement of zzso in zzso zzso release was demonstrated by a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso functions associated with zzso are zzso through binding to zzso zzso A zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso acids was isolated from the tropical zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso The zzso zzso shares zzso zzso motifs with zzso zzso zzso including predicted zzso zzso active sites for protein zzso action, and zzso zzso zzso However, the third zzso loop of zzso zzso is relatively short, and only six zzso zzso are predicted, zzso a truncated zzso zzso analysis with known zzso zzso genes suggests that zzso zzso belongs to the type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso was present in all zzso zzso including the neural zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso specifically within the zzso of zzso cells located in the outer zzso of both cerebral and zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells of the outer capsule and zzso tissue of the zzso to which the zzso zzso zzso Whether this zzso transcript is translated to a functional protein needs to be verified, but if so, it could play a role in zzso
