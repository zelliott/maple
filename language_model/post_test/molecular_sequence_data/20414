The dissemination of many zzso resistance genes has arisen among members of the family zzso The dissemination mechanism of these zzso resistance genes is closely linked with zzso sequence common region 1 zzso Thus, caution must be taken in clinical settings to prevent further dissemination of these zzso resistance zzso A nomenclature system of zzso zzso important for the zzso resistance zzso was zzso The proposed system can designate all zzso zzso on the basis of the detection time and by considering zzso zzso compared with zzso This nomenclature system of zzso zzso can be applied to 19 groups zzso to zzso of the zzso family and help some researchers to correctly designate new zzso zzso
