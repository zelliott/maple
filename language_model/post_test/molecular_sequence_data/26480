In plants, zzso zzso zzso is an effective trigger of zzso zzso and several classes of zzso small zzso zzso processed from zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso are essential in controlling gene zzso One such zzso class, the zzso zzso control the expression of closely related genes to regulate all aspects of plant development, including the determination of leaf shape, leaf zzso flowering time, and floral zzso A single zzso zzso zzso signal is processed from a long precursor transcript of zzso zzso termed the primary zzso zzso A region of the zzso is partially zzso allowing the transcript to fold back onto itself to form a zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso technology uses zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso zzso strand of the zzso zzso sequences have been replaced with corresponding zzso sequences that direct highly efficient zzso zzso of the targeted zzso Here, we describe the rules for zzso design, as well as outline the zzso and bacterial cloning procedures involved in the construction of an zzso plant expression zzso to control target gene expression in zzso zzso
