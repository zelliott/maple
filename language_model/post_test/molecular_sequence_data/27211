Some zzso processing zzso possess secondary zzso binding sites situated on the surface far from the active zzso In barley zzso 1 zzso two such sites, zzso and zzso are found on the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso stacking onto adjacent zzso zzso zzso at zzso and of zzso and zzso making numerous zzso contacts at zzso suggested that zzso and zzso act zzso in degradation of starch zzso While zzso makes the major contribution to binding and zzso of starch zzso zzso exhibits a higher affinity for the starch mimic zzso Compared to that of zzso zzso the zzso of starch zzso binding by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus increased zzso times; zzso the zzso of zzso was zzso whereas both affinity and activity for zzso at zzso were zzso of the zzso zzso zzso site double and triple zzso zzso eliminated binding to starch zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso was only zzso of the zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis of zzso showed that zzso binds to zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A model that accounts for the observed zzso in starch zzso where zzso and zzso bind ordered and free zzso zzso respectively, thus targeting the zzso to single zzso chains accessible for zzso is zzso zzso and zzso also influence the zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso the degree of multiple attack on zzso and zzso binding zzso
