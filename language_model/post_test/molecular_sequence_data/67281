zzso germ cells zzso zzso of zzso are specified very early in embryonic development and undergo an active migration to the site where the future zzso will zzso While the zzso pattern of zzso during zzso has been documented in few model zzso fishes, there is currently no information available for any representative of zzso zzso This includes Atlantic cod zzso zzso which is a historically important food fish in both fisheries and aquaculture zzso In the present study, we cloned and characterized zzso and zzso and used them as germ cell markers in Atlantic zzso zzso results showed prospective zzso and zzso zzso contained the zzso used to describe their respective protein zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis using the zzso acid sequence placed Atlantic cod zzso distinct from representatives of three other zzso zzso Atlantic cod zzso was placed with other zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of both genes was detected from the first zzso zzso both were specifically expressed in Atlantic cod zzso from the zzso zzso While zzso expression ceased during early zzso zzso was strongly expressed throughout embryonic zzso Using zzso as a marker, we described the Atlantic cod zzso migration zzso We demonstrated that Atlantic cod zzso migrate zzso to the trunk zzso With the exception of Pacific zzso zzso zzso zzso in other described zzso zzso migrate lateral to the zzso The results from this study are the first step toward understanding germ line formation in Atlantic zzso
