The zzso gene family encodes inward zzso zzso zzso channels that are widespread and critical regulators of zzso in zzso zzso A related gene family zzso has recently been identified in zzso While a crystal structure of one member, zzso has been zzso there has been no functional characterization of any zzso gene zzso Here we present functional characterization of zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso generates a zzso zzso zzso path that is inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso (an zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso acid zzso approximately zzso This characterization of zzso activity now zzso the way for further correlation of structure and function in this model zzso zzso
