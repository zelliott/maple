In areas where zzso disease zzso is endemic in wildlife zzso such as the Kruger National Park zzso in South Africa, control measures are in place that ensure that potentially infected zzso and buffalo do not come into close contact with domestic zzso In South Africa several zzso outbreaks occurred nearly simultaneously in cattle and zzso between zzso zzso analysis based on partial zzso gene zzso sequencing indicated that several of these outbreaks were linked and it is probable that disease spread from the zzso zzso zzso host to cattle in close zzso Evidence was found for the involvement of viruses from a single zzso zzso in zzso outbreaks in zzso over a 10-year zzso In addition, several unrelated outbreaks affecting cattle and zzso occurred within a single zzso zzso of outbreak strains from zzso similarly revealed that a single zzso affected different species over a 10-year period and that zzso spread of zzso virus occurred on at least one zzso This retrospective analysis of outbreak strains has clearly demonstrated that zzso control policies that address the role of zzso as intermediaries in disease transmission are crucial as these wildlife species play an important role in disease zzso
