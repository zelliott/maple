The zzso zzso is rapidly and zzso induced by a variety of zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso media from zzso transformed zzso cells rapidly zzso a DNA binding protein which binds to a zzso sequence upstream of the human zzso zzso We now show that zzso zzso zzso can induce this binding activity which we have termed zzso for zzso zzso zzso which bind to the zzso protein will zzso zzso zzso onto a zzso unresponsive zzso zzso However, sequences lying between zzso and zzso of the zzso gene are required for this zzso The zzso element functions independently of a region of zzso symmetry previously identified as the serum responsive element zzso The time course of zzso expression driven by the zzso element is similar to that zzso by the zzso Unlike the zzso which can respond to signals generated by zzso serum or zzso zzso the zzso binding element mediates zzso induction only in response to zzso The zzso and zzso elements function in an additive manner to stimulate the zzso of the zzso gene in response to zzso
