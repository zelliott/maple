Within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso segment, which covers the region between the zzso and zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso This region zzso zzso contains 33 complete open reading frames zzso zzso including the four zzso genes and one partial zzso A zzso search for the products of the 33 complete zzso revealed significant zzso to known proteins in 16 of them such as zzso resistance protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike the regions we zzso so far, this region contained two short sequence zzso one was a tandem sequence zzso zzso and 410 zzso and the other a zzso consisting of two highly zzso zzso tandem sequences preceded by a less zzso similar sequence zzso zzso The reasons for the presence of these sequence zzso in the zzso to zzso region were zzso
