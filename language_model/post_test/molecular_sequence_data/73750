As a first step toward the characterization of genetic expression in pig zzso we have selected zzso clones by differential zzso from a pig zzso cell zzso library, using zzso prepared from zzso extracted from either zzso or zzso cells and, in order to generate expressed sequence tags zzso we have performed 3' and zzso zzso sequencing of these zzso zzso of the 3' end of the 167 clones that produced zzso sequence data were first compared with each other, revealing a zzso level of zzso zzso from the 136 unique clones were analyzed for similarities with sequence data included in zzso and zzso zzso Among these unique zzso 54 zzso matched significantly with sequences from either zzso of zzso 4 with known genes in zzso 35 matched with previously reported human zzso and 15 with other zzso zzso zzso clones zzso showed no significant match with any gene or DNA sequence in the zzso and zzso databases and thus may represent new pig zzso
