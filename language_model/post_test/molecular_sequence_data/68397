We have prepared and analyzed two types of gene fusion between the replication zzso zzso zzso and the reporter zzso zzso in order to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso copy number and zzso zzso protein zzso A series of zzso copy zzso zzso with copy numbers ranging from 70 to 800 copies per cell, were zzso In one type of gene fusion used in this study, zzso was zzso coupled to the zzso end of the zzso coding sequence such that native forms of both proteins were zzso This gene fusion arrangement, which permitted monitoring of zzso production (as zzso zzso by plasmids using the protein for their own zzso demonstrated a linear relationship, with one exception, between zzso production and zzso copy number over a zzso zzso In the second type of fusion, zzso was zzso fused to the zzso end of zzso As the zzso fusion did not produce active zzso zzso the zzso zzso derivatives were maintained in a strain which provided zzso in zzso and were thus analyzed at constant copy zzso In contrast to previous analyses of this type, our zzso fusion zzso expressed zzso at levels zzso to the copy numbers of the plasmids from which the zzso were zzso Using these data, we have calculated a minimum figure for the number of zzso molecules zzso per replication zzso
