zzso are zzso zzso of interest because of their potential environmental and industrial zzso We performed zzso zzso of a zzso produced by zzso zzso in order to improve its zzso zzso Considering a strong interaction of the zzso zzso in position 206 with the zzso zzso we replaced it with zzso Ala or zzso expressed the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the transformation of zzso and zzso zzso The transformation rates remain within the same range whatever the zzso of the zzso and the type of zzso at most a zzso factor increase was obtained for zzso between the zzso and the most efficient zzso zzso with zzso acid as a zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso led to a significant shift of the pH zzso zzso zzso for optimal activity against zzso This study also provides a new insight into the binding of the reducing zzso into the active zzso site and induced modifications in zzso properties of the zzso
