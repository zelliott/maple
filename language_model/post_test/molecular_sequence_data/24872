zzso of the zzso zzso 3 zzso have been previously described to cause an zzso zzso zzso of severe combined zzso zzso usually characterized by the near absence of T and zzso cells, but preserved numbers of B zzso zzso We now report a family whose zzso zzso are associated with the persistence of circulating T cells, resulting in previously zzso clinical presentations, ranging from a nearly unaffected 18-year-old subject to an 8-year-old sibling with a severe zzso zzso Both siblings were found to be compound zzso for the same deleterious zzso zzso an zzso initiation start site zzso resulting in a zzso truncated protein product and a zzso zzso in the zzso donor site sequence of zzso 18, resulting in a zzso zzso and a predicted premature zzso These zzso were compatible with minimal amounts of functional zzso zzso leading to defective zzso zzso zzso T cells in these patients failed to express zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso which may explain the zzso of T cells with an activated zzso and a skewed T cell zzso zzso zzso family zzso We speculate that residual zzso activity accounted for the maturation of zzso but was insufficient to sustain zzso zzso of peripheral T cells via zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the clinical spectrum of zzso zzso is quite broad and includes zzso patients with zzso of activated T cells, and indicate an essential role for zzso in the zzso of peripheral T cells in zzso
