This laboratory recently reported the occurrence of concentrated deposits of zzso growth zzso zzso basic zzso proteins in the zzso of embryonic cardiac zzso from the earliest stage of avian heart development zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the role, if any, of zzso during embryonic zzso the zzso and functional effects of treating cultured anterior lateral plate zzso from zzso stage 6 zzso with zzso zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso were zzso Within 2 days of culture in defined zzso the zzso zzso normally zzso into a zzso of zzso cells that express zzso zzso and exhibit rhythmic zzso The inclusion of 25 zzso zzso that is complementary to the second zzso of chicken zzso zzso caused a 50% zzso in these zzso zzso ability as judged by incorporation of zzso zzso was similarly zzso These effects were prevented by including zzso human zzso protein in the zzso Treatment with sense zzso did not cause zzso zzso of zzso protein synthesis in the zzso tissue by zzso zzso was verified by zzso zzso These results point to a critical role for zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso and perhaps zzso function, of embryonic cardiac zzso
