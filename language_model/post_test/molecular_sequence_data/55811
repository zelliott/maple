The role of zzso and zzso in zzso rejection was studied in human liver zzso zzso Liver zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso gene zzso and the percentages of zzso and plasma cells within the portal zzso as well as peripheral zzso levels were zzso The majority of zzso with evidence of rejection had zzso zzso zzso and zzso while no resolving or zzso zzso had simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso In fact, rejecting liver zzso that contain zzso zzso and zzso also contain zzso cells that produce the zzso zzso major basic zzso In contrast, zzso plasma cell and peripheral zzso levels did not correlate with the zzso status of the zzso zzso and zzso had similar effects on the frequency of zzso gene expression in rejecting and zzso zzso However, zzso appeared to profoundly zzso zzso gene zzso since 0 of 11 zzso obtained during zzso treatment for rejection contained zzso zzso These observations raise the possibility of a cellular zzso of liver zzso rejection zzso by zzso zzso
