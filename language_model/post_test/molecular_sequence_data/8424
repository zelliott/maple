The zzso zzso zzso detects an zzso expressed at high levels by mouse zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we report on the zzso and zzso characterization of this zzso The zzso detected by the zzso zzso is an integral membrane zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 205 zzso by zzso and Western zzso The zzso point is pH zzso and carbohydrates comprise about 7 zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso prepared either to a synthetic zzso zzso or to whole zzso protein bind the same zzso protein recognized by zzso We refer to the protein as zzso in view of its abundant expression by zzso and zzso zzso cells, and the revised molecular zzso
