zzso analysis of a zzso terminal zzso of zzso zzso about 1600 zzso in zzso revealed a number of motifs in the zzso sequences of the zzso and other untranslated regions that are common to zzso 412 and zzso Taken together, experimental data and computer analysis of this sequence suggest that zzso falls into the gypsy group of zzso and most closely resembles related zzso 412 and zzso zzso bears a small open reading frame zzso that shares 24 and zzso identical zzso acid zzso with the second zzso of zzso 412 and zzso zzso Thus high similarity between the discovered zzso of zzso and the corresponding frame of zzso looks intriguing, since other regions of the sequences display little zzso zzso the evolutionary proximity of zzso to zzso cannot be zzso solely on the basis of the mentioned zzso The similarity may be explained by zzso of the two zzso or, zzso the frame can retain its function in the zzso of zzso and zzso and lose it in zzso
