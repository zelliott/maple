zzso is present in the zzso central nervous system, where it acts as one of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The current studies report on the isolation of a zzso zzso a human zzso zzso zzso from the human zzso like cell line, zzso The zzso gene was localized on zzso zzso The full-length zzso has zzso zzso which zzso for a protein of 340 zzso zzso The human protein shares zzso sequence identity with the mouse zzso zzso Human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso zzso with this zzso gene were able to produce zzso indicating that the sequence encodes for an active zzso In Northern zzso analysis the zzso zzso was expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver zzso Different zzso forms of zzso were present in the peripheral zzso zzso of at least three different sizes were present in heart and zzso while in Western zzso analysis multiple bands of different sizes were zzso zzso studies, using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a peripheral expression of zzso zzso protein in human cardiac zzso and convoluted zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso brain demonstrated the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso studies in the zzso demonstrated the exclusive expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The cloning of a functional human zzso zzso and its expression in central nervous system of primates support a role for zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, its presence in human periphery such as in heart and kidney suggest a potential biological role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso activity in these peripheral zzso as zzso
