zzso or zzso are a class of zzso zzso proteins that occur in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the precursors of several zzso peptides and may be involved in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso and analysis of zzso A zzso zzso B zzso and zzso II zzso in distant zzso species confirmed that zzso and zzso belong to related zzso groups, probably evolving from a common ancestral zzso while zzso sequences constitute a distinct zzso zzso In particular, selective sequences within these zzso bounded by potential processing sites, have been remarkably zzso during zzso zzso named zzso zzso and zzso which occur in these regions, have been shown to exert various biological zzso These zzso zzso may also be involved in the formation of zzso zzso in different zzso Other peptides such as zzso and zzso may have appeared late during zzso The function of zzso as zzso precursors and zzso factors is discussed in the light of recent data obtained in various model species and using knockout mice zzso
