zzso which zzso the zzso zzso of zzso acid to zzso acid in the second step of zzso zzso degradation, was zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The characteristics and gene organization of zzso suggested that it is a novel zzso zzso that should be grouped into a new family of the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibited zzso identity with that of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso but exhibited no significant zzso to other zzso indicating that zzso acid zzso may have evolved from zzso A putative zzso zzso gene was found upstream of the zzso zzso suggesting mutual interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Metal analysis with an zzso coupled zzso plasma zzso revealed that zzso contains approximately zzso zzso of zinc per zzso of zzso The zzso zzso had zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso respectively, for zzso zzso The zzso specifically acted on zzso acid, and zzso zzso and zzso acid competitively inhibited its zzso The full-length gene zzso the zzso zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso The kinetic parameters and zzso properties of the cloned zzso were apparently similar to those of the zzso
