zzso is a central component of the zzso zzso slit zzso and is essential for the normal zzso zzso zzso This study describes the complete structure of the mouse zzso zzso which was shown to be zzso to the human zzso the major difference being 30 zzso in the mouse gene as opposed to 29 in zzso The complete primary structure of mouse and rat zzso was also zzso The sequence identity between the mouse and rat proteins was shown to be zzso while both zzso proteins have only about zzso sequence identity with human zzso The availability of the three zzso sequences is significant for the interpretation of sequence zzso and zzso in the zzso gene in patients with zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analyses of whole mouse zzso and zzso revealed high expression of zzso in kidney zzso and, surprisingly, an intense and highly restricted expression in a set of cells in zzso and spinal zzso No expression was observed zzso This expression pattern may explain occasionally occurring neural symptoms caused by zzso zzso in the zzso gene in patients with zzso zzso zzso
