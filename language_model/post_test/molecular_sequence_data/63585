The availability of sequences from whole zzso to reconstruct the tree of life has the potential to enable the development of zzso hypotheses in ways that have not been before zzso A significant bottleneck in the analysis of zzso views of the tree of life is the time required for manual zzso of zzso data into zzso zzso zzso 

To keep pace with the zzso growing volume of molecular data in the zzso era, we have developed an automated technique, zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso to assemble these zzso species zzso and to evaluate the significance of individual genes within the context of a given zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso may enable scientists to re-evaluate species relationships and to develop new zzso hypotheses based on zzso zzso
