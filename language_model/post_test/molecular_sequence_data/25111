The peculiar zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is characterized by an extraordinarily high number of zzso zzso (up to zzso arranged in double parallel zzso zzso of the inner row of each spiral are zzso so that their outer arms point towards the zzso of the next zzso in the outer zzso zzso are provided with only the outer arm, and no structure related to the central zzso spoke complex is zzso When analyzed by zzso zzso electron zzso the structure of the zzso arms was shown to share the same organization described in other zzso however, it appears to be somewhat more complex than that previously found in a related zzso species, zzso zzso since the foot region of the arms displays a zzso zzso that is zzso between adjacent zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso induced zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso suggested the presence of a single zzso high molecular weight band or, in the gels with the best zzso resolution, of two very closely spaced zzso This zzso positively reacted with a zzso zzso raised against a specific zzso acid sequence located in the zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso zzso heavy zzso DNA sequences corresponding to the zzso zzso region were amplified by zzso Two distinct fragments zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso Southern zzso analysis performed on zzso DNA using these sequences as a probe showed that they are part of different zzso An zzso was identified in the zzso zzso at a position corresponding to the site of a zzso deletion in the putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibited in zzso a zzso movement both in the zzso duct and in the zzso but they were unable to undergo zzso movement in zzso They zzso a three-dimensional wave only when constrained in a bent zzso by some mechanical zzso The zzso relationships between the two zzso species, zzso and zzso based on these zzso and molecular data are also zzso
