zzso and zzso zzso proteins are core components of the zzso complexes essential to key zzso acid processing events within the zzso zzso They assemble as zzso ring scaffolds that have the capacity to bind zzso zzso and other necessary protein zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso reveals a new zzso of the zzso zzso ring, containing eight protein zzso Little distortion of the characteristic zzso fold is required to form the zzso indicating that the zzso zzso ring may be more zzso than previously zzso The zzso zzso zzso is found to successfully recruit zzso zzso and zzso directly from zzso zzso Our crystal structure shows the zzso tail of each zzso zzso to be engaged in connections across rings through specific zzso interactions with zzso zzso protruding from zzso zzso While these zzso are of distinct length for each zzso protein and generally comprise zzso polar zzso several zzso zzso comprise zzso sequences suitable for zzso zzso The zzso structure thus provides evidence for zzso interactions likely zzso by the highly variable zzso zzso and zzso in the recruitment of zzso processing factors to mixed zzso ring zzso Our coordinates also provide updated zzso models for the active zzso and zzso zzso zzso
