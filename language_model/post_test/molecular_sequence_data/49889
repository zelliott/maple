The prevalence of the zzso zzso zzso D zzso outer membrane protein zzso and its gene was determined in 91 clinical zzso and in 7 culture collection zzso zzso percent of the clinical zzso strains expressed zzso zzso zzso The mid gene was detected in all strains as revealed by zzso of the signal zzso sequence and a zzso area in the 3' end of the zzso When zzso proteins from five different strains were zzso an identity of zzso to zzso and a similarity of zzso to zzso were zzso Gene analyses showed several zzso acid repeat motifs in the open reading zzso and zzso could be called a putative zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso tracts were detected at the zzso ends within the open reading zzso By flow zzso using human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso most strains showed two zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso All zzso expressing high levels of zzso had 1, 2, or 3 triplets of zzso in their zzso zzso while strains not expressing zzso had 4, 7, 8, or 10 zzso in their zzso tracts or point zzso causing a putative zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the mid gene was regulated at the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso proved that bacteria lost their zzso expression by removing a G in their zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from the zzso or from blood and zzso specimens expressed zzso at approximately the same zzso In addition, no variation was observed between strains of different geographical origins zzso Europe, Japan, or the United zzso zzso and the mid gene were found solely in zzso zzso whereas related zzso and zzso species did not express zzso Taken together, zzso appears to be a zzso protein that can be found in essentially all zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is governed by zzso tracts when bacteria undergo phase zzso
