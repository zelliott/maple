A common zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso is often associated with zzso dysfunction primarily in the Japanese population, and the zzso gene zzso zzso is linked with a zzso promoter that could partly compensate for the somewhat weak biological effect of the zzso in the Finnish and other several zzso We analyzed the promoter region in a Japanese zzso woman zzso for the zzso to examine whether the zzso promoter is present or absent in the Japanese zzso carriers with zzso zzso zzso sequencing was performed for a zzso zzso promoter region from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso revealing zzso for eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are identical to those found in the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso dysfunction frequently observed in the Japanese zzso carriers would be due to some zzso genetic and/or environmental zzso rather than to the lack of the zzso promoter and the zzso low biological effect of the zzso In addition, the tight linkage between the two zzso zzso in the coding region and the eight zzso zzso in the promoter region of zzso appears to be common to various ethnic zzso
