zzso acids zzso of the rat zzso zzso were replaced by the corresponding region zzso of the rat gastric zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso with the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Increased resistance to zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso assembled with zzso and zzso rather than with zzso or zzso zzso binding also indicated that more functional complexes were assembled when zzso was expressed with zzso or zzso These results suggest that the sequence zzso interacts with the zzso on the zzso side of the cell zzso The zzso + zzso complex is less stable than zzso + zzso when heated and also has a lower binding affinity for zzso zzso constant zzso zzso 63 zzso compared with zzso + zzso or zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso complex is zzso as stable as zzso + zzso complexes, and its zzso binding affinity zzso zzso 10 zzso is the same as the wild zzso These results indicate that the zzso acids zzso of the rat gastric zzso zzso zzso associate with the zzso domain of zzso zzso to form functional pump complexes and that the zzso and/or zzso region of the zzso influences the stability of the alpha beta zzso
