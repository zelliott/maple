The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a proposed zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso coli zzso We recently distinguished four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which display large differences in transport and zzso activities and differ widely concerning their distribution within the zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying these functional variations in zzso zzso are, however, zzso 

The structural basis of zzso and zzso activity was investigated using zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis derived from zzso zzso of the zzso passenger zzso zzso zzso of the passenger domain zzso zzso when zzso zzso insertions occurred in regions essential for overall correct folding or in a loop protruding from the zzso zzso Loss of zzso function was limited to zzso in zzso 1 in the zzso third of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 1 form the zzso zzso of zzso 

Our data indicate that in zzso zzso the correct formation of the zzso structure of the passenger domain is essential for efficient zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso 1 is responsible for the zzso zzso Lack of stabilizing interactions of zzso 1 with the core structure of the passenger domain zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso
