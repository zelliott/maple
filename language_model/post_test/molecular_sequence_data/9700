The success of a temperate zzso is dependent upon its ability to completely shut down expression of its zzso genes during zzso zzso zzso zzso accomplishes this by an zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds to multiple zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso initiation at an early zzso promoter, zzso but also affects downstream gene expression at zzso sites in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is replete with zzso sites located within short zzso spaces in both the early and late zzso zzso and oriented specifically with respect to zzso zzso of zzso to these sites results in a strong zzso polar effect on downstream gene expression and global zzso of zzso gene zzso
