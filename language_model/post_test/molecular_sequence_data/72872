zzso is one of the earliest zzso markers of the zzso zzso heart, and gut and has been shown to activate regulatory elements controlling zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso analyses were zzso These analyses revealed that the zzso zinc finger and adjacent basic domain of zzso is zzso modulating both zzso and nuclear zzso zzso The N zzso of the protein encodes two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso acids zzso zzso acid zzso were identified within each domain that are required for zzso zzso Finally, we have shown that regions of zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso zzso I and II, respectively, function as potent zzso zzso The identification and functional characterization of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso suggests that each of these zzso zzso critical functions in the zzso regulatory zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso As such these data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control development of the zzso
