zzso expression of zzso II is one of the mechanisms observed in cell lines and clinical samples that are resistant to zzso zzso zzso The Chinese zzso lung cell line zzso made resistant to zzso zzso and zzso to other zzso II zzso has previously been shown to express lower level of zzso zzso zzso than the parental zzso cell zzso We have shown here that zzso zzso promoter activity is lower in the resistant cell zzso The promoter sequence responsible for the differential expression of Chinese zzso zzso zzso gene was localized in a small promoter region, which harbors three zzso zzso elements zzso that bind zzso factor zzso two zzso boxes that bind zzso and a zzso element that binds unknown zzso zzso analysis of cell zzso showed that the resistant line expressed reduced levels of zzso zzso and attenuated level of zzso Although zzso has been reported being involved in the regulation of zzso II zzso it is not responsible for the reduced zzso zzso expression in the drug resistant zzso zzso analysis of individual elements suggested that the resistant cell line has relaxed responses to ICE zzso and the zzso element plays a zzso role in the regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, gel mobility shift zzso showed that the resistant line has a differential binding to the novel zzso element, which may be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
