In zzso insulin zzso regulates zzso transport together with the expression and activity of various zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso a related zzso regulates zzso development and zzso zzso animals enter the zzso arrested zzso stage in response to high levels of a zzso zzso accumulating large amounts of fat in their zzso and zzso zzso in zzso (a zzso of the zzso insulin zzso and zzso (a zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest development at the zzso zzso Moreover, animals bearing weak or zzso zzso in zzso and zzso can develop zzso but nevertheless show increased energy storage and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso in zzso suppress the effects of zzso in zzso or zzso lack of zzso zzso the need for this insulin zzso zzso zzso The principal role of zzso zzso is thus to antagonize zzso zzso is widely expressed and encodes three members of the Fork head family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso acts zzso with the zzso activated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso with zzso zzso proteins in regulating the zzso of key zzso and zzso control zzso The probable human zzso of zzso zzso and zzso may also act downstream of insulin zzso and cooperate with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso These genes may be zzso in zzso
