To construct a zzso library from zzso zzso and screen genes with zzso obtain the zzso fusion zzso proteins by zzso expression zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso library was constructed by switching mechanism at zzso of zzso transcript zzso A total of zzso clones randomly selected from the zzso library were zzso and these expressed sequence tags zzso were further analyzed for the screen of zzso zzso The two candidate genes were zzso into expression zzso zzso The zzso were transformed into zzso and proteins were expressed by the induction of zzso zzso 

A high-quality zzso library from zzso zzso was constructed and a set of zzso valid sequences were zzso zzso and assembly of these zzso sequences resulted in 347 unique zzso among which 2 potential zzso genes were highly allied with outer membrane zzso zzso and zzso protein B zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso of the two candidate genes are zzso zzso and 726 zzso which coded two peptides with 517 and zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular weights of the zzso fusion proteins were 63 zzso and 30 zzso 

The zzso library of zzso zzso reached the quality requirement of gene zzso zzso database in the library would greatly facilitate further screening of zzso zzso
