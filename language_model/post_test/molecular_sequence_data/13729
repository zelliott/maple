A new zzso zzso zzso has been identified from a zzso zzso library constructed with zzso isolated from control zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and cells treated for 48 h with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso manner, upon long-term treatment of zzso cells with zzso indicating that this clone may be related to zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis indicates that zzso zzso is expressed in rat zzso Two similar nearly full-length zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library and zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso for by the zzso zzso has no significant zzso to the recently cloned zzso delta or zzso zzso receptors nor to any other known zzso
