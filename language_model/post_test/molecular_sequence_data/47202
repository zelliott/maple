zzso of the visual zzso is influenced by visual experience during an early zzso zzso The factors that regulate such a critical period remain zzso We examined the maturation and plasticity of the visual zzso in transgenic mice in which the zzso rise of zzso zzso factor zzso was zzso In these mice, the maturation of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Furthermore, the zzso decline of cortical long-term zzso induced by white matter zzso a form of synaptic plasticity sensitive to cortical zzso occurred zzso Finally, transgenic mice showed a precocious development of visual acuity and an earlier termination of the critical period for zzso dominance zzso We propose that zzso promotes the maturation of cortical zzso during early zzso life, thereby regulating the critical period for visual cortical zzso
