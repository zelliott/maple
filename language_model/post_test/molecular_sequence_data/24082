The zzso zzso zzso serves as a cellular storehouse for zzso and zzso released from the zzso plays a role in a host of critical signaling zzso including zzso contraction, zzso regulation of transcription, zzso and zzso Given the central role played by the zzso our understanding of these signaling processes could be greatly enhanced by the ability to image zzso directly in individual zzso We created a genetically zzso zzso indicator by redesigning the binding interface of zzso and a zzso zzso The sensor has improved reaction zzso and a zzso ideal for imaging zzso in the zzso and is no longer zzso by large excesses of native zzso zzso it provides a significant improvement over all previous methods for monitoring zzso and has been used to directly show that, in zzso breast cancer cells, the zzso protein B cell zzso 2 zzso zzso lowers zzso by increasing zzso leakage under resting conditions and zzso alters zzso zzso induced by zzso and that acute zzso of zzso by the green tea compound zzso zzso results in an increase in zzso due to zzso of zzso zzso zzso
