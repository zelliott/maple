Here we report the sequence of three zzso zzso from zzso of the zzso zzso that includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gene content is equivalent to that of zzso zzso but reveals the existence of new group I zzso in zzso and zzso and new potential zzso zzso Gene order is highly rearranged in these zzso which contain numerous zzso zzso zzso The more zzso zzso these elements contain, the longer and more zzso are the zzso containing them, leading to a direct relationship between the number of zzso and zzso within the elements and the size of the zzso Thus, there is a fivefold difference in size between the smallest and the largest zzso zzso with the largest being the most zzso zzso zzso are available under zzso zzso numbers zzso zzso and zzso
