The zzso gene is one of the best studied zzso zzso zzso Recently we performed zzso analysis on the zzso gene in a large number of bone and soft tissue zzso and found that approximately one-third of the zzso have some type of DNA zzso at the zzso locus zzso et zzso zzso However, the expression of the zzso protein resulting from these zzso still remains to be zzso In this study, zzso expression in the zzso zzso was zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and its relationship to DNA zzso was zzso Of 113 zzso 29 zzso showed positive zzso for the zzso zzso These included 19 of 67 zzso five of 20 zzso four of 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso and one Ewing's zzso In zzso most of the zzso zzso belonged to highly zzso and zzso zzso types zzso or zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso zzso in the progression of zzso zzso All the cases with a zzso zzso showed strongly positive zzso while no zzso was observed in the remaining three-quarters with DNA zzso including gross zzso zzso zzso nonsense zzso or zzso at zzso site except in one zzso These results demonstrated the dominance of the zzso zzso with zzso protein expression in bone and soft tissue zzso showing a unique characteristic of these types of zzso compared with other zzso such as colon zzso
