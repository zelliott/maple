The C zzso of zzso zzso have crucial roles in tissue growth and repair by controlling both the zzso assembly of zzso molecules and the zzso assembly of collagen zzso zzso in C zzso are associated with zzso often zzso genetic disorders affecting bone, cartilage, blood vessels and zzso Here we report the crystal structure of a zzso domain from human zzso zzso It reveals an exquisite structural mechanism of chain recognition during zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It also gives insights into why some types of collagen consist of three identical zzso zzso whereas others do zzso Finally, the data show striking correlations between the sites of numerous zzso zzso in different zzso zzso and the degree of zzso zzso The results have broad implications for understanding genetic disorders of zzso zzso and designing new therapeutic zzso
