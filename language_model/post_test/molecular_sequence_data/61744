We generated the zzso zzso zzso Data zzso zzso database using sequences assembled from zzso zzso zzso from zzso full-length zzso zzso Thus far we have performed zzso analysis of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso and assembled zzso high-quality sequences into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso provides a search interface for getting results of zzso searches and enables users to obtain information on sequence data and zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso detected through comparison of the zzso sequences are classified by origin zzso and zzso zzso and are zzso in the zzso This database system can accelerate analyses of livestock traits and yields information that can lead to new applications in pigs as model systems for medical zzso
