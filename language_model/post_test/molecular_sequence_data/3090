Two zzso zzso functional zzso zzso zzso zzso were recently isolated from a zzso zzso library of cotton zzso zzso zzso with putative zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Relative CA transcript abundance and zzso activity increased 9 and 15 times, respectively, in cotton zzso during the maximum period of reserve oil zzso zzso zzso zzso of CA activity significantly reduced the rate of zzso incorporation into total lipids in cotton zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso in zzso suggesting a role for CA in zzso zzso zzso CA zzso did not affect zzso A zzso activity or total storage protein zzso Similar results were obtained for two other plant zzso cell suspensions (and isolated zzso zzso of tobacco zzso zzso and zzso isolated from leaves of transgenic CA zzso tobacco plants zzso of zzso CA zzso In addition, tobacco cell suspensions treated with the CA inhibitor zzso showed a substantial loss of zzso compared with zzso The rate of zzso incorporation into zzso in cell suspensions was reduced by limiting external zzso zzso zzso and this rate was further reduced in the presence of zzso Together, these results indicate that a reduction of CA activity zzso or molecular zzso impacts the rate of plant zzso zzso from zzso perhaps by zzso the ability of CA to efficiently zzso zzso carbon inside zzso for zzso by zzso A zzso and the fatty acid synthesis zzso
