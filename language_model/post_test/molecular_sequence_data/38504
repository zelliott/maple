Among insects, the genetic regulation of regional identities in the zzso head or zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso is best understood in the fly zzso zzso In part, normal zzso development depends on zzso zzso and Sex combs reduced zzso genes in the split zzso zzso zzso The zzso segments of zzso and zzso zzso larvae are abnormal but not zzso zzso In the red flour zzso zzso zzso we have isolated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso larvae display a strong transformation of zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso normally composed of an zzso and a zzso develop only the zzso in zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to be transformed to zzso Moreover, a zzso of most of the zzso zzso complex causes all zzso (as well as zzso and zzso segments to develop zzso These and other observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ancestral insect zzso gene functions have been modified considerably during the evolution of the highly specialized zzso zzso One of the ancestral zzso genes that arose close to the root of the zzso appears to have given rise to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence from both zzso and zzso suggests that this ancestral gene served to repress anterior development as well as zzso a zzso zzso
