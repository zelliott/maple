It was examined where a zzso zzso from zzso zzso might zzso the zzso zzso zzso A zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso and contained a zzso which had the same mobility on zzso as that of the A1 zzso of zzso zzso by zzso The biological activity of zzso by this zzso was also identical to that of zzso by zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso which corresponded to the sequence from 193 to 196 of the A zzso These data suggest that this zzso like zzso nicks zzso at position 192 from the zzso of the A zzso and that the biological zzso of zzso by this zzso is similar to that by zzso
