We describe biological and experimental factors that induce zzso in reporter zzso peak areas obtained from zzso zzso We demonstrate how these factors can be incorporated into a statistical model for use in evaluating differential protein expression and highlight the benefits of using analysis of zzso to zzso fold zzso We demonstrate the zzso utility based on an analysis of zzso data derived from a zzso zzso
