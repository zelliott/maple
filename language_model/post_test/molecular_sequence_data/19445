zzso is a cell surface zzso that is expressed on both immune cells and cells of the zzso We have previously shown that zzso is required for the induction of experimental zzso zzso zzso an experimental model for the human disease multiple sclerosis zzso The development of zzso requires zzso expression on both T cells and zzso host cells in the zzso To understand the role of zzso on the resident cells in the zzso during zzso development, we created zzso bone zzso zzso and transgenic mice in which zzso expression was under the control of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We showed that mice lacking zzso expression on the zzso resident cells developed a mild form of zzso in contrast, mice with zzso of zzso in the zzso developed severe zzso Compared with zzso mice, the zzso of zzso mice had higher expression of zzso genes such as zzso and zzso marker zzso the zzso of zzso mice accumulated higher numbers of zzso and total zzso T cells, whereas zzso T cells underwent more proliferation during zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso also enhanced their zzso activity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso Thus, zzso on the resident cells in the zzso enhances zzso development via zzso of zzso T zzso Because zzso is increased drastically on resident cells in the zzso during zzso our data have important implications for zzso therapy of zzso
