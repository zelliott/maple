The zzso activity zzso beta zzso beta 1-3 Gal beta zzso alpha 2-3 zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso has been characterized in human colon zzso cells and embryonic chicken zzso Using zzso strategy, we have isolated partial zzso clones of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso sequence of human zzso zzso zzso were zzso The 800 zzso zzso zzso zzso a region zzso of alpha 2-3 zzso zzso zzso domain from zzso has been expressed as a zzso zzso zzso soluble fusion protein (62 zzso in zzso coli and zzso over zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso has been produced against zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso fusion zzso A zzso zzso zzso binding to native zzso has also been demonstrated by measuring the residual zzso activity in the zzso zzso from zzso The marked zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity and relatively less zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso alpha zzso zzso suggests strongly the existence of two different gene products zzso and zzso in human colon zzso zzso cells and in embryonic chicken brains zzso
