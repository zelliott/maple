The zzso zzso are known to be deficient in the human zzso due to a high zzso rate from zzso zzso to zzso and its complementary pair zzso Meanwhile, many cellular functions rely on these zzso zzso such as gene expression controlled by zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso that provide essential functional zzso should be retained in zzso How these two conflicting processes regarding the fate of zzso zzso - zzso high zzso rate destroying zzso zzso zzso functional processes that require their preservation remains an zzso zzso 

By analyzing the zzso and frequency spectrum of newly derived zzso in the human zzso a tendency towards generating more zzso was observed, which was mainly contributed by an excess number of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso we found a fixation preference for zzso derived from zzso rather than zzso generated by other zzso These tendencies were observed both in zzso and zzso zzso An analysis of Integrated zzso zzso zzso provided no evidence of selection for newly derived zzso 

zzso zzso zzso that were subsequently lost by zzso tend to be recreated in the human zzso as indicated by a biased zzso and fixation pattern favoring new zzso that derived from zzso
