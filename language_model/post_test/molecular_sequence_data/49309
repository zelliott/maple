Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is important in the metabolism of zzso zzso compounds such as zzso the zzso agent zzso and other clinically important drugs, many of which are zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignment of zzso identified zzso zzso as corresponding to zzso of zzso which has been suggested to play a role in the binding of basic zzso to the latter zzso Replacement of zzso with Ala zzso decreased activity by more than zzso and led to an zzso 3- to zzso increase in K zzso values for the three test zzso zzso zzso and zzso Conservative replacement of the zzso side chain in a zzso zzso zzso produced no significant changes in K zzso values and slight increases in k zzso zzso Changes in zzso were observed for both the Ala and zzso zzso low levels of both zzso zzso and zzso were observed in the zzso zzso whereas increased preference for zzso was observed for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coding for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso failed to form a zzso zzso Our analysis suggests a structural role for the zzso side chain of zzso in zzso zzso binding and zzso The conservation of an zzso zzso in other zzso families in a position equivalent to zzso indicates a common mechanism for maintaining the zzso zzso
