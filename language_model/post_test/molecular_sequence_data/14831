A novel gene was identified from a zzso library of the male accessory zzso of zzso zzso The full-length zzso of the gene was zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso protein and therefore the protein was named zzso zzso zzso results suggested that this gene was expressed exclusively in male zzso The tissue expression pattern and the zzso levels of zzso during blood feeding were determined using real-time zzso zzso was expressed predominately in the male accessory zzso and was zzso during blood zzso The zzso activity of a synthetic zzso based on the predicted mature portion of zzso was examined against a variety of zzso and zzso bacteria and zzso It appears that ticks use the zzso zzso to protect their zzso tracts from microbial zzso The protective role of zzso during mating was also zzso
