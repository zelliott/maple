zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is required for the formation and maintenance of zzso zzso During development, zzso is zzso from motor zzso to trigger the local zzso of zzso receptors zzso and other proteins in the muscle zzso which together compose the zzso zzso After release from the motor zzso zzso binds to the developing muscle zzso zzso and remains associated with the synaptic portion throughout zzso We have recently shown that full-length chick zzso binds to a basement zzso preparation called zzso The first 130 zzso acids from the zzso zzso are necessary for the zzso and they are the reason why, on cultured chick zzso zzso clusters induced by full-length zzso are zzso In the current report we show that an zzso zzso of zzso containing these 130 zzso acids is sufficient to bind to zzso and that the binding to this preparation is zzso by zzso The zzso also binds to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the muscle fiber zzso zzso On cultured zzso it zzso with zzso and is enriched in zzso zzso In addition, we show that the effect of full-length zzso on the size of zzso clusters is reversed in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that binding of zzso to zzso provides the basis of its zzso to synaptic zzso zzso and other basement zzso
