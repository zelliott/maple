An analogue of zzso zzso was designed in which the ability to donate important zzso hydrogen bonds to zzso was precisely and directly zzso Chemical zzso of unprotected zzso segments was used to zzso this zzso zzso The functionally relevant zzso zzso linkage between zzso zzso in each zzso of the zzso was replaced by an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had normal zzso specificity and affinity zzso However, the zzso activity zzso was reduced approximately zzso compared to the native zzso zzso zzso zzso by the reduced zzso bond zzso analogue zzso was unaffected compared with native zzso By contrast, the normally zzso zzso inhibitor zzso bound to the zzso zzso with an approximately zzso reduction in zzso The reduced zzso activity of the zzso zzso analogue provides direct experimental evidence to support the suggestion that backbone hydrogen bonds from the zzso zzso to the zzso are important for the zzso function of the zzso zzso
