zzso II zzso interact with zzso producing zzso of around 100 A zzso 1, zzso during which the products of zzso zzso are zzso This has been zzso to involve an articulation of the zzso head zzso on zzso or substantial zzso changes in zzso zzso Small movements of the regulatory light chain have been detected zzso for example, zzso 9, 10), but most data suggest that the bulk of zzso does not move on zzso during zzso zzso Here we present three-dimensional maps of zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso The zzso motor domain is similar in both states but there are major zzso differences in the zzso zzso This domain acts as a rigid level arm pivoting about the end of the motor domain and swinging approximately 23 degrees, resulting in a approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the motor domain may thus be converted by the zzso domain into large movement zzso
