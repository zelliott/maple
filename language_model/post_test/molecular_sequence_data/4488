The purpose of this study was to document which genetic zzso of zzso are present in zzso and to investigate whether zzso zzso carriers and AIDS patients carry distinct genetic zzso A secondary aim was to correlate zzso DNA load to clinical and zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso carriers and 11 AIDS patients from zzso zzso were included in a zzso study in which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA load, and zzso zzso zzso counts were zzso zzso analyses showed that all investigated subjects carried zzso A zzso zzso and that the sequences from AIDS patients and zzso carriers did not form distinct zzso in the zzso As expected, patients with AIDS had significantly higher median zzso DNA load than did zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso Our study indicates that the zzso epidemic in zzso is almost exclusively caused by zzso A zzso zzso and that the zzso infections among the zzso carriers and AIDS cases included in the study do not have distinct zzso zzso 

zzso is associated with AIDS but is less zzso than zzso zzso is endemic in West Africa, with the highest prevalence in zzso zzso studies in the country have found zzso zzso in the general population to be zzso zzso zzso increases with age and zzso near age zzso years, although the mean age of zzso AIDS cases is near 40 zzso Only scattered cases of zzso have been reported outside of West Africa, with some concentration in zzso France, and zzso 38 zzso zzso carriers and 11 AIDS patients from zzso were included in a zzso study in which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA load, and zzso zzso counts were zzso zzso analyses showed that all investigated subjects carried zzso A zzso zzso and that the sequences from AIDS patients and zzso carriers did not form distinct zzso in the zzso zzso with AIDS had significantly higher median zzso DNA load than did zzso zzso
