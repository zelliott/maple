Three unique zzso zzso proteins are produced by zzso zzso disease virus zzso during infection of a host zzso zzso zzso and zzso This study presents a complete genetic and zzso analysis of these proteins (and the genes that code for them) to allow comparison of the selective pressures acting on zzso zzso numbers, gene and protein sizes, zzso positions, zzso zzso terminal zzso start and stop zzso and zzso relationships are all zzso Unlike the core, or zzso zzso there are no characteristic genetic or zzso traits common to all of the zzso zzso zzso indicating that each is evolving under different selection zzso These differences are zzso Evidence of genetic zzso in zzso segment 8 zzso for zzso is also zzso together with evidence of gene zzso and zzso suggesting the zzso zzso may have evolved using mechanisms such as zzso
