The zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso of the barley zzso zzso zzso It is actively zzso translated and forms zzso particles zzso For zzso the inheritance of new copies depends critically on where in the plant replication zzso In order to shed light on the replication strategy of zzso in the plant, we have used zzso and in zzso zzso to examine expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and highly localized in companion cells surrounding the zzso sieve tubes in mature vascular zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not seen in the shoot zzso zzso of young zzso but appeared, following transition to zzso in the developing floral zzso Moreover, zzso has a highly specific zzso in zzso zzso The strong presence of zzso in the floral zzso suggests that newly zzso copies there will be passed to the next zzso zzso expression patterns are consistent with zzso regulation by predicted response elements in the zzso promoter, and in the zzso with release from zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the expression of native zzso proteins within a plant to be zzso
