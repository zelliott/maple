We have recently shown that zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in rat zzso where only one population of zzso receptors zzso is present, indicating that zzso receptors may be coupled to the zzso zzso zzso In the present studies, we have used zzso peptides which have been reported to interact with zzso receptors also called clearance receptors zzso without affecting the zzso zzso system, to examine if these peptides can also inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso analog zzso like zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner in rat zzso brain zzso anterior zzso and adrenal cortical zzso The zzso zzso was about zzso with an apparent Ki between zzso and 1 zzso In addition, zzso also decreased the zzso levels in vascular smooth muscle cells in a zzso manner without affecting the zzso zzso The zzso decrease observed was about zzso with an apparent Ki of about 1 zzso Furthermore, zzso was also able to inhibit zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso by zzso hormone in zzso cell zzso Other smaller fragments of zzso with ring deletions were also able to inhibit the zzso zzso activity as well as zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effects of various zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso activity and zzso levels were also significantly inhibited by zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso was dependent on the presence of zzso and was attenuated by zzso toxin zzso These results indicate that zzso receptors or so-called zzso receptors are coupled to the zzso zzso signal zzso system through zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso
