zzso zzso are important zzso of zzso resistance, especially in zzso zzso They are remarkably zzso and can zzso between bacteria belonging to different species and zzso zzso zzso may be similar to F zzso zzso as it appears that only one strand of the zzso DNA is transferred from donor to zzso The recent determination of the entire zzso sequence of zzso allowed us to make specific predictions about the possible function of different open reading frames and the position of a zzso origin of zzso The mechanism of zzso during zzso zzso differs from that of other zzso as shown by the absence of a zzso of the target sequence upon zzso The current model for zzso zzso that staggered zzso zzso occur at each end of the zzso One DNA strand is cut six bases from the end of the zzso and the other strand is cut immediately adjacent to the zzso The ends of the excised zzso are then zzso to form a circular intermediate with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the circular intermediate and the target DNA allow the zzso to insert into the target, where it is flanked by zzso regions that are resolved by zzso All hosts examined contain preferential target sites: these are not specific sequences but apparently consist of bent zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso has two zzso zzso that recognize different zzso one within the ends of the element and one that includes target zzso The affinity of zzso zzso for target sites zzso with the frequency of integration into a particular zzso The similarity between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is striking and suggests that both use the same mechanism of zzso In zzso however, zzso sites must be zzso zzso may be necessary because of branch migration, which is thought to occur during zzso In zzso zzso the zzso sites are nearly always different, and therefore branch migration probably does not zzso This review presents a speculative model for the alignment of the ends of zzso during zzso that was adapted from one recently proposed for zzso
