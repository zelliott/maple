The zzso neural system plays a pivotal role in mood, affective regulation and zzso zzso as well as numerous zzso zzso We have shown that zzso steroids alter the expression of several genes in the zzso zzso of zzso which may increase zzso synthesis and decrease zzso zzso Another control point in zzso zzso involves degradation by zzso This zzso occurs in two zzso A and B, which have different zzso zzso 

We questioned the effect of zzso steroid hormones on zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso nucleus and zzso using in zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso monkeys ( zzso zzso zzso were zzso and either zzso treated zzso zzso zzso treated zzso zzso zzso zzso treated zzso days zzso days zzso or zzso treated zzso days zzso days zzso zzso sections zzso zzso were zzso with a 233 zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso monkey specific zzso zzso films were analyzed by zzso which was performed with zzso Image zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso and in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso area zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso nucleus zzso lateral zzso zzso and zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso optical density was significantly decreased by zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso hormones had no effect on zzso zzso expression in the zzso However, there was a significant decrease in zzso optical density in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso P or zzso zzso Pixel area generally reflected optical zzso 

zzso steroids decreased zzso but not B, in the zzso zzso However, both zzso and B were decreased in discrete zzso zzso by hormone zzso These data suggest that the zzso regulation of zzso by zzso steroids may play a role in zzso or zzso zzso and zzso mood, affect or zzso in zzso
