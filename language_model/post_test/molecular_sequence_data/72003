Using a set of parental and zzso zzso zzso virus zzso we demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso zzso of the novel zzso zzso gene and elevated zzso activity in those strains that produce zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso with a construct expressing zzso protein from susceptible strains and with a zzso reporter construct containing the zzso promoter showed a zzso increase in zzso activity compared with zzso cells or cells zzso with a construct expressing zzso protein from resistant zzso Two deletions found at coding sites zzso and zzso of structural zzso I and III, respectively, of the zzso gene may account for the differences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso promoter has defined a region from zzso to zzso upstream from the zzso translation initiation site to be responsive to zzso zzso zzso mapping of genetic zzso in parental and zzso strains demonstrates that the zzso protein of strains that induce zzso zzso is responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These studies provide new insights into the role of the zzso gene in the zzso of viral zzso
