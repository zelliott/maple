zzso milk fat zzso zzso are a rich source of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso They are zzso zzso sharing a common zzso zzso The zzso protein consists of two zzso zzso and a tandem repeated structure with a high degree of similarity to the C1 and C2 zzso found in zzso factors V and zzso The second zzso domain contains an zzso cell zzso sequence with the possibility of binding zzso while the zzso end of the zzso domain contains a probable zzso zzso Using a zzso column, bovine alpha v beta 5 zzso was zzso from zzso zzso tissue by affinity zzso and characterized by Western zzso and zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and the alpha v beta 5 zzso was shown to be zzso zzso zzso binding zzso showed that zzso binds to surfaces of zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso acid, but not zzso Furthermore, zzso displayed the highest affinity toward a total zzso fraction derived from the milk fat zzso membrane as compared to pure zzso Using Western zzso technique, zzso was shown to be widely expressed in a number of zzso These results show that zzso is a common protein which can bind to zzso by two distinct mechanisms, one through affinity to zzso alpha v beta 5 and another by direct binding to zzso
