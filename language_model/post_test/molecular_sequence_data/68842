zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain truncated zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso coli and zzso to near zzso Various zzso states of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the major insulin zzso zzso sites, were used as zzso for the zzso There was no indication for selective zzso of any of the three zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out using all seven different zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed for zzso using the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, for delta zzso zzso was achieved for all seven zzso zzso The best zzso for delta zzso was the zzso zzso possessing a zzso of approximately zzso zzso about zzso lower than either the zzso or zzso zzso However, in contrast to delta zzso zzso had a zzso lower affinity for zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of a single zzso zzso domain increased the affinity of the zzso for the zzso zzso to a value similar to that obtained with delta zzso The pH zzso for all three zzso zzso were very similar and could not account for the observed change in zzso affinity between the three zzso These results suggest that the zzso domain of zzso exerts an zzso effect on its zzso zzso
