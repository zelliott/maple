The structural organization of alkaline soluble zzso zzso was investigated over size ranges extending from zzso to zzso of zzso Analysis was by electron zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and individual circular zzso in the zzso size range were isolated from zzso tissue of cell walls and zzso by rotary zzso zzso zzso and 50% zzso zzso zzso these zzso into zzso segmented zzso and zzso zzso which collectively comprised the internal gel network of the zzso Image analysis of the zzso specimens before and after zzso followed by curve fitting of the smoothed zzso revealed a zzso distribution of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso were stable for the most part to further zzso by increasing zzso zzso
