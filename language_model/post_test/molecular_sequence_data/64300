Three bacterial strains were isolated from flowers collected in Bangkok, zzso by an zzso approach for zzso acid zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the zzso were located in the lineage of the zzso zzso but constituted a cluster separate from the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA base composition of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso with a range of zzso zzso The zzso constituted a zzso separate from zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso The zzso had zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics similar to those of the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso grew on zzso The major zzso was zzso On the basis of the results zzso the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the zzso The type strain is isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which had a DNA zzso content of zzso zzso and was isolated from a zzso flower zzso in zzso zzso zzso collected in Bangkok, zzso
