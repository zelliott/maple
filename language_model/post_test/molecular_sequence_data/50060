A unique zzso cataract was observed in a zzso German family to be transmitted as an isolated zzso dominant zzso Since zzso in the zzso zzso zzso genes have previously been demonstrated to be the most frequent reason for isolated zzso zzso all 4 active zzso genes have been zzso A single zzso change in the zzso gene has been zzso leading to a premature stop zzso This was not observed in 170 control zzso However, it did not segregate with the disease zzso This is the first zzso zzso in an active zzso gene without a dominant zzso As the zzso zzso did not explain the zzso several other candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CENTRAL zzso zzso were investigated by zzso markers and linkage analysis, but they were excluded based on the combination of zzso analysis and zzso linkage zzso The zzso in this family is due to a zzso in another zzso cataract gene yet to be zzso
