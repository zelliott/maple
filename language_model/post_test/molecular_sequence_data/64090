To evaluate the relationship between zzso gene expression of zzso and their zzso in zzso zzso arrested zzso and zzso zzso because both nuclear and zzso factors contribute to zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso 

Prospective laboratory zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso laboratory in a university zzso 

Seventy-five zzso zzso 45 arrested zzso and 24 zzso zzso zzso from 45 female patients undergoing zzso 

Analysis of zzso gene expression by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso of the expression levels of zzso genes including zzso CO I, CO II, zzso 6, CO III, zzso zzso and zzso b in three zzso 

zzso decreased zzso levels were expressed in zzso zzso and arrested zzso The average expression levels of the eight determined genes compared with the control zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso arrested zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased expressions of the zzso 6, CO III, and zzso genes were detected from samples with zzso common deletion in the zzso DNA zzso compared with the zzso zzso 

The present study is the first report to present globally decreased zzso gene expression levels in human compromised zzso and zzso These data support the notion that the zzso of zzso zzso by defective zzso zzso genes possibly affects zzso quality including zzso and further zzso zzso
