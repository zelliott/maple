We present an zzso for viral zzso that relies on the zzso zzso of zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso A consensus zzso for the zzso zzso is fused between the DNA binding and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor which drives a zzso reporter zzso The zzso is performed in zzso cells, has a robust zzso ratio, and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso A unique feature of the zzso is its ability to detect zzso of viral replication that act on viral targets other than the zzso
