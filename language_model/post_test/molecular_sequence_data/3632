zzso of nitrate into the zzso is the first but least well understood step of zzso no gene has previously been identified to be necessary for this zzso zzso from the structural genes of the zzso nitrate zzso zzso in zzso zzso there is a fusion of two zzso each zzso to members of the zzso zzso The single open reading frame is predicted to zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of both the zzso of zzso zzso and electron transport through the nitrate zzso zzso in zzso zzso reveals that zzso and zzso are both involved in nitrate zzso zzso rate of nitrate transport via zzso was dependent upon zzso indicating that zzso encodes a zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso was not dependent on the zzso motive force for zzso nitrate transport zzso zzso transport via zzso was dependent on zzso motive force, indicating that it is likely to be a zzso zzso Low expression of zzso nitrate zzso in zzso zzso was zzso by zzso which induced nitrate zzso expression only if the zzso zzso zzso was zzso
