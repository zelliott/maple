The zzso complexes zzso regulatory information from upstream regulatory elements to the zzso machinery in organisms ranging from zzso to zzso By a zzso search we identified 14 zzso and genes in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins are smaller and appear to form a zzso of lower complexity, which is consistent with the hypothesized ancient origin of zzso zzso
