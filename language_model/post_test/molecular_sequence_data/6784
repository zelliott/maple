A new gene zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso was isolated by the ability to suppress the temperature sensitivity of a zzso zzso by increasing its gene zzso The gene could also suppress the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was physically mapped in the region near zzso on zzso zzso zzso The predicted gene product zzso zzso is basic and partially zzso to various zzso zzso The level of the gene expression increased zzso when exposed to mating zzso
