The smaller zzso segment of the zzso of infectious zzso disease virus zzso encodes a single zzso of approximately 90 zzso zzso The consensus zzso zzso derived from independent and overlapping zzso zzso contains a single open reading frame which begins with an exact zzso sequence and could zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso It has been suggested that zzso could be the viral zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the predicted zzso acid sequence of this protein with those of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso has failed to reveal any zzso between zzso and the zzso regions in these zzso It is possible that the zzso zzso by the zzso virus may represent a new class of zzso which are involved in the replication of zzso zzso zzso
