zzso actions as a class II zzso promote capture of diverse peptides inside the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells studied to date express class II bound by class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a short zzso zzso of the zzso chain, and exhibit defective zzso zzso To evaluate zzso functional contributions in k zzso mice, we engineered a novel zzso at the zzso locus via embryonic stem cell zzso The present experiments demonstrate short-lived zzso complexes, decreased zzso surface zzso and enhanced zzso zzso binding zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso loss in k zzso mice creates a substantial pool of empty or loosely occupied zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso hardly affects zzso zzso The appearance of mature compact zzso zzso near normal surface zzso and efficient zzso presentation capabilities strengthen the evidence for zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso described zzso partial occupancy by zzso zzso is sufficient to eliminate zzso zzso Mass zzso profiles reveal zzso and a zzso collection of relatively short peptides bound to zzso zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso has distinct roles depending on its specific class II zzso
