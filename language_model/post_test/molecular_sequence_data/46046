zzso dioxide zzso is a ubiquitous air zzso present in low zzso in the urban air, and in higher zzso in the working zzso zzso zzso a zzso aromatic zzso is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with diverse zzso zzso To investigate the interactions between zzso and zzso male zzso rats were exposed to zzso instilled with zzso zzso 3 zzso or zzso (20 zzso inhalation alone or zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso were analyzed in lungs using a real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis, zzso And zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities were zzso In lungs of rats exposed to zzso alone, the gene zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso activities were zzso Meanwhile, the zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso were increased zzso Exposure to zzso alone induced zzso zzso zzso levels, the protein levels of zzso and the zzso and zzso activities in zzso However, exposure to zzso plus zzso zzso neither increased nor decreased zzso zzso expressions, zzso and zzso activities in zzso versus exposure to zzso zzso Nevertheless, exposure to zzso plus zzso zzso increased the zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso in lungs compared with lungs exposed to zzso zzso zzso the zzso decreases of zzso might not influence the zzso zzso of zzso However, when zzso and zzso were given in the combinations, one might zzso that a synergistic effect on the expressions of zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso which might be one of the possible mechanisms of combination effects between zzso and the air zzso
