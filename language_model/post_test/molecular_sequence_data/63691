zzso interference zzso is an zzso gene regulatory zzso that the research community has adopted to facilitate the creation of a functional map of the human zzso To achieve this, small interfering zzso zzso short synthetic duplexes having complete zzso to the intended target, are introduced into cells to silence gene expression via a zzso zzso zzso While zzso can be designed to effectively knock down any target zzso recent studies have shown that these small molecules frequently trigger zzso zzso These unintended events can have a significant impact on experimental outcomes and subsequent data zzso As zzso is envisioned to play a central role in developing a functional map of the human zzso the development of reliable protocols for identifying zzso genes is zzso This chapter focuses on the underlying features of zzso zzso and the state-of-the-art methodology used to identify zzso genes via zzso gene expression zzso Future adoption of standards in this field will allow a clean distinction between zzso zzso gene regulation and other forms of gene zzso resulting from delivery effects and other events unrelated to the zzso zzso
