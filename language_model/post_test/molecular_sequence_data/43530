zzso is a cell surface zzso that is expressed on normal breast zzso zzso cells and zzso in most breast zzso In addition, zzso expressed by zzso cells is zzso differently than zzso expressed by normal zzso This difference in zzso exposes a zzso zzso on zzso cells which is not exposed on normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes this zzso and zzso zzso of breast zzso but only zzso zzso breast tissue zzso 

To create a human zzso that was equivalent to zzso for potential uses in imaging and/or the therapy of breast zzso 

We decided to zzso zzso by zzso using overlap zzso and to this end, designed and constructed a bacterial expression zzso that would allow zzso cloned via unique restriction sites, to be expressed as zzso zzso In this way, we hoped to be able to rapidly evaluate zzso zzso for binding to zzso and to cells and tissue sections that expressed the zzso 

A fully humanized zzso zzso was able to bind zzso zzso as well as breast cancer cells known to express the zzso and tissue zzso generally showing the same zzso as the native zzso In addition, an analysis of zzso expressed with a zzso tag preceded by a factor zzso zzso zzso site suggested that zzso coli zzso signal zzso was able to cleave the factor zzso site, thereby removing the zzso zzso 

We have generated a human zzso that is capable of recognizing a tumor specific zzso expressed by zzso of breast zzso
