In the present work, we studied the zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso gamma zzso in mast zzso Mouse mast cells express zzso receptors for zzso zzso and three zzso receptors for zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso In previous studies we showed that, when zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso but not zzso gamma zzso triggers the release of inflammatory zzso and zzso by mast zzso Upon zzso gamma R zzso mast cells not only release zzso materials, they also zzso particulate and soluble immune zzso We compared the ability of the two zzso gamma zzso zzso to trigger zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso deleted, and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso or zzso gamma zzso We found that zzso gamma zzso but not zzso gamma zzso triggered both zzso and zzso We identified distinct zzso sequences necessary for zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and we observed that two zzso zzso located in each of these zzso are critical for zzso and/or zzso Our data indicate that the two zzso pathways diverge as early as signal zzso
