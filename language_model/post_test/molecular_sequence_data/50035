About 30 languages of southern Africa, spoken by zzso and zzso are characterized by a repertoire of click consonants and phonetic zzso The zzso zzso zzso San carry multiple deeply coalescing gene zzso The deep genetic diversity of the San parallels the diversity among the languages they zzso zzso the language of the zzso of eastern Africa, although not closely related to any other language, shares click consonants and accompaniments with languages of zzso and zzso 

We present original Y zzso and zzso variation of zzso and other ethnic groups of Tanzania and Y zzso variation of San and peoples of the central African zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the context of comparable published data for other African zzso analyses of each of these independently inherited DNA segments indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are separated by genetic distance as great or greater than that between any other pair of African zzso zzso tree zzso indicates a zzso separation of the ancient ancestors of these zzso zzso That genetic divergence does not appear to be the result of recent gene flow from neighboring zzso 

The deep genetic divergence among zzso peoples of Africa and mounting linguistic evidence suggest that click consonants date to early in the history of modern zzso At least two explanations remain zzso zzso may have persisted for tens of thousands of years, independently in multiple zzso as a neutral zzso zzso zzso may have been zzso because they zzso an advantage during hunting in certain zzso
