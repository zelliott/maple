zzso protein plays an important role in zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of native and modified zzso protein containing an zzso zzso motif on the zzso and migration of zzso zzso 

A modified human zzso gene containing an zzso motif was obtained by rapid zzso zzso zzso human native and modified zzso proteins were then obtained and zzso The effects of the native and the modified version on the zzso and migration of zzso cells were examined in the presence or absence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso native and modified zzso proteins were successfully obtained and significantly promoted the zzso and migration of human zzso cells in zzso and the construct with the zzso motif was more zzso The enhanced zzso and migration were blocked by zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso promotes zzso cell zzso and zzso modified zzso was more effective than native zzso and this is zzso by the zzso zzso motif and zzso in a zzso zzso
