While much has been learned in recent years about the movement of soluble transport factors across the nuclear pore complex zzso comparatively little is known about zzso zzso We isolated the previously identified zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by an zzso designed to find nuclear envelope zzso associated proteins that are not zzso We localized both zzso and a closely related protein that we termed zzso to zzso structures stretching from the zzso face of the zzso into the zzso similar to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be imported into the nucleus by virtue of a nuclear zzso sequence zzso within its zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso can form large structures within the nucleus which exclude zzso but appear highly permeable to zzso zzso cells harboring a double deletion of zzso and zzso were viable, although they showed a slower net rate of active nuclear import and faster passive zzso of a reporter zzso Our data indicate that the zzso zzso are not merely zzso proteins but that they can be part of zzso peripheral zzso zzso In addition, we suggest that the zzso filaments could provide zzso zzso or tracks to guide the efficient zzso of zzso between the zzso and the zzso
