The zzso are a family of large zzso channels in the outer membrane of zzso bacteria that are involved in protein zzso In zzso zzso and many other zzso bacteria, the zzso zzso targets the zzso zzso to the outer zzso allowing a functional type II zzso system to be zzso Here, the crystal structure of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bound to its zzso zzso is zzso In solution, this zzso region of the zzso is zzso The zzso zzso folds on binding to the zzso to form just under four turns of zzso which bind tightly up against the first zzso of the zzso so that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can bind to the zzso surface of the zzso The zzso zzso binds parallel to the first part of the fourth zzso of the zzso An zzso zzso encourages zzso formation and binding by interacting zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso complex of the zzso zzso described here is a paradigm for this interaction in the zzso family of zzso which is essential for the correct assembly of the type II zzso system of several potent human adversaries, including zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso
