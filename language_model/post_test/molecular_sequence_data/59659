Attempts to analyze variation in the rates of molecular evolution among zzso lineages have been hampered by paucity of data and by zzso zzso Using zzso independent zzso we test three explanations for rate variation which predict correlations between rate variation and generation time, zzso rate, and body zzso zzso and nuclear zzso protein coding, zzso and zzso sequences from 61 zzso species representing 14 orders are used to compare the relative rates of sequence zzso zzso analyses performed on differences in genetic distance since common origin of each pair against differences in body mass, generation time, and zzso rate reveal that substitution rate at fourfold zzso sites in two out of three protein sequences is zzso correlated with generation zzso In addition, there is a relationship between the rate of molecular evolution and body size for two zzso zzso No evidence is found for an effect of zzso rate on rate of sequence zzso zzso causes of variation in substitution rate between species are zzso
