In this study, a zzso of 34 zzso acids from the Mr 40,000 C zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found to mediate zzso zzso zzso Treatment of the Mr 40,000 zzso with zzso generated one major Mr 17,000 zzso that was capable of binding zzso zzso acid sequence data placed the Mr 17,000 zzso within zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso After analyzing this sequence for highly zzso segments within the zzso from other species (which bind P) and segments of low similarity within human zzso mouse zzso and alpha zzso (which do not bind zzso a zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso was zzso This synthetic zzso bound to P and inhibited its binding to zzso In addition, it exhibited negative regulatory activity on the alternative zzso as it inhibited the zzso of rabbit zzso by normal human zzso These results show that the zzso site is located within the zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso
