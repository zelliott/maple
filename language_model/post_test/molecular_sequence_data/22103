In zzso zzso were found in zzso and in the zzso Here, we report for the first time the identification and characterization of a zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso mantle using an expressed sequence tag zzso To gain insight into potential roles of zzso in oyster zzso we produced the zzso zzso in zzso coli, characterized its zzso activities, determined its solution structure by zzso zzso and zzso its gene expression in zzso following bacterial challenge of zzso zzso zzso was active in zzso against zzso bacteria but showed no or limited activities against zzso bacteria and zzso The activity of zzso was retained in zzso at a salt concentration similar to that of zzso The zzso structure shares the so-called zzso zzso motif zzso with zzso zzso but is characterized by the presence of an additional zzso bond, as previously observed in the zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, despite a similar global fold, the zzso and zzso structures mainly differ by the size of their zzso and by the presence of two zzso zzso in zzso Distribution of zzso zzso in various oyster zzso revealed that zzso is mainly expressed in mantle edge where it was detected by mass zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed that the zzso zzso concentration was unchanged after bacterial zzso Our results suggest that zzso gene is continuously expressed in the mantle and would play a key role in oyster by providing a first line of defense against pathogen zzso
