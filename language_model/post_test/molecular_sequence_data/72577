One candidate for a zzso factor in early zzso development is zzso a member of the zzso beta zzso zzso of a truncated form of an zzso zzso Type zzso zzso zzso responsiveness and zzso formation in zzso The zzso Type zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from the Type zzso zzso by 43 and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, suggesting the possibility of different functions in zzso In this paper, we compare the Type zzso zzso with the Type zzso to test such a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso receptors reveals minimal differences, but experiments with dominant negative zzso of each zzso show zzso distinct zzso We show that while truncated zzso zzso Type zzso receptors cause zzso defects as previously zzso truncated type zzso receptors cause formation of secondary zzso similar to those seen by zzso of truncated receptors for zzso another zzso beta family zzso Furthermore, in animal cap zzso truncated type zzso receptors inhibit induction of all zzso markers tested, while truncated type zzso receptors suppress induction only of zzso zzso the zzso marker zzso is virtually zzso The suppression of zzso development by the type zzso truncated zzso suggests either that the truncated Type zzso zzso interferes with zzso zzso zzso or that zzso signaling through the Type zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso
