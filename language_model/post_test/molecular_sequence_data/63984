zzso zzso 5 gene zzso belongs to the human zzso zzso family, zzso by zzso highly similar and zzso active zzso High levels of zzso zzso are restricted to the zzso zzso and are essential for the maintenance of normal gestation in zzso zzso We have investigated here the nature of the zzso factors that recognize the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso regulatory sequences that significantly contribute to zzso zzso promoter zzso Both elements bear a similar zzso zzso and zzso complex formation, as well as promoter activity, is largely dependent on the integrity of these zzso zzso zzso shift, super gel shift and zzso experiments clearly demonstrate that the ubiquitous specificity protein 1 zzso is the major zzso factor involved in complex formation with both zzso elements in normal term zzso tissue and in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments indicate that zzso activates zzso promoter zzso In addition, we show that zzso is indeed zzso with zzso genes in the zzso cells, stressing its potential role in the in zzso regulation of zzso zzso
