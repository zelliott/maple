We cloned the zzso zzso zzso by using the human zzso zzso as a probe and prepared an zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that is specific to the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibited a zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso indicating that the zzso protein is required for an zzso of zzso zzso caused by loss of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein located in the zzso prominently in a periphery of the zzso of cells arrested with zzso and seemed to move into the zzso by loss of zzso zzso Also, we found a molecular shift of the zzso protein in cells showing premature zzso zzso zzso in addition to normal zzso zzso This zzso appeared depending on an zzso of zzso zzso
