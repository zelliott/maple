The imprinted zzso region on mouse zzso 12 contains six imprinted genes and a number of zzso expressed zzso and zzso Here we present a high-resolution sequence analysis of the zzso segment zzso to zzso in mouse and a zzso comparison to the zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso end of the analyzed sequence are zzso zzso suggesting that the imprinted domain does not extend beyond the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso experiments support the predicted presence of a zzso expressed zzso zzso encompassing zzso zzso and zzso These zzso expressed zzso and also the zzso zzso show pronounced expression in the adult mouse brain, whereas the zzso transcribed zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in different zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expressed genes might be an important feature of this zzso
