zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potentially zzso zzso disorder of skeletal muscle that may be triggered by inhalation zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso localized on human zzso zzso have been proposed to be responsible for zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid mapping panel, we were able to determine that four closely linked zzso repeat markers zzso zzso with the order zzso zzso Application of the four markers to genetic studies of zzso showed zzso between the markers and zzso in two families, with linkage analysis apparently excluding the zzso locus from the zzso region of zzso These results therefore support the recent observations of genetic zzso in zzso
