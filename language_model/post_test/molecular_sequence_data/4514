A positive selection scheme is described that selects for zzso zzso zzso The scheme is based on the rescue of zzso under zzso conditions, of zzso zzso strains that are conditional for zzso zzso and are defective in zzso zzso Transport defective strains were generated by selection for resistance to the lethal zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance was shown to be a zzso single gene trait that resulted from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as suggested by previous zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated by cloning zzso a zzso zzso zzso into a zzso containing zzso and transforming a strain disrupted in zzso Thus, zzso on zzso acid causes the loss of zzso synthesis zzso The gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned using this zzso The predicted zzso zzso acid zzso is a member of the major zzso zzso of zzso and thus possesses 12 zzso spanning segments with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso in the coding region were characterized that result in greatly reduced ability to transport zzso The level of zzso zzso was found to be rapidly and dramatically reduced by the addition of zzso to the growth zzso
