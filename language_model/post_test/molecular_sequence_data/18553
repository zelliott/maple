zzso zzso zzso within a plant is critical for plant survival under zzso zzso In this paper, a soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso A marked induction of zzso transcript was observed in young leaves, mature leaves and lateral roots during long-term zzso zzso zzso tobacco plants containing the zzso gene were obtained using an zzso transformation zzso Compared with zzso plants, transgenic plants showed significant increases in zzso efficiency zzso zzso II zzso function, total dry weight and seed weight under zzso zzso zzso expression levels and zzso were determined in a soybean zzso zzso line population during a pot experiment that was conducted to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso ) and seed zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression levels had significantly positive correlations with seed yield, zzso zzso and the quantum yield of zzso primary zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative trait zzso zzso mapping for zzso revealed two zzso one of which coincided with both the physical location of zzso and a zzso associated with seed zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso and it may be possible to improve soybean seed yields under zzso conditions by modulating zzso expression zzso
