The zzso female zzso tract has an abundance of complement zzso which play a vital role in protection against zzso zzso zzso may be protected against zzso damage by complement regulatory zzso including membrane zzso protein zzso zzso accelerating factor zzso and zzso However, zzso from zzso zzso zzso do not express zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether zzso zzso may be protected against zzso damage by expression of zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso We demonstrate here that, like zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice express both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are generated by two distinct but closely related zzso We show that in contrast to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso are generated by alternative zzso of a single copy zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins are broadly distributed on zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso mice as well as zzso mice, with expression on the zzso neck and zzso Thus, despite not expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso may be protected against zzso injury in the female zzso tract by zzso and zzso
