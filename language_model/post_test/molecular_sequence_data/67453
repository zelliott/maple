Emerging evidence has demonstrated that zzso expression of zzso in human cancer bodes for poor zzso The regulatory mechanism controlling zzso expression in cancer remains to be zzso In the present study, we have isolated and characterized the human zzso promoter in terms of regulation of zzso gene zzso A zzso zzso zzso of human zzso DNA containing the zzso sequence of the zzso gene possesses both zzso and zzso zzso zzso a deletion zzso approach, a zzso zzso zzso region was defined as the basic zzso promoter containing a zzso close to the zzso start zzso A combination of zzso extension study with zzso DNA sequencing analysis revealed one major zzso start site that is zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso zzso zzso promoter contains putative zzso regulatory zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso sites are required for zzso gene zzso Further analyses using an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed the requirement of these zzso and zzso elements in controlling zzso gene zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso expression in human breast cancer specimens correlated with zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso of DNA zzso in regulation of zzso expression was zzso in human breast cancer cell zzso Taken together, our study unraveled the regulatory mechanisms controlling zzso gene expression in human zzso
