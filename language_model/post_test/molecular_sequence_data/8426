zzso of zzso with the nuclear envelope and zzso is thought to help determine higher order zzso organization in the zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that nuclear zzso bind zzso zzso Here we have localized a zzso binding site to the zzso tail zzso of both A- and zzso zzso zzso and have characterized the zzso properties of this binding in zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins containing the tail zzso of zzso zzso C, zzso and B2 were analyzed for their ability to associate with rat liver zzso fragments immobilized on zzso plate zzso We found that all three zzso tails specifically bind to zzso with apparent zzso of zzso zzso By examining a series of deletion zzso we have mapped the zzso binding region of the zzso C tail to zzso acids zzso a segment immediately adjacent to the rod zzso Furthermore, by analysis of zzso zzso we found that core zzso constitute the principal zzso binding component for the zzso C zzso Through zzso this zzso interaction could be involved in specifying the high zzso attachment of zzso to the nuclear envelope in zzso
