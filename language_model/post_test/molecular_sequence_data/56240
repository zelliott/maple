zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso protein composed of two identical zzso each possessing three separate zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso A number of zzso of zzso the structural gene that encodes zzso nitrate zzso have been characterized at the molecular zzso zzso nonsense zzso of zzso were found to possess a truncated protein detected by a specific zzso whereas zzso nonsense zzso showed restoration of the zzso full-length nitrate zzso zzso The zzso show zzso expression of the truncated nitrate zzso zzso however normal control, which requires nitrate zzso was restored in the suppressed zzso zzso Three conventional zzso zzso were isolated by the zzso chain reaction and zzso two of these zzso were due to the deletion of a single base in the coding region for the zzso domain, the third zzso was a nonsense zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to occur when a deleted zzso gene was introduced by transformation into a host strain with a single point zzso in the resident zzso zzso zzso severely damaged, zzso zzso zzso were created by zzso point zzso and demonstrated to be useful as host strains for transformation zzso
