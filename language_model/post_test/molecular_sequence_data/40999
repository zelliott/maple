zzso gene transfer zzso plays a major role in zzso and evolution of bacteria and zzso by controlling gene distribution within an zzso However, information that links zzso to a natural community using relevant zzso parameters and spatial considerations is zzso The Great Salt Lake zzso zzso provides an excellent model for studying zzso in the context of zzso because it is a zzso system with zzso limitations due to a strong selective zzso zzso We zzso that in spite of the barrier to zzso zzso functional zzso the form of zzso beyond zzso limitations due to selective zzso 

To zzso the functional genes and zzso throughout the zzso we used a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a functional gene array zzso to measure zzso patterns of nine microbial zzso We found a significant difference in zzso based on zzso analyses when comparing zzso similarity values for zzso of function and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patterns exhibit behavior associated with horizontal gene transfer in that informational genes zzso zzso have a lower similarity than functional zzso and functional similarity is positively correlated with zzso selective zzso Specifically, high zzso of zzso throughout zzso zzso to an average similarity of zzso resistance genes that is zzso higher than zzso zzso This suggests active zzso may be measured at the population level in microbial communities and these zzso patterns may serve as a model to study bacteria adaptation and zzso
