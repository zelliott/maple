In this paper we report newly selected artificial zzso that enhance the zzso values comparable with or higher than those of the zzso zzso with broad zzso zzso The elements required for the zzso of Group I zzso zzso are concentrated in the zzso domain of their core region, which consists of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previously, we reported the in zzso selection of artificial zzso residing at the peripheral region of a zzso Group I zzso lacking zzso We found that derivatives of the zzso containing the zzso performed the reversal of the first step of the zzso reaction efficiently by using their affinity to the zzso zzso although their zzso values and zzso specificity were zzso and zzso zzso The results show that it is possible to add a variety of new zzso at the peripheral region that play a role comparable with that of the zzso zzso zzso
