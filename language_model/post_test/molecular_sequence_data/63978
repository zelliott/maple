zzso genetic analysis of zzso has been slowed by the usual practice of preservation and storage of samples in dilute zzso solutions, which are not always adequately zzso for zzso We report here the determination of DNA sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso preserved and stored in zzso zzso for up to 25 zzso zzso designed molecular protocols for DNA extraction and zzso amplification yielded valid sequence data for short zzso zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso b zzso gene for individual zzso Critical aspects of our approach include: extended extraction and zzso zzso to maximize DNA zzso use of protocols requiring short DNA zzso design of zzso zzso zzso to minimize risks of contamination by zzso zzso and comparison with published DNA sequences for the same gene and zzso We conclude that the yield of DNA and the success of subsequent molecular analyses depend primarily on the length of time the tissue has been exposed to zzso and the pH of the zzso zzso samples intended for molecular analysis should preferably be preserved and maintained in ethanol or zzso but long-term storage in zzso zzso does not zzso some types of molecular genetic zzso
