We have cloned a new zzso zzso from zzso zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence of which does not exhibit overall similarity to any known zzso zzso A weak resemblance between the zzso part of the zzso protein and regulatory zzso of zzso protein zzso from zzso as well as the zzso protein of zzso coli was zzso The zzso gene resides on the left arm of zzso X and codes for a zzso of molecular weight around 160 zzso By zzso zzso the zzso protein appears to be localized to the nuclear envelope and to the zzso zzso zzso However, no signal sequence or zzso region exists, suggesting that the zzso protein is attached to the zzso surface of the zzso envelope zzso zzso of the zzso gene is not lethal but results in cells of decreased zzso abnormal zzso and increased DNA zzso This zzso is not zzso by transformation with a zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso of zzso deletion zzso strains among each other or with unrelated strains lead to irregular segregation of genetic zzso Taken together the data suggest that the zzso protein is required during cell division for faithful zzso of the zzso envelope zzso which in zzso zzso zzso the duplicated zzso
