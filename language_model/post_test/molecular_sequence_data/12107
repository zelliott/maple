A zzso irregular zzso adhering to zzso bone excavated from the zzso cave zzso and estimated to date from zzso years zzso was examined to verify its zzso nature, suggested previously on the basis of optical and electron microscopic zzso zzso of the organic component revealed the presence of type II and IX zzso associated with residual zzso in the external zone of the zzso The zzso nature of the zzso was also demonstrated by zzso identification of type II collagen as the major protein in the zzso zzso the zzso acid compositions of zzso and soluble zzso were similar to that of pure type II zzso zzso zzso prepared after reduction of the sample, had an zzso pattern similar to that of zzso zzso peptides derived from type II zzso The zzso acid sequences of four zzso peptides were identical to the corresponding human type II zzso It was impossible to isolate intact alpha zzso All of the zzso zzso were composed of a wide range of zzso peptides demonstrating significant degradation of the collagen molecules that was not reflected in the zzso zzso structure observed at the zzso zzso The mineral zzso characterized by X-ray zzso consisted of zzso (as in zzso zzso associated with zzso poorly zzso components originating from the cave zzso Energy zzso zzso showed that the zzso zone contained three times less zzso and calcium than the underlying zzso These results confirm the zzso nature of the sample and the preservation of zzso zzso and suggest that the process of zzso is closely related to a mechanism of zzso
