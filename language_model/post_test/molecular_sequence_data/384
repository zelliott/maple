A comparison is made among all the models proposed to explain the origin of the zzso zzso The conclusion reached is that, for the model predicting that the zzso zzso originated after the assembly of two zzso structures, molecular fossils have been found in the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso These might be the witnesses of the transition stage predicted by the model through which the evolution of the zzso zzso passed, thus providing considerable corroboration for this zzso
