zzso tobacco zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso a limited array of proteins zzso into its floral zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of tobacco zzso revealed that a broad protein band from 61 to 65 zzso actually consists of five discrete protein zzso zzso sequencing and zzso zzso mass zzso fingerprint analysis demonstrated that the upper three bands are zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the lower two bands, zzso zzso zzso are related to each other but not to zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso based upon zzso sequence of zzso generated a short zzso that zzso the N zzso of the zzso zzso Two rounds of zzso using zzso DNA permitted the isolation of approximately one-half of the coding region of the zzso gene along with 787 zzso of the zzso zzso This DNA zzso was used as a probe to isolate a near full-length zzso clone from a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified the zzso zzso as a zzso bridge zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence corresponded to peptides that were identified by zzso zzso mass zzso fingerprint analysis of the zzso zzso thereby confirming that this zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated that zzso contains a zzso linked zzso and it possesses zzso zzso zzso zzso expression analyses showed that zzso expression is limited exclusively to the zzso zzso during late stages of floral zzso
