A novel zzso strain zzso was isolated from sand zzso of zzso Beach in zzso Korea, and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso which produced zzso zzso yellow zzso with a zzso zzso showed the following zzso zzso zzso acid as the zzso acid in the zzso zzso as the major zzso zzso as the only polar zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso as major fatty acids and a DNA zzso content of zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso features supported its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequence studies, showed that strain zzso formed an intermediate branch between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarity calculations based on a zzso analysis revealed that the closest relatives of strain zzso were the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on a broad set of zzso and genetic data, it was evident that the strain represents a novel species of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
