A high zzso zzso zzso was raised in a rabbit against the coat protein of zzso mosaic zzso zzso by injecting a preparation of zzso coat protein zzso from a fusion protein expressed in zzso zzso The fusion protein consisted of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso and the viral coat protein separated by the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso The fusion protein was zzso by the zzso zzso which was constructed by cloning a modified coat protein gene to the 3' end of the zzso zzso coding zzso The coat protein gene was modified by zzso zzso so that the zzso start zzso in the original construct was replaced by the zzso zzso deleting the zzso restriction site zzso and creating a unique zzso site zzso zzso restriction with zzso resulted in a DNA zzso with zzso as the first three zzso This zzso encodes zzso which is the proposed zzso zzso acid zzso of the mature native coat zzso This modified coat protein coding region was zzso directly behind the zzso code for the zzso acid recognition sequence for factor zzso zzso was induced with zzso and the zzso fusion protein was extracted from the bacterial zzso by zzso zzso column affinity zzso and the two zzso separated by factor zzso zzso The coat protein was then zzso from the zzso binding protein by zzso exchange zzso in buffer containing 6 M zzso A highly zzso sample which contained 150 zzso of both full-length and truncated coat zzso was recovered from a zzso of bacterial zzso The zzso reacted with native coat protein in zzso zzso and with zzso coat proteins expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso with little or no zzso with zzso zzso
