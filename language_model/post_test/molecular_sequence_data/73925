zzso zzso is a zzso zzso produced by zzso cells in response to many microbial zzso zzso plays an important role in the generation of T helper zzso cells, which favor zzso immune zzso zzso is composed of two different zzso zzso and zzso whose expression can be regulated zzso or zzso zzso cells, the major producers of zzso can be primed by zzso zzso to produce optimal amounts of zzso in response to zzso stimulation as a consequence of bacterial zzso The zzso effect is exerted primarily at the zzso level on the zzso promoter in conjunction with the effects of zzso possibly by inducing specific zzso factors, which individually have no direct effect but which zzso can activate the zzso We examined in detail one of these zzso interactions observed around an zzso element situated at zzso of the zzso promoter, which is known to be a functionally critical zzso This region interacts with a nuclear complex termed F1 that appears to be highly zzso by either zzso treatment for 16 h or zzso stimulation for 8 zzso F1 binding to the zzso site requires a considerable amount of spacing around the zzso site, as revealed by gel mobility shift and in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments and DNA affinity zzso indicated that both zzso and a novel, zzso related protein with an approximate molecular mass of 109 zzso are part of the F1 complex, together with additional components including zzso and zzso This novel protein is designated zzso for its zzso by zzso or zzso Its possible role in the zzso of the zzso zzso promoter is zzso
