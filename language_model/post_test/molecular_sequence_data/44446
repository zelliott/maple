zzso is a secondary zzso of zzso and zzso zzso strains with strong zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been correlated with the ability of some bacteria to control plant diseases caused by zzso zzso including the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to produce zzso and to be an effective zzso agent for this zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso DNA zzso from this strain that contains genes involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of this DNA with zzso revealed the presence of a zzso region that contains genes required for the synthesis of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso region was determined and found to contain a cluster of four genes that are required for the production of zzso zzso zzso in any of the four genes resulted in a zzso zzso The putative coding sequences of the four individual genes were cloned by zzso and fused to the zzso promoter from zzso zzso In each case, the appropriate zzso zzso gene fusion was shown to complement the zzso zzso of the corresponding deletion zzso Transfer of the four gene cluster to zzso coli resulted in the production of zzso by this zzso thereby demonstrating that the four genes are sufficient for the production of this zzso and represent all of the genes required to zzso the zzso for zzso zzso
