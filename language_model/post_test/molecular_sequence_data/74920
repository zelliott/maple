We have found that chain A of zzso contains two zzso zzso that show closest similarity to those of zzso Most zzso the two proteins zzso after the primary zzso of a single zzso domain as the two zzso zzso of zzso are more similar, especially in zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso of zzso than to each zzso We also propose that the zzso zzso parts of zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso We suggest that zzso may act as an inhibitor of the zzso zzso responsible for bone zzso We have also found that zzso is closely related to zzso
