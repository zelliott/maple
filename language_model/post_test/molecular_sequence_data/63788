Type III zzso systems zzso are present in many zzso zzso bacteria and mediate the zzso of bacterial zzso proteins into host zzso Here, we report the zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which the genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso either independently or zzso Like zzso we found that zzso is zzso by the zzso and its zzso requires the zzso zzso Upon infection of zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso exhibited the same invasive capacity as the zzso strain and the zzso zzso was 50% less zzso Upon infection of zzso zzso the zzso zzso did not show a significant zzso in invasion and the zzso zzso was slightly more invasive than the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in polarized cells was reduced by zzso compared to the zzso zzso Upon infection of the cornea in zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso a more pronounced zzso response, while the zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso The attenuated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed using a zzso pulmonary model of infection and zzso and zzso zzso
