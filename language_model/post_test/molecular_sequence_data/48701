zzso zzso zzso X zzso is a zzso protein zzso by the zzso gene at zzso In response to stress or zzso its levels increase zzso zzso of this gene is also elevated significantly in zzso zzso of the inactive zzso colitis zzso However, accurate information about its several transcripts is still zzso and additional evidence for its escape from zzso zzso remains to be obtained in order to help settle a debate (He zzso zzso C, Yang zzso Does the zzso gene escape from zzso zzso J zzso zzso 2011, zzso zzso 

Two major zzso zzso start sites were identified by primer extension at zzso and zzso as well as a minor start site at zzso zzso from the initiation zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of the zzso gene showed that there was little zzso zzso zzso in a normal male, and that none of zzso zzso in the zzso island approached 50% zzso in zzso 

The actual length of first zzso of the zzso gene was found to be about a quarter larger than that originally zzso Its transcripts result from a slippery zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso island provides additional evidence for the variable escape of the zzso gene from zzso zzso which could influence the range of severity of zzso zzso an inherited error in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
