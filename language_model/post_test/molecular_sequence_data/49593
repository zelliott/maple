We evaluated zzso in the zzso alpha zzso region zzso zzso for association with type 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso in two ethnic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were identified by alignment of overlapping human expressed sequence tags zzso zzso ambiguities were zzso confirmed and zzso zzso to test for association with zzso in 75 unrelated Caucasians with zzso zzso 95 unrelated Caucasian controls and, in a parallel study, 92 unrelated African Americans with type 2 zzso zzso 95 unrelated African Americans with zzso zzso and 86 unrelated African American zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha protein levels were measured in healthy Caucasians (N zzso zzso and African Americans (N zzso zzso to evaluate association between zzso and protein zzso 

A zzso in the 3' zzso of the human zzso gene was associated with zzso and zzso alpha protein zzso The zzso consists of two single zzso zzso zzso and an zzso generating four different zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso deleted for four internal zzso zzso The 4 zzso deletion zzso zzso was significantly less common among Caucasian zzso zzso and African American zzso zzso patients zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso In zzso this zzso is associated with the amount of zzso alpha protein zzso in zzso zzso from healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso additive zzso with the zzso zzso associated with higher levels of zzso zzso zzso 

The association of the zzso zzso with higher levels of zzso alpha expression and reduced risk for zzso is consistent with involvement of zzso in risk for developing zzso
