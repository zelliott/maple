The zzso protein domain is common throughout all zzso of life and is characterized by an active site zzso zzso that is able to bind zzso sulfur and zzso sulfur zzso No unique function has been attributed to zzso zzso most probably because of their diversity at both the level of sequence and protein domain zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso properties of an unusual zzso zzso zzso from zzso strain zzso which we have previously shown to be zzso expressed under zzso zzso with zzso The zzso of the zzso protein is its domain architecture which is constituted of two zzso zzso each with an active site zzso The zzso zzso domain is preceded by a zzso signal zzso zzso zzso on the outside of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was measured for both zzso contrasting with other zzso zzso in which usually only the zzso domain has been found to be zzso The genetic context of zzso shows that it is part of a zzso zzso displaying zzso with gene clusters zzso respiratory zzso of the zzso family, possibly involved in the reduction of sulfur zzso Our data suggest, however, that the presence of zzso in the medium is responsible for the high expression of zzso in zzso where it could play a role in the sulfur zzso of the zzso
