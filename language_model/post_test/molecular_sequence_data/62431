A moderately zzso zzso strain zzso capable of degrading zzso was isolated from a composting system of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence revealed that the zzso belongs to the zzso zzso A zzso zzso A ( zzso was zzso from culture fluid of the zzso grown in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was achieved mainly by exploiting its binding to the zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso was estimated to be 70 zzso and the zzso point approximately zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing revealed a sequence of zzso which had high zzso zzso zzso with that of zzso A1 from zzso zzso zzso The pH and temperature zzso were determined to be zzso and 70 degrees C, zzso The zzso was classified as a retaining zzso zzso and was most active against partially zzso zzso Its activities towards the partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were about zzso zzso and zzso higher than towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso almost exclusively into zzso zzso of zzso was observed by the addition of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the partially zzso zzso produced zzso with a degree of zzso ranging from zzso these are products that offer potential application for functional zzso zzso
