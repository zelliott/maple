We isolated a DNA zzso zzso zzso a protein with an activity of aluminum tolerance from an Al tolerant soil zzso zzso zzso This zzso was isolated from zzso tea field zzso The cloned DNA is composed of zzso zzso which has one zzso frame without any stop zzso However, when the DNA zzso was transferred into zzso coli, a zzso susceptible to Al zzso it endowed zzso coli with Al zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the DNA showed zzso identity with the protein of zzso gene in zzso coli, and zzso identity with zzso zzso hypothetical protein of zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso gene in the expression zzso produced a protein of 192 zzso acids zzso a molecular weight of zzso zzso by using the stop zzso in zzso The zzso gene is a new one that has the characteristic of Al zzso
