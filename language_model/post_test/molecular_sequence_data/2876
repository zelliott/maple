We have used zzso zzso and gel mobility zzso to analyze the upstream region of the human A zzso gene zzso Four protein factors were found to bind this zzso A zzso factor present in the zzso zzso fraction of a zzso zzso column binds to the zzso box zzso A ubiquitous zzso factor present in the zzso fraction binds to an zzso element zzso but is completed out by the zzso specific factor zzso (in the zzso zzso zzso which binds a site zzso immediately zzso the zzso A novel factor binding to a stretch of zzso around zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso This factor is not present in zzso nuclear zzso To study the zzso importance of these protein binding sites we have used an zzso zzso similar to that described for the zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso This provides evidence that the zzso and zzso box in the zzso to zzso region of the A zzso are important for the efficient expression of the zzso zzso
