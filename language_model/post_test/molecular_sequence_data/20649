The zzso II zzso is a ubiquitous family of zzso that are essential for zzso zzso zzso II and zzso R degrade zzso in the zzso direction in a zzso and zzso zzso However, although zzso R is capable of degrading highly structured zzso the zzso II activity is impaired by the presence of secondary zzso zzso II and zzso R share structural properties and have a similar modular domain zzso The zzso zzso II zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso one of the most important protein complexes involved in the maintenance of the correct levels of cellular zzso In the present study, we constructed truncated zzso II and zzso R proteins and point zzso and characterized them regarding their zzso activity and zzso zzso We report that zzso is crucial for zzso R activity without affecting zzso zzso When zzso was changed to zzso the final product changed from 2 to 5 zzso in zzso showing that this zzso is responsible for setting the zzso We have shown that the zzso domain of zzso II has zzso zzso The most striking result is that the zzso R zzso domain itself degrades zzso zzso even in the absence of a zzso Moreover, we have demonstrated for the first time that the zzso recognition of zzso R depends on the zzso zzso that target the degradation of zzso that are zzso by a zzso These results can have important implications for the study of zzso zzso degradation zzso
