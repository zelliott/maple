We report the development of a system for displaying zzso zzso fragments on zzso zzso in a manner that effectively mimics the binding behavior of natural zzso In the zzso zzso format, two copies of zzso binding sites are displayed on the coat of a single zzso zzso zzso display was first achieved by the zzso of a zzso domain, consisting of an zzso hinge region and a zzso zzso zzso zzso between a zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso minor coat zzso In a zzso display system, the resulting zzso particles display zzso zzso that resemble natural zzso An important functional consequence of zzso display is an zzso effect, which results in a greatly reduced zzso for zzso bound to immobilized zzso The zzso effect improved the capture and retention of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso both with zzso immobilized on plates and with cell surface zzso To examine the requirements for zzso display on zzso we systematically trimmed down the zzso domain and found that a single zzso was sufficient to zzso the same zzso effect zzso by the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display should be useful for many zzso In particular, the technology should aid in the production of zzso against difficult zzso and also, in selections that require zzso for zzso
