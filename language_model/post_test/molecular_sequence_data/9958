zzso zzso heavy chain zzso genes provide unique zzso markers for B zzso Since amplification of the rearranged gene by zzso chain reaction zzso and demonstrating that the amplified sequence is indeed derived from tumor cells is more problematic in zzso zzso zzso than in other B cell zzso we used a comprehensive zzso primer set and formulated stringent selection criteria to identify zzso rearranged zzso zzso zzso zzso genes amplified from zzso DNA were considered to be of tumor origin if they were zzso and if the same zzso was amplified with at least two independent zzso zzso From 11 of 13 zzso zzso and high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso was studied in four zzso and detected in two of zzso zzso using a zzso primer followed by Southern zzso of zzso product with a specific probe allowed detection of zzso DNA after zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were detected in patient blood and bone zzso samples which were negative by zzso and zzso zzso Thus, also in zzso and high-grade zzso lymphoma, sensitive minimal disease detection using the rearranged zzso gene as a marker appears zzso
