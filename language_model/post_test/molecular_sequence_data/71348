zzso maintain the order and zzso of the zzso cell cycle, and defects in checkpoints contribute to genetic instability and zzso Much of our current understanding of checkpoints comes from genetic studies conducted in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of both the DNA damage and DNA replication zzso The zzso and zzso protein zzso function downstream of zzso zzso is an zzso of the DNA damage checkpoint and, in the absence of zzso serves an essential function in the DNA replication zzso zzso functions in the DNA replication checkpoint and in the S phase DNA damage zzso Human zzso of both zzso and zzso but not zzso have been zzso Here we report the identification of a human zzso zzso a protein zzso zzso that shares zzso zzso and functional similarity to zzso zzso was modified by zzso and activated in response to zzso zzso It was also modified in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was required for zzso modification after zzso radiation but not after zzso zzso Like its zzso zzso counterpart, human zzso zzso zzso to promote the binding of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the checkpoint function of zzso is zzso in zzso and zzso
