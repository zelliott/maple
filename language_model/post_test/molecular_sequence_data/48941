Numerous miniature zzso repeat zzso elements zzso are present in the rice zzso but their zzso mechanisms are zzso In this report, we present evidence that two novel zzso families may have arisen from zzso zzso elements and thus may use a zzso mechanism similar to that of zzso zzso Two families of novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by searching for zzso zzso with zzso a previously identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso bear hallmarks of zzso zzso such as long terminal zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and putative zzso binding zzso zzso the zzso family has a zzso zzso identical to that of a rice zzso element ( zzso and the zzso family has an zzso zzso identical to that of the zzso autonomous zzso element zzso A putative zzso zzso to zzso protein is identified for the zzso zzso Thus, these two novel zzso families, with a total copy number of several hundred in rice, are designated zzso zzso ( zzso Interestingly, sequence zzso analysis of zzso families revealed a number of zzso site zzso zzso in the alignment gaps, and widespread historical zzso events are proposed to account for the existence of these zzso In addition to its value for discovering new zzso the zzso analysis approach used in this study simultaneously identifies zzso zzso zzso
