A novel mouse zzso zzso trap locus 1 zzso was identified in close proximity to a zzso zzso trap integration in the mouse zzso showing a specific zzso zzso pattern during zzso In zzso analysis revealed a widespread but not ubiquitous expression of zzso throughout development with particularly high levels in the central nervous system and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein deduced from the zzso shows strong zzso over a stretch of 500 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso protein involved in the regulation of zzso genes and to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso as well as to the zzso protein and the recently described zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso is the first zzso member of this group of proteins that are implicated in gene regulation and/or influencing zzso zzso The zzso to the regulatory proteins zzso and zzso and the expression pattern during zzso suggest that zzso protein might be involved in gene regulating pathways during mouse zzso
