To zzso the function of group II zzso the gene for the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was cloned and zzso Two distinct genes coding for zzso zzso designated alpha and zzso were zzso and their deduced zzso acid sequences are highly zzso to those of group II zzso from other zzso The alpha and beta zzso were individually expressed in zzso zzso Both of the zzso zzso assemble to constitute the zzso zzso complexes, which are prone to form large zzso The alpha zzso is zzso into the typical zzso ring complex by incubation in buffer containing zzso zzso zzso while the beta zzso cannot be zzso At high temperature, both of the zzso complexes have weak zzso zzso They are able to arrest zzso of a chemically zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and zzso is resumed when zzso is zzso These results suggest that zzso complexes of the zzso zzso have zzso
