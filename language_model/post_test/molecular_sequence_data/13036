zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso were found to zzso to a significant extent with zzso related zzso of the parent zzso where the zzso of each zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or the zzso sequence orientation zzso zzso was zzso or where both modifications were simultaneously introduced zzso zzso All zzso zzso displayed similar recognition properties for zzso and similar zzso zzso effects on the interaction between immobilized parent zzso and corresponding zzso zzso of zzso side chain zzso on zzso was evaluated analyzing the recognition properties of two zzso parent zzso zzso one lacking of the side chains in the sequence odd position and the other in even zzso These two zzso prepared introducing zzso zzso alternatively in the parent zzso zzso were found to zzso to a significant extent with the original zzso raised against the parent zzso Analysis of molecular models of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso of alternating side chains could lead to the formation of similar recognition surfaces, thus mimicking the parent zzso zzso zzso
