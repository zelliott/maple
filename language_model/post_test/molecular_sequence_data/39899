zzso zzso amplification zzso is a novel DNA amplification method that zzso a target sequence specifically under zzso zzso The objective of this study was to identify a Y zzso sequence in water buffalo and to establish an efficient procedure for zzso zzso by zzso The zzso of a Y zzso zzso bovine repeat zzso in swamp and river buffalo were zzso and designated swamp buffalo repeat zzso and river buffalo repeat zzso zzso zzso by zzso was performed using zzso for swamp buffalo repeat zzso A zzso zzso was also amplified by zzso as a control reaction in both male and zzso The minimal amount of the template DNA required for zzso appeared to be zzso zzso The sensitivity was further examined using swamp buffalo zzso as zzso When zzso were zzso with zzso the minimal cell number required for detection of both zzso and zzso common DNA appeared to be two cells, whereas correct determination of sex could not be achieved using zzso zzso by heat zzso zzso zzso was also performed using zzso from zzso nuclear transfer zzso The sex determined by zzso for zzso corresponded with the sex of nuclear donor cells in analyses using four or five zzso as zzso The zzso reaction required only about 45 zzso and the total time for zzso zzso including DNA zzso was about 1 zzso In conclusion, the present procedure without zzso cycling and zzso was reliable and zzso for water buffalo zzso
