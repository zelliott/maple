We have zzso and amplified by zzso the full-length zzso specifying the rat and human precursors of the zzso zzso DNA zzso protein zzso Each deduced sequence is composed of a zzso zzso zzso basic zzso and a mature protein zzso zzso in humans and 135 zzso in the zzso The mature proteins are highly zzso among themselves and with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso Moreover, three regions of the protein are similar to corresponding zzso of the zzso of zzso coli and to the zzso coli zzso factor zzso indicating the existence of a broad class of zzso proteins with structural and functional similarities both in zzso and in zzso zzso of higher zzso
