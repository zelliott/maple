zzso zzso is the principal zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences from the zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and a series of overlapping zzso clones defining zzso zzso zzso regions 1, 2 and 3 have been reported zzso et zzso zzso zzso 176 zzso zzso In the present study, the limits of the zzso zzso DNA around zzso regions 1 and 3 were determined by zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso to probe zzso DNA from the zzso zzso virulent strain zzso and the benign strain zzso This zzso region was found to be zzso zzso zzso in zzso and to be interrupted by a short DNA segment which is also found in the benign zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the entire region revealed an ORF, zzso which is very similar to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso integrate into the 3' ends of zzso zzso with the zzso genes adjacent to the zzso zzso A similar arrangement was found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso sequence was found to be repeated at the ends of the zzso region, and may represent the zzso attachment zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may have acquired these DNA sequences by the integration of a zzso or an zzso zzso that contains a zzso zzso zzso The high similarity of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso from zzso suggests that these zzso sequences may be transferred between zzso related zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
