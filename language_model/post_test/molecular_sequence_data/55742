zzso zzso which serve as source of various zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso and brain of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso two zzso zzso hormone zzso responsible for induction of embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso which share a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso at the C zzso We have isolated zzso clones for zzso from the zzso library of zzso by using zzso zzso The molecular characterization of the zzso reveals that the zzso encodes an open reading frame consisting of 192 zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso is localized at the zzso region just after the signal zzso A zzso search proposed that the zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso and three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the region following zzso all of which are flanked by possible zzso zzso sites and share the zzso sequence at the C zzso Northern zzso analysis clearly showed that the gene expression was limited to zzso We chemically zzso zzso zzso and zzso and used them to identify components in extracts of zzso and to examine biological functions, zzso and zzso were identified in extracts of zzso and the synthetic zzso and zzso expressed weak zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso along with four other zzso is generated from a common precursor zzso that is zzso by a single zzso transcribed in zzso cells of zzso
