zzso exhibit apparent distinctions in gene zzso molecular weight, zzso properties, and zzso zzso In this study, a new zzso gene named zzso was cloned from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene comprised an open reading frame of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The natural signal zzso of zzso was used successfully for the zzso production of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso process that removes an zzso acid sequence of about 20 zzso from the zzso end of zzso was first discovered in zzso zzso An increase in zzso activity by zzso in the presence of 5 zzso zzso was discovered, and zzso at a certain concentration range was positively correlated with zzso zzso The zzso production of zzso coli was zzso times higher than that of zzso These results indicate the potential use of the zzso in the zzso zzso
