zzso production of a zzso beta zzso zzso zzso in affected parts of the brain has been suggested to be the main zzso factor for the development of Alzheimer's Disease zzso The severity of the disease depends not only on the amount of the zzso but also its zzso transition leading to the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the brain of zzso zzso Despite being significant to the understanding of zzso zzso no zzso structures are available for these species due to the zzso nature of zzso that zzso most structural zzso zzso Based on our molecular modeling and zzso studies, we have designed zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that appear to organize zzso into stable zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso revealed the occurrence of two zzso in the zzso and zzso stretches that could be the possible cause for the zzso zzso We did not observe corresponding zzso for the zzso turn in the zzso zzso suggesting the need for the longer length zzso zzso to form the stable zzso promoting zzso Because of the presence of two turns in the zzso zzso which were absent in solid state zzso structures for the zzso we zzso zzso formation might be zzso The zzso information obtained in this work could aid in the development of structural models for toxic zzso formation that could facilitate the development of therapeutic approaches to zzso
