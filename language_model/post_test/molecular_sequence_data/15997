The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso domain of chicken liver fatty acid zzso has been determined by sequencing peptides produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain consists of 300 zzso acid zzso All of the zzso peptides of the zzso domain were isolated and zzso except the segment covered from position 109 to position zzso zzso resulting from zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso filled the missing part and overlapped the complete sequence of the entire zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso domain was determined to be zzso by sequencing the whole domain up to 20 zzso while the zzso zzso was identified as zzso through zzso zzso Y zzso The active site of the zzso domain of chicken fatty acid zzso was suggested to be the zzso on position 101 according to its zzso with other zzso zzso and zzso which have a common structure of zzso with the variable zzso acids X and Y zzso the zzso
