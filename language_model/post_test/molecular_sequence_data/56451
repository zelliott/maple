zzso is a large zzso protein with diverse biological zzso We previously demonstrated that intact zzso as well as an A chain synthetic zzso zzso stimulate tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso increases zzso production by the highly zzso zzso melanoma cell line zzso with no effect on the parental zzso line, which has a low zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso medium results in direct zzso of the zzso to zzso Furthermore, following incubation of zzso cells with zzso zzso is zzso from the cell surface, suggesting that these cells contain binding sites for zzso in close proximity to zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso activity using the synthetic zzso zzso indicates a minimal zzso increase in zzso in the zzso medium of zzso cells grown in the presence of zzso with no increased zzso activity observed in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in zzso experiments which are specific for zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Together these data suggest that degradation of basement membrane proteins by zzso melanoma cells may release fragments (such as zzso which stimulate both the production and activity of zzso zzso such as zzso providing a mechanism for zzso of the zzso capacity of zzso melanoma zzso
