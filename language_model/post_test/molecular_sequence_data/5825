zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the degradation of biologically active zzso Although no atomic structure is available for this zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that its active site resembles closely that of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso One active site zzso of zzso zzso is involved in inhibitor binding by forming hydrogen bonds with the zzso group of a zzso in the zzso position and also zzso in a hydrogen bond network involving zzso zzso alignment data shows that zzso of zzso could play a similar role to zzso of zzso This was investigated by zzso zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso being replaced by zzso zzso This led, in both cases, to decreases in zzso values, of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso essentially due to changes in zzso The Ki values of several zzso were also increased for the zzso zzso In addition, the replacement of zzso of zzso by Ala zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso of zzso The results, coupled with a molecular modeling study, suggest that zzso of zzso zzso to zzso of zzso and that in both zzso a hydrogen bond network exists, involving zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso which is crucial for zzso zzso
