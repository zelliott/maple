Two binding sites for zzso a factor involved in zzso from the zzso early promoter zzso zzso were mapped within the zzso zzso terminal repeats zzso zzso with the observation that zzso was required to initiate zzso from the zzso promoter and with the demonstration that two zzso binding sites were present in the zzso we show that the zzso terminal repeat region was able to promote zzso from the zzso site of the zzso promoter in zzso and in an zzso fashion in zzso The minimum sequence within the zzso capable of directing zzso zzso consists of zzso nine zzso zzso two zzso binding sites and at least one zzso binding zzso This zzso pair zzso possesses the characteristics of an zzso which is induced by zzso The zzso is active in zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso directed by the zzso required zzso and the general zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso factor specifically zzso zzso which zzso with the presence of zzso binding sites between the two zzso recognition zzso
