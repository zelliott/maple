zzso zzso zzso is a widely used tumor marker, especially in the surveillance of zzso cancer zzso Although zzso is also present in some normal zzso it is apparently expressed at higher levels in zzso zzso than in corresponding normal zzso As a first step toward analyzing the regulation of expression of zzso at the zzso level, we have isolated and characterized a zzso clone zzso which contains the entire coding region of the zzso zzso A close correlation exists between the zzso and deduced zzso domain zzso We have determined a cluster of zzso starts for zzso and the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and have zzso their putative zzso zzso of sequence zzso are found as far as approximately 500 zzso upstream from the zzso starts of these zzso but farther upstream they diverge zzso In both cases we were unable to find classic zzso or zzso boxes at their expected zzso To characterize the zzso and zzso zzso we carried out transient zzso zzso with zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene promoter zzso containing approximately 400 zzso upstream from the zzso start, showed nine times higher activity in the zzso than in the zzso cell zzso This indicates that zzso sequences which convey cell zzso expression of the zzso gene are contained within this zzso
