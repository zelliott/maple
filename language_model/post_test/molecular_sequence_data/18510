An effective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from activated zzso A response surface methodology was conducted, and the optimal conditions were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an initial pH of zzso and a temperature of zzso zzso The specific growth rate of zzso zzso on 10 zzso zzso was zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso zzso was superior to the other zzso in previous investigations of zzso zzso zzso zzso paralleled the production of cells, zzso and zzso zzso as well as the release of zzso whereas the carbon distribution and zzso yield varied with zzso zzso The facts that complete degradation only occurred with zzso zzso below 15 zzso and repetitive degradation of 5 zzso zzso could proceed for only three cycles were ascribed to pH decrease (from zzso to zzso though a buffer system was zzso
