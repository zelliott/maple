Bone zzso is a zzso zzso zzso component that is intimately associated with zzso yet the zzso elements of the zzso gene that restrict its expression to zzso cells remain zzso To identify such zzso we analyzed a zzso pair zzso of the zzso promoter that directs zzso expression of a zzso reporter gene and found that the region between zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start is crucial for its zzso zzso We identified an element within this region that binds a protein complex in the nuclear extracts of zzso cells and is required for its zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso that zzso a zzso binding site within this sequence eliminates both its in zzso binding and nearly all of the zzso activity of the zzso pair zzso We further found that the zzso zzso which is able to regulate the zzso zzso promoter, can bind this element and stimulate its zzso activity when zzso in zzso zzso These data represent the first description of an zzso element within the bone zzso promoter and demonstrate its regulation by a member of a family of factors known to be involved in zzso
