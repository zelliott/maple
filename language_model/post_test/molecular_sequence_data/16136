The zzso gene of zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso zzso A, was cloned and its zzso zzso together with that of the zzso regions, was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso A shows significant similarity to the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso beta chain from several zzso This sequence similarity is likely to reflect the structural zzso of zzso shared by both zzso This may indicate that these zzso although zzso different reactions in different zzso zzso have evolved from a common ancestral zzso
