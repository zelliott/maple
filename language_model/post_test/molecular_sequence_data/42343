The molecular and cellular biology of the milk protein zzso is zzso zzso constitutes more than zzso by weight of the total protein associated with the fat zzso membrane of bovine zzso zzso related proteins are abundant in the fat zzso zzso of many other zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso of 526 zzso acids with an zzso zzso signal sequence of 26 zzso zzso which is zzso before zzso in association with the fat zzso zzso zzso analysis and in zzso translation of zzso zzso indicate that the protein associates with zzso in a type I orientation via a single stretch of 27 zzso zzso acids in the approximate middle of the zzso Evidence that zzso is incorporated into fat zzso membrane as a zzso protein and as a zzso oriented peripheral component is zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is significantly zzso to two other zzso zzso finger protein and the zzso nuclear zzso A of zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso with the onset of milk fat zzso toward the end of pregnancy and is maintained throughout zzso The possible function of zzso in the zzso of milk zzso droplets is zzso
