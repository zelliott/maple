zzso zzso II zzso zzso in zzso zzso can terminate zzso via several zzso To study how a mechanism is zzso we analyzed recruitment of zzso which zzso with zzso and zzso to terminate small zzso zzso and other short zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso domain zzso interaction domain zzso zzso which bind the zzso of the Pol II largest zzso zzso and zzso act in zzso zzso and both zzso interact with zzso zzso at zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso shows a fold similar to that of zzso but zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso at zzso the form found zzso to zzso This indicates why zzso zzso near zzso ends of genes and why the zzso termination zzso acts specifically at short Pol zzso zzso zzso recruitment to genes involves a combination of interactions with zzso and zzso
