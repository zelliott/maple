The zzso protein zzso zzso a component of the large zzso of the zzso has an unusual structure, zzso two compact zzso zzso connected by an zzso it interacts with 23 S zzso To obtain information about zzso of zzso zzso (the giant zzso we designed zzso based on the known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strategies were employed to isolate zzso and the zzso gene from zzso zzso these were zzso and zzso We zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli zzso The cloned zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso containing an open reading frame of 579 zzso The deduced protein is composed of 192 zzso zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso The length of the zzso sequence is zzso zzso including six zzso and five zzso Based on alignment analysis, zzso has high similarity among zzso we found zzso agreement of DNA and zzso acid sequences with the other species that have been zzso Based on zzso predictions, there are two zzso sites, five protein zzso C zzso sites, one zzso zzso II zzso site, two zzso zzso zzso sites, three zzso sites, one zzso site, and one zzso protein zzso signature 2 in the zzso protein of zzso zzso The zzso gene can be readily expressed in zzso zzso it zzso with the zzso zzso zzso giving rise to the zzso of an expected zzso zzso which is in good agreement with the predicted molecular zzso This expression product could be used for zzso and further study of its zzso
