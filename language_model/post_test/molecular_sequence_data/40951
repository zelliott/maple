zzso zzso zzso are central for the selection of proteins targeted for degradation by the zzso zzso zzso In this study zzso zzso a major zzso zzso in muscle, has been characterized in Atlantic salmon zzso zzso The protein sequence is highly zzso between zzso and zzso and is characterized by the presence of five zzso motifs related to the identification of protein zzso The zzso structure is zzso between zzso and zzso and contains 9 zzso and 8 zzso The zzso relationship between zzso and two other closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso and zzso grouped together with zzso being more zzso The zzso were expressed in multiple zzso zzso and zzso were most abundant in white muscle and heart whereas zzso had greatest expression in brain, white muscle and zzso The zzso zzso of these zzso zzso was examined in starved fish and fish following different immune zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was increased following food zzso implementing these two genes in degradation of muscle protein during zzso During viral infection zzso expression was not altered, whereas it was increased following stimulation with zzso indicating an onset of zzso processes during inflammatory zzso
