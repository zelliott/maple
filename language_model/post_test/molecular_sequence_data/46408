In bacteria, the zzso zzso coding region plays an important role in determining translation zzso Here, we report synthetic sequences that when placed in the zzso coding region, leading to zzso proteins containing short zzso zzso virtually zzso enhance or produce intermediate expression levels of green fluorescent protein in zzso zzso At least in one case, no apparent effect on protein stability was observed, pointing to zzso level effects as the principal reason for the observed expression zzso zzso a synonymous zzso library to the zzso coding sequence allowed tuning of protein expression over zzso with preservation of zzso acid zzso This approach is simple and should be generally zzso in zzso The data support that features in the zzso zzso coding region near the zzso start zzso are key in determining translation output and hence is important to zzso and, most certainly, zzso gene zzso
