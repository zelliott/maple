zzso zzso growth factor I zzso zzso contain multiple zzso regions due to the use of leader zzso transcribed from several zzso initiation sites and to alternative zzso within leader zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso corresponding to the use of zzso 1 zzso initiation sites were translated in zzso into zzso peptides initiated at a zzso zzso in zzso 1 or a zzso zzso in zzso 3, and zzso with a zzso corresponding to the major zzso 2 zzso start site were translated into a zzso zzso initiated at a zzso zzso in zzso zzso All forms of zzso were processed by canine pancreatic zzso suggesting that all these zzso function as signal zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso zzso was zzso zzso to the length of the zzso zzso zzso of the first of three upstream zzso zzso in zzso 1, which potentially zzso a zzso acid open reading frame, did not affect zzso zzso The other two zzso zzso are immediately followed by stop zzso The absence of both upstream zzso zzso in a completely spliced zzso zzso zzso enhanced the in zzso and in zzso zzso of this zzso as compared with the full-length zzso zzso of the downstream initiation zzso in particular increased zzso efficiency in zzso and in intact cells, suggesting that an inefficient zzso event at the zzso zzso contributes to the poorer translation of zzso zzso in which these upstream zzso motifs zzso We conclude that zzso zzso potentially zzso multiple forms of zzso and that specific differences in their zzso regions provide a molecular basis for zzso control of zzso zzso
