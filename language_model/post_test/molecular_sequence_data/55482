zzso structures are built from zzso zzso that can be identified by structural and comparative sequence zzso In order to assemble sets of zzso in compact zzso zzso that introduce zzso and zzso are zzso Among such zzso zzso form an important family that presents sequence and structural zzso Here, we describe an internal loop in the bacterial type A zzso P zzso that sets zzso bound at the junctions exactly in the same relative positions as in zzso but without the structural signatures typical of zzso Our work suggests that identifying a structural module in a subset of zzso sequences constitutes a strategy to identify distinct sequential motifs sharing common structural zzso
