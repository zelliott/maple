The potential of the environment to yield organisms that can produce functional zzso is demonstrated by zzso zzso bacteria isolated from a zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso was identified as a zzso species zzso based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso This strain reduced zzso under zzso conditions to produce zzso alpha zzso zzso A zzso washing treatment was then employed to remove the biomass and resulted in the production of clusters of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were analyzed using electron zzso and X-ray zzso zzso This zzso isolate has the potential to be used both in the zzso of toxic zzso zzso in the environment and in the environmentally friendly manufacture of zzso
