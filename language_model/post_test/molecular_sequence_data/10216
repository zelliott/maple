While much is known about the neural and zzso mechanisms that control egg laying in the zzso zzso zzso relatively little is known about the regulation of male zzso activity in this simultaneous zzso In the present study, we have cloned and zzso a zzso that encodes a precursor zzso the predicted zzso processing of which presumably generates nine copies of the zzso zzso zzso five connecting zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The sequence of one connecting zzso is identical to the previously characterized cerebral zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis identified two major zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso which were present in central nervous system zzso but were most abundant in the right cerebral and right pedal zzso zzso studies using sexually mature zzso demonstrated that the vast majority of zzso zzso was localized in zzso zzso along the anterior and zzso margins of the right cerebral zzso and in a cluster of zzso zzso in the right pedal zzso A total of only about ten zzso zzso were located in other zzso zzso also demonstrated that zzso was present in the zzso zzso that participate in the storage or transport of zzso including the small zzso duct zzso of zzso storage before zzso the white zzso (also known as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso As a group, these data suggest that zzso may play a role in regulating male zzso function in zzso as it does in other zzso
