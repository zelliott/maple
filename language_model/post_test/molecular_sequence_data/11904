zzso small round cell tumor is a recently described entity associated with fusion of the zzso and zzso genes and with expression of a zzso zzso To investigate the structure and potential diagnostic utility of the detection of zzso zzso zzso in zzso small round cell zzso 12 examples of this entity and 49 other tumors that enter in its differential diagnosis were studied by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction for the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in 11 of 12 zzso small round cell tumors but not in any other tumor type zzso including 17 zzso tumors, 10 Ewing's zzso zzso tumors, 13 zzso zzso and 9 zzso zzso One zzso small round cell tumor was found to have a zzso zzso zzso product that included zzso 8 of zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in all Ewing's zzso zzso tumor and not identified in any other tumor types, including zzso small round cell zzso zzso zzso were present in 9 of 13 zzso zzso but not in any other zzso zzso of zzso transcripts by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction is a very specific aid in differential diagnosis of zzso tumors and further establishes zzso small round cell tumor as a distinct zzso
