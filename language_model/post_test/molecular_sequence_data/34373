zzso of zzso cell death pathways may circumvent drug resistance in deadly zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso To this end, it is important to define the cell death zzso in zzso and thus characterize zzso such as zzso zzso which have been reported to induce cell death in plants and zzso zzso zzso therefore, investigated whether the cell death function of zzso is zzso in different zzso zzso species such as zzso zzso and zzso major, focusing on the zzso specificity and functional role in cell survival as compared to zzso zzso Our results show that, similarly to zzso zzso zzso exhibits a zzso zzso zzso activity and its expression in zzso induced growth zzso as well as an zzso increase in cell death under zzso stress, a situation encountered by zzso during the host or when exposed to drugs such as zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso cell death pathways in both zzso and zzso involve a zzso zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso is able to induce cell death in stress conditions, where it specifically activates a downstream zzso as part of a cell death zzso This zzso activity is also induced by the zzso drug zzso in zzso stages of zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that blocking zzso cell death influences their drug sensitivity, a result which could be used to create therapeutic strategies that zzso drug resistance mechanisms by acting directly on the innate pathways of zzso cell zzso
