zzso zzso starch zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are major starch zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves require zzso and zzso for zzso function, whereas zzso starch is near normal with only zzso zzso functions were characterized in zzso zzso zzso leaves to determine whether zzso distinctions in zzso primary structure, or zzso differences in zzso are responsible for the differing zzso zzso zzso methods provided lines lacking zzso or zzso zzso analyses characterized zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso content, zzso zzso and zzso fine structure were zzso Three zzso activity forms were observed in leaves, two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso activity existed in zzso lacking zzso zzso without zzso differed in leaf starch content, zzso zzso and zzso structure compared with zzso or lines lacking both zzso and zzso The data imply that both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso function in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is present and functions in the zzso zzso zzso divergence between zzso and zzso probably explains the ability of zzso to function as a zzso in zzso leaves, in contrast to other species where the zzso zzso is the only active zzso
