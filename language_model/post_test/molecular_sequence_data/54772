Ambient light has profound effects on early zzso zzso through red and zzso zzso zzso and blue and zzso zzso zzso zzso integration of various light signal zzso pathways leads to changes in gene expression and zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso TO LIGHT or zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso displayed a long zzso zzso under red, zzso and blue light, whereas zzso of zzso caused a short zzso zzso under similar light zzso The zzso also showed other zzso defects such as zzso zzso retarded zzso and leaf expansion, reduced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and attenuated expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to an zzso fold protein family and is localized strongly in the nucleus and zzso in the zzso The expression of zzso was strongly induced by light of various zzso and this light induction was impaired in zzso zzso zzso zzso directly bound to both a zzso and a zzso in the zzso promoter but with a greater affinity toward the zzso zzso therefore, represents a new signaling step downstream of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
