zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso thick ascending limb zzso display similar functions and regulation, suggesting that similar zzso zzso are zzso In the rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present in the zzso zzso however, in the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso has been zzso In this study, the expression and zzso zzso of zzso in both rat and mouse zzso were zzso To detect zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was performed in zzso zzso zzso using zzso specific for zzso Analysis of zzso products with and without zzso by restriction zzso chosen from the published zzso sequence gave predicted zzso zzso and sequencing of the zzso product from mouse zzso revealed zzso and zzso identity to the published zzso zzso sequence of comparable regions in rat and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso of mouse and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was determined by zzso using a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso but not zzso membrane of zzso of both zzso In addition, zzso zzso recognized an 85 zzso protein in plasma zzso prepared from mouse and rat zzso outer zzso and a zzso cell line by Western analysis, which further support that zzso protein is expressed in the zzso of both zzso We conclude that zzso is expressed in the zzso membrane of zzso in both mouse and zzso
