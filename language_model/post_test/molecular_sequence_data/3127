zzso controls a wide array of cellular behaviors including zzso zzso differentiation and tissue zzso Here we show that zzso zzso a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease, controls a zzso zzso of zzso This zzso is zzso by zzso or calcium influx and occurs between human zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso system zzso both the full-length zzso and a zzso zzso fragment, derived from a zzso zzso after the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso thus promoting zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso releases the zzso zzso to the zzso and increases the levels of soluble zzso and zzso Thus, the zzso system stimulates zzso of the zzso zzso complex and increases the zzso pool of zzso a key regulator of the zzso signaling zzso
