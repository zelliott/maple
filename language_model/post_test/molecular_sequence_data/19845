zzso intervention achieved by manipulating zzso zzso immune responses would critically increase the clinical feasibility of zzso as immediate zzso rejections become zzso through genetic zzso of donor zzso zzso negative regulatory signals like the programmed death 1 zzso death zzso 1 zzso system are candidate targets for the control of zzso zzso immune zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was cloned using zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso technology based on the human zzso zzso The functional effects of cloned zzso zzso were tested on human zzso T cell zzso using zzso zzso bystander zzso Cellular proliferation was monitored by zzso zzso zzso and human T cell zzso was measured by flow zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso was found to have zzso sequence zzso with human zzso and to contain two zzso zzso in its zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expressed on Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells inhibited human zzso T cell proliferation zzso with zzso only or zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso activated human T cells increased by over zzso in the presence of zzso zzso cells, and the addition of zzso human zzso fusion proteins during human T cell zzso reversed the zzso effects of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso showed high sequence zzso with human zzso and a similar molecular zzso Moreover, zzso zzso inhibited human zzso T cell zzso in human zzso manner, and this involved activated T cell zzso The authors suggest that zzso might play an important zzso immune regulatory role during zzso zzso and that the effective application of this system would improve transplanted zzso organ zzso
