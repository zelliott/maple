zzso zzso is a zzso opportunistic zzso pathogen responsible for several outbreaks zzso It can cause several infections at various sites of the zzso One of the main infections caused by this zzso is zzso pneumonia in patients in intensive care zzso Treating these infections is becoming difficult because of the high resistance to zzso zzso This study compared the expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso having zzso zzso and no zzso upstream of the zzso gene in zzso zzso clinical zzso It showed that the expression of zzso was six times greater when zzso was present upstream of the gene in comparison with the zzso expressed zzso gene with no zzso present zzso The study indicated that zzso has better promoters than zzso and this is responsible for the zzso of the zzso gene as they share considerable zzso to the well-established zzso coli zzso The zzso box of zzso formed a fusion promoter with the zzso box of the zzso gene causing the zzso gene to be significantly zzso The ability to zzso the expression of zzso with the assistance of different zzso elements such as zzso and zzso has become an important factor in zzso zzso resistance to zzso
