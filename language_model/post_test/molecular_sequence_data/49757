zzso resistance in skeletal muscle is a hallmark feature of type 2 zzso An increasing number of zzso and zzso pathways have been implicated in the development of insulin zzso However, the primary cellular cause of insulin resistance remains zzso zzso analysis can zzso a large number of proteins and their zzso modifications simultaneously and is a powerful tool to study zzso diseases like type 2 zzso Using this approach on human skeletal muscle zzso we have identified eight potential protein markers for type 2 diabetes in the zzso zzso The observed changes in protein expression indicate increased cellular stress, zzso zzso of two heat shock zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B, in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 zzso zzso appears to play a key, potentially zzso role for most of the proteins identified in this zzso In particular, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and that the levels of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in diabetic muscle correlated zzso with zzso plasma zzso zzso These data suggest a role for zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso synthesis and that zzso in the regulation of zzso synthesis and cellular stress proteins may contribute to the zzso of type 2 zzso
