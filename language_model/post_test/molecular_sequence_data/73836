A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, which does not contain a functional promoter for zzso transcription, has been shown to direct zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The promoter candidate found in this zzso by the computer method of zzso is compared with cryptic promoters selected by this computer zzso It is characterized in zzso by electron microscopic zzso of zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso transcription, and in zzso by high resolution zzso zzso
