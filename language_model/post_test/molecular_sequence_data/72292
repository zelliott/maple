The ability of zzso zzso zzso to enhance the biological activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso was investigated using zzso zzso dwarf zzso These animals were shown to respond to increasing doses of zzso zzso zzso administered in two daily injections over a zzso treatment period, in a highly significant zzso zzso The responses measured were increases in zzso weight, zzso weight and the index of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso confirmed the suitability of this animal model for these investigations and suggested the zzso dose of zzso (20 zzso for use in enhancement zzso Five peptides derived from the beta zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso C, zzso D, zzso zzso zzso were used to generate zzso zzso zzso Of these zzso only A and B produced an zzso zzso in zzso capable of zzso zzso in a liquid phase zzso zzso prepared against zzso A or zzso B were found to significantly enhance the biological activity of 20 zzso zzso over a zzso treatment zzso The response to zzso zzso alone did not differ significantly from that observed in zzso control animals, neither did the response to zzso alone differ from that observed in animals treated with zzso plus zzso zzso Thus the enhanced responses are dependent upon the presence of zzso plus zzso zzso zzso A and B are located in a region thought to be involved in zzso recognition, this may have implications for the mechanism underlying this phenomenon and/or the zzso relationships of zzso That zzso zzso can be generated by zzso of animals with peptides A and B suggests that it may be possible to develop these peptides as vaccines capable of increasing zzso performance, such as zzso zzso The high degree of sequence zzso between zzso bovine and zzso (and to a lesser extent human and zzso zzso in the region covered by peptides A and B suggests that these peptides could also be used to promote and regulate zzso function in all of these zzso
