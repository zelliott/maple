T zzso can be induced to produce zzso zzso and zzso upon T cell zzso zzso occupancy together with a zzso zzso zzso The T cell surface zzso zzso is believed to function as a regulator in T cell zzso at both the level of zzso zzso stabilization and gene zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso via zzso has been shown to be zzso through a zzso zzso zzso called zzso DNA binding analysis revealed that the zzso signal is involved in the induction of zzso binding zzso Here, we demonstrate that the induction of zzso binding activity is not specific for the zzso zzso Our data indicate that distinct zzso T cell zzso signals zzso on the induction of zzso binding activity, and suggest a crucial role for this activity in the zzso zzso responsiveness to different modes of T cell zzso
