The zzso action of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on cell proliferation and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso was determined in the zzso amplified human zzso cell line zzso The zzso of each zzso was estimated from zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso cells with incremental zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso for 4 zzso Cell proliferation was zzso determined by a zzso zzso using zzso dye and zzso analysis, and zzso zzso by zzso of Western zzso All zzso zzso with the exception of zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation in a zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso zzso weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 117 zzso 26, 255 zzso 29, and 425 zzso 44 zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso for zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso growth factor zzso zzso ranging from zzso to 1000 zzso progressively increased cell proliferation rate, but it zzso at zzso above 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was zzso zzso by zzso zzso from 1 to 100 zzso The suppression of zzso zzso zzso differed for each zzso and their respective zzso zzso were as zzso zzso zzso zzso under curve zzso zzso under curve zzso zzso control (no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The lower the ratio, the greater the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have terminal zzso zzso acid zzso as well as one and two zzso zzso acid zzso linked to the internal zzso respectively, both inhibited cell proliferation and zzso zzso However, zzso was a more potent zzso of cell proliferation and zzso most effective against zzso zzso zzso which only has a terminal zzso zzso acid, inhibited cell proliferation and zzso zzso almost zzso These data suggest that zzso differ in their potency as zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso and that zzso in the differential expression of membrane zzso may play a role in modulating zzso zzso
