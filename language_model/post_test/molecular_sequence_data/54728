Within the zzso zzso Systems zzso project, the effect of temperature on a zzso network is investigated at the systems zzso zzso zzso zzso an unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso for sugar degradation that is zzso for zzso and zzso In the course of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso exhibits high similarity to the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso but possesses different zzso properties, particularly regarding zzso specificity and zzso zzso In contrast with zzso which exhibits broad zzso specificity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso is absolutely specific for zzso The comparison of kinetic parameters suggests that zzso might represent the major player in zzso zzso via the zzso zzso pathway, whereas zzso might have a dominant role in zzso degradation via the same zzso as well as in different zzso zzso
