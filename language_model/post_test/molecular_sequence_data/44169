The retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso between two tissue zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso In this report we describe a zzso zzso isolated from a chick zzso zzso library that encodes a membrane protein found only in zzso zzso The deduced protein has zzso zzso acids with twelve putative membrane spanning zzso The zzso has been designated zzso based on its zzso identity in zzso acid sequence and structural similarity with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso made in a rat zzso zzso cell line zzso express zzso zzso zzso had enhanced zzso zzso zzso as a measure of zzso zzso which was zzso and inhibited by zzso In zzso zzso unique expression in zzso cells, multiple potential zzso sites, and zzso distribution suggest that zzso may regulate zzso levels in the zzso zzso
