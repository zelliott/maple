Many proteins contain reiterated zzso zzso but zzso of excessive length may result in human disease by zzso new properties on the protein containing zzso One established property of a zzso zzso depending on the nature of the zzso zzso is its ability to act as an zzso zzso in a zzso reaction and to make a zzso zzso with a neighboring zzso To learn whether zzso repeats can act as zzso zzso we have made peptides with variable lengths of zzso flanked by the adjacent zzso acid zzso in the proteins associated with zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso disease zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or those zzso adjacent to the preferred zzso site of zzso or solely by zzso zzso The zzso was found to zzso excellent zzso properties on any soluble zzso under optimal conditions, virtually all the zzso zzso acted as zzso zzso in the reaction with zzso zzso and lengthening the sequence of zzso increased the zzso of each zzso zzso In the presence of zzso peptides containing zzso formed zzso zzso with the proteins of brain extracts and these zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed on the surface of a zzso protein should form zzso zzso in the presence of any zzso activated by the presence of zzso
