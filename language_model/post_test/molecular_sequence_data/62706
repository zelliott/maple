The third repeat zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein has been considered to play an essential role in the zzso zzso zzso To clarify the zzso and zzso features that differentiate zzso from the second zzso zzso the zzso assembly profiles of these zzso fragments were monitored by the zzso zzso method and electron zzso The zzso zzso zzso change from a random structure to an zzso structure, in an zzso solution, was monitored by CD zzso and the structure of zzso in zzso solution was analyzed by a combination of two-dimensional zzso zzso and molecular modeling calculations to facilitate comparison with the structure of zzso The speed of zzso assembly was remarkably faster than that of zzso in spite of their similar zzso acid zzso The averaged zzso zzso of zzso exhibited the zzso zzso zzso Similar features observed in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were that the zzso sequence takes a zzso structure with the zzso distribution of the respective zzso whereas the zzso zzso are both zzso In contrast, a notable difference was observed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso and an extended zzso for zzso These zzso behaviors would be associated with the different zzso speeds and seeding reactions between zzso and zzso
