The structure of zzso from zzso zzso was determined at zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso family and functions in a recently identified alternate zzso for the zzso of vitamin zzso zzso active zzso include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows similarity to zzso a zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso A zzso model of this protein was zzso zzso is predicted to be a zzso barrel on the basis of sequence zzso The predicted active site includes highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, a zzso model of a putative zzso complex was prepared using the structure of zzso as a zzso This model predicts that the zzso zzso generated by zzso is channeled through the center of the zzso barrel to the putative zzso active zzso
