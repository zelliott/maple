The zzso loop in zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso is known as a principal zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso loop peptides derived from three different zzso strains were used as zzso to identify the cell surface zzso which may participate in the infection of zzso Two different cell lines, zzso and zzso and three zzso loop peptides derived from zzso zzso and zzso strains were zzso The binding of zzso zzso to the cell surface was confirmed using zzso surface proteins of both cell zzso The relative molecular mass of the major radioactive band on the zzso was zzso zzso in both cell zzso A protein was zzso from the plasma membrane fraction of zzso cells using affinity columns coupled with three different zzso loop zzso Two major zzso (32 and 33 zzso were zzso from the affinity zzso zzso zzso showed that the protein migrated as a single peak with a molecular mass of 130 zzso These proteins were separated by zzso zzso which indicated that the zzso protein is more zzso than the zzso protein in zzso zzso A similar but not identical zzso protein with zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso from zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso a zzso protein on the surface of zzso and zzso cells on zzso
