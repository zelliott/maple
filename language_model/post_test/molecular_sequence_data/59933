In order to zzso the zzso activity relationships of the zzso the three-dimensional structures of two hybrid zzso zzso - zzso and zzso - zzso in zzso zzso solution were investigated by zzso zzso Both zzso - zzso and zzso - zzso have strong zzso activity but only zzso - zzso has zzso activity against human zzso zzso - zzso has a zzso zzso of only two turns combined with one short zzso in the zzso with a flexible hinge section in zzso zzso - zzso has a severely bent structure in the middle of the zzso These structural features as well as the low zzso of zzso - zzso seem to be crucial for the selective zzso against the membrane of zzso zzso zzso - zzso has an zzso structure of about three turns in the zzso domain and a flexible structure with one turn in the zzso domain connected with a flexible hinge section in between, and these might be the structural features required for membrane disruption against zzso and zzso zzso The central hinge region zzso in an zzso zzso zzso is considered to play an important role in providing the zzso flexibility required for zzso channel formation of the zzso zzso zzso on cell zzso
