Previous kinetic investigations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso A protein of the zzso small nuclear zzso particle zzso interacting with its zzso target zzso hairpin II zzso provided experimental evidence for a zzso and zzso model of zzso The final step of zzso has been proposed to involve zzso changes in an zzso immediately zzso to the zzso domain zzso zzso which zzso the zzso binding surface in the zzso zzso zzso C must shift its position to accommodate zzso binding in the zzso zzso This results in a new zzso core, an zzso hydrogen bond and a quadruple stacking interaction between zzso and zzso Here, we used a surface zzso zzso zzso to gain zzso insight into the role of zzso C in zzso the interaction with zzso zzso removal or disruption of the zzso exposes the zzso surface, resulting in an increase in the association rate, while simultaneously reducing the ability of the complex to zzso reflected in a loss of complex zzso zzso of the quadruple stacking interaction has minor kinetic effects when compared with removal of the zzso hydrogen zzso These data provide new insights into the mechanism zzso sequences zzso to an zzso can influence zzso zzso
