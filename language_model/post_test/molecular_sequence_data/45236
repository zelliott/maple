zzso zzso zzso are major architects of zzso evolution and have been associated with adaptations relevant to malaria transmission in zzso zzso The processes responsible for their origin and zzso still poorly zzso can be illuminated by analysis of inversion zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso structure of zzso inversion zzso from the principal malaria zzso zzso zzso and its relatives in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the standard zzso arrangement contain gene zzso full-length genes and their truncated copies at opposite zzso zzso genes without zzso copies in the alternative arrangement zzso imply that zzso is derived and was viable despite damage to zzso because zzso preserved gene zzso A unique origin for the zzso zzso inversion was challenged previously by indirect genetic evidence, but zzso sequences determined from members of the zzso zzso complex strongly suggest their descent from a single zzso The derived position of zzso long considered ancestral in this medically important group, has significant implications for the zzso history and the evolution of zzso capacity in the zzso zzso zzso
