We have characterized the complete sequence of two zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and could thus compare the zzso sequences of 7 zzso zzso from 6 species spread over 350 million years of zzso Although the size of these sequences is heterogeneous, we identified three completely zzso sequences of 10, 11 and 12 zzso zzso We observed that two of these elements may be contained in zzso zzso structures previously implicated in zzso zzso The length of these zzso their existence in zzso predicted structures, and their presence in regulated zzso zzso with a frequency greater than predicted by chance, suggest that they are functionally zzso
