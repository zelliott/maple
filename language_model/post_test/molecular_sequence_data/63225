Basic zzso proteins zzso are a class of proteins widely present in saliva of humans and other zzso They are zzso as zzso and zzso zzso into small peptides before zzso from the zzso zzso Recently, we characterized two zzso peptides zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of pig zzso zzso that are derived from three zzso of a zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso and zzso Together the coding regions for zzso and zzso which are repeated many times, account for zzso of the coding regions of the zzso zzso This study was undertaken to identify peptides zzso by zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of enriched zzso preparations from pig zzso zzso by two different zzso strategies identified ten new zzso peptides derived from the three zzso Together with the coding regions for zzso and zzso already identified it was possible to assign zzso of the zzso coding zzso The zzso sequences indicated a number of unusual zzso zzso sites suggesting the presence of unknown zzso zzso
