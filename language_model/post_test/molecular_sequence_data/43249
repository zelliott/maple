zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso zzso and serves critical structural and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of PC zzso which is zzso by all zzso and is the sole or major PC zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso we present the complete structure of the zzso CT zzso zzso One zzso zzso clone and six subsequent zzso zzso were isolated and analyzed for the zzso organization of the zzso zzso The gene spans approximately 26 zzso and is composed of 9 zzso and 8 zzso The zzso match the distinct functional zzso of the CT zzso zzso 1 is zzso zzso 2 codes for the nuclear zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 8 codes for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 9 includes the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso initiation sites, spaced 35 zzso apart, were identified using zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso chain zzso The zzso natural zzso region was found to lack zzso or zzso boxes and to contain zzso regions, which are features typical of promoters of zzso zzso Several sites that have the potential to interact with zzso regulatory factors, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso of the gene and found to be distributed in two distinct zzso These data will provide the basis for future studies on the zzso and zzso factors involved in zzso gene zzso and for the creation of induced zzso mouse models of altered CT zzso
