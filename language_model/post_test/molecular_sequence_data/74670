zzso zzso the latest member of the growth zzso family, is a novel zzso hormone with diverse zzso At present, zzso can be identified only in fish but not in zzso and its regulation at the zzso level has not been fully zzso Using grass carp as a model, we examined the direct effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and synthesis at the zzso cell zzso As a first step, the structural identity of grass carp zzso zzso and zzso was established by zzso amplification of zzso zzso These two zzso zzso are zzso genes and are expressed in two separate populations of zzso cells located in the zzso zzso In the carp zzso zzso nerve fibers were detected in the nerve tracts of the zzso and extended into the vicinity of zzso cells forming the zzso zzso In primary cultures of grass carp zzso cells, zzso was effective in stimulating zzso release, cellular zzso content, and total zzso zzso The increase in zzso production also occurred with parallel rises in zzso and zzso zzso zzso With the use of a combination of molecular and pharmacological approaches, zzso zzso release and zzso gene expression were shown to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso These findings, as a whole, suggest that zzso may serve as a zzso factor in fish stimulating zzso zzso and synthesis at the zzso zzso Apparently, zzso zzso production is zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso gene expression through zzso of zzso zzso
