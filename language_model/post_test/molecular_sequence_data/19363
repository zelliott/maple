The zzso sequence of the linear zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso A total of 103 open reading frames zzso were identified on zzso 49 of which had no zzso zzso The zzso were assigned to the following functional groups: zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso maintenance and DNA replication and zzso The genes for conversion of zzso to zzso are organized in two zzso that include zzso presumed to code for proteins involved in assembly of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso protein that could be required for zzso of the zzso zzso Genes possibly coding for zzso involved in zzso degradation via zzso zzso A form another zzso These zzso were expressed when cells were grown on zzso or on aromatic compounds downstream in the zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso of putative replication zzso of zzso were predicted to form elaborate secondary structures due to zzso and zzso terminal zzso however, the two zzso appear to form different zzso zzso analysis of zzso 101 to 103 suggested that zzso codes for one or two putative terminal zzso presumed to be zzso bound to the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Even if the putative proteins zzso by zzso 101 to 103 share motifs with the Tap and terminal proteins involved in zzso zzso of zzso linear zzso their overall sequences and domain structures differ zzso
