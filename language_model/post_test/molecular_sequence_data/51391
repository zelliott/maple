zzso of zzso proteins in bacteria has facilitated the characterization of many gene zzso However, the zzso characterization of zzso proteins is limited since the zzso expressed proteins are often zzso as fusion zzso The presence of bacterial sequences in fusion proteins further limits the use of these proteins for generating zzso since the bacterial sequences are also zzso We describe two new bacterial expression zzso based on the zzso series of zzso These zzso were made by precisely deleting all of the zzso coding sequences found in zzso The new zzso have enabled us to express zzso genes as zzso zzso These altered plasmids can be used to insert any DNA sequence of interest through a multiple cloning site located just 3' of an zzso start zzso zzso expression is still under the control of the zzso zzso and is carried out at great efficiency when the bacteria are zzso zzso Studies presented here test the expression system with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Large amounts of zzso zzso proteins were zzso Also, a time course of induction shows that the production of the zzso proteins was under the control of the zzso zzso which is readily zzso after zzso zzso and addition of zzso zzso These zzso may be useful for the zzso of many proteins in a form closely zzso their native zzso
