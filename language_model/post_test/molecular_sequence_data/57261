The performance of a competitive zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso a viral zzso zzso was assessed over a 3 year period in The zzso West Africa, and compared with a commercially available zzso zzso using three panels of zzso An zzso region of the zzso zzso of an zzso isolate zzso zzso was also cloned and expressed in zzso coli as a zzso fusion protein and the resulting zzso protein zzso in place of the existing viral zzso zzso Competitive zzso were found to be both a specific and sensitive means of reliably determining the zzso status of an individual with a high zzso value, particularly when a strategy of zzso positive results in the two zzso was zzso When either zzso competitive zzso were used in conjunction with a competitive zzso for zzso detection it was possible in the vast majority of cases to identify the zzso infecting an individual and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A few zzso which showed similar zzso profiles when diluted over a serial tenfold dilution steps were identified as possible dual zzso
