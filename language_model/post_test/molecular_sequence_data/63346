zzso zzso sequencing has left a legacy of zzso yet zzso genes or open reading zzso activities that may have useful applications in health and/or the zzso We are interested in the discovery and characterization of potentially new zzso activities for the zzso zzso of natural zzso fibers such as hemp and zzso A highlight in this study is the discovery of a zzso zzso zzso among five zzso sequences and two zzso sequences that we have cloned from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of these sequences as active zzso zzso and zzso required their zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso The most active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso to near zzso and their kinetic parameters were zzso A significant amount of zzso degradation products was shown to be released by the two zzso zzso but not the zzso when hemp fiber zzso was used as zzso zzso of this study showed that zzso data mining, besides an economical approach to new gene zzso may uncover new findings such as the discovery of a zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso a zzso zzso
