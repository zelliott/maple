Recent studies on insect patterning suggest that the genetic hierarchy may be roughly zzso in zzso divergent species, but zzso genes may not function zzso in all zzso In order to understand potential evolutionary changes in the role of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was cloned and its expression pattern during early zzso zzso Eight stripes of zzso zzso were progressively expressed in an zzso zzso Later, these stripes disappeared zzso Under this detection system, zzso zzso stripes clearly do not resolve into the corresponding secondary zzso an obvious difference from zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may serve a zzso defining role and may determine the zzso zzso zzso
