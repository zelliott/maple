Two zzso zzso 1 and 2) were zzso to zzso from the zzso zzso preparations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grown on rice zzso zzso 1 and 2 are zzso zzso whose apparent molecular masses zzso are around 78 zzso which decreased by approximately 10 zzso upon zzso zzso Both zzso showed similar zzso characteristics in optimal temperature and zzso stability, and zzso They were active against a wide range of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their zzso acid sequences shared zzso identity and exhibited less than zzso identity with the known zzso zzso Considering properties such as reduced zzso by ethanol, zzso and zzso low zzso activity, wider zzso range, less binding affinity to zzso materials, and abundant zzso zzso is likely to be more suitable for zzso production than zzso via simultaneous zzso and zzso of rice straw with zzso zzso
