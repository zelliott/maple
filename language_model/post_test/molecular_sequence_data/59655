A major component of zzso zzso is the zzso zzso which is clearly related to other zzso and zzso This zzso is distinguished by its exclusively zzso location, and by the fact that, unlike other zzso it does not zzso its own reverse zzso zzso coding sequences diverge significantly, even between elements within the same zzso Such rapid divergence has been noted previously in studies of gag genes from other zzso zzso comparisons indicate that the entire zzso coding region codes for gag zzso with regions of similarity to other insect zzso gag proteins found throughout the open reading frame zzso zzso is most striking in the zinc zzso region, a region characteristic of gag genes of most zzso zzso We identify a zzso of insect zzso zzso with three zinc zzso of the form: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The first and third zzso are zzso but the second shows some differences between members of this zzso This zzso includes zzso and a second zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike other gag regions, zzso requires a zzso zzso for complete zzso Such zzso are common between the gag and pol sequences of zzso but have not before been seen within a gag zzso The zzso allows zzso to zzso two zzso this mechanism may substitute for the zzso zzso that creates multiple gag zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso coding sequences have a zzso region with zzso of zzso zzso and many zzso zzso None of these changes interrupt the open reading frame, arguing that only elements with zzso zzso can be incorporated into the zzso Perhaps zzso translation products act in zzso to target the zzso to zzso zzso
