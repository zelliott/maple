To determine the influence of DNA repair by zzso zzso on the distribution of zzso zzso we have zzso in zzso and zzso bacterial strains the DNA sequence changes of a total of zzso independent zzso occurring within the initial part of the zzso gene of zzso zzso The majority zzso of zzso induced by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the two genetic backgrounds were zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso The analysis of the distribution of zzso zzso zzso transitions induced by zzso in zzso and zzso bacteria reveals an influence of the zzso base at the level of repair by zzso zzso The zzso protein appears more efficient at repairing zzso zzso which are flanked zzso by a G or C, in agreement with previously reported data from our group for zzso zzso In contrast, no preference could be zzso for the repair of zzso zzso by zzso zzso These results seem to indicate that the preference of the zzso zzso to repair certain DNA sequences might be a function of the size of the zzso zzso The importance of the zzso group length has been described also at the level of the zzso zzso machinery that seems to have a DNA sequence specificity opposite to that of zzso zzso
