Several zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 1) gene in the zzso zzso gene zzso serve as cellular receptors for mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso in zzso mouse strains showed that the zzso expressed in zzso mice are zzso by an zzso zzso of the zzso 1 zzso named zzso zzso We recently cloned and characterized a second zzso zzso 2, that encodes a functional zzso zzso zzso which is not recognized by zzso zzso A third gene related to zzso 1 was cloned and expressed and shown to zzso a soluble protein called zzso that differs significantly in its zzso domain from zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso proteins constructed between the different zzso zzso and point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were analyzed to further characterize the zzso and zzso zzso within the N terminal domain of the zzso Thus, the zzso host for zzso expresses multiple zzso zzso of zzso zzso by several different zzso genes which differ in their ability to serve as zzso zzso The differential expression of these genes in different zzso zzso may help to explain the tissue zzso of zzso zzso
