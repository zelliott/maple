The human zzso 18 zzso E6 and zzso proteins are considered to be primarily responsive for the transforming activity of the zzso In order to zzso the molecular mechanisms resulting in viral zzso zzso it is necessary to identify the factors involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso Here we define by gel zzso experiments a sequence zzso zzso binding site present in the promoter zzso part of the viral zzso control region zzso Regulatory zzso zzso zzso analyses employing transient reporter zzso reveal that this zzso element is required for an efficient stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso element in the natural context of the zzso zzso leads to a strong decrease in the activity of the zzso in several cell zzso The magnitude of reduction varies between different cell types and is higher in cell lines of zzso origin when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso expression zzso systems further define the promoter zzso zzso zzso binding motif as a functional zzso element in zzso and show that its integrity is essential for the stimulation of the zzso by zzso levels of zzso These results zzso that the cellular zzso factor zzso plays an important role for the stimulation of the zzso by the viral zzso and represents a major zzso for the expression of zzso transforming genes E6 and zzso
