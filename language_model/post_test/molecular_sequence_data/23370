The completion of the mouse and other zzso zzso sequences will provide necessary, but not zzso knowledge for an understanding of much of mouse biology at the molecular zzso As a requisite next step in this process, the genes in mouse and their structure must be zzso In particular, knowledge of the zzso start site of these genes will be necessary for further study of their regulatory zzso To assess the current state of mouse zzso zzso to support this activity, we identified several hundred gene predictions in mouse with varying levels of supporting evidence and tested them using zzso zzso were made to the procedure allowing pooling of zzso samples, resulting in a zzso zzso The results illustrate potential errors or zzso in the current zzso end zzso in zzso of the genes zzso In testing zzso unsupported gene predictions, we were able to identify 58 that are not usually zzso as genes but produced spliced transcripts zzso zzso success zzso In addition, in many genes we were able to detect novel zzso not predicted by any gene prediction zzso In zzso of the genes detected in this study, multiple transcript species were zzso These data show an urgent need to provide direct experimental validation of gene zzso Moreover, these results show that direct validation using zzso can be an important component of zzso zzso This approach can be a useful tool in the ongoing efforts to increase the quality of gene zzso especially zzso start sites, in complex zzso
