We have isolated and characterized the mouse gene for zzso zzso zzso a basic zzso zzso factor implicated in neural development and zzso The gene consists of two zzso and the entire zzso sequence is zzso by a single downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso was zzso at day 4 and increased to a zzso level at day 6 during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso To zzso the regulatory mechanisms of the zzso gene expression during this process, a construct containing the zzso DNA zzso of about 3 zzso upstream of the zzso coding region fused to a zzso reporter gene was zzso into zzso cells, and stable zzso were pooled for zzso of zzso zzso When the stable zzso were treated with zzso and zzso to induce zzso zzso the zzso activities were induced in a zzso expression pattern similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso Further experiments using a series of deletion and zzso zzso indicated that the zzso sequence in the zzso region of the zzso gene is important, and that one of the E boxes in the sequence plays a critical role in the regulated zzso zzso zzso experiments also showed that the same E box is required for the zzso of the zzso promoter activity by zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene expression is regulated by an E zzso factor during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
