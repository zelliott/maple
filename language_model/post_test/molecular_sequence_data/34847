We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso zzso partial zzso zzso encodes a partial predicted protein of zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis with other zzso zzso sequences demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso in regions of functional zzso The sequence reported zzso combined with the high degree of conservation observed in critical zzso has also facilitated an investigation of the molecular zzso of environmentally induced liver tumor samples in a feral fish zzso zzso zzso were detected in liver zzso samples, also in apparently zzso regions of liver samples dissected from fish displaying zzso but not in normal liver samples from otherwise healthy feral zzso These results are the first reporting the appearance of zzso zzso in zzso fish and suggest that the molecular zzso of fish cancer appears to involve zzso zzso The zzso relevance of the zzso zzso in feral fish liver tumors, in terms of future zzso instability and possible development of a zzso zzso is zzso
