The zzso 2 zzso gene promoter is recognized by several zzso and ubiquitous zzso regulators that integrate information transmitted by various signaling systems leading to zzso production and zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso methods, we have discovered the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso (for zzso zzso which recognizes a zzso response element zzso located within the zzso zzso Although the zzso is similar in sequence to a consensus zzso zzso B site, several criteria indicate that zzso is distinct from zzso zzso zzso However, like zzso zzso B, zzso activity is induced by zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
