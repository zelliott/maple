zzso complications in zzso zzso result predominantly from zzso of the zzso zzso These abnormalities affect the zzso as well as zzso zzso ducts and the zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso the gene product defective in zzso fibrosis, functions as a zzso zzso channel in the plasma zzso As such, it may represent an important driving force for fluid transport across the zzso 

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of zzso in human gallbladder zzso cells and to examine the zzso zzso transport properties of these zzso zzso was performed on tissue zzso The reverse zzso was used to analyze the expression of zzso zzso in freshly isolated and cultured gallbladder zzso zzso The zzso protein was detected by Western zzso and zzso The zzso zzso transport properties of the cells were determined by zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso protein was zzso in human gallbladder in zzso and localized predominantly to the zzso membrane of zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso and protein were maintained in gallbladder zzso cells in primary zzso zzso forms of zzso were present as confirmed by treatment with zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso pathways but more intensely by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso acid, a zzso channel zzso Two zzso active zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Our results are consistent with a high expression of zzso functional zzso protein in human gallbladder zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso in these zzso These findings indicate that zzso play an important role in the zzso of the zzso zzso including the gallbladder zzso
