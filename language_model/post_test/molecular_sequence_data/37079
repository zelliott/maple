zzso is one of the most widespread classes of zzso families and is well known to construct zzso with two different zzso zzso and zzso In the course of zzso analysis of zzso zzso we have constructed an zzso database by large-scale sequencing of clones that were randomly selected from zzso libraries of various zzso and zzso belonging to different zzso zzso Using this zzso database, we have identified four types of zzso gene and three types of zzso zzso Based on the analysis of deduced zzso acid zzso we have determined the zzso relationships of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso as well as two other zzso species, suggesting that each zzso is classified into at least three distinct zzso a zzso expressed one, a zzso regulated one and a zzso specific zzso
