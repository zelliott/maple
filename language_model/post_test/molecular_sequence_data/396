Few studies have investigated zzso from plants that host zzso zzso zzso efforts are zzso to find an zzso agent against plant pathogens like zzso zzso However, screening the effects of zzso agents on plant zzso in zzso or using zzso native zzso in zzso is a time consuming zzso A zzso correctly zzso zzso structure forming zzso could accelerate research in this zzso In this study, we cloned full length zzso isolated from potato leaves using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were predicted to zzso 449 and zzso zzso acid long proteins with molecular masses of 57 zzso and 60 zzso zzso Average yields of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of culture, zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso sensitivity were zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was confirmed by western zzso zzso When combined under appropriate conditions, these zzso zzso and zzso were capable of zzso into zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso revealed that important zzso binding sites were folded zzso This zzso zzso could serve as a control of zzso of selected zzso zzso compounds during in zzso screening zzso
