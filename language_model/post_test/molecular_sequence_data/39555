The defensive strategy of zzso against zzso attack relies heavily on the zzso of zzso chemical cocktails from specialized skin zzso zzso zzso peptides constitute a major component of zzso in many species and the most complex are produced by zzso leaf frogs of the zzso zzso We recently reported that these skin zzso contain elements of both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso zzso the latter are protected from degradation by interactions with zzso zzso zzso This thus permits parallel zzso acid sequencing of peptides and zzso acid sequencing of cloned precursor transcripts from single zzso samples of zzso Here we report that the protection afforded is sufficiently robust to permit zzso studies by cloning of full-length zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso from libraries constructed using ambient temperature zzso skin from recently deceased specimens as source zzso The technique was sufficiently sensitive to permit the identification of zzso zzso zzso peptides constituted by six different zzso of zzso and two zzso Also, for the first time, establishment of the zzso acid and zzso acid sequence of the precursor zzso the zzso zzso skin zzso zzso zzso from cloned zzso was zzso These data unequivocally demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso persists in zzso zzso zzso finding that may have fundamental implications in the study of zzso materials but also in the wider field of molecular zzso
