zzso zzso zzso virus stocks have been obtained by zzso zzso zzso influenza virus in medium containing zzso from zzso zzso and zzso against the influenza zzso Growth of the resulting zzso is dependent on addition of bacterial zzso to the zzso zzso sequence analysis showed large single deletions in the zzso zzso with both ends of the zzso gene segments zzso These zzso fragments all have the capacity to code for a zzso that contains the zzso zzso and zzso region of the zzso but the presence of this zzso has not been demonstrated in zzso or infected zzso In contrast to the ease of selection of zzso zzso from the zzso virus, no zzso were selected from three other zzso The zzso segments of parental zzso and zzso zzso predict a change of Pro to His at zzso 227 zzso zzso close to the zzso site of zzso zzso compared to the zzso of an zzso zzso that contains the zzso zzso zzso This change may contribute to an altered zzso specificity that allows selection of zzso that can zzso cells in the presence of high levels of zzso zzso It appears that the role of zzso in influenza infection is to remove zzso acid from the zzso rather than to destroy receptors on zzso
