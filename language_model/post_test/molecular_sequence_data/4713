We have deduced the zzso acid sequences of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso clones from the zzso Aedes zzso Two zzso which differ in the very beginning of the zzso domain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified, characterized and compared to one another as well as to zzso zzso from different zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso predicts a molecular mass zzso of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso whereas the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso predicts a zzso of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso Both zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso with zzso identities of zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso cow and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso The highest degree of conservation is in the middle portion of the zzso zzso zzso which includes the zzso region and extended zzso arm, with decreasing conservation through the zzso domain, zzso domain, and the relatively zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso do not directly zzso to specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the exception of zzso 6 which encodes the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso fusion protein recognized one major band of about 180 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso localized it to the coat of coated pits and coated zzso in zzso from zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso analyses suggest that regulation of zzso gene expression in the zzso is complex, and it likely involves both zzso and hormonal zzso
