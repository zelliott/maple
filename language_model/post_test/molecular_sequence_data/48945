The zzso sequences of 16 newly reported and 8 previously reported zzso zzso DNA molecules in zzso have been zzso As described for the eight previously reported zzso the first 50 bases zzso inside the zzso at both zzso strands in additional zzso molecules are zzso This anomalous base composition might serve as a signal to identify zzso molecules in zzso DNA during zzso The zzso segment upstream of the zzso in the zzso leaders of the zzso molecules contains extensive, zzso sequence motifs that are possibly promoter zzso The 3' zzso trailers contain virtually no zzso sequence zzso With one exception, the 3' trailers contain a second stop zzso zzso 36 bases on average downstream of the primary stop zzso Excluding zzso zzso zzso acid identities in zzso I range from 78 to zzso with variations distributed zzso along the zzso zzso trees based on the zzso zzso sequences of 22 zzso define the evolutionary relationships of their zzso zzso The zzso zzso while well supported by zzso zzso does not always coincide with the zzso defined in zzso analyses or classical zzso zzso
