The identification of specific zzso abnormalities in acute zzso leukemia zzso is important for the zzso of patients into the appropriate treatment zzso However, a significant proportion of diagnostic bone zzso zzso in zzso is reported as normal by conventional zzso analysis and it is suspected that these zzso may conceal the presence of zzso significant zzso zzso To address this question, we have developed a novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso which uses an zzso set of zzso zzso zzso We report here the application of the zzso zzso to 69 zzso cases with apparently normal zzso or an isolated zzso Of the 69 cases zzso 3 abnormalities were identified, all in the normal zzso zzso The first was a zzso identified in an infant with zzso In 2 other young patients with zzso zzso 19 zzso an apparently identical zzso was zzso zzso mapping by FISH and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis confirmed that this was the same zzso as previously identified in 3 children with zzso associated with zzso and resulting in the zzso gene zzso The zzso was not detected by zzso zzso using multiplex FISH zzso emphasizing the value of screening with zzso zzso for subtle zzso This is the first report of the zzso in association with an apparently normal zzso and highlights this as a new, potentially clinically significant zzso zzso in childhood zzso
