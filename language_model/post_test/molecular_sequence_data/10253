In the majority of cervical zzso zzso of high-risk zzso human zzso zzso such as type 16, are maintained so as to express two viral zzso E6 and zzso suggesting an essential importance to zzso The high-risk zzso E6 proteins are known to zzso zzso tumor zzso protein but appear to have an zzso zzso unknown zzso In this study, we demonstrate that these E6 proteins can bind to the second zzso domain of the human zzso of the zzso discs large tumor zzso protein zzso through their zzso zzso (where X represents any zzso acid, zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso This finding is similar to the interaction between the zzso zzso coli gene product and zzso E6 zzso losing the ability to bind to zzso are no longer able to induce zzso transformation of zzso zzso These results suggest an intriguing possibility that interaction between the E6 protein and zzso or other zzso zzso proteins could be an underlying mechanism in the development of zzso zzso
