zzso of zzso zzso stem cells with or without zzso zzso has proved a successful strategy in the treatment of zzso zzso We have recently shown that this approach can also cure mouse prostate cancer, provided that it is combined with zzso zzso Whether the response to zzso acts by providing helper function to enhance zzso responses or in other ways zzso on vaccine zzso remains to be zzso and this question is of clinical zzso In this study, we have addressed this issue by comparing the zzso of zzso cells zzso with a zzso derived from a zzso model zzso in recipients of donor cells either zzso to the host or differing for either zzso or multiple minor H zzso We report that vaccination elicits comparable proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso T cells despite concurrent expansion and differentiation of minor H zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells reduced zzso but not zzso zzso T cell zzso suggesting that zzso do not provide helper functions in peripheral zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso was also preserved in the case of multiple minor H zzso zzso prone to zzso zzso Thus, in the context of zzso zzso aimed at restoring an effective zzso T cell repertoire, minor H zzso T cells do not interfere with zzso T cell zzso supporting the notion that zzso vaccination is a valuable strategy to boost tumor and zzso protective zzso
