The zzso and zzso structure of a putative zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated the presence of four zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of each zzso showed five functional zzso that are zzso to zzso very low density zzso zzso zzso All four zzso seem to have originated from a single gene by alternative zzso and were zzso expressed in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso an additional 27 zzso acids in the zzso sugar domain, resulting in an extra zzso The zzso zzso gene consisted of 16 zzso separated by 15 zzso spanning zzso zzso and was at least three times larger than the human zzso zzso Surprisingly, one of the zzso zzso was expressed specifically in the brain and central nervous zzso Additionally, it had a unique zzso tail, leading to the proposition that it represents a new candidate zzso for possible zzso zzso This is the first report on the zzso characterization of an zzso zzso zzso gene and the identification of a zzso zzso zzso from a core member of the low density zzso zzso family in zzso
