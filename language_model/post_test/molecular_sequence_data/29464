The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is zzso on the tumor cell surface in a variety of zzso We report here that the zzso zzso also functions in the zzso zzso of zzso a relevant event in basement membrane degradation and tumor zzso In the presence of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso binding site, the rate of zzso degradation by the zzso zzso zzso B was significantly increased, and a new zzso zzso particularly active in in zzso cell migration zzso was zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso binding site on zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results shed light on the mechanism by which an zzso zzso such as the zzso plays a major role in tumor aggressiveness and zzso
