zzso resistance to zzso zzso is controlled in part by zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1) in zzso and zzso To isolate zzso zzso from rainbow trout, a combination of library screening and rapid amplification of zzso ends was zzso Two closely related zzso zzso designated zzso alpha and zzso zzso were cloned and zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso two highly zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso showed that the zzso alpha and zzso beta proteins share zzso of their zzso and contain all of the signature features of the zzso family of zzso 12 zzso zzso two zzso zzso sites, and a zzso transport zzso zzso analysis supported a close relation to zzso zzso a related member of the zzso zzso Despite this zzso juvenile trout expressed zzso alpha in a manner consistent with an zzso zzso and zzso beta similar to an zzso zzso Both trout zzso were expressed at relatively high amounts in the zzso of zzso a finding not reported in the investigations of previously characterized zzso and avian zzso These results suggest a role for zzso zzso in the zzso development of zzso fishes, as well as in zzso Because zzso zzso are ancestral zzso fragments of zzso alpha and zzso beta were isolated from zzso a zzso relative, to determine whether the trout zzso represent zzso of a single zzso zzso sequences for both zzso were found in zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso alpha and zzso beta are indeed independent zzso that were present before the zzso zzso of zzso The isolation of zzso zzso from rainbow trout may eventually produce a genetic tool for the control of disease in aquaculture zzso zzso the involvement of trout zzso in innate immunity may also provide insight regarding the evolution of host resistance to zzso
