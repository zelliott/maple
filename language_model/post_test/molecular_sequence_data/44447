zzso presumed zzso zzso zzso from fish, oil zzso and clinical zzso the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared by several typing zzso zzso analysis of sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso protein and zzso patterns showed that the strains were separated into two distinct clusters with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso similarity for zzso protein profiling and zzso zzso One cluster consisted of 26 zzso with 52 to 55 zzso G + C and included 15 human zzso mostly clinical zzso 8 zzso from marine waters, and the type strain of zzso zzso This homogeneous cluster of zzso zzso strains was by all analyses identical to the recently defined species zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso typically zzso strains formed the other, more zzso major zzso with 43 to 47 zzso G + zzso The type strain of zzso zzso was included in this zzso The two groups were confirmed by zzso zzso gene sequence zzso It is concluded that the zzso must be considered two different species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that most zzso zzso formerly identified as zzso zzso belong to zzso zzso The ecological role and potential zzso of zzso zzso can be evaluated only if the zzso is correctly zzso
