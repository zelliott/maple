The zzso activity of zzso derived from influenza A primary zzso of human zzso or avian origin zzso zzso zzso was compared upon zzso in zzso or avian cells, using zzso reporter zzso zzso under the control of the human and chicken zzso zzso I zzso zzso In avian cells, zzso activities were in the same range with all zzso zzso In human cells, zzso derived from zzso showed reduced zzso activity and reduced zzso binding to the zzso complex zzso or to the isolated zzso zzso as compared to the zzso derived from zzso Both defects were restored when zzso zzso zzso was changed to a zzso zzso derived from the human zzso zzso H5N1 isolate showed efficient zzso interaction in human cells, and high levels of activity which were determined mostly by the zzso and PA zzso Our data suggest that zzso might play a pivotal role in molecular interactions involving both the viral zzso and cellular zzso
