zzso zzso fragments that interfere with molecular interactions inside cells are valuable in investigation of zzso and in zzso but their application demands that they function in the reducing cellular zzso We show here a zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso folds based on scaffolds developed from zzso zzso capture technology, and we reveal that there is no structural or functional difference with or without the zzso zzso bond of the variable domain of heavy chain or the variable domain of light zzso The data indicate that, in the reducing in zzso environment, the absence of the zzso zzso bond is not an impediment to correction of zzso folding or to interaction with zzso Thus, the structural constraints for zzso function are intrinsic to variable zzso framework zzso providing a generic scaffold for isolation of functional zzso zzso single zzso
