In animals, major classes of zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso possess a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain that functions as a zzso zzso However, no zzso with the zzso domain had been identified in zzso Recently, we found that the rice zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso domain, exhibited zzso activity toward the rice zzso zzso zzso and regulates zzso production of zzso oxygen species and defense gene expression in zzso ( 1) zzso contains a single zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso wild zzso zzso of in zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso incapable of type III zzso delivery, revealed enhanced growth of the pathogen in the zzso zzso indicating that zzso is required for zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso reduced the zzso hypersensitive zzso These results suggested that zzso plays a role in both zzso and zzso immunity in zzso
