The human gut zzso is a unique zzso zzso containing substantial amounts of zzso zzso zzso with unknown zzso In this study we show that distinct and unusual zzso of zzso are present at different levels of human zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso and colon were compared using zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso from all three levels was compared using zzso zzso chain reaction, and the zzso of zzso in zzso was determined using zzso zzso Surface marker profiles of isolated zzso zzso cells at all three levels were also zzso On average the proportion of zzso gamma delta zzso was comparable in zzso than zzso and colon and varied in zzso with gut zzso zzso alpha beta zzso dominated in colon but were absent in zzso zzso zzso alpha beta zzso were present at all levels but only in zzso did they constitute the majority of all zzso zzso zzso alpha beta zzso were present in similar zzso at all levels of the zzso In general, the majority of zzso had an activated zzso zzso alpha E beta zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibited zzso which are rare in peripheral zzso The zzso markers zzso and zzso as well as the zzso cell marker zzso were expressed on a fraction of zzso alpha beta and zzso gamma delta zzso A small population of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was also present at equal proportions along the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso suggesting that zzso T cell maturation occurs in the zzso of small zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso often formed small clusters and intimate contacts with zzso cells, suggesting cell cooperation within the zzso Some zzso had zzso extensions penetrating the zzso basement membrane suggesting zzso zzso cells in small zzso but not colon expressed heat shock protein 60 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not expressed on zzso zzso cells at any zzso The distinct surface marker profiles of zzso and zzso cells along small and large zzso suggest functional regional specialization and are compatible with the hypothesis that zzso alpha beta zzso participate in immune reactions to zzso zzso while zzso gamma delta zzso perform surveillance of the zzso
