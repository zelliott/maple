Recent evidence indicates that chronic zzso disease can result from breakdown of regulation and subsequent zzso of zzso T zzso In many zzso zzso disease systems and in the Lewis zzso zzso T cells utilizing the T cell zzso zzso zzso gene segment play a major zzso In the zzso basic zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso model in zzso mice, we had shown that T cells recognizing a zzso zzso within the framework 3 region of the zzso chain have a critical role in influencing the course of the zzso Here, we report experiments in another disease system, collagen II zzso arthritis zzso in zzso zzso mice, indicating a remarkably parallel control circuit to that found for zzso A critical role is played by zzso zzso T cells in the zzso system, which we have zzso Animals treated with the zzso zzso before zzso administration are significantly protected from zzso Next, we tested the ability of peptides encompassing the entire zzso chain to induce zzso zzso Only zzso zzso B5 zzso acids zzso a regulatory zzso in zzso induced zzso B5 was then used to zzso zzso mice and was shown to reduce greatly the severity and zzso of zzso as measured by joint inflammation or zzso Furthermore, similar protection was found when B5 was administered after zzso zzso It was shown that there is zzso induction of a zzso response to B5 during zzso and that the zzso within B5 is produced from a single chain zzso construct containing the entire zzso zzso Finally, the regulation of zzso is discussed in the context of other experimental zzso diseases, especially zzso with emphasis on what appear to be zzso common zzso
