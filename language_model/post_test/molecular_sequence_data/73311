The promoter activity of an zzso zzso gene was analyzed in its zzso zzso A modified calcium zzso zzso method using a zzso marker zzso was developed to achieve highly efficient zzso of the zzso zzso gene into zzso zzso In this zzso zzso the calcium zzso complex was formed gradually in the medium during incubation with cells and zzso on the zzso The crucial factors for obtaining efficient zzso were the pH zzso of the zzso buffer used for the calcium zzso zzso and the amount zzso zzso tissue culture zzso and form zzso of zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso isolate zzso was zzso at an efficiency of about zzso with the constructed zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene incorporated zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso was zzso at an efficiency of about zzso with this zzso zzso of both zzso strains appeared to result in low copy zzso integration (about two copies per cell are zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the promoter of the zzso zzso gene in the constructed zzso was especially strong in zzso zzso thus the zzso system may be useful for the construction of zzso expression libraries, as well as for the expression of cloned zzso
