We present evidence that zzso zzso have evolved from zzso zzso During the final stages of zzso the zzso of DNA in many organisms is accomplished by the replacement of zzso with a class of zzso proteins called zzso In other organisms, however, zzso of zzso DNA can occur with comparable efficiency in the presence of zzso zzso or, zzso an intermediate class of proteins called zzso zzso The idea that the highly specialized zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso could be related dates back almost to the discovery of these zzso Although this notion has frequently been revisited since that time, there has been a complete lack of supporting experimental zzso Here we show that the emergence of zzso in zzso occurred very quickly, as a result of the conversion of a zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso nuclear basic proteins of the zzso zzso zzso which we show consists of both a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso of the genes zzso these proteins to that of a sister zzso zzso zzso has indicated this rapid and dramatic change is most likely the result of zzso zzso in the tail of the zzso zzso zzso By establishing an evolutionary link between the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso proteins of the zzso these results provide unequivocal support to the notion that zzso zzso evolved from zzso
