The promoter of the zzso zzso zzso gene contains two zzso which are critical sites for zzso zzso by the binding of zzso zzso We have identified zzso nuclear zzso protein U zzso zzso as a component of the complex formed on the zzso promoter region of the zzso gene by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso U was responsible for the association with zzso zzso zzso of zzso U with zzso interference blocked the induction of the zzso gene and cell growth by serum zzso suggesting that zzso U is a zzso of the zzso complex and essential for cell zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the segment between the two zzso in the promoter is the primary binding site of zzso zzso The putative binding sequence was zzso to a zzso segment by comparing the sequence between the zzso with the binding sites of zzso zzso which were recently identified in the promoter of zzso a core component of the zzso molecular zzso These findings increase our knowledge of how the zzso complex exerts its zzso regulatory role and suggest that zzso U may be a zzso of this zzso zzso zzso
