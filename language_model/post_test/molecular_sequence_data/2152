A cloned zzso zzso gene from the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize the in zzso expression of the zzso zzso genes in this zzso by zzso zzso zzso The gene represents an isolated zzso unit zzso solely zzso zzso Under exponential growth conditions, zzso was initiated at a single promoter, which represents the structural equivalent of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso region was very similar to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso segment that is responsible for zzso The zzso zzso leader region was approximately 85 zzso shorter than its zzso coli zzso zzso Potential processing zzso were correlated with a proposed secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso
