zzso is normally a zzso process that occurs as soon as a nascent and unfolded zzso chain has emerged zzso zzso into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the efficient zzso of an zzso site engineered within the zzso extreme zzso zzso of distinct integral membrane zzso a native zzso resident protein and an engineered zzso zzso This zzso addition required that the zzso zzso within an zzso zzso be located at least four zzso away from the zzso of the zzso and, in the case of membrane zzso at least 13 zzso away from the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the natural zzso of the proteins studied were attached zzso whereas zzso zzso occurred zzso within a time frame of hours in zzso zzso zzso and minutes in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cell expression systems, affinity zzso zzso zzso may facilitate the determination of orientation of the zzso tail of membrane proteins relative to the zzso
