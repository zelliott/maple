zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were obtained from a zzso cell suspension culture of zzso rape zzso zzso zzso zzso Jet zzso zzso shares a very high level of identity with zzso but is a smaller protein lacking the relatively zzso zzso segment found in zzso Both transcripts were produced in the cell suspension cultures and the zzso were functionally expressed in transformed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso metabolism and expression of zzso were examined in the cell suspension cultures following transfer of cells from media containing zzso zzso zzso to media containing zzso zzso zzso content and zzso activity of the cells increased zzso within the first 12 h after transfer zzso The rapid decline in zzso content observed at 12 zzso was zzso related to an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The transient increases in zzso content and zzso activity correlated with the elevated amounts of zzso zzso zzso levels were also zzso but levels of zzso zzso zzso were not tightly correlated with zzso activity and amount of zzso suggesting some control of expression at the zzso zzso In general, the rapid changes in zzso content were closely associated with the changes in the activity of zzso zzso and expression of zzso
