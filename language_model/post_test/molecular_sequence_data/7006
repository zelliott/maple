We compared the trafficking of the zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso and two zzso zzso proteins containing the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso canine kidney zzso cells to determine whether different mechanisms might be used in zzso sorting of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which contained the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus zzso was delivered directly to the zzso zzso zzso contained the zzso and zzso zzso of influenza zzso Both zzso and zzso were delivered directly to the zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso in zzso zzso during zzso zzso as it associates with zzso zzso Neither hybrid protein was zzso zzso though the small amount of zzso that was zzso to the zzso surface was zzso We examined the effects of three drugs known to interfere with membrane trafficking on sorting and delivery of zzso and the hybrid zzso zzso had no effect on sorting or surface expression of any of the zzso zzso affected the sorting of both zzso and zzso but not of zzso zzso A appeared to disrupt the sorting of zzso and zzso but not of zzso This conclusion was tempered by the observation that this drug affected the distribution of proteins at the cell zzso Thus, sorting and transport of zzso and zzso zzso proteins are similar in a number of zzso
