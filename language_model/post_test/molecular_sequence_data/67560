A tomato zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in fruit with a maximum expression at the breaker stage while expression in roots, zzso leaves and flowers is very zzso It represents a potential candidate for the formation of aroma zzso by zzso alcohols and zzso The zzso zzso protein produced in zzso coli exhibited zzso activity towards several volatile compounds present in tomato zzso with a strong preference for the zzso zzso The strongest activity was observed for the reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso process of zzso and zzso was much less efficient zzso of zzso and zzso respectively), indicating that the zzso zzso acts as a zzso However activity was observed only for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the corresponding zzso No activity could be detected for other aroma zzso important for tomato zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to assess the function of the zzso zzso transgenic plants have been generated using the technique of zzso interference zzso zzso zzso using the zzso promoter resulted in the generation of dwarf plants, indicating that the zzso zzso although zzso expressed in zzso zzso had a function in regulating plant zzso zzso zzso using the zzso promoter had no zzso effect and did not alter the zzso balance of the zzso compounds produced by the zzso Nevertheless, zzso fruit unexpectedly accumulated higher zzso of zzso and zzso volatile compounds of the zzso pathway, possibly as an indirect effect of the suppression of zzso on the zzso of zzso and/or integrity of zzso
