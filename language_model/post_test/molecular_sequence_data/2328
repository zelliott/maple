One potent zzso zzso of human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso is zzso zzso protein Tax zzso zzso zzso zzso through the long terminal repeat zzso by using a zzso repeated zzso sequence as the zzso In this report we have characterized the induction of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso By zzso progressively deleted zzso in the zzso zzso we have zzso a zzso sequence in the zzso which is capable of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso to zzso promoters in a zzso zzso This zzso zzso element is specifically recognized by zzso factors from zzso zzso We show that zzso of this sequence by zzso zzso does not require de zzso cellular protein zzso When the zzso zzso was simultaneously activated by both Tax and zzso an additive effect was zzso This suggests the use of distinct regulatory pathways by the two respective zzso
