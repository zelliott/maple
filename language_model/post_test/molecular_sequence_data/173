Almost all zzso have brown or zzso eyes zzso but among zzso there are some prominent blue-eyed zzso The blue eyes of some humans and zzso are a striking example of zzso evolution of a rare zzso on distant branches of the zzso zzso Recent work on humans indicates that blue eye color is associated with, and likely caused by, a single zzso zzso zzso in an zzso of the gene zzso which likely regulates expression of the neighboring pigmentation gene zzso This raises the immediate question of whether blue eyes in zzso might have a similar genetic zzso We addressed this by sequencing the zzso genetic region in the blue-eyed black zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso 4) and the zzso black zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso which has brown zzso We then compared a zzso segment corresponding to and zzso the human zzso region in these zzso as well as other primates zzso zzso orangutan, macaque, zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso sequences indicated that this region is strongly zzso in both zzso zzso subspecies as well as the other primates (except blue-eyed zzso zzso it is unlikely that this regulatory segment plays a major role in eye color differences among zzso as it does in zzso Although zzso zzso can sometimes come about via the same or similar genetic changes occurring zzso this does not seem to be the case here, as we have shown that the genetic basis of blue eyes in zzso differs from that of zzso
