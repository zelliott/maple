Key steps in zzso export are the nuclear assembly of zzso zzso particles zzso the zzso of zzso through the nuclear pore complex zzso and the zzso zzso events at the zzso side of the zzso zzso is a constituent of the zzso filaments of the zzso specific to higher zzso and provides a multitude of binding sites for the zzso transport zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso at zzso zzso The structure reveals an zzso domain that harbors three central zzso repeats zzso flanked on each side by an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, the zzso adopts an unusual extended zzso that lacks the characteristic zzso groove observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso the vast majority of the zzso surface exhibits an zzso zzso positive zzso potential, and we demonstrate that the zzso possesses the capability to bind zzso zzso in zzso Together, these data suggest that the zzso contributes to zzso zzso events at the zzso face of the zzso
