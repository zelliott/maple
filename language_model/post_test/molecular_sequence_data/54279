Cap zzso is a critical step in several zzso zzso zzso pathways and is carried out by the zzso zzso zzso complex containing zzso at the zzso zzso In zzso zzso is an essential zzso of zzso and zzso such as zzso and zzso are thought to enhance activity, though their mechanism remains zzso Using kinetic analysis we show that a crucial function of zzso is to couple the binding of zzso of zzso to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso bind zzso via its zzso zzso recognition site and stimulate zzso by zzso affecting both the zzso for zzso and rate of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is necessary and sufficient to enhance the zzso step, while the remainder of the protein likely increases zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain or the zzso zzso sequence are sufficient to block zzso These results identify a new role of zzso which is to link the binding of zzso to zzso recognition and zzso of zzso
