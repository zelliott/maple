zzso Z zzso is a water channel protein from zzso coli and has attracted many attentions to develop the zzso water zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis zzso system, one of the most complex zzso systems, has the ability of producing the integral membrane protein in zzso To enhance the synthesis of zzso in zzso coli zzso system, several natural leader peptides were respectively fused at the zzso and were verified to enhance the expression level zzso Moreover, the supplementation of zzso or zzso could activate leader zzso from the zzso extract and provide zzso environment for proper folding of zzso Thus, the release of mature zzso via the in zzso removal of leader zzso was zzso with a specific water transport activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this in zzso removable leader zzso strategy, the zzso leader sequence zzso and membrane protein folding were integrated into a simple process in the zzso system, providing a convenient approach to enhance the expression of target zzso especially those membrane proteins difficult to zzso
