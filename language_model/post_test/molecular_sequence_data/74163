The majority of zzso species release an alarm zzso with the most common component being the zzso zzso sometimes accompanied by other zzso or zzso The zzso involved in the production of these compounds have not been identified in zzso although some components of zzso zzso have been identified in other insect zzso Here we report the zzso expression and zzso of a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso which can act as a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso to produce both zzso and zzso and hence could be responsible for the zzso of the observed components of the alarm zzso In addition, the zzso can zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso showing that the synthesis of the latter involves the sequential zzso of zzso zzso zzso
