The zzso family of zzso zzso are crucial for the signaling of a large number of different zzso zzso including the zzso many zzso erythropoietin, and growth zzso Through their interaction with zzso the zzso initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the zzso of gene zzso and ultimately a cellular response to various zzso In addition to their role in cellular zzso zzso of zzso activity has been implicated in several disease zzso In identifying zzso proteins with the zzso zzso system, we cloned the human zzso of the zzso zzso tumor zzso gene lethal () zzso zzso discs, which encodes the protein zzso zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso represent members of the zzso family of molecular zzso The zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso zzso and zzso We confirmed the interaction between zzso and zzso or zzso by zzso from zzso cells expressing these zzso The interaction between zzso zzso and zzso was shown in zzso zzso We further showed that zzso interacts with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, using a zzso construct where the zzso domain of zzso zzso was fused to the zzso domain of zzso we showed that zzso binds more efficiently to the zzso with an active zzso domain than to a similar construct with an inactive zzso zzso Additionally, the data demonstrate that zzso zzso as well as zzso interact with zzso in zzso and the interaction between zzso and zzso is reduced after zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso
