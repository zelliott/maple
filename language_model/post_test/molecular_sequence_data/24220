zzso zzso zzso a common zzso precursor to the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important branch point zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to be a key zzso in zzso of zzso zzso we report the first confirmation of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso 

The open reading frame for full-length zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso long with calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences revealed high zzso with other plant zzso zzso Several highly zzso regions, including two zzso motifs were zzso zzso expression of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein in tobacco cells demonstrated zzso zzso in the zzso zzso production was observed in zzso coli harboring zzso from zzso zzso and zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso functional zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was strong in leaves, decreased in stems and very little expression was observed in zzso 

This investigation proposed that zzso was zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to be involved in the zzso of zzso which is primarily zzso in the leaves and subsequently accumulates in the stems and zzso
