The ability of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to function as a zzso zzso is attributable to certain of its zzso not to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso zzso was zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso produced were zzso by zzso and zzso for zzso zzso activity in zzso Each zzso digest of zzso contained a heavily zzso zzso approximately 55,000 apparent zzso that exhibited zzso zzso activity in zzso To determine the region of zzso zzso from which the active zzso were zzso Western gel zzso employing an zzso directed against a specific zzso zzso zzso and automated zzso zzso acid sequencing were zzso zzso of these experiments strongly suggest that the active zzso produced by zzso of zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso are derived from the same region of the zzso half of the zzso zzso These and other findings are discussed in terms of zzso structure and zzso
