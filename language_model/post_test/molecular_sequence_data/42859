The details of zzso DNA zzso zzso structure of the northern zzso mouse zzso zzso were examined using populations from a zzso area of zzso that includes three arid regions zzso zzso Interior Plains, and Wyoming zzso in western North zzso Fifteen zzso and zzso restriction zzso were used to zzso zzso variation in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso representing the zzso and part of the zzso gene zzso A total of 18 zzso zzso were zzso Although overall genetic divergence among these zzso was low zzso zzso zzso zzso structuring was zzso zzso a clear zzso split separated one group of zzso restricted to the Wyoming zzso from all zzso This zzso split was further zzso by examination of zzso sequence variation from a zzso stretch of the zzso zzso b zzso zzso geographic and zzso patterns suggest a complex history of geographic structuring and subsequent mixing of populations of zzso mice throughout the late zzso These patterns of variation are evaluated relative to alternative hypotheses about zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso in western North American arid zzso
