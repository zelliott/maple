All steroid receptors possess a zzso nuclear zzso signal sequence zzso that zzso within the second zinc finger of their zzso zzso zzso mapping of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a composite signal composed of three distinct zzso that function effectively when present in unique zzso At least one of the zzso zzso appears to influence zzso trafficking within the nucleus, as revealed by a unique nuclear zzso pattern of receptors possessing a point zzso zzso zzso at position zzso zzso at zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso possessing various point zzso at zzso localized within a limited number of large zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso targeting when present in full-length zzso reflecting a protective effect of the zzso zzso domain that can be exerted in zzso and in zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso targeting were not autonomous because we also observed a zzso zzso of zzso the zzso heat shock zzso within nuclear zzso that include zzso zzso zzso The elimination of zzso zzso by zzso of an zzso partner zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso system is mobilized to specific sites within the nucleus in response to inappropriate targeting or folding of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso defective zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso Thus, molecular zzso such as members of the zzso and zzso families, may survey the nucleus for zzso proteins and actively participate in their zzso into biologically active zzso zzso
