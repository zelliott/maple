zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are related zinc zzso involved in the processing of biologically active zzso Only zzso however, exists as a zzso zzso The zzso linkage in rat zzso is between zzso in each zzso which is equivalent to zzso in rabbit zzso Here we report that directed zzso of zzso to zzso in rabbit zzso creates a zzso zzso as revealed by transient zzso in zzso cells and zzso of a membrane zzso Under reducing conditions, both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso migrate as a zzso of 92 zzso However, under zzso conditions, the Mr of the wild type remains zzso whereas that of the zzso is zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not result in the production of a zzso zzso zzso of the kinetic zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso as zzso show a decrease of zzso 50% in zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso value for zzso of the zzso by zzso or zzso is increased zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso exhibit only about zzso identity and differ substantially in zzso specificity and some other zzso these data indicate that they have considerable similarity in three-dimensional structure, allowing zzso formation in the zzso zzso with the zzso link probably occurring in a zzso surface zzso
