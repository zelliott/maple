In the dairy industry, zzso zzso contribute to improving the texture and zzso of cheese and zzso and also receive increasing attention because of their beneficial properties for zzso For zzso acid bacteria, the production of zzso is well zzso However, for dairy zzso the zzso of zzso is poorly zzso A zzso zzso gene was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso zzso This gene best zzso with zzso the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso type 37 that is responsible for the production of a zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification showed the presence of an internal zzso of this gene in twelve strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a ropy zzso in zzso zzso The gene sequence is highly zzso as less than zzso of zzso differed among the 10 strains containing the complete zzso zzso The same zzso failed to detect the gene in zzso zzso strain zzso 47, which is known to zzso zzso in zzso The presence of zzso zzso capsule was demonstrated for 7 out of 12 strains by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso corresponding to the gene was detected by zzso in three strains at both exponential and stationary growth zzso This work represents the first identification of a zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso and further studies will be undertaken to zzso the role of zzso zzso
