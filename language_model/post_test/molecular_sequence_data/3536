Death zzso zzso proteins are involved in important cellular processes such as zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a novel nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso shares significant sequence zzso zzso and structural zzso to another zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso but not with the other zzso proteins zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to, and sequesters zzso in the nucleus upon zzso in human cell zzso Using the zzso zzso system to identify zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso factor zzso was identified as a zzso and zzso interacting zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso with zzso in zzso cells zzso the zzso from the zzso and zzso of zzso in the nucleus, indicating that zzso and zzso form strong zzso with zzso and might be important regulators of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso cells inhibited the expression of a zzso gene under the control of the zzso zzso Our data provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of zzso proteins in the regulation of components of the general zzso machinery in the zzso
