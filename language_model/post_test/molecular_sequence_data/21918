zzso zzso is the major royal jelly zzso and honey zzso having various biological zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso is a regular component of honey and zzso zzso and stimulates zzso to release tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso The zzso zzso zzso and its four zzso protein fragments derived on the basis of partial zzso products of zzso were prepared by zzso expression in zzso coli zzso zzso at 50 zzso concentration was used for improving the zzso protein zzso We report that the zzso zzso of zzso is responsible for stimulation of zzso production by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we have shown that zzso effect is significantly increased after partial zzso zzso of zzso It has been determined that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is the most active zzso of zzso release in comparison to other three protein fragments of zzso as well as to the native zzso and zzso Furthermore, it was found that native honey was able to stimulate zzso zzso from zzso zzso whereas the zzso honey had no effect on the release of zzso This result suggests that zzso effect of honey is based on its zzso content, primarily on its dominant protein zzso
