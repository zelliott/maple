zzso zzso C has been implicated as a cellular target for zzso zzso We have previously proposed that zzso zzso zzso activity by interacting with multiple sites within the zzso In order to further characterize the zzso interactions we compared the effects of zzso on the zzso and zzso protein zzso C zzso using zzso human zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso of bovine brain protein zzso C, the zzso The results demonstrate that, whereas at zzso zzso zzso activates zzso half zzso zzso approximately 2 zzso it has no effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso is additive with zzso in a manner indicating interaction with half of the calcium zzso zzso In the zzso range of zzso zzso zzso all zzso with estimated zzso of zzso zzso 28, and 93 zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso effects on zzso zzso indicates a mixed type zzso with respect to zzso and zzso zzso with respect to zzso Taken together with the results of our previous study zzso and zzso zzso zzso 64, zzso zzso and the evidence for the existence of two zzso coordination sites zzso and zzso within the C2 domain zzso et zzso Science zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the results of the current study provide further support for a zzso zzso interaction scheme wherein lead zzso partially activates the zzso through zzso interactions with the zzso site and zzso the zzso zzso activity through zzso interactions with zzso site in the C2 domain and zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity through zzso interactions with the zzso zzso The concentration dependence of the differential effects of zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso underscores the importance of the C2 motif as a high affinity molecular target for zzso
