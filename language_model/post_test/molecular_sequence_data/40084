Development of hybrid rice has greatly contributed to increased yields during the past three zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are being zzso in developing new hybrid rice zzso When the male sterile lines are developed in such a zzso background, the problem of F1 seed contamination by zzso from the sterile lines can be solved by zzso zzso at zzso zzso We first determined the sensitivity of the zzso plants to zzso Both zzso showed symptoms to zzso starting from 100 zzso which was about zzso lower than the sensitivity threshold of their zzso zzso In addition, both zzso were sensitive to zzso zzso The locus for the zzso zzso is bel for zzso and zzso for zzso Tests showed that the two zzso are zzso to each zzso The two genes were cloned by zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso zzso had a zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso The two zzso are renamed bel ( a ) (for zzso and bel ( b ) (for zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso named zzso Analysis of the zzso protein sequence also revealed the reason for bel ( a ) being slightly tolerant than bel ( b zzso Introduction of the zzso zzso gene rescued the zzso and zzso zzso of bel ( a ) zzso On the other hand, expression of zzso zzso in zzso induced a zzso zzso Based on these results we conclude that the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso resistance to two different classes of zzso
