zzso is a key regulator of zzso inflammation and is selectively expressed by zzso zzso zzso An important role for the zzso zzso and zzso sites in regulating zzso zzso is generally accepted but the significance of an adjacent zzso site has remained zzso We have investigated its role using the mouse zzso clone zzso zzso of zzso reporter gene plasmids could be induced in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation and significantly further enhanced by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Strong induction of zzso zzso was also induced by zzso zzso showed that the zzso site is of critical importance along with the zzso and zzso sites in regulating zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate the zzso factors which could function at the three sites and possible synergistic zzso zzso zzso strongly induced zzso zzso and dominant negative zzso zzso confirmed that zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso zzso unlike other members of the zzso family, zzso strongly with zzso suggesting that zzso is the family member which functions at the zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso promoter region, demonstrated by zzso zzso was zzso by zzso The absolute dependence on the binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso together with the strong zzso between zzso and zzso suggest close cooperative interactions between the three zzso factors in the regulation of zzso expression in mouse T zzso
