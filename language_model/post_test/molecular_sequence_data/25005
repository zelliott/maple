zzso stacking zzso of zzso with DNA as template was investigated using three types of zzso zzso zzso stacked with the stem of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso or three zzso zzso short zzso with a common DNA zzso zzso Delta H degrees and zzso Delta S degrees of the zzso stacking of adjacent duplexes were determined for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (*) zzso base zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso interaction was found for the zzso interface zzso G zzso zzso and the minimal one for the zzso interface zzso G zzso zzso at 37 degrees zzso As a whole, the efficiency of the base pairs interaction Delta G zzso in the zzso is not lower than that within the intact DNA zzso zzso G zzso These observed Delta G zzso values are proposed may include the effect of the partial removal of fraying at the adjacent zzso ends additionally to the effect of the direct stacking of the terminal base pairs in the duplex junction zzso G zzso The zzso parameters have been found to describe adequately the formation of all tandem complexes of the II and III types with zzso of various length and zzso zzso The performed zzso analysis reveals features of stacking zzso zzso which allow one to predict the temperature dependence of association of zzso and the DNA template within tandem complexes as well as to determine optimal concentration for formation of these complexes characterized by high zzso zzso
