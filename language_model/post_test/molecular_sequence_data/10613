The effects of a synthetic putative zzso zzso zzso releasing factor zzso zzso zzso on pancreatic zzso zzso were examined in conscious zzso rats and a zzso strain of rats lacking the zzso zzso zzso injection of graded doses of the zzso zzso induced zzso responses in zzso zzso The injection of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso produced a zzso response, while 1 zzso produced a lower zzso No significant effect was observed in rats lacking the zzso zzso The synthetic zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso via zzso receptors in conscious zzso
