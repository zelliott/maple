A zzso zzso and moderately zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a saline lake of Xinjiang province in zzso The isolate showed zzso and zzso reactions and did not reduce zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the isolate was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso with zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso and formed a tight zzso group with zzso zzso zzso with a zzso value of 99 % within the family zzso However, strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed a zzso lineage distinct from other zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of strain zzso with other related type species were lower than zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular properties, it is clear that zzso zzso should be reclassified in the new zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and that strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
