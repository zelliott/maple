zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in embryonic patterning and adult stem cell renewal but has recently been found also to be involved in certain stem cell zzso One of the first steps in zzso signaling is the zzso of zzso zzso in which the zzso domain zzso zzso a zzso zzso reaction that leads to the production of the cholesterol zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso thereby yielding a signaling zzso that activates the zzso zzso by binding to the zzso zzso This article describes an in zzso homogeneous zzso system that measures changes in zzso polarization that accompany the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso system makes use of a modified zzso protein in which zzso which is not essential for zzso is replaced by a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso is quite robust and easily adapted to zzso screening in zzso plates with zzso factors above zzso It has been used to screen the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection, which has led to the identification of 2 compounds that inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso protein at zzso zzso
