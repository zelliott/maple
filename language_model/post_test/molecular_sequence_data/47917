The zzso zzso zzso the zzso named zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso It encodes a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 57 zzso as determined by zzso Using zzso directed against zzso zzso we showed the expression of this zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The serum did not zzso with other members of the zzso zzso zzso hence showing that zzso was zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso within the subspecies and was used for the development of a specific zzso zzso for the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain an zzso It showed high similarity to functional zzso genes of other zzso in the zzso zzso zzso However, it contained interrupted open reading zzso Moreover, the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso in different strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso were quite zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso had a size similar to that of the functional zzso genes of other zzso of the zzso zzso cluster and occupied the same zzso location as the latter ones in the vicinity of the zzso zzso This study showed that all members of the zzso zzso cluster contain each a zzso zzso respectively zzso specific zzso gene analogue which encodes a zzso that has structural and functional relationship to the surface zzso zzso zzso previously named zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the exception of zzso zzso zzso zzso which seems not to express an zzso zzso
