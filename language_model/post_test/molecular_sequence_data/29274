zzso class II zzso control the specificity of zzso immune responses and zzso to many zzso zzso zzso the role of zzso class II zzso in immunity is hampered by the lack of animal models expressing these genes as authentic zzso In this study we describe transgenic expression of the zzso prone zzso zzso zzso from a zzso artificial zzso zzso containing an intact zzso region from zzso zzso to zzso In zzso mice zzso DR and zzso gene products were expressed on B cells, zzso and zzso cells, but not on T cells indicating zzso zzso Positive selection of the zzso compartment by human class II molecules was zzso efficient in zzso mice lacking zzso class II molecules zzso and expressing only zzso zzso A broad range of zzso zzso families was used in the peripheral T cell repertoire, which was also zzso of zzso zzso and zzso T cells by zzso mouse zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso background was associated with normal zzso clearance of virus from zzso mice and development of zzso protection from otherwise lethal infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cell responses were also zzso following zzso with known T cell zzso presented by these zzso These findings demonstrate the potential for human zzso class II zzso to function efficiently in transgenic mice and should provide valuable tools for developing humanized models of zzso zzso zzso
