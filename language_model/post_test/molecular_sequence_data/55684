We describe a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated by enriching for genes expressed in a mouse zzso cell line but not expressed in a mouse zzso cell zzso The complete zzso sequence is predicted to zzso a protein of approximately 38,000 Da that contains a zzso zzso domain and three zzso zinc fingers within the zzso zzso Additional sequence analyses reveal that the zzso zinc fingers are most zzso to the zzso family of zzso factors and also allow us to predict potential zzso target sites for the zzso zzso On the basis of this zzso we show that zzso is able to bind the sequence zzso zzso zzso an essential element of the zzso zzso Its tissue distribution establishes that the zzso transcript is expressed only in bone zzso and zzso the two zzso zzso of the zzso and analysis of zzso cell lines indicates that zzso expression is limited to zzso and mast cell zzso zzso zzso establish that zzso zzso activates a target promoter that contains its zzso zzso The tissue expression pattern of zzso in conjunction with its function as a zzso zzso strongly suggests that the zzso protein may be intimately involved in establishment and/or maintenance of the zzso cell zzso
