The construction is described of a molecular probe to P virus, a double stranded zzso virus belonging to the zzso which is an endemic pathogen of swimming zzso in British coastal waters and the zzso The probe zzso to the P virus zzso and can be easily produced in large quantities by zzso It may be used by dot zzso or in zzso zzso to specifically detect P virus in zzso and cells of natural or zzso infected zzso zzso of tissue samples with this probe show that the virus zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso This is the first gene probe to be constructed for a native viral pathogen of temperate water zzso and it will be useful to study virus ecology and zzso interactions in zzso and in zzso An understanding of these processes is essential to control and manage disease and, ultimately, to identify immune zzso capable of destroying viral zzso
