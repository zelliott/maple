zzso I is a potent zzso zzso zzso isolated from the skin zzso of wounded zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the mechanism of zzso I production from zzso zzso in zzso skin zzso on zzso zzso zzso D is found to exist in the zzso as an inactive zzso zzso zzso and a zzso induced on injury, zzso zzso D to generate active zzso zzso This activated form of zzso D then zzso the zzso bond of zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso zzso zzso a precursor of zzso I, and zzso D are present in the zzso of zzso zzso cells and that zzso I is produced on the zzso surface on zzso zzso Western zzso analysis shows that zzso I is also present in the skin zzso of other fish zzso Furthermore, zzso I shows good zzso activity against zzso bacterial zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso D and a zzso participate in the production of zzso I from zzso zzso and that zzso I contributes to the innate host defense of the fish against invading zzso
