zzso based on various inhibitor studies previously performed, zzso came to be regarded as zzso zzso Not completely satisfied with this generally accepted zzso we performed a series of zzso zzso studies on one particular zzso of zzso zzso zzso that was involved in its zzso zzso For these experiments, the zzso zzso was produced as the inclusion body in zzso coli to greatly facilitate its recovery and subsequent zzso With regard to the zzso active site zzso zzso a zzso zzso Ala zzso zzso still retained zzso of the original specific zzso In sharp contrast, zzso in certain other positions in the neighborhood of zzso had a far more dramatic effect on the zzso zzso acid substitution of zzso reduced the specific activity of the zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso substitution as well as zzso zzso Ala substitution completely abolished the specific zzso It would thus appear that, among various zzso zzso residing within the so-called signature sequence common to all zzso the real active site zzso are zzso and zzso rather than zzso zzso as an zzso bond zzso in the zzso zzso is not too far structurally removed from a zzso bond zzso the signature sequences of various zzso were compared with the active site sequences of various types of zzso It was found that zzso acid and zzso zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso are present within the active site sequences of zzso zzso thus suggesting the evolutionary relationship between the zzso
