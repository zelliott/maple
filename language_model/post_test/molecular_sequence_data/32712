Since the mid-1990s, lethal infections of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso threatening the worldwide production of common carp and zzso (both zzso zzso The complete zzso sequences of three zzso strains from Japan, the United States, and Israel revealed a zzso zzso containing a zzso terminal direct zzso The finding that 15 zzso genes have clear zzso in the zzso related channel zzso virus zzso zzso 1) confirms the proposed place of zzso in the family zzso specifically in the branch with fish and zzso zzso zzso thus has the largest zzso reported to date for this zzso The three strains were interpreted as having arisen from a zzso parent zzso 156 unique zzso zzso 8 of which are duplicated in the terminal zzso In each strain, four to seven genes from among a set of nine are fragmented by zzso likely to render the zzso proteins zzso Six of the affected genes zzso predicted membrane zzso zzso or other zzso close to the 3' ends of coding sequences were identified in a further six zzso The conclusion that at least some of these zzso occurred in zzso zzso the hypothesis that loss of gene functions might be associated with emergence of the disease and provides a basis for further investigations into the molecular epidemiology of the zzso
