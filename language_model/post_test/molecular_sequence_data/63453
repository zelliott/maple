zzso are highly structured zzso elements located in the zzso region of zzso zzso that directly bind small zzso zzso to regulate gene zzso zzso and zzso studies have revealed zzso experience significant zzso zzso changes that are coupled to zzso To monitor the zzso of zzso binding and zzso folding within the zzso domain of the zzso zzso we have chemically zzso the zzso with zzso zzso zzso over a broad temperature zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso in the presence and absence of zzso reveals that a limited set of zzso within the binding pocket change their zzso in response to zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that a zzso zzso interaction serves to restrict the zzso freedom of a significant portion of the three-way zzso thereby promoting zzso binding under zzso zzso
