The transient zzso potential zzso zzso channels are thought to be involved in the entry of calcium zzso into zzso In this study, we isolated a zzso zzso zzso that shows high zzso to zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso member of the zzso family, from a zzso zzso zzso egg zzso zzso We analyzed its properties using zzso zzso Upon reduction of zzso zzso the zzso calcium concentration was found to increase in zzso zzso This increase in zzso calcium concentration was dependent on the presence of zzso calcium zzso and was inhibited by treatment with zzso zzso a zzso calcium channel zzso Thus, these results indicate that zzso egg zzso is an zzso sensitive zzso zzso
