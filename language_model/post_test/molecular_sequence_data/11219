Previously, we identified an zzso binding factor zzso a zzso serum zzso which interacts with zzso envelope proteins and which is also located in the membrane of normal human zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 67, zzso Here we show that zzso is a neutral zzso which shares zzso specificity and properties with a newly described family of membrane type zzso zzso zzso treatment of the zzso resulted in the zzso of the zzso part of the middle zzso envelope protein at the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso a single zzso zzso zzso zzso affected the zzso of the large zzso protein with zzso zzso probably inducing the zzso change of the zzso zzso The zzso virus remained zzso intact with unchanged S zzso zzso The structural modifications of the viral envelope proteins induced by zzso enabled cell membrane attachment and viral entry into the zzso Both processes were blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso of the envelope proteins seems to be essential for the zzso entry into the zzso zzso under a membrane bound or a zzso form could be (one zzso the zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso
