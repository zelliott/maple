zzso C virus zzso is a major cause of zzso and sporadic zzso worldwide, leading to chronic liver disease in at least 50% of infected zzso The zzso mechanisms that result in chronic zzso are zzso zzso are typically observed within the zzso zzso but the functional characteristics of these cells have not been zzso In this study, zzso zzso from two subjects with chronic zzso zzso were cloned at limiting dilution and tested for zzso zzso activity using zzso target cells infected with zzso viruses expressing zzso zzso zzso or zzso with synthetic zzso zzso In both subjects, zzso zzso class zzso zzso were identified that recognized zzso in variable regions of either the envelope or zzso zzso These results demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso at the site of tissue damage in persons with chronic zzso zzso and provide a means to evaluate the possible zzso role of these cells in zzso zzso
