The complement system helps in the zzso of invading pathogens and zzso the inflammatory as well as the zzso and cellular immune zzso zzso mediates many potent inflammatory and zzso events after zzso zzso by complement zzso zzso zzso to investigate the role of pig zzso ( zzso as a candidate gene for disease resistance in zzso the complete zzso of zzso was zzso screened for single zzso zzso zzso and an association analysis with various zzso parameters measured in zzso animals of a pig resource population based on a cross of zzso and Berlin miniature pigs zzso was carried zzso In total, zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso which codes for the zzso precursor of zzso Four zzso sites were zzso one of which was segregating in the zzso population in three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Classical zzso and alternative zzso complement activities, zzso levels, zzso zzso acute phase protein levels, and zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso vaccines were measured in the resource zzso Association analysis between zzso and the zzso parameters was carried out using repeated measures mixed and general linear model zzso The zzso AA was found to be significantly different from the other two zzso with respect to zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso was found to be significantly different from the other zzso for zzso and zzso zzso No significant difference could be seen between zzso for zzso zzso against zzso Association of zzso with complement activity traits and acute phase proteins promotes zzso as a candidate gene for innate disease zzso
