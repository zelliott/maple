zzso zzso zzso complexes consist of zzso zzso zzso and auxiliary zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso which can zzso zzso function in specific zzso The zzso effects of four zzso zzso binding to various auxiliary zzso amplify the functional diversity of zzso The significance and magnitude of molecular diversity, however, remain zzso To gain insight into the molecular complexity of zzso and zzso zzso we compared the proteins that zzso with each zzso type in the rat zzso This zzso study identified the majority of known interacting proteins and, more importantly, provides candidates for additional zzso We validate the zzso zzso zzso as a newly identified binding zzso unique zzso of zzso zzso zzso by detailed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso extends the functional variety of zzso complexes, and further investigation of other candidates may reveal additional complexity of zzso zzso zzso zzso
