An outer membrane protein from zzso zzso with a mass of zzso was isolated and evaluated as a vaccine zzso The zzso protein binds zzso and appears to be related to the other proteins from the zzso that are reported to bind zzso The zzso protein possessed zzso zzso exposed on the bacterial zzso This is based on the zzso with whole bacterial cells as well as complement dependent zzso activity of zzso from mice zzso with the isolated proteins from the zzso and zzso zzso However, there was divergence in the degree of zzso zzso with the protein from one strain to zzso This zzso divergence was reflected in both the zzso zzso activities of the zzso zzso in mice and the capacity of immune mice to clear the bacteria in a zzso pulmonary zzso zzso affinity zzso from human plasma lacked zzso activity even though they were zzso with all the tested zzso The zzso protein appears to be a good vaccine candidate, but more studies are needed to understand its zzso zzso and whether zzso toward it are zzso
