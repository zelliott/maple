zzso receptors comprised of different zzso zzso exhibit zzso unique zzso and pharmacological zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso controls pharmacological and kinetic properties of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso time course, open probability zzso and mean zzso zzso Using zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso we show that the zzso contributes to the low zzso potency of zzso zzso receptors and the high zzso potency of zzso zzso The zzso influences the zzso time courses of zzso zzso as removal of the zzso from zzso slows the zzso rate, while removal of the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso Open probability also is influenced by the zzso zzso of the zzso from zzso or replacement of the zzso with that of zzso decreases zzso in single-channel recordings from zzso patches of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, deletion of the zzso from zzso or replacement of the zzso zzso with that of zzso increases zzso and mean open zzso These data demonstrate the modular nature of zzso zzso and show that the zzso of the different zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso the functional properties of the individual zzso zzso zzso
