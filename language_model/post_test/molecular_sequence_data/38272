We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso fatty acid zzso and demonstrated its activity by zzso expression in zzso zzso The predicted protein is highly zzso both to the cloned plant genes with similar function and to the published sequence of the zzso zzso omega-3 fatty acid zzso In addition, it zzso to the structural constraints expected of a zzso fatty acid zzso including the zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of a cloned animal zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The increase of membrane fluidity brought about by this change in zzso was zzso The production of zzso fatty acids in zzso cells and the zzso increase in membrane fluidity was correlated with a modest increase in growth rate at low temperature and with increased resistance to ethanol and zzso zzso
