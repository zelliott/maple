The complete zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains 37 genes (2 zzso zzso zzso 22 transfer zzso genes and 13 zzso zzso and two large zzso regions zzso zzso and 31 zzso as previously reported for two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The A + T content of the zzso is zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have unusual and unstable secondary zzso Whereas zzso and zzso have identical gene arrangements, the zzso and zzso of zzso differ from them in their zzso and/or zzso This suggests that the zzso and zzso are more closely related to each other than to the zzso Three scenarios are proposed to account for the unique gene arrangement of zzso The data also imply that the zzso and zzso Loss zzso model is zzso to the order zzso zzso zzso zzso and maximum likelihood zzso analyses using zzso acid sequences deduced from the 12 zzso zzso genes zzso zzso support the view that the three zzso members are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are clustered together zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso is a sister of the zzso However, due to conflict with previous reports using zzso approaches based on zzso zzso further studies are needed to confirm the close relationship between zzso and zzso
