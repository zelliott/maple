The growth of zzso zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso protein precursor zzso providing a simple zzso to study the function of zzso Our preliminary study, testing the activity of a series of fragments derived from the zzso form of zzso zzso on this zzso has shown that at least one of the active sites of zzso was localized within a zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Shapiro, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, to further characterize the zzso activity of zzso on zzso we applied a battery of synthetic peptides on this zzso and found that: zzso the sequence of five zzso zzso zzso zzso was uniquely required for the zzso activity of zzso zzso the activity was zzso because the zzso zzso of the active domain had no zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso which partially zzso the zzso side of the active sequence zzso could antagonize the activity of zzso Furthermore, a zzso protein which lacks this active domain zzso without zzso did not promote zzso cell growth, suggesting that this domain is the only site of zzso involved in the growth zzso The availability of these biologically active, short peptides and their zzso should prove to be an essential step for the zzso of zzso involvement in regulation of cellular zzso
