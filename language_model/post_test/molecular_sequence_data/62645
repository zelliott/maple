Signal sequences target proteins for zzso from cells or for integration into cell zzso As nascent proteins emerge from the zzso signal sequences are recognized by the signal recognition particle zzso which subsequently associates with its zzso zzso In this complex, the zzso and zzso stimulate each other's zzso activity, and zzso zzso ensures zzso targeting of cargo through a zzso pore in the zzso To define the mechanism of zzso zzso we determined the zzso A structure of the complex formed between these two zzso The two partners form a zzso symmetrical zzso zzso analysis supports the importance of the extensive interaction zzso Complex formation zzso the two zzso molecules in a symmetrical, composite active site, and the zzso groups are essential for association, zzso zzso and zzso This unique circle of twinned interactions is severed twice on zzso leading to complex zzso after cargo zzso
