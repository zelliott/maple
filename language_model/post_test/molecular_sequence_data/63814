The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not a single zzso but a complex composed of three sibling species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Discrimination among these sibling species have been performed by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso length zzso or sequencing analysis of the internal transcribed zzso zzso region of zzso DNA zzso In the present study, zzso zzso were applied for the discrimination of these zzso Based on the sequence differences among zzso zzso complex at the ITS region of zzso forward primer zzso that is expected to be specific to zzso zzso was newly zzso The specific zzso was amplified in only zzso zzso by zzso with zzso but not quite in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso using the forward primer zzso might be zzso for the discrimination of zzso zzso zzso
