zzso analysis based on the pharmacological differences between zzso and zzso zzso II receptors zzso zzso previously identified 7 zzso zzso located in zzso zzso zzso III zzso IV zzso V zzso zzso VI zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the rat AT zzso type zzso zzso zzso that significantly influenced binding of the zzso zzso zzso Further studies have shown that an additional 6 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso II zzso III zzso zzso zzso VI zzso and zzso zzso are important in zzso zzso The 13 zzso required for zzso binding in the zzso zzso were exchanged for the corresponding zzso acids in the zzso AT zzso type a zzso zzso to generate a zzso zzso zzso that bound zzso with the same affinity as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a zzso zzso in which the zzso crucial to formation of a zzso binding site in a zzso zzso hormone zzso were transferred to a previously unresponsive zzso by zzso zzso Ala zzso and comparison of zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that TM III in the zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso Identification of zzso involved in zzso zzso binding will facilitate studies aimed at zzso the chemical basis for zzso recognition in the AT zzso and zzso hormone receptors in zzso
