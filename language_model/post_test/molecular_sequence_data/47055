zzso of bacterial zzso zzso is increasing at a rapid and exciting zzso To obtain an overview of this industrially very important class of zzso and their zzso we have collected and classified the information available from protein and zzso zzso Here we propose an updated and extensive zzso of bacterial zzso and zzso based mainly on a comparison of their zzso acid sequences and some fundamental biological zzso These new insights result in the identification of eight different families with the largest being further divided into six zzso Moreover, the zzso enables us to predict zzso important structural features such as zzso forming the zzso site or the presence of zzso bonds, zzso types of zzso mechanism and requirement for zzso zzso and zzso the potential relationship to other zzso zzso This work will therefore contribute to a faster identification and to an easier characterization of novel bacterial zzso zzso
