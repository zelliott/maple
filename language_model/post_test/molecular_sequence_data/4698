In this study, we have assessed the mechanism of zzso in a series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells following treatment with zzso zzso of zzso The specific zzso degradation and the zzso activities of the zzso protein zzso zzso were assessed in the zzso zzso cell line and two resistant zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso Forty-eight h following zzso treatment, zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso The resistant zzso and zzso cell lines showed greater decreases in activity approaching 80 and zzso zzso The decreases in zzso activity were attributed to zzso degradation of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The extent of degradation zzso the loss of zzso activity, with the resistant cell lines showing the greatest portion of zzso zzso At the same time point, the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to bind DNA was decreased in zzso zzso cells compared to zzso controls, with the decrease in binding activity being attributed to decreased expression of the zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso specific zzso zzso of the zzso and generation of zzso DNA ladders was observed in all cell lines following zzso zzso These data suggest that cell death via the zzso of zzso DNA occurs via zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso
