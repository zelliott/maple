High mobility group proteins 1 and 2 zzso 1 and 2) are abundant zzso proteins which are believed to be zzso associated with regions of active zzso Our previous results have shown that zzso 1 and 2 can significantly stimulate specific zzso in zzso from the zzso major late zzso This stimulation is now shown to be due, at least in part, to the influence of zzso 1 and 2 on binding of a specific zzso factor zzso upstream of the start site of the gene to a region zzso to zzso which is required for optimal zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso 1 and 2 cause both an increase in the rate of binding of the zzso factor to the DNA and zzso to the pattern of the zzso footprint of the factor on the zzso Different binding states of the factor are also observed dependent on the presence of zzso the factor being bound but not protecting the binding region from zzso in the absence of zzso
