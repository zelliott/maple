zzso from zzso zzso cells was used for the construction of a zzso library and screened with zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso B and G zzso One zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso insert was further zzso Complete DNA sequence analysis revealed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso DNA sequences from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and corresponded to the zzso open reading frame of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences of zzso with that of published zzso zzso DNA indicated that there were 14 different bases which results in 7 zzso acid zzso zzso The product of in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso contained the zzso zzso activity and a 52 zzso protein was zzso from the in zzso translation products using serum from a patient with zzso zzso which contained a high level of zzso zzso Northern zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso probe revealed a complex pattern of zzso in this zzso zzso DNA fragments were then used to map these zzso species to the zzso zzso DNA zzso The result of zzso zzso analysis indicated that a zzso zzso containing transcript sized zzso zzso is initiated at zzso zzso zzso 1 and terminated at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
