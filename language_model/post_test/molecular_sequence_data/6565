zzso chain zzso is a zzso membrane protein which binds and zzso major zzso complex class II zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso compartments of zzso zzso In concert with an zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to facilitate loading of conventional class II molecules with peptides before transport of the class zzso complex to the cell surface for recognition by T zzso The interaction of zzso with class II molecules is thought to be zzso in large part through a region of 24 zzso acids (the class zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds as a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso groove of class II molecules in zzso cell zzso Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to demonstrate that a soluble zzso zzso zzso contains significant zzso regions which probably include zzso
