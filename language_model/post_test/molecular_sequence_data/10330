zzso is a zzso reverse zzso zzso that adds DNA repeats to the ends of zzso using its zzso component as a template for zzso zzso activity is detected in the zzso as well as the majority of tumors and zzso cell lines, and at low levels in several types of normal zzso We have cloned a human gene zzso to a protein from zzso zzso and zzso zzso that has reverse zzso motifs and is thought to be the zzso zzso of zzso in those zzso This gene is present in the human zzso as a single copy sequence with a dominant transcript of approximately 4 zzso in a human colon cancer cell line, zzso The zzso sequence was determined using clones from a zzso zzso library and by zzso zzso and zzso on zzso from the same zzso We show that the gene is expressed in several normal zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines and various tumors but is not expressed in the majority of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Multiple products were identified by zzso using zzso within the reverse zzso zzso zzso of these products suggests that they arise by alternative zzso zzso various tumors, cell lines and even normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed considerable differences in the zzso zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transcript may be important for the regulation of zzso activity and may give rise to proteins with different zzso zzso
