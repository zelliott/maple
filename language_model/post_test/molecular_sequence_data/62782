The well-known zzso zzso mouse dilute exhibits a zzso in zzso zzso and although various zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso motor zzso have been identified in dilute mice, why zzso zzso in the zzso tail of zzso a putative zzso site, cause the dilute zzso zzso lighter coat zzso has never been zzso In this study we discovered that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso tail zzso of zzso partially impair the binding of zzso a zzso protein between zzso and zzso on the zzso The zzso site in zzso was mapped to the region zzso acids zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso site, but it is distinct from the zzso site zzso acids zzso The zzso interaction was much weaker than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso found in dilute mice zzso only the zzso interaction and had no effect on the zzso zzso We further showed that expression of green zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso site zzso but not the zzso zzso severely zzso zzso transport in zzso cells, especially at the zzso transfer step from zzso to zzso filaments zzso zzso zzso of zzso On the basis of our findings, we propose that zzso interacts with zzso complex on the zzso via two distinct zzso both of which are essential for zzso transport in zzso
