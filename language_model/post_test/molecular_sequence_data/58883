Spinal muscular zzso zzso is a relatively common, zzso zzso inherited neurodegenerative disorder that maps to human zzso zzso This region of the human zzso has an intricate zzso structure that has complicated the evaluation of zzso candidate zzso We have chosen to study the mouse region zzso for human zzso in the hope that the zzso mouse zzso would contain the same genes as human zzso on a simpler zzso zzso Here, we report the mapping of such a region to mouse zzso 13 and to the critical zzso for zzso a mouse locus responsible for modulating the zzso replication and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We have generated a mouse zzso zzso across the zzso zzso and have mapped the two zzso gene markers for the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso onto this zzso In addition, we have localized the two zzso candidate zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso critical region, making these two genes candidates for the zzso zzso Upon zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso and zzso we have detected a large, low copy number repeat that contains at least one copy of zzso zzso zzso Identification of the zzso gene will either provide a novel function for zzso or zzso or reveal the existence of another, yet zzso gene in the zzso critical zzso zzso in such a gene might help to explain some of the zzso zzso among the human zzso
