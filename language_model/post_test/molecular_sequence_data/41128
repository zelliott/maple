The human gut zzso has a high density of bacteria that are considered a zzso for zzso resistance genes zzso In this study, one zzso zzso library generated from the gut zzso of four healthy humans was used to screen for zzso against seven zzso Eight new zzso were zzso one against zzso six against zzso and one against zzso The new zzso resistance gene encodes a protein with zzso identity to a class D zzso from zzso zzso zzso The six new zzso resistance genes zzso proteins with zzso identity to known zzso zzso The new zzso resistance gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with an zzso zzso acids zzso that has zzso identity to the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and a zzso zzso acids zzso with zzso identity to a hypothetical protein from zzso zzso zzso A functional study on the novel zzso resistance gene showed that only the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that functional zzso is a useful tool for the identification of new zzso
