zzso is a growth zzso immediate early gene initially identified in zzso mouse zzso It encodes a member of an emerging family of zzso zzso proteins that includes a zzso tissue growth zzso We show here that zzso is expressed in the developing mouse zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is expressed in regions of zzso origin, including the zzso cone and the zzso giant zzso In the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the smooth muscle vessel walls of the zzso circulatory zzso Most notably, expression is found in developing zzso zzso including the zzso ribs, and zzso In addition, regions of the zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso cartilage, also express zzso Thus, zzso transcript is found in zzso cells of both zzso and zzso origin during their differentiation into zzso The zzso and spatial regulation of zzso expression and the zzso features of its zzso protein suggest that zzso may be important for the normal growth, zzso or zzso of the zzso skeleton of the zzso
