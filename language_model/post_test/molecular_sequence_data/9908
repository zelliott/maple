Gene expression in zzso zzso is largely regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso leader addition and 3' zzso of zzso We examined these events in zzso by mapping the zzso sites of the transcripts from two different, but closely linked zzso genes zzso zzso zzso The coding regions of the zzso 1 zzso upstream gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso downstream gene zzso produce zzso 2 and 3 zzso zzso zzso Both genes were zzso in cells that were zzso with this zzso unit zzso or zzso zzso zzso taking advantage of the zzso as a zzso marker for zzso The transcripts from both genes were spliced zzso at both ends, irrespective of their zzso or zzso expression in both zzso zzso zzso extension of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso protection of the 3' zzso initially identified the major zzso sites, corresponding to the zzso sequence at zzso zzso and + zzso 900 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and + zzso 600 zzso of zzso These zzso sites, consistent with the size of the major zzso are among those mapped precisely by sequencing zzso amplified zzso and 3' zzso The additional sites mapped by the latter are minor alternatives, especially abundant for transcripts of the downstream zzso All these minor zzso sites are closer than the major zzso sites to the coding region, indicating that the most distant zzso sites are zzso zzso This preference creates a zzso zzso zzso with zzso tracts in the zzso region consistent with the model zzso zzso leader addition with zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of these events suggests that the zzso zzso zzso unit is suitable for constructing zzso zzso expression zzso
