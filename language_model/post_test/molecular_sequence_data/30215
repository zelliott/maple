The processing of the primary transcript of the zzso T cell zzso c beta region can result in two distinct forms of zzso The optional zzso C beta O, is appended at the zzso end of the constant region and to date has been observed at low zzso in zzso clones from zzso populations of T zzso Because individual cell lines were not analyzed in those studies, it was not known whether small numbers of T zzso use the C beta O zzso exclusively or instead most zzso use the C beta O zzso but at low zzso We have determined that our zzso zzso zzso 4, produces both C beta zzso and C beta zzso functional zzso zzso To determine the C beta O usage in this zzso zzso we coupled zzso synthesis with the zzso chain reaction using zzso corresponding to sequences at the V beta 14 region and sequences corresponding to C beta O or C beta zzso The data indicate that zzso 4 zzso clone is able to use either zzso site but uses the C beta O zzso at a frequency of approximately zzso
