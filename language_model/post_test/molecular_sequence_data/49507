zzso which is commonly associated with zzso affects zzso of the zzso zzso has a zzso zzso that may be due to either over production and/or reduced zzso zzso of zzso In order to identify the mechanisms underlying reduced zzso of zzso we undertook zzso cloning studies of familial juvenile zzso zzso zzso which is an zzso dominant disorder characterized by zzso a low fractional zzso zzso of zzso and chronic zzso failure that is associated with zzso zzso The zzso locus has been previously localized to a 22 zzso zzso flanked zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso on zzso zzso This zzso contains over 120 genes and we selected 13 zzso expressed sequences to search for zzso in 5 unrelated zzso families that contained 21 affected and 24 unaffected zzso This revealed 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that altered evolutionary zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso which is an 85 zzso zzso has roles in zzso stone formation, the zzso of immune responses, and zzso zzso The results of our studies, which have identified the gene causing zzso now indicate a further, novel role for zzso in zzso zzso
