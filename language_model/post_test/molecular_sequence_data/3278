zzso zzso zzso is the first structural and functional zzso zzso of human zzso a zzso zzso zzso required for zzso splitting in early zzso zzso shares zzso overall zzso identity with its human counterpart and zzso identity within the zzso zzso Both proteins can be subdivided in an zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressed zzso and zzso deletion zzso revealed that zzso activity requires the presence of the zzso zzso and that zzso occurs at the zzso zzso analyses with zzso zzso and expression of a zzso fusion protein in zzso showed that zzso is a permanent zzso resident and suggested that it is a component of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso frequently exhibit zzso zzso centers zzso This zzso did not require zzso activity because it was also observed in cells expressing inactive zzso However, it was shown to be caused by zzso of the zzso domain since it also occurred in zzso expressing only the zzso or a zzso zzso construct but not in those zzso expressing only the zzso domain or a zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the formation of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso proteins revealed two independent zzso targeting zzso of zzso one within the zzso or zzso zzso domain and one in the zzso zzso
