The zzso fusion protein expression system from zzso was modified so that zzso zzso proteins can be easily obtained in large quantities for functional zzso zzso that are prone to form the inclusion bodies can be functionally expressed as zzso fusion proteins in zzso zzso After zzso the zzso proteins can be easily zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso protein can be obtained functionally via a mild zzso zzso to cleave off the zzso zzso A deletion construct of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso protein was used as an example to illustrate how this protein expression system zzso
