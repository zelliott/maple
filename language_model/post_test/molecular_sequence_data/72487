The establishment and mapping of zzso DNA sequences greatly complement the ongoing efforts to map and sequence all human zzso To facilitate our studies of human zzso 7, we have generated and analyzed 2006 zzso tags zzso derived from a collection of direct selection zzso libraries that are highly enriched for human zzso 7 gene zzso zzso searches indicate that approximately two-thirds of the zzso are not represented by sequences in the public databases, including those in zzso In addition, a large fraction zzso of the zzso do not have redundant or overlapping sequences within our zzso Human zzso zzso sites zzso have been developed from 190 of the zzso zzso 180 zzso of these zzso map to zzso 7, demonstrating the zzso of zzso enrichment in constructing the direct selection zzso zzso Thus far, 140 of these zzso zzso have been assigned unequivocally to zzso zzso that are distributed across the zzso Together, these studies provide zzso 2000 zzso highly enriched for zzso 7 gene zzso 180 new zzso 7 zzso corresponding to zzso and a definitive demonstration of the ability to enrich for zzso zzso by direct zzso Furthermore, the libraries, sequence data, and mapping information will contribute to the construction of a zzso 7 transcript zzso
