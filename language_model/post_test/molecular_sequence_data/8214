zzso zzso is a zzso derived from protein zzso that can associate with the zzso zzso It was shown previously to be recognized by an zzso zzso T zzso zzso clone derived from the blood of melanoma patient zzso We derived two other zzso zzso clones from different blood samples of the same patient and compared the fine specificity of recognition of the three zzso by testing them on zzso zzso peptides incorporating different zzso acid zzso The zzso recognized by the zzso proved to be zzso While modifications of zzso at positions 5, 6, or 7 in the zzso zzso affected recognition by the three zzso each of the modifications of zzso at positions 1, 4, or 8 affected recognition by one zzso zzso The sequences of both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell zzso zzso of the three zzso were completely zzso The results indicate a long-lasting diversity in terms of fine specificity and of T cell zzso zzso structure in the repertoire of zzso zzso derived from the blood of a melanoma patient and directed against a defined tumor zzso
