The zzso marine zzso zzso zzso produces several zzso compounds that act against a range of common zzso organisms, including bacteria, zzso zzso zzso larvae and zzso zzso The zzso regulator zzso has previously been shown to regulate expression of zzso compounds, type IV zzso and zzso formation zzso which all appear at the onset of stationary zzso In this study a comparison of survival under zzso or stress between the zzso zzso zzso strain and a zzso zzso zzso does not suggest a role for zzso in regulating zzso and zzso zzso such as those that may be required in stationary zzso Both zzso zzso PAGE zzso and zzso zzso arbitrarily primed zzso studies were used to discover members of the zzso zzso zzso identified 11 proteins that were zzso expressed by zzso zzso sequence data were obtained for six of these proteins and identified using the draft zzso zzso zzso as being involved in protein zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso as well as hypothetical zzso The zzso analysis identified three genes significantly zzso by zzso including a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a hypothetical zzso Under zzso the zzso showed greater survival than zzso indicating the importance of zzso under these zzso zzso from these studies show that zzso controls the expression of genes zzso proteins involved in iron acquisition and zzso zzso acid metabolism and zzso zzso in addition to a number of proteins with as yet unknown zzso
