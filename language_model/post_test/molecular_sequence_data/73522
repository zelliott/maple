A method is described to simultaneously amplify and sequence DNA using a new class of zzso containing zzso During the zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are incorporated into the product zzso The zzso linkages are resistant to zzso and thus the positions of the zzso can be revealed by zzso zzso thereby generating a set of fragments that defines the DNA zzso The zzso method offers an alternative to current zzso sequencing zzso zzso primer extension with zzso chain zzso is avoided, with the consequence that the sequencing fragments are derived directly from the original zzso zzso zzso sequencing is demonstrated with the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso automatic zzso producing data that is comparable with cycle zzso
