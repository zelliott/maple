zzso genes have evolved in primates to generate a diverse family of receptors with unique structures that enable them to recognize zzso I molecules with locus and zzso Their zzso expression creates a repertoire of zzso cells that surveys the expression of almost every zzso zzso zzso thus zzso the spread of pathogens and tumors that zzso innate and zzso defense by selectively zzso certain zzso class I zzso The genes zzso zzso that recognize classical zzso molecules have diversified rapidly in human and zzso this contrasts with conservation of zzso and zzso receptors for zzso zzso zzso As a result of the variable zzso content in the zzso and the zzso of the zzso system, dissimilar numbers and qualities of zzso pairs function in different zzso This diversity likely contributes zzso to the function of zzso cells and zzso by modulating innate and zzso immune responses to specific zzso
