A single transcript in its zzso and spliced forms directs the synthesis of all zzso zzso Although nuclear export of zzso cellular transcripts is restricted in zzso cells, zzso has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome this restriction for viral zzso Previously, zzso was identified as a cellular zzso for zzso export of zzso zzso zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso activity zzso the zzso DEAD box zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is a zzso shuttling zzso which binds zzso and zzso to nuclear membrane zzso zzso of zzso using either zzso zzso or zzso zzso suppressed zzso in the export of incompletely spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso is the human zzso zzso which functions in the zzso zzso export zzso zzso to the zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso
