The zzso sequence of the zzso coli zzso zzso which is located in the upstream region of the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso gene encodes a very zzso protein with 463 zzso acid zzso (Mr zzso A zzso deletion zzso under conditions for the induction of nitrate zzso was unable to perform nitrate zzso Loss of transport activity was recovered by transforming the zzso with a zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso gene encodes a zzso protein participating in nitrate zzso In the zzso promoter region, we defined a unique sequence that we designate as a zzso zzso functioning as a putative zzso site, in addition to the consensus sequence of the zzso
