zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso site of a zzso zzso revealed a gene zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso activity of the zzso zzso wild type by a factor of approximately zzso The growth rates of the wild type and the zzso were not affected by added zzso A second open reading frame zzso zzso is located downstream from zzso Both zzso and zzso probably are part of a single zzso The translation product of zzso was zzso zzso of identity, zzso to that of zzso of zzso zzso A zzso in zzso resulted in an extended lag phase and lower cell zzso Similar zzso observations were made for the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may have a polar effect on zzso This was confirmed by zzso gene replacement in zzso The zzso zzso did not affect the zzso ability of the zzso but resulted in decreased zzso In zzso our data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso and that zzso is required for optimal growth of zzso zzso zzso
