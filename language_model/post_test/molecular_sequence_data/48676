The full-length zzso sequence of the zzso gene was cloned via zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and was designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene is zzso zzso long and encodes a zzso acid zzso with a zzso domain zzso and is a typical zzso zzso zzso analysis in onion zzso cells showed that zzso is localized in the plasma zzso The expression of zzso gene was analyzed in melon leaf infected with powdery zzso using a quantitative zzso and it was found that zzso was mainly expressed in melon leaves in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso may play a crucial role in the zzso of powdery zzso
