The genetic element zzso exists in nature as a single DNA segment integrated into the zzso of zzso zzso Upon mating with zzso zzso a closely related species, zzso zzso precise zzso from its zzso site and is transferred into the recipient where it zzso zzso Previous work has shown that integration and zzso involve zzso zzso between a zzso site, zzso and a virtually identical zzso zzso on zzso We demonstrate here by means of gene replacement that a zzso sequence that zzso part of the zzso site of zzso zzso is both biologically functional and essential for cell zzso The requirement for this zzso gene has been used to stabilize the inheritance of a zzso unstable zzso in cells lacking a zzso zzso zzso The evolution of an essential DNA locus as an attachment site for a zzso zzso genetic element represents a novel mechanism of biological zzso
