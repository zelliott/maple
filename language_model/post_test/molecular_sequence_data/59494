The zzso effect of zzso zzso on the zzso membrane immobilized on the porous cellulose zzso filter was investigated by zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso having zzso acid instead of the long zzso chain of the zzso portion zzso was incorporated into the model zzso An zzso examination of the membrane showed that zzso zzso an zzso rotation in the wide range of temperature zzso degrees zzso By monitoring the overall splitting zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the model zzso were found to show decreased fluidity in accordance with the zzso zzso The phase transition temperature zzso of zzso zzso model zzso could be estimated by the measurement of zzso and zzso The effects of zzso were found to be more significant in broadening the phase transition rather than in zzso the zzso of zzso model zzso
