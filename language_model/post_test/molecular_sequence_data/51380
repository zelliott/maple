zzso zzso has been applied to a zzso zzso pH zzso solution of toxin III zzso zzso zzso from zzso of the scorpion zzso zzso zzso The resonance assignment strategy began by applying a generalized zzso directed method for rapid identification and resonance assignments of secondary zzso The remaining zzso were assigned by the sequential zzso Major structural features include a zzso of 2 1/2 turns zzso zzso which is linked by two zzso bridges to the central strand of a zzso zzso zzso Turns were identified at zzso zzso zzso and also at zzso zzso Numerous zzso have been observed between zzso zzso which suggest the presence of a zzso zzso these include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso rings lie zzso to one zzso No crystal structure has been solved for this zzso III zzso Comparisons are made with other members of the scorpion toxin zzso
