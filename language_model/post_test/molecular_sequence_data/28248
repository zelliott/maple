The rat zzso 1 gene gives rise to two zzso zzso rat zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso via an alternative zzso zzso The gene is comprised of 11 zzso zzso 1 through 5 and zzso 8 and 9 are common to all zzso expressed from this zzso zzso 6 and 11 are used in zzso as well as smooth muscle whereas zzso 7 and 10 are used exclusively in skeletal zzso In the present studies we have focused on the mutually exclusive internal alternative zzso choice involving zzso 6 zzso zzso and zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso To study the mechanism and regulation of alternative zzso site selection we have characterized the branch points used in processing of the zzso zzso in zzso using nuclear extracts obtained from zzso zzso zzso of zzso 5 to zzso 6 zzso zzso involves the use of three branch points located 25, 29, and 36 zzso upstream of the 3' zzso site of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 6 zzso zzso or zzso 7 zzso muscle zzso to zzso 8 involves the use of the same branch point located 24 zzso upstream of this shared 3' zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso 5 to zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso involves the use of three branch sites located zzso 147 and 153 zzso upstream of the 3' zzso site of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso content of the region between these unusual branch points and the 3' zzso site of zzso 7 was found to be greater than zzso These studies raise the possibility that the use of branch points located a long distance from a 3' zzso site may be an essential feature of some alternatively spliced zzso The possible significance of these unusual branch points as well as a role for the zzso stretch in zzso 6 in zzso site selection are zzso
