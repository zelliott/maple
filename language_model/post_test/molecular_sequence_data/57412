A set of 8 peptides from the zzso region zzso zzso of zzso was prepared by zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in two zzso different zzso acid zzso in positions 73, 74 and zzso Free peptides and their zzso with bovine serum zzso were tested for zzso in zzso The correlation between the zzso chain's length and its zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed a positive reaction with all individual zzso and pools of zzso from zzso chronic zzso Both zzso of the zzso zzso reacted with zzso of zzso pools but only with zzso of individual zzso Smaller peptides from the same zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso did not bind to any zzso positive zzso All zzso peptides reacted strongly with rabbit zzso raised to the zzso of zzso zzso with bovine zzso These findings suggest that zzso contains multiple highly zzso zzso associated with the single zzso site between 69 and 80 zzso acid zzso
