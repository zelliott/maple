zzso zzso is a zzso hydrocarbon used as a zzso in industrial settings and in zzso zzso Exposure to zzso has been linked to increased risk for zzso heart zzso in both human and animal zzso Previous studies showed zzso exposure reduced the expression and function of the zzso calcium zzso zzso which is important for regulating calcium flux in zzso and maintaining zzso cardiac zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso reduced zzso expression by altering the zzso status of its zzso promoter zzso Low doses of zzso exposure zzso induced DNA zzso zzso in the zzso promoter region in cardiac zzso cells and rat embryonic cardiac zzso zzso exposure induced DNA zzso in a region of the zzso promoter which is the target for zzso binding site essential for regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data confirmed that zzso exposure reduced the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter region adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso exposure reduced the concentration of zzso in exposed cells and zzso These cumulative data indicate that zzso mechanisms, including DNA zzso may be important in zzso the zzso effects of zzso in embryonic zzso
