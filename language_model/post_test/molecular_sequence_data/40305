zzso are highly regulated zzso with essential functions in zzso zzso sugar zzso and plant zzso Here we present the zzso zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in complex with a protein inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor of zzso from zzso The structure identifies a small zzso acid motif in zzso that directly targets the zzso active zzso The activity of zzso and its interaction with zzso are strictly zzso with a maximum at about pH zzso At this zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that zzso tightly binds its target with zzso zzso zzso competes with zzso zzso for the same binding site, suggesting that both the zzso zzso concentration and the pH changes regulate association of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso in the complex interface was previously identified as an important quantitative trait locus affecting fruit quality, which implicates the zzso complex as a main regulator of carbon zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso structure with the complex between the structurally zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso indicates a common targeting mechanism in zzso and zzso However, zzso and zzso use distinct surface areas to selectively inhibit very different zzso zzso
