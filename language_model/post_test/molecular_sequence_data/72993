A three-dimensional model of zzso a zzso and zzso protein from the fruits of zzso zzso was built from the X-ray coordinates of zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The three zzso sites present in zzso were found in zzso but are devoid of zzso activity as shown by zzso experiments performed with zzso Some regions well exposed on the surface of the three-dimensional model of zzso could act as zzso responsible for the zzso properties of this zzso
