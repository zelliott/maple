zzso zzso is a unique zzso zzso possessing both protein zzso and zzso I zzso for zzso of small zzso In this study, we demonstrated unique zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso including zzso specificity and zzso to known zzso zzso Some of important zzso of the zzso beta zzso implicated in the specificity for zzso zzso and zzso donors are zzso in zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso in zzso coli, showed activity to transfer zzso to both human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso only zzso zzso All the representative zzso Ras and zzso small zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso zzso by zzso This indicates that the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso is remarkably broader than that of its zzso zzso In contrast to zzso which zzso but not zzso solely zzso zzso also showed significant zzso activity against Ras zzso zzso zzso showed remarkable resistance to zzso known to inhibit zzso zzso Together with our previous observation that this zzso does not appear to depend on zzso for a majority of Ras and zzso these data indicate that biological and zzso advantages leading to the zzso selection of this zzso modification must exist uniquely in this zzso zzso Finally, remarkable zzso differences in binding to zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso highlight this zzso as an attractive target for the development of new zzso against zzso
