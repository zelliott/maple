zzso zzso are known for their irregular body zzso Most importantly, the number of zzso zzso zzso plates zzso does not match the number of zzso structures zzso zzso zzso theories exist to explain the origin of this so-called zzso We have studied the zzso of a representative zzso zzso zzso and have analyzed the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and wingless zzso We show that zzso segments can be distinguished from zzso zzso They differ not only in number and zzso history, but also in gene expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso but at different zzso locations, whereas wingless is expressed only in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso the patterns are similar to what has been described from zzso and other zzso consistent with a zzso role of these genes in establishing zzso zzso On the zzso side, however, the gene expression patterns are different and inconsistent with a role in boundary formation between zzso but they suggest that these genes might function to establish the zzso zzso Our data suggest a profound and rather complete decoupling of zzso and zzso zzso leading to the zzso discrepancies in the number of zzso zzso Based on gene zzso we propose a model that may resolve the zzso controversial issue of the correlation between zzso zzso and zzso leg pairs in zzso zzso zzso zzso and is suggestive also for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
