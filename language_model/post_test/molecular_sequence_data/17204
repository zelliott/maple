The G zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso involved in water zzso in the zzso collecting zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso gene cause zzso diabetes zzso Many of the zzso zzso are retained zzso by the quality control system of the early zzso zzso It was previously thought that quality control system is restricted to the zzso zzso zzso Here, we have examined the retention mechanisms of eight zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are trapped exclusively in the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reach the zzso intermediate compartment zzso and are zzso to the zzso The ability of the zzso receptors to reach the zzso is independent of their expression zzso Instead, it is determined by their folding zzso zzso receptors in the zzso may be sorted into retrograde transport zzso by an interaction of an zzso motif in the third zzso loop with the zzso complex zzso Our data show that zzso zzso of a particular membrane protein may be retained in different compartments of the early zzso zzso and that the folding states of the proteins determine their retention zzso
