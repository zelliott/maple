zzso are units of zzso genetic inheritance found in all zzso of zzso They replicate autonomously and undergo stable propagation in their zzso Despite their small size, zzso replication and gene expression constitute a zzso burden that compromises their stable maintenance in host zzso This pressure has driven the evolution of strategies to increase zzso zzso process accelerated by the ability of plasmids to transfer zzso between cells and to exchange genetic material with their host and other resident zzso zzso These abilities drive the zzso and diversity of plasmids and their host zzso Indeed, survival functions found in plasmids have zzso zzso that have an essential role in cellular responses to zzso An analysis of these functions in the zzso zzso zzso and of their intricate zzso reveals remarkable overall similarities with other zzso and zzso strategies found within and beyond the zzso zzso
