A zzso expression system has been developed which allows zzso effects on zzso degradation rates to be zzso This system uses stable, zzso zzso that provide consistent levels of zzso expression without the position effects common to zzso zzso zzso zzso putative instability elements may be zzso into the zzso untranslated region zzso the coding region, or the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The effects of these sequences on zzso stability may then be determined by zzso time course analyses of the fusion zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human cell zzso To demonstrate the utility of the zzso system we fused an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso reporter and introduced the zzso into the human zzso cell line, zzso The fusion zzso was zzso at a rate zzso to zzso greater than that of zzso alone, at a rate similar to that reported for zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal rat zzso Similar to a number of other relatively unstable zzso the rate of fusion zzso degradation was greatly decreased by treatment with zzso
