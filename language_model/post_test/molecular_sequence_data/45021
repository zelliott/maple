We investigated gene expression patterns and functional zzso regarding the clusters of human dental pulp stem cells zzso and human zzso stem cells zzso possess a zzso zzso little is known about the precise zzso clues by which these cells activate their zzso ability or functionality to eventually form zzso and bone, zzso We first verified the expressions of the alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso by real-time zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and consequently discovered the high expressions of these zzso Total zzso was also followed by zzso with a human zzso system consisting of zzso zzso zzso of gene expression patterns indicated several genes which zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso growth factors, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of differences in gene expression levels revealed cell zzso cell communication, or cell zzso In the future, information on the gene expression patterns of zzso and zzso might be useful in determining the detailed functional roles of the relevant genes and zzso to stem cell therapies, and these cells could also be used as zzso cell sources for gene technology and tissue engineering zzso
