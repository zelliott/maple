Two zzso zzso of zzso Y zzso were zzso by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso acid, respectively, to the free zzso group of the side chain protected zzso zzso zzso Crude peptides obtained by zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and their zzso were confirmed by zzso acid and mass spectral zzso As with zzso both zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding and zzso zzso activity of rat cardiac zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso comparable to that of zzso whereas zzso was slightly less zzso In the in zzso experiments, however, both the zzso zzso exhibited responses comparable to zzso in increasing zzso blood pressure and decreasing heart rate in zzso zzso The responses of the zzso zzso were longer lasting than those of zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso could label the zzso receptors in rat cardiac zzso zzso This labeling was specific since intact zzso inhibited the zzso These studies show that zzso zzso exhibit biological zzso comparable to intact zzso and can therefore be used to further probe the zzso zzso
