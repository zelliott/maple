zzso is a zzso zzso required for zzso transport of iron from zzso Sex linked zzso zzso mice have a zzso in the release of iron from zzso zzso into the circulation due to an zzso deletion in the zzso gene zzso 

We have demonstrated that zzso is primarily zzso to a zzso compartment in both zzso zzso and in cultured zzso In normal zzso zzso zzso was also present on the zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso was present only in the zzso zzso In contrast, the iron zzso zzso zzso to the zzso membrane in both control and zzso zzso 

We suggest that zzso of zzso likely contributes to the functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso
