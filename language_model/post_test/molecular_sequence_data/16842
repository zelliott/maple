In the green zzso zzso zzso DNA is zzso transmitted to the zzso We previously hypothesized that the underlying molecular mechanism involves specific zzso of maternal zzso DNA before zzso protecting against zzso To obtain direct evidence for this, we focused on a DNA zzso zzso which was previously shown to be localized in zzso The full-length zzso protein with a molecular mass of 150 zzso was expressed in insect cells, and its zzso activity was zzso In zzso zzso using synthetic DNA indicated zzso of all zzso zzso with no clear selectivity in terms of the neighboring zzso zzso transgenic paternal cells zzso expressing zzso were constructed and direct zzso mapping zzso of their DNA showed a clear zzso zzso of zzso zzso When transgenic paternal cells were crossed with zzso maternal cells, the frequency of zzso and paternal offspring of zzso increased up to zzso while between zzso strains it was approximately zzso The results indicate that zzso is a novel type of DNA zzso with a zzso zzso zzso activity, and that zzso DNA zzso by zzso is one of factors influencing maternal inheritance of zzso zzso
