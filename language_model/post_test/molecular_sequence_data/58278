zzso zzso peptides derived from the zzso domain of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso inhibit zzso entry into zzso and zzso cells by two distinct zzso competitive zzso of zzso binding to zzso colon cells and zzso zzso of zzso fusion with zzso zzso In the present study, we have characterized the cellular binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso which possesses eight zzso consensus motifs zzso zzso zzso on a neutral zzso core zzso These binding sites are zzso that share a common structural zzso zzso a terminal zzso zzso with a free zzso group in position zzso zzso on zzso colon zzso zzso and its zzso derivatives zzso and zzso on zzso human zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso for zzso zzso on zzso cells and thus acts as a competitive inhibitor of virus binding to these zzso cells, in full agreement with previously published zzso zzso In contrast, zzso does not bind to the zzso zzso in agreement with the data showing that the zzso zzso zzso infection of zzso cells by acting at a zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso expressed by zzso zzso suggests a role for these zzso in the fusion process between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane of zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso can theoretically bind to several of these zzso we zzso that the resulting zzso of membrane components may affect the fluidity of the plasma membrane and/or membrane zzso altering the zzso fusion zzso
