zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso channels play a fundamental role in the signaling pathways regulating mouse anterior zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the cloning and functional characterization of the components of mouse zzso BK zzso zzso cloning and zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso zzso zzso revealed robust expression of zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso containing the mouse zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso at zzso site zzso zzso and functional analysis, using the zzso zzso zzso revealed that native zzso BK channels are not functionally coupled to zzso in zzso zzso expression of the zzso containing zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in BK channels with calcium sensitivity, single-channel zzso and zzso by protein zzso A identical to that of native mouse zzso BK zzso This report represents the first zzso zzso channel to be characterized at the molecular level and demonstrates that mouse zzso BK channels are composed of zzso expressing the mouse zzso zzso
