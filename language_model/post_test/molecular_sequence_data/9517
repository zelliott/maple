zzso I and II are zzso complexes that are important for the zzso of zzso They are essential for zzso and important for regulating gene expression during zzso Here, we investigated the zzso and translation of the mouse zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso We identified three zzso zzso within the first zzso a zzso zzso zzso at the beginning of zzso 16 and alternative zzso In total, zzso is potentially capable of generating 12 unique zzso transcripts and six unique zzso We confirm that zzso can generate three different zzso all zzso by zzso 1, one of which is translated from an alternative reading zzso This alternative reading frame zzso zzso appears to be a novel outcome of zzso If this is zzso to other zzso it would account for a previously unappreciated level of zzso protein zzso
