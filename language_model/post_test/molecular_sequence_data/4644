A zzso zzso termed zzso which localized in the dense plaques and dense bodies of smooth muscle cells, was found in a zzso alkaline extract of chicken gizzard smooth zzso An zzso against zzso was used to screen a chicken gizzard zzso library, and the zzso sequence of the partial zzso zzso this protein was zzso zzso of predicted zzso acid sequences revealed that the protein had significant zzso with human zzso and chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but despite the high zzso zzso was zzso distinguishable from zzso zzso analysis showed that an zzso zzso reacted exclusively with the zzso band of smooth, zzso and cardiac muscle zzso By indirect zzso the zzso zzso against zzso intensely stained the dense plaques of the isolated smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso particles representing zzso were found abundantly on the dense plaques and less abundantly on the dense zzso Its zzso acid zzso molecular size, zzso zzso and zzso in smooth muscle thus indicated that zzso is a new component of the dense plaques and dense bodies of smooth muscle zzso
