During the development of zzso kidney stones, zzso form and deposit in the zzso and become surrounded by zzso zzso We have proposed that in response to crystal exposure zzso zzso cells produce zzso which attract the zzso to the sites of crystal zzso We investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein by zzso rat zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso a calcium zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso 

zzso cultures of zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso or zzso at a concentration of 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They were exposed for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h for isolation of zzso and 24 h for zzso to determine the zzso of protein into the culture zzso Since cells are known to produce free zzso on exposure to zzso zzso we also investigated the effect of free radical scavenger zzso on the crystal induced expression of zzso zzso and zzso 

Exposure of zzso cells to the zzso resulted in increased expression of zzso zzso and production of the zzso zzso zzso were most provocative while zzso the zzso Treatment with zzso had a negative effect on the increased expression of both zzso zzso and zzso which indicates the involvement of free zzso in zzso of zzso zzso 

Exposure to both zzso and calcium zzso zzso stimulates increased production of zzso Free zzso appear to be involved in this zzso zzso indicate that zzso which is often associated with localized zzso may be one of the zzso zzso associated with the deposition of various urinary zzso in the zzso during kidney stone zzso Because of the small number of experiments performed here, results must be confirmed by more extensive studies with larger sample zzso
