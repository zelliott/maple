Positive selection by zzso is believed to play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso Recently, it has been described that zzso results in the loss of an already established zzso cell zzso To zzso whether the zzso influences the zzso zzso repertoire, we have analyzed the consequences of zzso in the recently established zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso mice are characterized by a severe block of B-2 development and predominance of zzso cells, which exhibit a pronounced zzso zzso presumably due to positive selection by zzso In this study, we show that, in striking contrast to zzso normal mice, zzso mice exhibit unchanged zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso repertoire of these zzso cells, however, was severely zzso in that the previously described zzso zzso H chains were no longer zzso The repertoire changes were partial since zzso zzso cells were present in similar numbers before and after zzso Thus, zzso zzso appear to act as zzso zzso for major zzso of zzso B zzso The loss of zzso cells in the absence of such factors is compensated by repertoire changes among zzso cells in B cell zzso zzso but not normal zzso
