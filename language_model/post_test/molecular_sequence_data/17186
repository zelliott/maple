To investigate the zzso mechanisms of zzso cluster assembly in zzso we selected zzso zzso zzso with a decreased content of zzso I zzso containing three zzso zzso One identified zzso zzso OF zzso zzso zzso belongs to a previously unknown gene family with four defined groups zzso to zzso only found in nuclear zzso of vascular zzso All zzso contain two related motifs of approximately 100 zzso acid zzso that could potentially provide zzso for zzso zzso zzso is essentially required for zzso growth, and levels of zzso core zzso are below the limit of detection in the zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to accumulate significant amounts of the outer antenna zzso of zzso and zzso and to form zzso zzso In particular, zzso is essentially required for stable zzso of other zzso and zzso zzso cluster complexes within the zzso whereas zzso zzso complexes appear to be zzso In zzso labeling experiments and analyses of zzso association suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso transcripts zzso and zzso is specifically arrested in the zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso is involved in the stable assembly of several zzso zzso complexes of zzso and interferes with zzso events probably in association with zzso zzso
