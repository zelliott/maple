A zzso zzso factor has been zzso from the zzso of rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso was a basic protein with zzso site and gave a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 16 zzso on zzso under reducing zzso The zzso was treated with zzso and the resulting peptides were isolated by zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the peptides were almost identical with the sequence of zzso zzso type III domain of human collagen type zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso consists mainly of zzso zzso type III domain and the adjacent zzso site of rat collagen type zzso The zzso zzso of collagen type XIV dose zzso attracted rat zzso and zzso increased the zzso free zzso concentration of zzso The results suggest that the novel zzso plays a role in zzso recruitment in rat zzso
