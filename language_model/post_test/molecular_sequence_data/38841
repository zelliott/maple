Members of the zzso family are zzso zzso zzso protein receptors involved in zzso zzso and/or fusion within the zzso and zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso system, we have identified a novel member of the zzso family, zzso 18, that binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso 18 is principally located in the zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso of zzso zzso 18 and a zzso lacking the zzso 81 zzso acid zzso on protein transport and zzso in the early zzso zzso Both expressed proteins localized to the zzso zzso and the expressed zzso 18 caused remarkable zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although expression of the zzso 18 lacking the zzso region produced less effect on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso intermediate compartment and zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso 18 zzso inhibited protein export from the zzso zzso These results taken together suggest that zzso 18 functions in transport between the zzso zzso and zzso
