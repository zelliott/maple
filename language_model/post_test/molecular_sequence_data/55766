zzso zzso represent promising tools for gene zzso in live zzso Triple zzso zzso which bind to zzso DNA, are of special interest since they are targeted to the gene itself rather than to its zzso product, as in the zzso zzso Triple zzso zzso can be coupled to zzso agents and used to introduce modifications in the DNA target in a highly zzso zzso We have recently designed zzso zzso which, upon binding to zzso DNA sequences via triple zzso formation, may be zzso in zzso to both strands of the DNA following zzso zzso A zzso zzso was targeted to the promoter of the alpha zzso of the zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso The triple zzso site zzso the binding site for the zzso factor zzso B, which activates zzso from the zzso alpha zzso After zzso zzso the zzso zzso becomes zzso to the target site and zzso zzso of reporter plasmids zzso in live zzso zzso is observed when zzso zzso occurs both in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso (after zzso We directly demonstrate that this zzso effect is due to triple zzso formation at the target site, since a zzso of the promoter, to which zzso binding was zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso after zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso zzso upstream of the promoter has no effect on zzso
