zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso pathogens that cause human and canine zzso zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that these pathogens express unique proteins in response to their growth in zzso and tick host cells and that this differential expression is similar in closely related zzso zzso zzso of nine zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso isolate demonstrated that protein expression was host zzso The zzso expressed proteins included those from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins expressed in infected zzso were primarily the products of the zzso 19 and 20 genes or their zzso In cultured tick cells, zzso zzso expressed only the zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 14 protein which is the only protein expressed by zzso zzso zzso in cultured tick zzso The expressed zzso proteins were zzso modified to generate multiple molecular zzso zzso zzso gene expression from the zzso locus was similar in tick cell lines derived from both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of proteins within the zzso locus may therefore be vital for adaptation of zzso species to their dual host life zzso
