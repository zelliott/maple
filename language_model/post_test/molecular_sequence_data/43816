We report the DNA sequence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This contains a putative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso rod and associated proteins zzso and zzso the L and P ring proteins zzso a possible zzso export protein zzso and two proteins of unknown function, zzso and zzso Several of these genes have overlapping stop and start zzso Three zzso zzso zzso map to this zzso zzso to the first zzso zzso the rod protein zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso A zzso zzso introduced into the final gene in this zzso zzso also resulted in a zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso is zzso and that at least zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso assembly in zzso zzso The bulk of this zzso is zzso in the same order in zzso zzso
