As present antibiotics therapy becomes increasingly zzso new technologies are required to identify and develop novel classes of zzso zzso An attractive alternative to the classical zzso approach is the use of zzso reporter zzso for zzso zzso The wide usage of these zzso is, however, limited by the small number of specifically responding promoters that are known at zzso This work describes a novel approach for identifying genetic regulators that are suitable for the design of zzso zzso The basis for the proposed strategy is a large set of zzso expression profiles zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso applied to the expression data pinpoint the relevant zzso sites in zzso zzso Using this technique, we constructed a zzso reporter zzso that is based on a novel zzso zzso In a zzso experiment, this zzso was shown to enable screening for new zzso zzso of bacterial zzso
