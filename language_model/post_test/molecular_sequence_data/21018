The primary objectives of this phase zzso study were to evaluate the safety and zzso of combination therapy consisting of concurrent zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso vaccination in patients with zzso zzso breast zzso 

Twenty-two patients with stage IV zzso breast cancer receiving zzso therapy were vaccinated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was graded according to National Cancer Institute criteria, and zzso specific zzso immunity was assessed by zzso gamma zzso zzso spot zzso Data on zzso and overall survival were zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso were well zzso with zzso of patients experiencing an zzso decline in left zzso ejection fraction below the normal range during combination zzso Although many patients had pre-existing immunity specific for zzso and other breast cancer zzso while treated with zzso alone, that immunity could be significantly zzso and maintained with zzso zzso spreading within zzso and to additional zzso proteins was zzso by zzso and the magnitude of the zzso response generated was significantly zzso correlated with serum transforming growth factor beta zzso At a median follow-up of 36 months from the first zzso the median overall survival in the study population has not been zzso 

Combination therapy with zzso and a zzso vaccine is associated with minimal toxicity and results in zzso zzso zzso immune responses in treated zzso
