The zzso acid degradation zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso proceeds via a novel zzso zzso In this study, we cloned and zzso a zzso DNA locus of strain zzso that encompasses the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso designated zzso is organized tightly and in the same zzso The zzso and zzso gene products were found to be novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso carries out the zzso of zzso to zzso while the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the latter compound to zzso The zzso and zzso proteins were zzso in zzso coli and zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso protein was found to be restricted to zzso In zzso coli, this zzso zzso zzso with a specific activity of 8 zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed the essential role of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso activity is also dependent on the presence of zzso but is inhibited by other metal zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein was zzso as a zzso zzso and its specific activity towards zzso was 195 zzso of zzso Further processing of zzso to zzso acid and zzso zzso A was predicted to proceed via the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of these proteins are highly zzso to those of the corresponding proteins involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso gene is predicted to have a regulatory function of the zzso family zzso The function of the product of the small open reading frame, zzso like the zzso sequences in the zzso or zzso zzso pathway, remains zzso
