zzso infants in the Northern zzso of Australia experience zzso zzso media from an early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colonization of the zzso initially occurs within weeks of birth, persists throughout infancy and most of childhood, and contributes to zzso zzso We established previously that the high carriage rates of zzso in these infants result from concurrent and successive colonization with multiple zzso with sequential elimination of dominant zzso We have now zzso zzso 4, 5, and 6 of the zzso zzso zzso gene and characterized several strains with prolonged carriage zzso Furthermore, despite a wide diversity of zzso gene zzso we have four examples of zzso gene identity for strains with different genetic backgrounds as characterized by zzso zzso and randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso which leads us to suggest that the zzso gene has been transferred between zzso We also discuss the possibility that the paradoxical observation of zzso and prolonged carriage of zzso strains is related to immune suppression or tolerance in the zzso
