The zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso B strain zzso and zzso A strain zzso were systematically searched for open reading frames zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso were identified, six of which were present in both zzso whereas two were specific for zzso Among the identified zzso was the gene zzso the known zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the other identified zzso were zzso to known zzso and found to contain an zzso signal sequence and a zzso domain that could constitute a zzso in the outer zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso (for zzso zzso and penetration zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso adherence zzso zzso of zzso zzso were cloned from zzso B strain zzso and expressed in zzso zzso Western blots revealed that all zzso of patients zzso and healthy carriers zzso tested contained zzso against at least one of the zzso zzso These results indicate that both genes are widely distributed among zzso zzso zzso and expressed during colonization and zzso
