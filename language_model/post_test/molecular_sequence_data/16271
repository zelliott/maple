During development of the cellular slime mold zzso zzso cells migrate in response to zzso to form zzso which give rise to zzso bodies consisting of two major cell zzso spores and stalk zzso zzso is achieved by the expression of two types of zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding sites are expressed at the initial stage of zzso At the zzso stage, cells acquire zzso binding sites, which are zzso by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso associated with cell surface zzso which are probably involved in the initiation of contact formation between zzso zzso zzso with zzso bind specifically to zzso zzso The binding can be inhibited by zzso cells with an zzso zzso zzso thus suggesting that zzso mediates zzso binding via zzso zzso The structure of zzso predicted from its zzso sequence can be divided into three major zzso a membrane anchor, a zzso and a zzso zzso An analysis of fusion proteins containing different zzso segments shows that the zzso activity resides in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso is replaced by other surface zzso in maintaining zzso zzso One of them has a Mr of 150,000 zzso zzso zzso have no effect on zzso cells, but they disrupt zzso zzso at subsequent zzso It becomes evident that the complex phenomena of cell zzso and tissue organization involve the participation of a number of surface zzso
