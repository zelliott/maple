The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso functional unit zzso was determined by direct sequencing and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso of peptides obtained by zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso chain of zzso consists of 413 zzso acid zzso and contains two consensus sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso potential sites for zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a zzso content of about zzso and the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating that only zzso zzso chains of zzso type seem to be zzso On basis of the zzso composition and zzso analysis of native and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso attached to zzso is zzso Multiple sequence alignments with other zzso zzso e functional units revealed an identity of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The present results are discussed in view of the recently determined X-ray structure of the functional unit g of the zzso zzso zzso
