The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with four zzso zzso on the zzso face of the zzso zzso is strongly zzso whereas two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso To understand how changes in zzso zzso face structure affect function, two additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were designed using the same zzso acid composition as zzso and zzso The aromatic zzso in zzso and zzso are near the zzso interface and at the center of the zzso face of the zzso zzso Like zzso but in contrast to zzso and zzso these peptides effectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso oxidized zzso zzso zzso and scavenged zzso zzso from low density zzso High pressure liquid zzso retention times and zzso exclusion pressures indicated that there is no direct correlation of zzso function with zzso zzso Fluorescence studies suggested that, although the peptides bind zzso similarly, the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso is less zzso restricted than in zzso and zzso Based on these results and molecular modeling studies, we propose that the arrangement of aromatic zzso in class A zzso zzso molecules regulates entry of zzso oxygen species into zzso complexes, thereby reducing the extent of zzso zzso an important step in zzso
