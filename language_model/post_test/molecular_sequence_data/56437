The mechanism for the formation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso produced under conditions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the tandem mass zzso of the zzso + zzso zzso of a model zzso and the corresponding zzso + zzso zzso in which all zzso zzso are replaced with zzso revealed that neither the zzso hydrogen nor a hydrogen from a nitrogen atom is involved in the process of migration of a hydrogen which leads to the formation of zzso zzso The most feasible position from which the transferred hydrogen originates is that at the first zzso in the zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso
