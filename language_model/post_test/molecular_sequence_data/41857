zzso disease zzso is an zzso neurological disorder characterized by zzso in the central nervous system zzso Recently zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso gene which encodes both zzso and its zzso zzso generated by alternative zzso have been demonstrated in zzso zzso We analyzed the seven zzso of the zzso gene of a Japanese boy affected with zzso by direct sequencing and identified an zzso event in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso was also present in his carrier mother, but was absent in zzso X zzso of normal zzso The zzso zzso leads to the production of truncated zzso with altered zzso terminal zzso acid zzso resulting in considerable change of the structure of zzso and zzso necessary for functional zzso This is the first report of a zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso gene associated with zzso
