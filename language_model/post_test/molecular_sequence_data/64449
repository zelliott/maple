zzso cells can restore function to the damaged zzso zzso system in animal models of Parkinson's zzso It has been reported that a protein which is released from zzso zzso can promote the survival of zzso zzso in zzso and protect them against zzso zzso zzso This zzso effect has been found to be zzso by zzso cells and blocked by zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Here we report the identification of bovine zzso zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso and the cloning of the respective zzso from zzso adrenal zzso zzso extracts from bovine zzso zzso were found to promote the survival of embryonic zzso zzso in culture, to the same extent as zzso human zzso Furthermore, the zzso action of the zzso zzso extract could be abolished by zzso to zzso human zzso We also show that zzso injection of zzso human zzso protected the zzso zzso system in an in zzso adult rat model of Parkinson's zzso zzso administration of this protein at the same time as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bundle was found to spare zzso levels in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso This study has found that the main component in zzso zzso responsible for their zzso effect on zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, zzso has significant protective effects on zzso zzso zzso in zzso making it a potential candidate for use in the treatment of Parkinson's zzso
