The zzso functioning of the A1 zzso zzso of zzso tissue has been implicated as a factor in zzso To begin to address questions concerning this relationship, the possibility of a unique A1 zzso zzso in zzso tissue must be zzso zzso zzso zzso the A1 zzso receptors of zzso zzso of a mouse and an obese human were isolated, zzso and expressed in zzso zzso We found their sequences to be zzso identical and each identical to published sequences of the receptors in brain preparations of the two zzso The two zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cells, a human kidney cell zzso Despite the zzso identity in their zzso the zzso binding properties of the human and mouse zzso expressed in the zzso cell line differed zzso With respect to zzso acid differences in the zzso zzso four occur in the second zzso loop, which has been implicated in binding by other zzso The zzso binding characteristics of the zzso receptors matched those of native receptors from human and mouse zzso zzso The human A1 zzso zzso was also expressed in zzso zzso cells to investigate reported influences of cellular environment on binding zzso We compared zzso binding of the expressed zzso in the two cell lines zzso and zzso We also compared zzso binding of native receptors from mouse brain and zzso tissue zzso In both studies, cellular environment had no affect on binding zzso This conclusive evidence resolves earlier conflicting reports in the zzso
