zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated in the progression of zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to investigate the dynamic zzso of zzso and its gene expression so as to explore the relationship between zzso expression and zzso at the early stage of zzso 

A zzso model was made with zzso zzso in male zzso zzso zzso changes of rat zzso were assessed zzso zzso zzso The dynamic expression of zzso and circulating zzso was zzso analyzed by zzso The gene fragments of zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso and confirmed by zzso The cellular distribution of zzso zzso expression was confirmed by zzso 

zzso examination confirmed zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso development in rat zzso and progressive increases in the levels of zzso and circulating zzso and its gene expression during the zzso The levels of zzso expression in the liver and blood of rats with zzso were significantly higher than those in normal rats and those with zzso zzso analysis confirmed the positive expression and zzso distribution of zzso in the development of rat zzso A positive relationship was found between zzso expression in the liver and blood zzso 

The above observations support the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso and its gene are closely associated with the zzso transformation of zzso and play an important role at the stage of zzso
