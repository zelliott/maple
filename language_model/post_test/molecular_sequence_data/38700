A novel zzso designated zzso was identified from an zzso database of a zzso immature zzso zzso zzso The zzso has zzso similarity to a recently cloned human zzso zzso that has no demonstrated zzso Northern analysis of mouse and human genes showed zzso zzso in brain, zzso muscle and zzso zzso panel blots showed that zzso was zzso in cervical zzso and zzso zzso but was zzso in breast invasive zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to B cells and zzso as well as two B cell lines, zzso and zzso and a zzso line, zzso zzso showed no binding to zzso or activated T zzso In addition, zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso cells but not T zzso The zzso injection of zzso creates a mixed inflammatory response in zzso and zzso zzso The above data indicates that zzso and its human zzso represents a novel zzso zzso that may have important roles in trafficking of B cells and zzso We propose the name B zzso and zzso zzso zzso for this zzso to reflect the described biological zzso
