zzso zzso zzso is a T zzso zzso zzso zzso Two peptides representing sequences of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were previously shown to stimulate peripheral blood zzso of patients with zzso and were found to be zzso T cell zzso in zzso and zzso mice, zzso Single zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso We showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso the zzso responses of T cell lines specific to the relevant zzso and zzso zzso cells of mice zzso to zzso and zzso zzso To inhibit T cell responses to both peptides zzso and zzso we zzso dual zzso composed of the zzso arranged two single zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso either zzso zzso or zzso zzso In the present study, we report that both dual zzso could bind to major zzso complex class II molecules on zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which bound more efficiently to major zzso complex class II zzso was found to inhibit the zzso responses of both zzso and zzso T cell zzso Furthermore, the analog inhibited the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells of both zzso and zzso mice when administered zzso zzso or per zzso The dual analog zzso could also zzso zzso manifestations in mice with experimental zzso zzso induced by zzso of a zzso T cell zzso Thus, a single zzso that is composed of zzso to two zzso zzso can be used to regulate T cell responses and disease associated with each zzso
