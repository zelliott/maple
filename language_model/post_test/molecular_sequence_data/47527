The zzso leukemia zinc finger gene zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso associated with acute zzso zzso In this work, a zzso zzso DNA region containing the entire zzso gene was zzso zzso elements account for zzso and no obvious coding information other than zzso is present over this zzso zzso contains six zzso and five zzso and the zzso organization zzso well with protein zzso There are at least four alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within zzso zzso zzso could be detected in most zzso tested whereas zzso zzso and zzso were present in the stomach, zzso and heart, zzso Although zzso donor and zzso signals at zzso boundaries for zzso and zzso zzso were classical zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso zzso These alternative zzso zzso maintained the zzso and may zzso zzso with absence of important functional zzso In zzso species without zzso there is a relatively long zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso box and several zzso factor binding sites were found in the putative promoter region upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso is a well zzso gene from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso sequences are found in human zzso The presence of two zzso alignments on human zzso zzso and 19 suggests a zzso replication during zzso The zzso zzso and joining sites in the index acute zzso leukemia case with zzso also were zzso which suggests the involvement of DNA zzso zzso
