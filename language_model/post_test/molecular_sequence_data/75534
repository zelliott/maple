zzso zzso was found to have two zzso designated zzso and zzso that were responsible for its stable inheritance during cell zzso They are located near the region that is essential for autonomous zzso Under conditions that inhibit replication of zzso zzso the zzso containing these zzso genes gave only a few zzso in viable cells and increased the number of zzso cells in the population, suggesting that a product from the zzso region stabilized the zzso by killing zzso zzso zzso of one of the two zzso open reading frames in the zzso region caused the loss of the killing function, and thus, the open reading frame is a gene designated zzso which encodes the killing zzso The coexistence of the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso carrying the other open reading frame inhibited stabilization, and thus, the second open reading frame is a gene designated zzso which encodes the inhibitor which might control the killing function of zzso It is likely that the two open reading frames were transcribed from a zzso There were no significant zzso in DNA sequences between the zzso gene of zzso and the genes previously shown to be responsible for the stable inheritance of the other zzso
