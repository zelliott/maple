The zzso zzso complex zzso encompasses important pathogens in both animals and humans, yet little information is available on the factors required for MAC zzso An animal zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was found to be considerably more virulent in zzso mice than a human zzso zzso zzso strain zzso To identify the genetic basis of this difference zzso zzso was applied, which resulted in the isolation of six DNA fragments unique to strain zzso zzso searches showed that three sequences belonged to a large gene cluster responsible for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso To reveal the nature of variation between strains in the zzso cluster zzso of a clone containing the A5 zzso zzso zzso cluster was isolated, zzso and compared to the corresponding region in other zzso zzso zzso The zzso cluster was highly zzso in the zzso region between all strains and zzso zzso the 3' region reflects extensive divergence among zzso including whole gene deletions and insertions of sequences containing open reading frames but lacking identity to any known zzso
