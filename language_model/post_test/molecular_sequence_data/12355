The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes several large zzso which are expressed in complex patterns in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated and zzso It produces a similar to zzso zzso set of zzso and it encodes a protein that shows sequence similarity in several zzso which are also zzso in human zzso zzso Previous experiments have suggested that a distinct expression domain of zzso in the zzso region of the zzso is required to maintain expression of the zzso genes zzso et zzso 1994, Development zzso zzso At cellular zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso is also confined to the zzso portion of the zzso zzso This finding supports the idea that the specific zzso expression domain is an essential feature of the zzso zzso
