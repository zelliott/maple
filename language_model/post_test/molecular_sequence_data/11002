The X and Y zzso of the zzso like those of other zzso are zzso over most of their zzso but at the zzso ends of the zzso is a region of sequence identity, the zzso region zzso where the zzso pair and recombine during male zzso The point at which the zzso zzso into zzso and zzso sequences is called the zzso zzso We have completed a zzso walk from the zzso zzso gene to the zzso Analysis of this region revealed that the zzso boundary of mice is located within an zzso of a transcribed gene that encodes a novel zzso finger zzso The first three of the zzso of the gene are located on the X zzso whereas the 3' zzso of the gene are located on both X and Y zzso This unusual arrangement may indicate that the gene is in a state of transition from zzso to zzso and provides evidence for a process of attrition of the zzso region on the Y zzso
