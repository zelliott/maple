The zzso domain of a putative type 1 blue copper protein zzso from zzso zzso was zzso and zzso A zzso zzso chain reaction method was used to zzso an artificial coding region for the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso known as zzso prior to zzso and zzso The zzso proteins were zzso from inclusion bodies and zzso with copper, and their in zzso characteristics were zzso zzso zzso which is zzso has identical zzso and zzso properties to the native zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate that they have comparable zzso type 1 copper binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso highlights the similarity between the active site zzso of zzso and zzso The reduction potential of zzso zzso is 252 zzso compared to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso values of zzso are obtained for the alkaline transitions in both zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso and the results form the zzso basis for a discussion of zzso function in the model vascular zzso
