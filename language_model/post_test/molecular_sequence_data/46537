We have determined the DNA sequence of the envelope gene region of the zzso strain of mouse zzso zzso zzso The sequence extends for zzso zzso from the single zzso site to beyond the zzso site in the 3' long terminal repeat zzso of the zzso There is a major open reading frame from zzso zzso to zzso which encompasses the entire zzso zzso This reading frame extends through a zzso tract and into the zzso There is another open reading frame from the first zzso to position zzso presumably corresponding to the end of the pol zzso The zzso zzso site which generates zzso zzso has been mapped zzso to zzso zzso The zzso gene products, zzso and zzso have been positioned on the sequence using the directly determined zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso of zzso and both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The start of zzso is preceded by a series of 19 zzso zzso acids which could function as a typical signal zzso but this sequence is only part of a much longer leader zzso The zzso zzso is the presumed zzso site in the zzso zzso and occurs just before the zzso zzso zzso There are five potential zzso zzso sites which agrees with previous experimental zzso The zzso has two long zzso regions at its zzso and zzso zzso these are suggested to act as a fusion zzso and the zzso anchor, zzso
