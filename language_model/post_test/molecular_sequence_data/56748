The zzso in human zzso cartilage from subjects of all ages express zzso for both of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso although the level of expression of zzso zzso is much lower than that of zzso zzso zzso shows alternative zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso domain within its zzso zzso region, but there is no evidence for a major difference in zzso in the relative expression of this domain with zzso At all ages studied from birth to the mature adult, a greater proportion of transcripts lacked the zzso zzso The relative proportions of the two transcripts did not change upon culture and passage of isolated zzso In contrast, the zzso complement regulatory protein zzso domain was predominantly expressed irrespective of age, but cell culture did result in variation of the zzso of this zzso zzso possesses two zzso zzso and one zzso domain, but at all ages the three zzso were predominantly present in all zzso This situation persisted upon culture and passage of the zzso Thus, unlike zzso the zzso expressed by human zzso cartilage does not appear to undergo alternative zzso of its zzso zzso region, either in cartilage in zzso or in zzso in zzso
