We identified a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso designated zzso zzso localized at zzso boundaries in the zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso polarity was zzso Before zzso polarization of wing cells along the zzso zzso zzso zzso was redistributed predominantly to zzso and zzso cell zzso This biased zzso of zzso appears to be driven by an imbalance of the activity of zzso zzso across the zzso cell zzso These results, together with zzso caused by zzso expression of zzso and zzso suggest that cells acquire the zzso polarity by way of the zzso boundary zzso of zzso
