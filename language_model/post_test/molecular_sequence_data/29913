The zzso virus zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso which acts as a key regulatory switch in the transition between the zzso and zzso viral life zzso In this work, full-length zzso was expressed at high levels in zzso coli and zzso to zzso by DNA affinity zzso The bacterial protein bound to specific target sequences zzso response zzso and activated zzso in zzso from an zzso virus early target promoter zzso zzso bound to DNA as a zzso The formation of a zzso with a zzso deletion zzso was detected by gel zzso mobility shift zzso zzso analysis on the zzso zzso and zzso virus 40 control regions revealed multiple binding sites with no simple consensus zzso zzso bound upstream from its own promoter at low zzso while at high zzso it bound at the zzso start site, suggesting that it may activate and then zzso its own zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso
