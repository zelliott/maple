We have analyzed five zzso zzso of two zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Two of the five zzso zzso produced similar zzso for both zzso zzso The other three zzso caused zzso dependent on the particular zzso zzso Of all the zzso zzso only two were found to possess a zzso zzso zzso Our zzso analysis lends further support for zzso being the true zzso of the zzso zzso zzso even though quite divergent from zzso zzso zzso still retains the ability to interact with at least some essential cell cycle regulators, suggesting some functional zzso with the zzso zzso Additionally, we demonstrated that the three zzso acid deletion in the zzso zzso results in the loss of the ability to interact with the zzso zzso
