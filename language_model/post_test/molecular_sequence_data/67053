Recently we have identified the novel zzso zzso responsible for degrading zzso and other short zzso peptides in zzso the zzso zzso which we named zzso zzso In the present study we have identified and characterized the human zzso zzso zzso in brain zzso and we show its capacity to degrade the zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is localized to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies in human brain zzso using zzso zzso showed complete zzso of zzso activity against zzso We have zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and its zzso with zzso base zzso in the zzso zzso motif replaced by zzso In zzso studies using zzso zzso and liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso revealed novel zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso Arctic, a protein that causes increased zzso formation an early onset familial zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to insulin degrading zzso which is a functional analogue of zzso zzso does not degrade insulin but does degrade insulin zzso zzso modeling of zzso based on the crystal structure at zzso A resolution of zzso allowed us to identify zzso and zzso that form zzso bridges under oxidized conditions and might be involved in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso may potentially be of importance in the pathology of zzso zzso
