zzso involved in zzso metabolism are of particular pharmaceutical interest, as their function is crucial for zzso acid and DNA zzso The crystal structure of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of a zzso zzso has been determined previously with a bound zzso zzso While the zzso binding site was identified to be localized in a deep and rather zzso zzso at the interface between two protein zzso the zzso assignment of zzso zzso was not zzso We succeeded in determining the crystal structures of three zzso zzso zzso Investigation of these structures followed by zzso zzso studies allowed identification of the zzso acids involved in zzso by both zzso zzso The zzso bind close to zzso and zzso zzso of a strictly zzso motif for active sites in zzso While zzso is in a good position for chemical interaction with the zzso zzso zzso was found stacking against the zzso aromatic rings and hence seems to be more important for proper positioning of the zzso than for zzso Also, zzso and/or zzso were found to possibly act as an zzso for water in the zzso zzso These and the other zzso zzso and zzso with which contacts are made, are strictly zzso in zzso zzso On the basis of structural and zzso data, we propose a reaction mechanism for both activities, the zzso and the zzso
