Comparisons of proteins show that they evolve through the movement of zzso However, in many cases, the underlying mechanisms remain zzso Here, we observed the movements of DNA recognition zzso between zzso proteins within a zzso zzso zzso zzso systems, consisting of a zzso DNA zzso and a restriction zzso contribute to zzso of zzso zzso systems limit horizontal gene transfer but are themselves zzso We compared Type III zzso systems in zzso zzso zzso and found that target recognition domain zzso sequences are mobile, moving between different zzso groups that occupy unique zzso zzso zzso comparisons suggested that a likely underlying mechanism is movement through zzso zzso of similar DNA sequences that zzso zzso acid sequence motifs that are zzso among Type III DNA zzso zzso with this movement, zzso was observed between the zzso trees of zzso regions and other regions in zzso zzso acquisition of diverse zzso sequences was suggested by detection of zzso in other zzso species and zzso related bacterial zzso One of these zzso systems in zzso zzso was zzso by zzso of another zzso system that likely transferred from an oral zzso zzso movement represents a novel route for diversification of zzso zzso
