A zzso survey of the zzso associated with the Brazilian endemic coral zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of 54 zzso specimens collected in three different places at zzso zzso in two consecutive years zzso 2005 and 2006) was used for zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso of the 151 zzso zzso fell within the zzso core group according to partial zzso zzso zzso We performed the sequencing of zzso and zzso genes of all zzso zzso The most abundant zzso belonged to the zzso core group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the exception of zzso zzso which was found only in the zzso of zzso zzso the other species appeared in different hosts with no evidence for the presence of zzso clones or zzso Using zzso analysis, we observed a high zzso zzso within the zzso Each zzso isolate generated a different zzso fingerprint zzso There was a complete agreement between the grouping based on zzso and zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso gene has the highest zzso power for zzso species zzso 

The zzso core group is dominant in the zzso of these zzso There is a tremendous diversity of zzso lineages within the coral zzso zzso gene sequences permit a clear-cut identification of zzso 

The zzso resolution provided by zzso (but not zzso appears to be enough for identifying species of zzso and for disclosing putative new zzso The zzso core group appears to be dominant in the zzso of the Brazilian zzso The overrepresentation of these zzso may reflect as yet unknown ecological functions in the coral zzso
