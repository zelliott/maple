The purpose of the study was to characterize the zzso and molecular mechanisms in the very early zzso of electrical zzso in a rabbit model of rapid zzso pacing zzso 

zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso and transient outward zzso zzso currents by zzso zzso of the underlying zzso zzso However, electrical zzso starts early after the onset of rapid zzso zzso The time course of zzso current and channel zzso in these early zzso of zzso is currently zzso 

Rapid zzso zzso right zzso pacing was performed in zzso Animals were divided into five groups with pacing zzso between 0 and 96 zzso zzso currents were measured by patch clamp zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and protein expression were measured by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso 

zzso calcium current started to be reduced (by zzso after 12 h of zzso and continued to decline as pacing zzso Current changes were preceded or paralleled by decreased zzso expression of the zzso channel beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas significant reductions in the zzso zzso zzso and protein expression began 24 h after pacing zzso zzso outward zzso current zzso were not altered within the first 12 zzso but after 24 zzso currents were reduced by zzso zzso pacing periods did not further decrease zzso Current changes were paralleled by reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the auxiliary zzso zzso were not zzso 

zzso calcium current and zzso are reduced in early zzso of electrical zzso A major mechanism appears to be zzso zzso of underlying zzso channels, which partially preceded zzso current zzso
