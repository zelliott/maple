zzso trafficking of zzso zzso receptors is regulated predominantly by zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso Although zzso receptors are found at the vast majority of zzso zzso synaptic zzso receptors exhibit a much more restricted distribution, suggesting that specific mechanisms exist for selective trafficking of these zzso zzso In this report, we define a critical forward trafficking motif that is necessary for surface expression of the zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso proteins containing only the zzso zzso zzso The trafficking zzso was identified by tracking surface expression of green fluorescent zzso zzso receptors with zzso zzso in zzso cells and cultured zzso and zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso site zzso of the zzso zzso C zzso localized the critical motif to a seven zzso acid stretch of predominantly basic zzso zzso zzso of the trafficking motif reduced zzso zzso current zzso by zzso and resulted in retention of the zzso receptors in the zzso zzso This forward trafficking domain is the first such identified for zzso zzso
