zzso from reconstructed field bean zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the DNA was used for the physical zzso of seed storage and zzso zzso protein genes using zzso with sequence specific zzso The data were confirmed and refined by using DNA of zzso zzso of other zzso as the target for zzso The specificity of the zzso products was proved by zzso zzso into fragments of predicted length or by zzso using zzso zzso The genes are located within defined regions of zzso I zzso zzso unknown seed protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso B3 zzso III zzso B4 zzso IV zzso zzso 1) and V zzso A genes and zzso zzso zzso Except for the zzso derived from the sequence of zzso B4 zzso all members of each gene family are located in one zzso region zzso This approach proved to be useful for zzso genes that cannot be mapped genetically zzso to the lack of zzso zzso and might be applied to integrate physical and genetic zzso
