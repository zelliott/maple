We report the synthesis by mouse zzso cells of zzso peptides related to the zzso zzso by the zzso cells of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso line zzso zzso cells in primary cultures, and zzso zzso tissue in culture medium were observed to release zzso material with a zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso culture medium was increased zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso enriched in round zzso and of nerve growth zzso Two series of results suggest that this activity may zzso to the release by zzso cells of zzso zzso and specifically, of peptides of the zzso family first identified in the zzso cells of zzso zzso First, a characteristic zzso sequence corresponding to the zzso first zzso of the mouse zzso and zzso zzso genes was evidenced in the zzso of zzso cells and of the zzso Second, zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso group in zzso cells, and identified two distinct zzso in the zzso Inside the zzso zzso these zzso were found accumulated in zzso cells at stages corresponding to the maturation of zzso In the zzso space, zzso cells also contained zzso zzso
