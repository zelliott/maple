In efforts to find genetic resources with high nutritional value of rice seed, we assessed the diversity of the major storage protein zzso in 13 wild and 2 cultivated rice species by a unique zzso method and zzso zzso zzso separation of zzso zzso zzso which is a prerequisite for the diversity zzso could be attained by zzso performed at higher temperature zzso degrees zzso than the generally employed temperatures zzso degrees zzso Seven zzso zzso were raised against zzso zzso sequences designed at five sites from four variable regions spanning the zzso zzso High specificity of each zzso was confirmed using rice zzso zzso and demonstrated considerable variation in zzso acid sequence and zzso level of zzso zzso in wild species, in combination with the zzso zzso The degree of the variation was, however, changed according to the site of variable regions and the type of zzso Some wild species accumulated nutritious zzso zzso more than cultivated zzso The wild species zzso zzso and zzso zzso had zzso with low zzso against most zzso examined in this study, reflecting the significant zzso Such wild species may hopefully serve as important genetic resources for nutritional improvement of cultivated zzso
