A previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found by sequence comparison as a zzso of the zzso translation initiation factor 4A zzso zzso has zzso identity and zzso similarity on the zzso acid level to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso Although clearly grouped in the zzso zzso the essential zzso displays a different zzso function and zzso An zzso zzso zzso is localized predominantly in the zzso zzso analyses in a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso strain reveal a decrease in the number of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, these strains are hypersensitive to the zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso zzso labeling of zzso and zzso analysis of zzso and mature zzso by Northern zzso and primer extension in the zzso strain show that zzso is required for zzso processing at sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso depletion of zzso leads to decreased zzso zzso levels and to an overall deficit in zzso zzso zzso Together, these results zzso zzso in the zzso zzso maturation zzso rather than in translation zzso
