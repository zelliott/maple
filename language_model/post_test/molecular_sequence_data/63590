The zzso (or zzso protein was recently identified in our laboratory as a zzso of serum response factor that contributes to the regulation of zzso target genes in the zzso 

In the present study, we report that zzso a nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso represented the majority of the zzso clones that zzso with zzso in multiple screenings using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins zzso and zzso with each other in the zzso The zzso protein contains four classic nuclear zzso sequence zzso and it was observed to be present predominantly in the zzso zzso of zzso altered the zzso level of zzso and reduced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso also induced the zzso of serum response zzso 

These data suggest that zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso processes such as cardiac cellular zzso gene zzso and possibly zzso
