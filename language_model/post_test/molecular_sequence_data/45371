The zzso status of an zzso isolated from zzso collected from the zzso zzso was established using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso and zzso properties consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso and formed a distinct zzso line in the zzso zzso gene tree together with the type strain of zzso zzso The isolate was readily distinguished from the latter, and from representatives of other zzso species, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso acids and a zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso It is apparent that the isolate belongs to a novel species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was thus considered to be the type strain of a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
