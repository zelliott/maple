Several zzso zzso and zzso were incubated individually in zzso with rumen fluid from two sheep receiving a mixed grass zzso diet and with washed cells of zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The rates of breakdown of most peptides were similar in the rumen fluid from the two zzso zzso and zzso peptides tended to be more slowly zzso than neutral or basic zzso The zzso at the zzso of higher peptides was observed as an early product of zzso confirming that a zzso zzso type of activity was zzso The relative rates of breakdown of zzso by zzso zzso were different from that of rumen fluid, but the zzso of higher peptides followed a similar pattern, and zzso from the zzso were detected as early zzso
