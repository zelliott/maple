zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered the leading candidate zzso processing zzso of zzso zzso zzso Its zzso specificity is directed toward a zzso zzso acid processing site, and as such, the zzso zzso is distinguished from the family of zzso zzso which act at zzso zzso acid processing zzso To delineate the molecular mechanisms which distinguish zzso from zzso zzso zzso processing zzso pure zzso zzso is needed for sequence determination leading to molecular zzso and for preparation of zzso An affinity zzso zzso scheme seemed a logical modification of our established procedures to yield suitable amounts of zzso for further studies zzso and Harris zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso formed ineffective affinity zzso even though these compounds contain essential zzso on either side of what would be the zzso bond in a zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso (based on the zzso recognition sequence of the zzso zzso linked to zzso formed effective affinity zzso permitting zzso of the zzso in a single step from a zzso fraction enriched for zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso was zzso zzso in zzso overall yield, and subjected to zzso sequence analysis through 26 zzso The sequence determined, zzso indicates that the zzso zzso is unique, showing little sequence zzso to other proteins in the zzso
