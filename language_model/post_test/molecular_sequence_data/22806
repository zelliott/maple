We have previously shown that when mouse zzso zzso a zzso anchored zzso zzso is applied to the wound area, the inflammatory responses in the early recovery phase of damaged tissue are enhanced and wound closure is zzso This suggests that zzso has an important effect on skin wound zzso 

Whether zzso zzso the development, in zzso mice, of zzso zzso zzso skin zzso induced by repeated application of zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined under specific zzso zzso 

zzso the application of zzso to the zzso zzso mice remarkably suppressed severe zzso zzso into the zzso although total skin severity scores, zzso changes in zzso erosion and zzso of inflammatory cells into the zzso and subcutaneous zzso were comparable between the zzso group of mice and the control zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso would be beneficial for the treatment of zzso zzso by suppressing severe zzso zzso into the zzso
