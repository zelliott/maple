zzso zzso is the most frequent cause of zzso hypothyroidism, but its molecular zzso is largely zzso Our hypothesis that some genes downstream to zzso zzso zzso zzso might be responsible for development of the zzso prompted us to identify genes whose expression is zzso by zzso zzso products of zzso clones obtained by a zzso zzso method in zzso expressing cell lines were screened with labeled zzso by zzso zzso We isolated 17 genes zzso by zzso which were subsequently confirmed by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso One of them is a novel gene designated zzso that showed a highly zzso expression zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that expression of all of the 14 genes tested was zzso by both zzso and zzso another zzso zzso zzso Our results have important implications for understanding normal zzso development as well as the molecular defects underlying zzso zzso
