zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to be regulated by a zzso zzso zzso A 25 zzso acid zzso derived from this domain zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Here we show that a 97 zzso acid zzso of the zzso A alpha zzso is zzso zzso more potent than the shorter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso to zzso previously shown to disrupt zzso zzso and zzso regulation in zzso greatly reduced zzso by the zzso domain in zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso show that both are competitive zzso of zzso zzso activity with Ki values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests zzso regulation of zzso with the zzso zzso interacting at the active site of the zzso The competitive zzso of the zzso zzso contrasts with the mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso complexes, which have been shown to bind to zzso at a region removed from the active zzso
