A gene family, designated zzso has been characterized in zzso zzso by zzso Southern zzso and zzso sequencing zzso The zzso gene family includes at least five members, named zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose products share appreciable sequence similarities in their zzso zzso and zzso motifs with known zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso protein deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso clone has considerable zzso with the zzso motor domain of the zzso heavy zzso The predicted secondary structure of the zzso protein indicates two zzso zzso separated by a long alpha zzso coiled zzso with zzso repeat structures, such as are commonly found in zzso zzso
