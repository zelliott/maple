The recent zzso characterization of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso allows structurally zzso regions to be zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso activities from different bacteria shows that the relative activities vary according to zzso By comparison of both zzso acid sequences and structures, differences can be identified in the zzso interface and the zzso zzso these differences could be responsible for the observed zzso in zzso activity and indicate that subtle changes in the zzso structure may zzso the zzso for different zzso
