A search of the zzso zzso which includes zzso of the zzso zzso zzso identified 53 sequence zzso of zzso zzso binding proteins zzso A DNA zzso was constructed from the zzso that includes those zzso and zzso other zzso zzso genes for zzso To screen the zzso program with this zzso an zzso extract from growing cells was compared with one prepared from developing cells at 12 zzso Previous reporter studies had shown that zzso zzso has initiated development and has begun to express many zzso regulated genes by 12 zzso The comparison revealed substantial increases in the expression levels of 11 zzso factors that may respond to environmental zzso Six of the 53 zzso zzso were expressed at significantly higher levels at 12 h of development than during zzso Three were previously unknown zzso and they were zzso to look for effects on zzso body zzso One knockout zzso produced zzso bodies of abnormal shape that depended on the composition of the zzso
