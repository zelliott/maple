The molecular basis of the zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso was investigated using a zzso zzso An immobilized zzso zzso library, which contains 24,000 zzso was constructed with a zzso zzso fluorescent group attached at the N zzso of each zzso This immobilized zzso library was incubated with zzso zzso zzso releasing zzso fragments in the solution zzso The relative zzso specificity zzso for each member of the library was determined by measuring zzso intensity in the solution zzso zzso sequencing was used to assign structure to zzso of active zzso zzso zzso the zzso preference for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The last position on the zzso side in which the identity of the zzso acids affects the activity of the zzso is zzso and an aromatic side chain is preferred in this zzso The optimal zzso extended zzso sequence is zzso zzso and zzso The Cop group in either the zzso or zzso position is required for a high zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites of the zzso play a dominant role in fixing the zzso zzso The immobilized zzso library proved to be a powerful approach for assessing the zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso so it may be applied to the study of other zzso of zzso
