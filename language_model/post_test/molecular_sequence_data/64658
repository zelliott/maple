zzso zzso an early branching zzso is the zzso agent of zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso by modulating the zzso properties of the zzso However, the zzso role of zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso zzso remains poorly zzso We had previously characterized a novel zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso Here, we report the identification and partial characterization of an zzso of this zzso zzso Both zzso have four zzso zzso zzso binding zzso The two zzso are zzso by genes of the same size zzso zzso zzso between the two genes showed an overall identity of zzso at the zzso sequence zzso This identity dropped to zzso in the zzso central zzso region between the second and third zzso binding zzso Both of these genes are single zzso as revealed by Southern zzso Analysis of the available zzso zzso zzso sequence data suggested that the two genes are zzso zzso structural modeling showed that the major differences between the two zzso lie in the central zzso region, normally involved in binding target zzso A number of studies indicated that zzso and zzso are functionally zzso They bind different sets of zzso zzso proteins in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also found to be unique for the two proteins and the zzso concentration required for their optimal functionality was also zzso In addition, a zzso zzso was identified from a random zzso library that could zzso bind the two zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a new member of a class of zzso zzso zzso proteins involved in a novel calcium signal zzso zzso
