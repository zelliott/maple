zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso the orphan zzso zzso may play a role in the regulation of stress responses in lung and airway zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso a novel protein we found in our previous study which interacts with zzso This study was designed to observe the zzso location and wound repair function of zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and then the zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso The location of zzso protein was observed by laser zzso zzso and the expression of it was analyzed by zzso At the same zzso built the zzso zzso zzso zzso it into zzso and observed its impact on cell cycle and wound repair of zzso The results showed that zzso locates in membrane and zzso and increases significantly in zzso zzso zzso zzso results demonstrated that the zzso zzso increases S phase plus zzso phase of cell cycle by zzso zzso video analysis system showed that the repair index of wounded zzso increases by zzso through stable expression of zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso locates in the membrane and zzso suggesting that this protein is a zzso zzso which promotes cell cycle and wound repair of zzso
