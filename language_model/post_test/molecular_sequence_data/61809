Human zzso zzso and zzso genes are located on zzso in the zzso gene zzso We recently identified deletion of zzso in a Japanese zzso This study was performed to identify the zzso and to examine the association of zzso deletion with zzso to zzso arthritis and systemic lupus zzso The location of the zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso from the 3' end of zzso by comparing sequences of the zzso segments upstream and downstream of the zzso gene in the common zzso with the zzso sequence between zzso and zzso in the deletion zzso Based on this information, a zzso system was zzso The frequency of zzso deletion zzso was zzso in Japanese and zzso in Dutch zzso The frequency of zzso deletion was zzso in Japanese and zzso in zzso Evidence for an association with rheumatic diseases was not zzso These results indicated that zzso deletion is commonly present in Japanese and Dutch, suggesting that zzso is not essential for survival and zzso and is not associated with rheumatic zzso
