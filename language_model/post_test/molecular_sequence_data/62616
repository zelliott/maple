Using a method of expression profiling called differential analysis of zzso library expression zzso we report the expression profile of late response genes in a model of zzso zzso survival and zzso zzso Using zzso we isolated zzso expressed genes from cultured rat embryonic cortical zzso after zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso We identified 469 zzso regulated zzso of which 174 are genes of unknown zzso The regulation of 63 genes was found to be zzso oxide zzso zzso genes fell into several major categories, including signal zzso zzso zzso development, DNA zzso gene transcription, protein zzso energy regulatory zzso and zzso zzso These genes may be important in zzso zzso survival and zzso Furthermore, these late response genes provide the tools to begin to investigate downstream events in zzso zzso survival and zzso The major advantage of zzso is that it provides a nearly complete and relatively comprehensive differential screening profile that has the potential to be a powerful and useful tool in other fields of zzso
