The role of zzso in eye development in insects and zzso supports the view that their eyes evolved from simple zzso zzso present in their last common ancestors zzso The cerebral eyes in errant zzso represent zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus resemble the presumed ancestral zzso We have zzso expression of zzso eye zzso genes in the early development of zzso and adult zzso eyes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and adult eyes form in close vicinity of the zzso zzso on both sides of the developing brain zzso While zzso is expressed in the zzso but not in the developing, adult eyes, expression of zzso from zzso stages zzso specifically outlines the zzso zzso and thus covers both the developing zzso and adult zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as differentiation marker, we show that the first pair of adult eye zzso cells is detected within bilateral clusters that zzso express zzso the zzso zzso zzso thus resembling zzso sensory zzso Our data indicate zzso to insects, but different from the zzso zzso expression outlines the entire visual system from early zzso stages zzso and zzso clusters generate the first zzso cells to zzso We propose that zzso zzso and zzso zzso eyes, as found in today's zzso were present already in zzso
