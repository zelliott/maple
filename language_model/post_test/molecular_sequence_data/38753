zzso type C zzso disease is characterized by an zzso of cholesterol and other lipids in the zzso zzso In this report, we use zzso zzso and zzso to determine the zzso of the zzso zzso C1 zzso zzso zzso of mouse liver zzso indicates that some zzso zzso with zzso membrane protein 1 zzso zzso However, a significant amount of zzso is also found in zzso that do not contain zzso Moreover, zzso of liver zzso and zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso showed that a fraction of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso of cultured mouse zzso showed that zzso is found in two zzso distinct zzso The first population is characterized by large zzso structures that do not zzso with major zzso protein zzso but do zzso with zzso and a small fraction of zzso zzso of these large zzso compartments using electron zzso shows that these structures contain extensive internal zzso The second population is represented by smaller, more diffuse structures, a fraction of which zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso with low density zzso zzso increases zzso of zzso with zzso zzso This zzso can be further enhanced by treating zzso with zzso or zzso The results indicate that zzso is associated with an unique zzso compartment enriched with cholesterol and containing zzso and that zzso cycles to zzso zzso presumably to facilitate the processing of zzso zzso
