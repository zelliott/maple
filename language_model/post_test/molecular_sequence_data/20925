The zzso yellow mosaic viruses zzso that cause extensive losses to grain zzso across southern Asia are an zzso unusual group of zzso zzso zzso family zzso with zzso zzso All previously identified zzso were isolated from zzso crop zzso Here we have identified a virus related to the zzso in a common zzso the zzso zzso zzso originating from zzso Analysis of the sequence of the virus shows it to be a typical zzso zzso zzso comparisons to all other zzso sequences available in the databases show the virus from zzso zzso to be zzso with the highest level of sequence identity zzso to an isolate of zzso yellow mosaic zzso This indicates that the virus identified here is a new species in the zzso zzso for which we propose the name zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso By zzso zzso we show that, in common with the other zzso the clones of zzso are not infectious to the experimental host zzso zzso In zzso the results of zzso depended upon the zzso In soybean zzso zzso the symptoms were mild and plants recovered from zzso However, in zzso zzso symptoms were severe and progressed to zzso indicative of a hypersensitive zzso These results indicate that there is resistance to zzso in the soybean zzso The significance of these results is zzso
