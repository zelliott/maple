zzso is a major zzso zzso of drugs and zzso that are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the protein levels of the individual zzso zzso in human zzso is required for the successful zzso of in zzso zzso data to in zzso zzso Most previous studies evaluating zzso zzso expression were limited to the zzso level because of the high degree of zzso acid sequence zzso between zzso zzso that has hampered the availability of zzso zzso In this study, we generated a zzso zzso zzso against human zzso We demonstrated that this zzso does not zzso with the other zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and shows a high degree of zzso acid sequence similarity with zzso Using this zzso we found that zzso protein is expressed in the kidney and the liver but not in the zzso or the zzso consistent with previous reports of zzso zzso In a panel of 20 individual human zzso the zzso protein levels exhibited zzso zzso It is noteworthy that the relative zzso protein levels were not correlated with the zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso like other zzso zzso reported zzso suggesting the importance of evaluating zzso zzso expression at protein zzso In conclusion, we generated a specific zzso zzso against zzso and evaluated the distribution and relative expression levels of the zzso protein in human zzso This zzso may serve as a useful tool for further studies of zzso to evaluate its zzso zzso and zzso roles in human zzso
