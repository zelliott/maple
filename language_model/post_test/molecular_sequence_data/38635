zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso dietary deficiencies with the synthesis and provision of several essential zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso a region of the zzso of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso which includes the zzso zzso zzso This gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which plays a central role in zzso zzso Two changes involved in the overproduction of this zzso acid have been zzso First, the absence of an zzso region suggests a zzso expression of this zzso Second, the regulatory domain of the zzso zzso zzso shows changes in the zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso binding of zzso and is strongly zzso in zzso zzso proteins from practically all known zzso These changes suggest the zzso of the zzso to zzso by zzso and would permit the bacterial zzso to zzso zzso
