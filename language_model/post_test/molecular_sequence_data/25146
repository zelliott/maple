zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso structural zzso that is linked to an zzso zzso zzso When inherited in trans to an zzso zzso zzso it results in zzso H disease associated with low levels zzso of the zzso zzso The nature of the zzso zzso associated with the alpha zzso zzso has been investigated by structural and functional zzso zzso analysis of the cloned zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso at zzso 109 in an otherwise normal alpha zzso zzso When the alpha zzso gene was introduced into mouse zzso cells, the steady state zzso zzso zzso zzso level was equivalent to the alpha zzso gene zzso Although in zzso translation of a synthetic alpha zzso zzso generated levels of alpha zzso equivalent to alpha zzso zzso at early time points, the ratio of alpha zzso to alpha A zzso decreased markedly at later time zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso results from a significant instability of the alpha zzso zzso
