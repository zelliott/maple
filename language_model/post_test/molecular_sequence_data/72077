Previous studies using zzso zzso segments reported that the exclusive site of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is the zzso zzso convoluted zzso zzso We now report the presence of zzso zzso zzso and activity in cells that are devoid of markers of zzso zzso but express characteristics highly specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso mouse zzso convoluted zzso zzso cells but was markedly induced when zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso D3 zzso zzso protein and activity were also identified in zzso cells by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso or zzso hormone zzso 10 zzso was found to zzso the effect of 1, zzso on zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso or zzso on zzso expression in zzso cells suggests differential regulation of zzso expression in the zzso and zzso In the presence of zzso and 1, zzso a zzso to zzso induction in vitamin D zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso as determined by Western zzso analysis, was also enhanced in the presence of zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso cells with rat zzso promoter deletion zzso demonstrated that zzso enhanced 1, zzso zzso zzso but this enhancement was not zzso by zzso response elements zzso in the zzso zzso We conclude that 1) although the zzso is the major site of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and activity can also be localized in the zzso zzso 2) both zzso and zzso zzso the induction of zzso expression by zzso in zzso cells in a manner different from that reported in the zzso and 3) in zzso cells, zzso of zzso levels by zzso and not an effect on zzso in the zzso promoter, is one mechanism involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
