zzso zzso encodes a zzso DNA zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso that use a protein as the primer for initiation of DNA zzso In one of the most important motifs present in the zzso zzso domain of zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso contains three zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are highly zzso among most zzso DNA zzso These zzso have recently been shown to be involved in proper stabilization of the primer zzso at the zzso zzso active zzso Here we investigate by means of zzso zzso the role of these three zzso in reactions that are specific for DNA zzso utilizing a zzso DNA replication zzso zzso introduced at zzso zzso zzso and zzso severely affected the zzso replication capacity of zzso DNA zzso For four of the zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction with the terminal protein was affected, leading to few initiation and transition zzso These findings, together with the specific conservation of zzso zzso and zzso among DNA zzso belonging to the zzso zzso strongly suggest a functional role of these zzso acid zzso in the DNA zzso protein zzso
