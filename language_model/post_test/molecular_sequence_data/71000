zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences were determined for a zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso from zzso segment 8 and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso segment 2 of the North American isolate of infectious salmon anemia virus zzso and compared to the published sequences of Norwegian zzso of zzso The North American zzso isolate exhibited zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso isolate from Norway in the partial zzso sequence of zzso segment 2, which encodes a zzso component protein zzso The North American zzso exhibited 88 and zzso identity with 2 partial zzso sequences of zzso segment 8 zzso zzso zzso reported for the zzso isolate from zzso The North American zzso exhibited zzso similarity with the zzso zzso zzso isolate from Norway in the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the protein zzso in the partial zzso zzso of open reading frame zzso 1 of zzso segment 8 of the North American zzso exhibited only zzso and zzso similarity with the 2 sequences of the Norwegian zzso zzso However, the North American zzso isolate exhibited zzso and zzso similarity with the 2 sequences of the Norwegian zzso isolate in the deduced zzso acid sequences of the protein zzso in the partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these partial zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences confirmed that the North American isolate is zzso However, the differences observed in these zzso sequences suggest that the North American isolate may represent a distinct zzso zzso from the previously described Norwegian zzso
