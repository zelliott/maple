Recent findings suggest that the zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, plays an important role in the attachment of zzso to bone zzso We report here the zzso by in zzso zzso of the zzso for the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso zzso in rat bone zzso To generate the zzso zzso zzso used in this study, we cloned zzso fragments of zzso chains alpha zzso beta 3, and beta 5 by the zzso chain reaction from rat zzso These fragments share zzso zzso with the respective human zzso In zzso zzso localized the alpha v and beta 3 zzso to regions undergoing extensive bone zzso The zzso appearance and zzso of bone sections for zzso acid zzso zzso indicated the presence of these zzso in zzso These observations support zzso findings that zzso express high levels of the zzso zzso confirm the identity of this zzso as zzso alpha zzso 3, and suggest that zzso may actively zzso these zzso
