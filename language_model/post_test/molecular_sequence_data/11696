The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso complex with a restricted tissue distribution pattern, is essential for signal zzso Our previous studies demonstrate that the continuous treatment of mice with zzso beta resulted in the complete disappearance of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso suggesting that signals through zzso beta are critically involved in development of these zzso zzso However, these zzso zzso are reported to be apparently unaffected in the zzso zzso To further examine the biological roles of the zzso zzso transgenic mice carrying the zzso beta zzso were zzso In these mice, high levels of the cell surface expression of the zzso beta were observed in essentially all zzso lineage cells, and zzso T cells as well as zzso T cells showed vigorous cell proliferation upon zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso cells marked with a high expression of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in the skin were completely absent in transgenic zzso However, the development of other zzso zzso including conventional alpha beta zzso cells, gamma delta zzso cells and B cells remained apparently zzso From these observations together with previous data on zzso mice, we speculate that factors, other than zzso that zzso the zzso beta as its functional zzso zzso may have a vital role in the development of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso for possible in zzso functions of zzso zzso beta are zzso
