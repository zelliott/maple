A family of inner nuclear membrane proteins is implicated in gene regulation by interacting with zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso however, the zzso functions of these proteins are largely zzso Using a zzso expression screening approach with an anterior zzso zzso library, we have identified an inner nuclear membrane zzso zzso as a novel zzso factor that is zzso by the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso and appears to be restricted to the entire zzso at the early zzso stage, then to the anterior zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior neural markers without zzso induction in zzso zzso and a partial secondary axis when expressed zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso protein zzso signaling downstream of its zzso zzso as judged by animal cap zzso in which zzso blocks expression of downstream targets of zzso signaling zzso and zzso and by zzso reporter zzso in which zzso suppresses zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses reveal that the zzso and zzso activities of zzso reside in the zzso region, and that the zzso region binds to zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso functions with zzso zzso zzso leads to the reduction of anterior zzso These results provide the first evidence that the nuclear envelope protein zzso acts as a zzso protein to antagonize zzso signaling during zzso zzso
