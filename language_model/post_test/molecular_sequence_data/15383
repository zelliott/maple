The interactions of zzso zzso and their host figs provide a model for investigating zzso Fig zzso have specialized zzso characters and lifestyles thought to be adaptations to living in the zzso zzso Although these aspects of natural history are well zzso the genetic zzso underlying these changes zzso zzso Fig zzso zzso is the key to zzso The zzso gene class, an unusual member of zzso zzso family, plays a critical role in enabling the function of conventional zzso zzso Four zzso zzso genes from one zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with one species of zzso zzso zzso can be used to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso zzso adaptation to its zzso We made a comparison of spatial zzso expression patterns and substitution rates of one zzso gene in these zzso zzso and sought evidence for selection zzso 

A newly identified zzso zzso gene was named zzso Expressions of zzso were restricted to the heads of all wingless male zzso zzso which usually live in the dark cavity of a zzso throughout their life zzso However, expressions were widely detected in the zzso legs and zzso of all female zzso zzso that fly from one zzso to another for zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was also observed in the zzso of zzso Compared with zzso the zzso gene in zzso zzso had an elevated rate of zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso using zzso D, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso tests indicated a zzso pattern of zzso variation in all zzso zzso Unlike in zzso this zzso pattern was also observed for synonymous sites of zzso within zzso 

The zzso and zzso expression patterns of zzso genes detected beyond the known primary zzso zzso indicates the location of cryptic zzso zzso The specialized ecological niche of these zzso explains the unique habits and zzso evolution of zzso zzso The zzso gene in zzso zzso is evolving very zzso zzso zzso from the neutral model of evolution reflects possible selection pressures acting on zzso sequences of zzso zzso particularly on zzso who are more zzso to zzso
