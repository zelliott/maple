Three dominant cell surface proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in the cell wall zzso The zzso zzso which encodes one of the major cell surface zzso was cloned using the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso Then the cloned zzso zzso containing the zzso gene was zzso and was shown to zzso a mature zzso of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene showed similarity to the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso one of the two major zzso proteins of zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso differed in zzso Northern zzso analysis and primer extension analysis respectively revealed a zzso zzso transcript and a promoter sequence resembling that of the zzso zzso fatty acid zzso B zzso zzso
