zzso an zzso form of retinal zzso results from defects in the zzso escort zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso assist in the attachment of zzso groups to zzso zzso a modification essential for their action as molecular switches regulating zzso zzso zzso If zzso that depend zzso on zzso for zzso exist, they will accumulate zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to label zzso zzso zzso we identified one zzso protein in zzso zzso that was zzso in zzso more efficiently by zzso than by zzso This protein was zzso and identified as Ram zzso zzso a previously cloned zzso of unknown zzso zzso of rat zzso showed that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso the two retinal cell layers that zzso earliest in zzso These results raise the possibility that the retinal zzso in zzso results from the deficient zzso of zzso or a closely related zzso
