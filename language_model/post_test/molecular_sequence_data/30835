The polar zzso of zzso zzso are composed of zzso of the zzso structural zzso The zzso of zzso involves the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso leader zzso membrane zzso and assembly of zzso into a zzso structure extending from the bacterial zzso This report describes three novel genes necessary for the formation of zzso DNA sequences adjacent to zzso the zzso structural zzso were cloned and zzso with zzso zzso Each of the insertions were introduced into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by gene zzso The effect of the zzso insertions in the bacterial zzso on zzso assembly was assessed by electron zzso and sensitivity of zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also tested for synthesis and membrane zzso of the zzso zzso in order to define the genes required for zzso export, and assembly of zzso A zzso region of DNA adjacent to the zzso structural gene was found to be essential for formation of zzso This region was zzso and found to contain three open reading frames coding for zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three proteins of similar molecular weight were expressed in zzso coli from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with use of a zzso zzso expression zzso The results of the analyses of the three genes and the implications for zzso assembly and maturation are zzso
