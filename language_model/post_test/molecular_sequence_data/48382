The zzso zzso zzso is a common species that is widely distributed throughout rocky zzso zones in zzso This zzso is the first intermediate host for three zzso zzso one zzso (an zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso A few studies based on zzso zzso experimental infection and molecular analyses have been performed to ascertain the zzso (at least at the family zzso to which these zzso zzso yet, there remains no clarification about the specific identity of these zzso zzso in this study, we compared the zzso region zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of these three zzso species, classified as zzso found in zzso zzso and nine adult zzso species from zzso zzso that are likely definitive hosts for these zzso The sequences from two of the zzso zzso matched with adult zzso from the zzso zzso type 1 zzso was similar to zzso zzso zzso with a mean genetic divergence of zzso and type 2 zzso was similar to zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso with zzso genetic zzso The third species zzso 3 zzso was classified to the family zzso however, the sequence from this species differed greatly from the three other zzso species documented in the marine fish of Chile and from other zzso in public zzso Moreover, this zzso has a particular zzso zzso that greatly differs from other zzso species described thus zzso zzso this intriguing zzso remains a zzso
