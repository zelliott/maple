Because of zzso zzso zzso as a select agent in the United States, genetic manipulation of this zzso is strictly zzso Only a few zzso selection zzso including zzso zzso and zzso are currently approved for use with this zzso but zzso strains are highly resistant to these zzso To facilitate routine genetic zzso of zzso zzso several new tools were zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and used to construct zzso plasmids where the zzso and zzso zzso genes are expressed from the zzso zzso coli zzso promoter and zzso zzso and zzso zzso selection markers from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or synthetic bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso systems allow in zzso zzso and recycling of zzso and zzso selection markers contained on zzso or zzso zzso Finally, expression of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter allowed development of an efficient zzso zzso integration system for zzso zzso In conjunction with a natural transformation method, the utility of these new tools was demonstrated by zzso an unmarked zzso zzso pump zzso zzso natural zzso zzso DNA fragments carrying this zzso marked with zzso resistance were transferred between the zzso of two different zzso zzso zzso Lastly, the deletion zzso was zzso by a zzso integrated zzso element carrying the zzso zzso The new tools allow routine zzso genetic zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
