The alpha and beta zzso are the zzso genetic disorders zzso The zzso state is associated with high morbidity and zzso thus screening of zzso zzso and prenatal testing are strongly zzso A zzso zzso array has been designed using zzso arrayed primer extension zzso for the simultaneous analysis of 15 zzso zzso defects and 23 zzso zzso commonly found in southeast Asian countries, where zzso are highly zzso This overcomes the problem of using multiple reverse dot zzso zzso The array showed zzso sensitivity and specificity in the detection of 120 zzso zzso and 35 zzso zzso zzso It is robust enough to be produced in a single place and shipped to other laboratories for zzso The production cost of the array is low, each slide can be used for three different test samples and is therefore amenable to large scale zzso screening in southeast Asian zzso
