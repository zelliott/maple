Two novel moderately zzso zzso rods zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from Lake zzso in Inner Mongolia zzso zzso zzso They were strictly zzso and zzso They grew at pH zzso zzso at pH zzso at zzso degrees C zzso at 37 degrees zzso and at zzso of zzso % zzso total zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the two zzso based on a comparison of their zzso zzso zzso led to their zzso within the class zzso the closest recognized type strain being zzso mobile zzso zzso with which they were found to share zzso % sequence zzso On the basis of zzso zzso data zzso 100 and 99 % zzso for each zzso the two zzso were found to be members of the same zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were found to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids of strain zzso selected as the representative strain, were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso and its polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and six unidentified zzso On the basis of the zzso evidence from this study, strains zzso and zzso represent a novel zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
