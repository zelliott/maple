A mixture of two different zzso acid sequences was discovered in zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso modification was zzso The high number of zzso in the sequence suggested that protein zzso was a product of gene zzso This was confirmed by isolation of two different zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis allowed the primary structure of the two zzso chains to be zzso zzso The observed changes (19 in 150 zzso are distributed along the zzso chain to give similar protein net charges although zzso of the same polarity and/or charge were the exception rather than the zzso The degree of diversity between the two zzso zzso is comparable to that between zzso sequences and shows that the putative increase of the rate of zzso for zzso zzso zzso at later evolution stages zzso zzso Lee et zzso 1985, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1986, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is observed in zzso This is the first time complete sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso from the same zzso have been found to be products of divergent genes and not simply zzso zzso
