We have cloned and zzso a novel zzso zzso gene that encodes a protein having a high degree of zzso with other known zzso C zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso a highly zzso putative zzso zzso motif found in zzso within the zzso zzso of previously identified zzso zzso is also present in zzso We have expressed and zzso to zzso a zzso zzso fusion protein having a molecular weight of approximately zzso zzso We have used this zzso fusion protein to produce zzso zzso against zzso for Western zzso zzso These analyses have revealed that zzso is expressed in the zzso head, the zzso zzso the zzso the zzso and the gut, as has been confirmed by zzso In addition, real-time reverse zzso chain reaction has shown that zzso zzso levels differ substantially among these zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is selectively expressed in the muscular zzso of the zzso including portions of the head, the zzso zzso the body wall, and the zzso
