Par zzso genes were originally identified in zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso However, neither their function in zzso development nor their action mechanism has been fully zzso Here we show that two members of Par zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulate the zzso zzso zzso to control zzso zzso We find first that zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso but not for cell fate zzso during early embryonic zzso We then find that zzso binds to zzso in an zzso zzso Our analyses identify two zzso zzso sites in zzso which are essential for zzso binding and for proper zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding of zzso to zzso does not markedly affect the zzso activity of zzso but zzso relocation of zzso from the plasma zzso to the zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso and its binding partner zzso zzso are also essential for zzso Thus, our results identify a requirement of Par proteins for zzso zzso and reveal a novel zzso within Par proteins that may provide a general mechanism for spatial control of zzso
