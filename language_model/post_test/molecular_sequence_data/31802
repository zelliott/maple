zzso a class VI intermediate filament zzso is expressed by zzso zzso cells in the zzso zone zzso In the present study, we analyzed the zzso expression and zzso levels in nerve cells in a mouse model of cerebral zzso and zzso zzso mice were subjected to zzso zzso for zzso and were killed either 1 or 4 days after the zzso The percentages of cells in the zzso that were positive for zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not significantly differ between the zzso zzso and sham zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso regions, the mice at 4 days after zzso zzso showed significantly higher numbers and percentages of nerve cells that were positive for zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared to results from the other zzso To our knowledge, this is the first description of zzso zzso expression in neural zzso cells in the zzso of adult zzso In this cerebral zzso and zzso mouse model, cells positive for zzso zzso were increased in the zzso and zzso field of the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso active zzso zzso zzso
