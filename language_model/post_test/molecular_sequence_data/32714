The coronavirus membrane zzso protein zzso tail interacts with the zzso during virus zzso Previous studies demonstrated that the two terminal zzso are important, and the charged zzso zzso in the penultimate position in the mouse zzso coronavirus zzso zzso M protein was suggested to participate in zzso interactions with negative charges in the zzso zzso zzso To determine the significance of the positive charge at position zzso we zzso the zzso with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso and studied these by reverse zzso in the context of a zzso full-length infectious zzso zzso with zzso zzso were readily recovered with the K or A zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were not tolerated as zzso In all recovered zzso viruses the negative charge was replaced with zzso zzso resulting from apparent template switching during zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso zzso substitution was present in some zzso zzso zzso viruses had zzso changes within the M protein zzso tail that were partially zzso zzso most of the second site changes in the zzso zzso viruses were previously shown to compensate for the removal of negative charges in the N zzso Our results strongly indicate that a positive charge is not absolutely zzso It is clear that other regions within the tail must also be involved in helping mediate interactions between the M protein and the zzso
