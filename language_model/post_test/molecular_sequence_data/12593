In establishing the memory zzso population and maintaining zzso during an immune response, zzso mediates the removal of early, zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso center zzso cells, and, zzso zzso B zzso To address the role of the zzso cell surface zzso zzso in the zzso response to zzso we have examined the zzso zzso response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice in which the zzso gene is zzso High levels of zzso were expressed on normal zzso B cells but the absence of zzso did not zzso the progressive decline in numbers of either zzso B cells or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the rate of formation and eventual size of the zzso memory zzso population in zzso mice were zzso The zzso of cells with zzso zzso and the appearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the serum were also normal in zzso zzso Thus, although high levels of zzso are expressed on zzso B cells, zzso is not required for zzso selection or for regulation of the major zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the size and composition of zzso compartments in the zzso immune response are regulated by mechanisms that do not require zzso
