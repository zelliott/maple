zzso zzso zzso members of a newly defined zzso of the family zzso are the most common agents of outbreaks of zzso in the United zzso Two features of zzso have hindered the development of simple methods for detection and determination of zzso their genetic diversity and their inability to grow in cell zzso To assess the immune responses of patients involved in outbreaks of zzso resulting from infection with zzso we previously used zzso zzso zzso representing four different genetic zzso but this panel proved insufficient for detection of an immune response in many zzso To extend and further refine this panel, we expressed in zzso the zzso genes of three additional genetically distinct zzso zzso Landing virus zzso White River virus zzso and Florida zzso All three expressed proteins assembled into zzso particles zzso that contained a full-length zzso zzso but both the zzso and zzso zzso also contained a zzso protein that resulted from deletion of 39 zzso acids at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were used to measure the immune responses in zzso patients involved in 37 outbreaks of acute zzso A majority of patients demonstrated a fourfold rise in the zzso of zzso G to the zzso zzso to the outbreak strain, but most zzso in response to other genetically distinct zzso as well, suggesting no clear pattern of zzso immune zzso Further study of the zzso of the zzso by use of zzso should allow us to design new detection systems with either broader zzso or better specificity and to define the optimum panel of zzso required for routine screening of patient zzso
