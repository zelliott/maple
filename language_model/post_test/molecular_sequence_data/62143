zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso is regulated in response to zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso genes includes a zzso zzso and two distinct translation control zzso zzso also regulates translation of zzso zzso a zzso zzso that encodes a putative zzso zzso Its translation initiation region contains zzso repeats typical of zzso zzso We found that regulation of zzso and zzso is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso from filter binding and gel mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso binds specifically to a segment of the zzso transcript that includes the untranslated leader and translation initiation zzso While the affinities of zzso for the zzso and zzso transcripts are similar, zzso translation control of zzso is much more extensive than for zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso binding site consists of nine zzso repeats (five zzso three zzso and one zzso that surround and overlap the zzso zzso zzso sequence and translation start zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso translation experiments indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis by preventing binding of a zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results establish that zzso regulates translation of zzso by blocking zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulates zzso synthesis and transport by three distinct zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoting formation of the zzso zzso blocking zzso and blocking zzso binding to the zzso and zzso zzso
