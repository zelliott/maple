A detailed investigation of how zzso are formed and arranged on the DNA sequence is a prerequisite to understanding the molecular mechanisms of zzso processes such as transcription, zzso DNA repair, and zzso In this report we analyzed the zzso structure of zzso 5-8 of the zzso gene in human zzso We mapped at the zzso level the positions of zzso I and zzso zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso Areas of clear zzso I protection, which would be indicative of the binding of zzso zzso were not zzso Instead, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns suggested that this region was covered by zzso and that two areas spanning zzso 5 and 6 are occupied zzso These zzso could influence DNA damage distribution, repair of certain zzso and other aspects of the zzso process in zzso zzso
