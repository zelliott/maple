Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso bind to zzso zzso and that the zzso of these cells to high zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso binding occurs via recognition of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expressed on the high zzso zzso We have now extended these studies by determining the role of the zzso zzso alpha 4 beta 1 zzso and the alternative zzso zzso zzso in a rat model of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso to resting and zzso zzso zzso cultured high zzso cells zzso in a zzso manner with zzso zzso of zzso zzso completely blocked the zzso of rat zzso to immobilized zzso zzso and to a zzso soluble zzso form of human zzso zzso binding to zzso was also completely blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso to zzso and zzso zzso equally and its effect at 50% zzso was slightly less than that of zzso These findings suggest that a zzso zzso zzso expressed by high zzso is zzso The majority of cultured zzso expressed significant levels of zzso under zzso conditions, as did zzso in peripheral zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and the effects were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results described here demonstrate that rat peripheral zzso zzso zzso express zzso its expression is zzso by zzso in particular zzso and it supports the zzso of zzso zzso They also suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may operate during the zzso migration of zzso into zzso zzso Although the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso was not determined, these results show that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and therefore zzso on its own, cannot be used as a specific indicator of zzso zzso
