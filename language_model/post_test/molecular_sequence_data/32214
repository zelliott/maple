zzso infections caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso pose a constant threat to consumer health, with the pig being a particularly major source of zzso zzso zzso as a promising approach to reduce colonization and zzso has been scarcely used, as it interferes with current control programs relying on zzso as a means of zzso zzso In order to overcome this problem, we set out to develop a zzso vaccine allowing the differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals zzso zzso an zzso approach with two-dimensional gel zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso tandem mass zzso we identified the zzso protein as a suitable negative zzso Using zzso exchange, we generated an zzso zzso of the licensed live vaccine strain zzso and showed that zzso of zzso and that of the zzso strain, zzso were indistinguishable in zzso zzso In a pig infection experiment including two oral zzso with zzso and challenge with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso we confirmed the protective efficacy of zzso in zzso showing a significant reduction of both clinical symptoms and colonization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso spot array zzso Upon testing of several zzso zzso each including an zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso to zzso that facilitated the detection of infected animals independent of their vaccination status zzso zzso was zzso The approach described overcomes the problems currently limiting the use of bacterial live vaccines and holds considerable potential for future developments in the zzso
