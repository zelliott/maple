The binding sites of class II major zzso complex zzso molecules can accommodate many seemingly diverse zzso In the case of mouse class II zzso it appears that in general, the I-A and zzso zzso associate with different zzso In this study we report an example where a single zzso acid substitution in an zzso restricted zzso changes the restriction element to zzso A T cell zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso from mouse zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso was found to be restricted by zzso using class II zzso specific blocking zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso by Mt zzso zzso was competitively inhibited by other peptides that bind to the zzso zzso but not by the zzso Mt zzso zzso in which zzso at position 96 was zzso by zzso This single zzso acid substitution resulted in the ability of Mt zzso zzso to activate the pigeon zzso c specific, zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by Mt zzso zzso was inhibited by peptides which bind to the zzso zzso but not by Mt zzso zzso and by zzso specific for zzso but not by zzso specific for zzso These results suggest that the zzso acid at position 96 may be an important anchor zzso for both zzso and zzso binding but that peptides with different zzso acid side chains are zzso at that position by one or the other zzso class II zzso Thus, in this particular case a single zzso acid zzso in the peptides determines the zzso class II zzso zzso
