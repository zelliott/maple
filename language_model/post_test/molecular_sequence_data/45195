zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the unique zzso zzso of zzso coli reflects the dual function of zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The tandem pair of promoters is regulated by various mechanisms depending on the needs of both pathways and the maintenance of a zzso zzso zzso Here we focus on the zzso regions that impose the distribution of target sites for zzso proteins involved in zzso and zzso repression of the upstream promoter zzso We introduced deletions and zzso and combinations zzso in four zzso connecting the binding sites for integration host factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and studied the importance of phasing and spacing of the targets and the importance of the zzso sequence of the zzso The two zzso binding sites must be properly aligned and separated with respect to each other and to the promoter for both zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, the phasing and spacing of the zzso and zzso sites are strictly constrained but only for zzso zzso The zzso target is even zzso for zzso zzso Thus, a correct zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso complex is a prerequisite for the establishment of zzso repression and for the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Our data also suggest the existence of a novel zzso zzso regulatory target located around position zzso Finally, the analysis of a zzso zzso devoid of its control region has led to a zzso of the effect of excess zzso on zzso and has revealed that zzso has no need for a UP zzso
