We have determined the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso gene zzso the immediate early protein zzso which is involved in zzso zzso of later virus zzso The locations of the zzso and 3' zzso of zzso zzso together with the positions of two zzso were zzso zzso of the DNA sequence suggested that translation starts at the first zzso after the zzso zzso of the zzso and that both zzso occur in zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso and has a molecular weight of zzso It contains a zzso region resembling regions found in several proteins which interact functionally with zzso An zzso was raised to the predicted C terminal zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso and was shown to zzso the native protein from zzso cell zzso The functional importance of regions of the protein was evaluated by construction of zzso and deletion zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso were tested for zzso function by short-term zzso zzso and the results were correlated with the DNA sequence and zzso mapping zzso
