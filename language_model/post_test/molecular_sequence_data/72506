The mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified from zzso zzso complementary DNA and zzso into the zzso insect cell zzso and the zzso sequence was zzso zzso a zzso cell system, the zzso zzso acids zzso was expressed as a fusion protein with the zzso insect cell signal sequence at the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed by Western zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and a rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso These zzso detected two principal species of zzso one zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso of infected insect zzso More than zzso of these species were present in a zzso zzso zzso This fraction was then used to zzso under native conditions, zzso amounts of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso migrated as a homogeneous zzso band visible on zzso zzso gels and was confirmed by Western zzso We also zzso the zzso from total cell zzso under zzso conditions, followed by zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso amounts of soluble zzso were zzso This material consisted primarily of the zzso zzso form, but in addition contained four or five lower molecular mass, partially zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso with either zzso F or zzso reduced all zzso zzso species to a zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso preparations inhibited the binding of zzso to the full-length human zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells in a zzso manner, with similar zzso The affinity of such interactions was 3 orders of magnitude less than observed with native zzso zzso and was further reduced by unfolding the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were also recognized by zzso zzso in the serum of patients with zzso zzso zzso Such zzso binding to zzso was also markedly reduced by unfolding the zzso These results demonstrated the successful production of large quantities of well zzso biologically active, zzso zzso In addition, the data showed that although the zzso of the zzso bound zzso intact zzso may be required for high affinity zzso zzso Whether the zzso region is required for direct zzso zzso as seen for other G zzso zzso or whether it is needed to stabilize the zzso binding to the zzso and maintain a correctly folded state, remains zzso
