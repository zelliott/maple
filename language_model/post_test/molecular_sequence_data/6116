The zzso zzso signal in a full-length zzso clone of the zzso Venezuelan zzso encephalitis virus zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso transcripts derived from the resulting plasmids programmed the production of zzso particles upon zzso of baby zzso kidney zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso also gave rise to a small proportion of viable zzso Analysis of these biological zzso and their zzso cloned zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso at either zzso position 243 or E1 position zzso were able to restore viability to zzso zzso signal zzso The viable zzso incorporated zzso zzso into particles which showed normal zzso for zzso cells, but reduced ability to grow in zzso zzso zzso A zzso carrying a lethal zzso zzso signal zzso in combination with a zzso at E1 zzso was either zzso or highly attenuated in adult mice when zzso by the zzso zzso or zzso route and zzso complete protection against both zzso and zzso challenge with virulent zzso These results indicate the close functional association of the zzso and E1 proteins in the zzso zzso They also have implications for the design of zzso live virus vaccines for zzso for other zzso and for other viruses that use a similar mechanism for zzso zzso
