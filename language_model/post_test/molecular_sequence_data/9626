zzso zzso promotes the generation of a condensed, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity must be antagonized in order to convert zzso to a zzso competent, more extended zzso Using zzso virus 40 zzso as a model system, we now demonstrate that the zzso zzso protein zzso which is known to zzso associate with active zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso also partially zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Both the zzso enhancement and zzso activities of zzso are zzso through its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural activities of zzso are maintained upon replacement of the zzso zzso by zzso regions from either zzso or zzso These data support the model that the zzso C zzso of zzso is involved in unfolding zzso zzso structure to facilitate zzso zzso of zzso zzso
