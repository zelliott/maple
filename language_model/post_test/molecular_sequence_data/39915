A great many carefully designed experiments will be required to fully understand biological mechanisms in atomic zzso A complementary approach is to use powerful statistical procedures to rapidly test numerous scientific hypotheses using vast numbers of protein zzso cell's own zzso for specifying biological zzso zzso zzso of the evolutionary constraints imposed on functionally divergent proteins can reveal key components of the molecular machinery and thereby suggest likely mechanisms to test zzso This approach is demonstrated by considering how DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso couple DNA recognition to zzso zzso and clamp zzso
