zzso zzso zzso a clinical isolate from zzso was resistant to zzso group A antibiotics by zzso The strain zzso a zzso containing a zzso zzso responsible for this zzso this gene was cloned and zzso It zzso zzso a protein deduced to be zzso Da in mass and zzso with a new family of zzso zzso described in zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The similarity of zzso to other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, and to two putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso coli, was also observed in a region considered to be the zzso active zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso zzso A was necessary for zzso activity and that a single zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso Other members of the zzso A group such as zzso M and zzso were also zzso for the zzso We conclude that resistance to the zzso A group of antibiotics in zzso zzso zzso is due to zzso by an zzso related to the novel zzso zzso zzso
