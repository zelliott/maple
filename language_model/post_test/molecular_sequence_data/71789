The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso accumulates zzso as a zzso in response to elevated zzso zzso synthesis in this insect is zzso by an unconventional zzso zzso zzso that uses zzso to reduce zzso A zzso zzso the zzso from adult zzso zzso was cloned and zzso to determine the primary structure of this zzso The zzso zzso a protein of 352 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso shared zzso identity with sheep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso involved in zzso binding were zzso in the zzso zzso An important structural difference between the zzso zzso and zzso occurred in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso that coordinates the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso (including zzso was replaced by an Ala in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso also contained two neutral to zzso zzso within four zzso of the zzso to Ala zzso zzso modeling indicated that addition of the zzso zzso and loss of the zzso decreased the electric potential of the zzso zzso pocket, creating an environment favorable for zzso Because of the ability to use zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions, unlike zzso which function in zzso zzso
