zzso zzso were deployed on two zzso zzso vents at zzso zzso (27 degrees zzso 111 degrees zzso in order to measure in zzso temperatures at which zzso colonize the associated mineral zzso zzso sections of three structures that formed around the zzso were collected after 4 and 72 day deployments (named zzso zzso and zzso zzso diversity associated with discreet zzso collected across each deposit was determined by zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso diversity were observed in all deposits and appeared related to in zzso zzso In zzso no zzso zzso genes were detected beyond about zzso zzso within the sample zzso 200 degrees zzso zzso detected on the outside of this deposit belong to zzso groups containing zzso and zzso whereas only putative zzso were detected zzso zzso inside the structure zzso 110 degrees zzso In contrast, the more moderate zzso zzso recorded across zzso was associated with a deeper colonization zzso zzso inside the zzso of putative zzso zzso Although our study does not provide a precise assessment of the highest temperature for the existence of microbial zzso inside the deposits, zzso zzso zzso genes were detected directly next to zzso that measured 110 degrees C zzso zzso in zzso and 116 degrees C zzso in zzso The successive array deployments conducted at the Broken zzso zzso site also revealed compositional differences in zzso communities associated with immature zzso and mature zzso zzso formed by the same zzso These differences suggest a zzso transition in the primary carbon sources used by the zzso communities, with potential zzso zzso prevalent in zzso being replaced by possible zzso or zzso zzso and zzso in zzso This study is the first direct assessment of in zzso conditions experienced by zzso inhabiting actively forming zzso deposits at different stages of structure zzso
