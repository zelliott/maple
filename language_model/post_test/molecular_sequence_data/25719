A complete set of zzso and T zzso designed for the study of protein DNA interactions has been zzso These modified bases have been designed by considering the groups on the zzso and T bases that are accessible to proteins when these bases are incorporated into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rosenberg, zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1976) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 73, zzso Each of the positions on the two zzso having the potential to interact with zzso have been subject to zzso conservative zzso Typically a particular group zzso the zzso of zzso or the zzso of zzso has been replaced with a hydrogen zzso Occasionally zzso groups (the zzso and zzso oxygen atoms of zzso have been replaced with zzso The base set has been incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso at the central zzso zzso Melting temperature determination shows that the modified bases do not destabilize the double zzso Additionally, circular zzso zzso shows that almost all the altered bases have very little effect on overall zzso zzso and that most of the modified zzso have a zzso type zzso zzso is the recognition sequence for the zzso restriction modification zzso zzso rate zzso (at a single zzso concentration of 20 zzso have been carried out with both the zzso restriction zzso and modification zzso This has enabled a preliminary identification of the groups of the zzso and T bases within the zzso sequence that make important contacts to both zzso
