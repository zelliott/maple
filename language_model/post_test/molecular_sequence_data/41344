For important food crops such as wheat and rice, grain yield depends on grain number and zzso In rice zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a major quantitative trait locus for yield and encodes an zzso zzso zzso that zzso regulates grain zzso Wheat zzso zzso has zzso zzso in the A, B, and D zzso and zzso in zzso were associated with grain zzso Here, to investigate zzso function, zzso interference zzso was used to zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso wheat lines showed significantly decreased grain zzso dimensions compared with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso also caused a significant reduction in zzso cell zzso These results indicate that zzso regulates grain size in zzso possibly by controlling zzso cell zzso Wheat and rice zzso genes thus seem to have divergent functions, with rice zzso zzso regulating grain size and zzso positively regulating grain zzso Analysis of zzso of zzso zzso in developing grains suggested that zzso and zzso act in both the division and late zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and molecular analyses revealed that zzso is a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso A functional nuclear export sequence responsible for zzso export from the nucleus to the zzso and retention in the zzso was zzso zzso these results show that zzso acts in the regulation of grain size and may provide an important tool for enhancement of grain zzso
