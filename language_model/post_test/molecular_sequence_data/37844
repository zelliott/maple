zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso of bovine zzso The unique composition of zzso zzso it from zzso and zzso zzso zzso because five of zzso 13 zzso are zzso zzso Solid phase synthesis of zzso gave rise to a minor byproduct that possessed unusual zzso and zzso zzso properties compared with authentic zzso The byproduct was zzso by combined zzso exchange and reversed phase high pressure liquid zzso steps and was shown be identical to authentic zzso in its zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mass analysis of the byproduct revealed a zzso mass unit reduction compared with zzso suggesting the zzso of two zzso side chains to form an zzso zzso zzso We confirmed the nature of the zzso zzso termed zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequence zzso zzso degradation revealed that zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso was partially resistant to zzso with zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso a subset of molecular zzso that are zzso resistant but that are absent in the native zzso
