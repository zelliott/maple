Environmental signals can be zzso into zzso responses by the action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in the transient zzso of a zzso zzso which in turn activates certain zzso factors and thus a set of zzso zzso Many steps in this cascade are zzso and zzso have been discovered from zzso to zzso We have characterized the zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso The zzso protein shares the highest similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene in zzso zzso results in a slower growth rate, the formation of more zzso zzso altered zzso zzso an zzso of zzso formation and a block of zzso zzso The gene is zzso activated during asexual development and controls the zzso of two putative zzso zzso
