zzso zzso zzso is an important cause of sudden death in apparently healthy young zzso In less than half of zzso with zzso the disease is linked to the zzso zzso gene locus zzso We have recently described two zzso zzso gene zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to Val zzso and found that the zzso message is present in skeletal muscle zzso and that the zzso zzso obtained from zzso muscle has abnormal in zzso zzso zzso Having identified a second zzso with the zzso zzso and 3 other zzso with two additional zzso zzso and zzso we performed zzso analysis of zzso muscle zzso from 25 zzso patients with one of these four zzso Light microscopic examination of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of central core disease zzso of skeletal muscle, a rare zzso dominant zzso zzso characterized by a predominance of type I zzso fibers and an absence of zzso in the center of many type I zzso zzso was present in 10 of 13 patients with the zzso zzso 5 of 8 patients with the zzso zzso 1 of 3 patients with the zzso zzso and 1 patient with the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes with muscle fiber zzso were present in 16 zzso zzso zzso was present in 2 adults and 3 children with the zzso zzso who did not have cardiac zzso In contrast, zzso muscle samples from 5 patients from 4 zzso in which zzso was not linked to the zzso locus showed no zzso or zzso zzso muscle zzso from 5 control subjects also showed normal zzso This work demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso is often a disease of zzso muscle but with zzso cardiac involvement and zzso a subset of zzso patients with zzso gene zzso zzso have zzso
