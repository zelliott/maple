The zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso has been isolated and its complete zzso zzso sequence zzso A set of zzso zzso zzso deduced from zzso acids which are zzso in a number of zzso zzso were zzso and used to amplify a zzso zzso This zzso zzso was used as a probe to isolate a zzso zzso zzso derived zzso A region of this zzso zzso zzso was zzso and revealed that the zzso gene was located zzso to zzso This sequence was then used to design a set of inverse zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso was cloned which contained the region zzso to zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso was determined from overlapping zzso It revealed that the zzso zzso was preceded by a zzso structure and the promoter appears similar to most zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso bacterial zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso is under tight regulation and a dramatic induction of zzso synthesis occurs within 15 zzso after heat zzso
