zzso and zzso of the alkaline zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso and zzso zzso Over half of newly zzso zzso was zzso by 6 zzso Over zzso of zzso activity which was external to the zzso membrane was located in the zzso zzso zzso of 55, 52, 44, 36, and 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso from zzso cell extracts by rabbit zzso raised against mature, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso H indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained about 2 zzso of zzso zzso and that the zzso and zzso zzso contained zzso zzso of zzso experiments did not fit a simple zzso relationship of zzso In fact, maximum labeling intensity of the zzso zzso occurred later than for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso of 19 and 20 zzso derived from the zzso of zzso indicated that one major processing zzso was zzso The gene coding for zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The sequence and the zzso results suggest that zzso is originally zzso with an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso definitely involves zzso after pairs of basic zzso acids and the addition of one zzso zzso Signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and at least one additional zzso zzso may also be zzso
