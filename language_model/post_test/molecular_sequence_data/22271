zzso zzso are produced by zzso species, zzso zzso and various zzso zzso zzso The zzso modify the zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso In structural studies of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified that appears to be involved in zzso specificity and recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Exchange of zzso which is a key zzso of the zzso to zzso in zzso from zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso activity toward zzso The zzso protein is still capable of zzso and possesses zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins specifically at an zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso a model zzso for many zzso zzso is modified by the zzso zzso Also in zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso the exchange of the equivalent zzso zzso to zzso blocked zzso modification of zzso but zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso resulting in decrease in zzso activity of the zzso zzso The data indicate that the exchange of one zzso acid zzso in the zzso turns the zzso zzso of the zzso family into zzso zzso
