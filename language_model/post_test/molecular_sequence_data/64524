The persistent expression of zzso zzso activity has previously been demonstrated not only in adult forms, but also in zzso muscle larvae of zzso zzso and zzso zzso pointing to an unusual pattern of cell cycle regulation, and prompting further studies on the zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso was cloned and zzso allowing the characterization of a single open reading frame of 307 zzso acids coding for a putative protein of zzso Da molecular zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso the consensus zzso tree built and its stability zzso The zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso was confirmed by the zzso activity of the zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso As compared with the zzso zzso from muscle larvae, it showed apparently similar zzso value, but higher zzso values zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With the coding region used as a probe, zzso zzso zzso levels, relative to zzso zzso were found to be similar in muscle larvae, adult forms and newborn larvae, in agreement with muscle larvae cells being arrested in the cell zzso
