The molecular basis of active zzso transport in zzso zzso such as the prostate is not well zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso colon surface cell zzso zzso and thus is referred to as zzso Here we show that the zzso is expressed in zzso prostate complex in a zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses indicate that rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein are present in zzso zzso zzso zzso and lateral and zzso prostate and absent from zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso is present in all zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso and zzso and gastric zzso zzso are not present in significant amounts in all prostate zzso Relatively low levels of zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso protein expression is zzso highest in zzso zzso somewhat lower in zzso zzso and even lower in lateral zzso zzso protein abundance has the reverse order: expression in zzso lobe is higher than in zzso zzso zzso protein abundance is higher in zzso zzso than zzso colon zzso zzso shows that in rat and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso protein has an zzso polarization and zzso zzso is localized in zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in zzso prostate zzso zzso may indicate its involvement in zzso concentration regulation in zzso of these zzso
