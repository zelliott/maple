zzso group is one of the most promising targets for detecting zzso contamination in water zzso principally due to its zzso zzso and high zzso in feces of zzso zzso We developed real-time zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic markers zzso zzso and zzso A reference collection of DNA extracts from 143 individual zzso samples and wastewater treatment plant zzso was tested by the newly established zzso The zzso limits of zzso zzso and zzso markers in environmental water were 54, 57, and 12 zzso zzso It was possible to detect possible zzso zzso from wild ducks in environmental water with the constructed genetic marker zzso even though the density of total zzso in the identical water samples was below the detection zzso zzso marker was amplified from feces of wild duck and chicken with the positive ratio of 96 and zzso respectively, and no zzso was observed for the other animal zzso zzso marker was detected from zzso of chicken feces, while detected from zzso of cow feces, zzso of pig feces, and zzso of swan zzso zzso marker was detected from zzso of wild duck feces and zzso with zzso of cow zzso These levels of detection specificity are common in zzso genetic markers previously proposed, which implies that there is a practical limitation in the independent application of zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic markers and a combination with other zzso contamination markers is preferable for detecting zzso contamination in water zzso
