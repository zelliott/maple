Raw zzso of zzso eggs was either subjected to linear electron beam zzso at approximately zzso zzso dosage or not zzso Both zzso and zzso egg zzso samples were stored at zzso C after zzso Testing was conducted on 0, 1, 7, 15, 30, and 60 d of zzso Development of storage zzso zzso was delayed in zzso samples after 7 zzso which suggests that less structure was developed in zzso egg zzso than in zzso egg zzso during zzso zzso samples retained more soluble protein within the first 7 d and showed slightly improved emulsion capacity over that from zzso zzso However, zzso egg zzso was less bright than zzso zzso No differences were observed in zzso patterns of soluble proteins and zzso low density zzso zzso The LDL isolated from zzso liquid egg zzso showed no difference in zzso zzso acids compared to that of zzso egg zzso indicating no zzso zzso of zzso However, the zzso temperature of zzso samples at Day 0 shifted about 1 C lower than that of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that electron beam zzso did not cause significant physical, chemical or functional changes of egg zzso or zzso of egg zzso zzso zzso electron beam zzso could serve as a preservation method for liquid egg zzso
