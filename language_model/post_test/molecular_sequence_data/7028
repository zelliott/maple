zzso membrane proteins of approximately 17 zzso have been suggested to play a role in the zzso activity of zzso based on zzso their pattern of induction in zzso and zzso cell lines and zzso the ability of a membrane fraction enriched in zzso proteins to inhibit cell zzso To gain insight into the nature of the proteins that mediate the zzso activity of zzso a zzso zzso zzso was generated that reacted specifically with a zzso zzso cell surface zzso The expression pattern of this zzso protein by human cell lines correlated with sensitivity to the zzso activity of zzso To obtain information regarding the structure of this zzso the zzso zzso was used to screen zzso cells zzso with a human zzso expression zzso zzso analysis of a full-length zzso clone revealed identity with the zzso zzso previously isolated on the basis of its zzso zzso by differential zzso In addition, the zzso protein zzso by the zzso gene was shown to be identical to the zzso zzso zzso was previously identified as a zzso zzso protein in zzso and zzso cells and is a component of a zzso complex involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a novel level of cellular regulation by zzso involving a membrane zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso which associates with other proteins at the cell surface, forming a complex relaying growth zzso and zzso zzso
