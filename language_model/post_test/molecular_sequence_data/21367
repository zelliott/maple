The emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis poses a serious concern globally and researchers are in rigorous search for new drugs to fight against these dreadful zzso Recently, the bacterial zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso has been identified as an important drug zzso A unique zzso zzso tail, essential for survival and the absence of gene in host makes zzso a suitable target for inhibitor zzso 

This study describes the models developed for predicting zzso activity zzso of chemical compounds against zzso protein using zzso and zzso zzso These models were trained on 84 diverse compounds zzso zzso taken from zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were zzso in the active site of the zzso domain of zzso protein zzso using the zzso A zzso model was developed using zzso energies as zzso and achieved maximum correlation of zzso zzso between actual and predicted zzso zzso zzso models were developed using molecular zzso calculated using various software packages and achieved maximum correlation of zzso zzso Finally, hybrid models were developed using various types of zzso and achieved high correlation of zzso zzso between predicted and actual zzso It was observed that some molecular zzso used in this study had high correlation with zzso We screened chemical libraries using models developed in this study and predicted 40 potential zzso zzso These zzso could be used to develop drugs against zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso energies can be used as zzso for developing zzso zzso The current work suggests that zzso energies based zzso could be used along with commonly used molecular zzso for predicting zzso activity zzso of molecules against zzso Based on this study an open source platform, zzso has been developed for predicting zzso zzso
