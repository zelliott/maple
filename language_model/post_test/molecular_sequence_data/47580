zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Two forms of the zzso named zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso were zzso from the zzso zzso by heat treatment and column zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso beta gave a single protein band with a molecular mass of 10,500 zzso on zzso zzso alpha is mostly composed of the same molecular mass protein as zzso zzso Both forms were zzso towards other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso but had no effects on zzso and zzso Both forms inhibited the processing of the zzso inactive zzso of zzso zzso to the activated mature zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta shared many other features such as molecular mass determined by gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso revealed that three zzso acid zzso were different in the zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso all others being zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor increased activity approximately zzso to fivefold at the time of spinning and maintained this level of activity during zzso
