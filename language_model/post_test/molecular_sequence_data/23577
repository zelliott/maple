The zzso zzso is highly expressed during kidney and lung zzso zzso mice display abnormal zzso development suggesting that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso it would be of considerable interest to understand the zzso structure, zzso and sequence variation of the zzso zzso Using FISH and zzso database analysis, we show that zzso gene maps to zzso zzso and consists of zzso zzso organized into 30 zzso zzso of 47 individuals from two different ethnic groups zzso and African zzso identified zzso varying zzso The diversity of zzso is comparable to that of other regions within the human zzso Eight of the varying sites were located in the coding zzso six resulted in zzso zzso of which two lead to zzso changes in zzso None of the sites showed significant zzso from zzso zzso We mapped the coding region single zzso zzso zzso onto a model of the predicted zzso structure and found all the zzso were located in the zzso of the zzso zzso In the European population, the linkage zzso statistic zzso showed three blocks of relatively zzso regions in the zzso gene while the African population showed more evidence of zzso The observed patterns of the linkage zzso statistic zzso suggest that a large number of sites will need to be zzso to ensure coverage of the entire gene for genetic association zzso Identification of the sequence variation will allow genetic association studies of zzso in kidney and lung zzso
