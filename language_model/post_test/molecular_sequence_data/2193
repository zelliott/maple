zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso and zzso by rod zzso cells into the zzso zzso and is known to bind zzso and fatty zzso We have used zzso clones zzso human zzso to isolate a zzso zzso zzso that encompasses the complete human zzso zzso The zzso gene spans more than 11 zzso and is interrupted by three zzso all of which are positioned near the zzso of the coding zzso The zzso pair coding region of zzso appears to have been generated by zzso of an approximately 900 base pair long ancestral zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence predicts a mature protein of zzso zzso zzso molecular weight zzso The protein sequence can be aligned into four zzso zzso each consisting of about 300 zzso zzso similarity between segments is as high as zzso when conservative zzso are taken into zzso Two putative zzso zzso sites are located in highly zzso zzso in the center of the first and second segment of zzso A domain consisting of 41 zzso at the zzso end of the third segment has 15 matching zzso zzso with an zzso loop of zzso a zzso protein in rod zzso
