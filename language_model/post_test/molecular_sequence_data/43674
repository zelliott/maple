A global zzso of all currently known protein sequences is zzso Every protein sequence is zzso into segments of 50 zzso acid zzso and a dynamic programming distance is calculated between each pair of zzso This space of segments is initially embedded into zzso zzso The zzso that we apply zzso every finite metric space into zzso space so that zzso the dimension of the host space is small, zzso the metric distortion is zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso is then applied to the embedded space with zzso zzso We monitor the zzso of our zzso by randomly splitting the data into two parts and performing an zzso zzso zzso independently on each zzso At every level of the hierarchy we zzso the clusters in one part with the clusters in the zzso The resulting zzso tree of clusters offers a new representation of protein sequences and families, which compares favorably with the most updated zzso based on functional and structural data about zzso Some of the known families clustered into well distinct zzso zzso and zzso such as the zinc finger, zzso hand, zzso zzso and others are automatically correctly identified, and relations between protein families are revealed by examining the splits along the zzso This zzso leads to a novel representation of protein families, from which functional biological kinship of protein families can be zzso as demonstrated for the zzso zzso Finally, we introduce a new concise representation for complete proteins that is very useful in presenting multiple zzso and in searching for close relatives in the zzso The zzso method presented is very general and applies to any data with a consistent and zzso measure of similarity between data zzso
