It has recently been demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce a strong protective immunity after direct zzso in various experimental zzso T zzso from Fischer rats zzso with the zzso zzso zzso were cultured in zzso in the presence of seven synthetic peptides derived from the zzso acid sequence of the zzso The most significant and zzso proliferation was obtained with the zzso and zzso synthetic zzso In order to analyze whether these located zzso were also exposed to the zzso immune system during the natural zzso zzso infection or after zzso with crude zzso extracts of various development stages of the zzso the zzso responsiveness of infected or zzso Fischer rats and zzso mice was tested towards these synthetic zzso The results showed that, in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthetic peptides are recognized during the course of infection and that there is a dynamic variation of this zzso These peptides are also recognized by T cells educated against crude zzso extracts of different zzso stages of the zzso which contained the native form of the zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicated that these synthetic peptides derived from the zzso zzso zzso can activate T zzso educated against the native zzso zzso during the development and maturation of the zzso in their zzso zzso they might be useful for the construction of synthetic vaccines against zzso
