zzso new zzso in the structural gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein have been isolated, mapped using a powerful zzso genetic system and their DNA sequence changes zzso The zzso were generated by zzso treatment of the cloned gene on a zzso expression zzso zzso the activity of the zzso protein produced from this zzso and screening for zzso zzso were accomplished by the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in soft zzso to produce infectious zzso zzso zzso in the cloned gene have been constructed by a two step procedure involving zzso zzso zzso and in zzso deletion by restriction zzso zzso The zzso whose physical zzso were determined by DNA sequencing, define 12 genetic and physical intervals into which the new zzso were mapped by marker rescue zzso These deletions were transferred to zzso zzso by zzso and used to map zzso carried on zzso Following zzso the zzso change for each of the zzso was determined by DNA zzso The majority were absolute zzso zzso although both amber and zzso nonsense zzso were also identified in the protein coding portion of the zzso The suppression pattern of the nonsense zzso was determined on several nonsense zzso Four of the zzso cause severely depressed levels of zzso protein expression from both the cloned gene on the zzso expression zzso and from zzso zzso carrying these zzso These zzso were identified as zzso changes in what is probably the zzso late zzso zzso zzso which immediately follows the zzso protein coding zzso
