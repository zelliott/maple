zzso evidence is presented in support of the longstanding but unproven hypothesis that B zzso specific for self zzso zzso can be used in the immune response to foreign zzso We show that the B cells in zzso zzso responding early to pigeon zzso c zzso produce zzso that recognize and bind the major zzso site on mouse zzso with greater affinity than they bind pigeon zzso zzso they are zzso for the self zzso Furthermore, these B cells express the same combination of zzso variable region zzso genes that are known to be used in zzso recognition of mouse zzso Over time, the response to pigeon zzso becomes more specific for the foreign zzso through the recruitment of B cells expressing different combinations of V genes and, zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso specific B cells from early in the zzso zzso of pigeon zzso by mouse zzso B cells results from the sharing of critical zzso acid zzso by the two zzso Although zzso recognition of the self zzso mouse zzso is very specific, which limits the extent to which foreign zzso can zzso the zzso B cells, it is possible that zzso B cells to other self zzso may be used more frequently in response to foreign zzso
