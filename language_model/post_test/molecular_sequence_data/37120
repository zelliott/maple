zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to form zzso and zzso groups, essential in several zzso zzso The availability of zzso structures of zzso from zzso organisms and information produced by the zzso projects prompted the analysis of the adaptation of zzso to zzso zzso such as high temperatures, by exploitation of structural data from zzso zzso The sequences of 10 zzso zzso were multiply aligned to 53 zzso zzso and analyzed by a comparative approach, examining the zzso acid compositions and preferred zzso exchanges between zzso and zzso The structural basis of the observed exchanges was further investigated through the application of zzso modeling to the 10 zzso zzso The results of this study indicate that, in zzso zzso stability can be achieved mainly through three zzso zzso increased number of charged zzso at the protein surface; zzso increased zzso of the protein zzso and zzso substitution of zzso zzso exposed to the zzso Additional features of the zzso zzso for which no structural data are available yet, were also investigated to explain their zzso zzso and the interaction with modified zzso
