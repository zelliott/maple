Three zzso promoters with the consensus sequences in the zzso and zzso regions and the 17 zzso zzso made of random, zzso and of both these classes of AT DNA simultaneously were constructed and cloned into zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of restriction fragments containing these promoters indicated that zzso of the latter was zzso to the number of zzso AT DNA zzso The strength of these promoters in zzso measured in relation to an internal zzso standard was shown to correlate well with gel zzso of the respective restriction fragments and to decrease with the number of potential DNA zzso sites zzso in the promoter zzso
