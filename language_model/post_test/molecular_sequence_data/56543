The zzso zzso is the largest reported zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso with as many as 14 possible members based on variation in reported DNA zzso A study of the zzso organization of four distinct zzso genes indicated that they contained within their zzso the uninterrupted zzso repeat zzso with zzso zzso zzso DNA amplification zzso and conditions were determined which amplified the zzso of these four different zzso gene zzso All four zzso genes tested showed length zzso when examined in a group of unrelated zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing showed that the zzso of each gene differed in size by multiples of two base pairs zzso due to different repeat numbers of the zzso zzso These four zzso zzso had from three to ten zzso and individual zzso of zzso to zzso The large number of zzso and the high zzso make these zzso chain reaction zzso zzso very attractive genetic markers for segregation studies which zzso the presence of zzso zzso genes within the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso DNA confirmed the relatively large size of the zzso zzso in several zzso zzso zzso sequencing of an zzso of the zzso genes from other primates revealed the presence of zzso repeats similar to those found in human zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso was not only present in the zzso zzso before zzso gene duplication, but was present before zzso of the zzso
