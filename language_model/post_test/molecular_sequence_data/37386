zzso is responsible for the production of zzso 2 zzso which functions in zzso zzso as a zzso signal that controls the cell zzso expression of the zzso zzso In zzso organisms, the zzso role of zzso is not zzso We report that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso results in reduced growth of the zzso but not the zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew to high cell density when zzso under zzso zzso In addition, the zzso strain grew to high cell density under iron limitation after transformation with a zzso containing a functional copy of zzso zzso of real-time zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso transport zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expressions of putative receptors for zzso zzso and zzso binding protein were also reduced at more modest levels zzso to zzso In contrast, expressions of zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso zzso were increased zzso and zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso To better understand the mechanism of the zzso response, the zzso zzso zzso was searched for zzso of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso was found to be most similar to zzso zzso To determine whether zzso plays a role in the response of zzso zzso to zzso an zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso grew poorly under zzso conditions but grew normally under zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso failed to grow zzso under iron zzso and reverse zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso resulted in decreased expression of zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso exhibit similar zzso when cultured zzso under iron zzso and both zzso exhibit reduced expression of a common set of genes involved in the transport and storage of zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may act in concert to control the adaptation of zzso zzso to zzso conditions and its growth under such zzso
