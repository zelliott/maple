DNA zzso required for mating type zzso switching in zzso zzso is initiated by zzso zzso The zzso event is regulated by zzso zzso elements and by several zzso factors, including zzso (for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were previously shown to function in dictating zzso zzso DNA replication by controlling replication fork movement around the zzso region and, second, by pausing fork progression around the imprint zzso With zzso studies, we investigated whether the zzso factors function indirectly or directly by binding to the zzso zzso zzso First, we report the identification and DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso is not essential for zzso and, like the other factors, it exerts a zzso effect on zzso Second, we showed that only zzso and zzso interact to form a zzso complex and that complex formation did not require their binding to a DNA region defined by the zzso zzso Third, we found that the zzso complex physically binds to a region around the imprint site where pausing of replication zzso Fourth, the protein complex also zzso with the zzso polar zzso of replication zzso These results suggest that the zzso effect of zzso and zzso on switching and zzso occurs through interaction of the zzso complex with the zzso zzso
