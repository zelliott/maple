The zzso pattern of the plasma membrane from tobacco was studied by two-dimensional gel zzso When using classical carrier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso approximately 400 zzso spots were detected after silver zzso and computer analysis using the zzso zzso This resolution was sufficient to assess zzso effects such as changes in a zzso zzso By using pH zzso immobilized pH zzso zzso and zzso zzso gels, approximately 600 zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the total population expected, were zzso This zzso of the plasma membrane zzso population was mainly constituted by low or intermediate molecular mass zzso to 45 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After sample application by zzso zzso large amounts of plasma membrane protein (between 5 zzso and 10 zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso and zzso protein sequencing was performed for zzso collected from one zzso Internal protein sequences were also zzso Nearly all protein sequences corresponded to unidentified proteins but several of them matched translated sequences from unidentified plant expressed sequence tags zzso It is concluded that the combined use of zzso gels and zzso zzso zzso in the case of plant membrane zzso both zzso and zzso zzso with an efficiency comparable to that demonstrated for soluble zzso Finally, it is suggested that a systematic investigation of plant plasma membrane zzso is feasible and would constitute a source of new and zzso zzso
