zzso zzso produces four genetically and structurally distinct antibiotics in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso globally deficient in zzso production zzso zzso have previously been isolated, and some of these were found to define the zzso zzso In this study, we isolated zzso DNA and show that it encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso III zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that the zzso zzso global zzso in zzso synthesis is due to a zzso in zzso zzso In marker exchange experiments, the zzso zzso zzso gene rescued zzso zzso restoring zzso zzso zzso the DNA of zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso lay in the zzso open reading zzso Constructed disruptions of zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused an zzso zzso An zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso zzso as had previously been reported for zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso gene is widely zzso in zzso We speculate on why an zzso III zzso could globally affect the synthesis of zzso
