The zzso gene was identified as a zzso gene in excised zzso of zzso We determined the sequences of some zzso zzso with different structures and zzso zzso clones for zzso This gene consisted of three zzso and there were at least three types of transcript, which seemed to be generated by alternative zzso of the second zzso None of the zzso transcripts included a long open reading frame zzso We isolated a zzso of zzso zzso with cucumber zzso zzso as a zzso This zzso for a gene designated zzso also lacked a long zzso A region of 180 zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso of cucumber and the zzso zzso of zzso although the zzso was relatively low when the entire sequences were zzso Each zzso region consisted of seven zzso and seems to form stable secondary zzso These suggest that zzso zzso may function as an zzso that is not translated into a zzso
