zzso algae acquired their zzso by the secondary zzso zzso of a zzso red zzso Several other zzso lineages acquired zzso through such an event zzso but zzso are distinguished by the retention of a relic red zzso nucleus, the zzso zzso The zzso (and its absence in other zzso can reveal a great deal about the process and history of zzso but only if we know the relationship between zzso and other algae, and this has been zzso Several recent analyses have suggested a relationship between zzso of zzso and some or all other red zzso lineages zzso but we must also know whether host nuclear genes mirror this relationship to determine the number of zzso events, and this has not been zzso We have carried out an expressed sequence tag zzso survey of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of 102 zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso acid alignment zzso show a robust zzso relationship between zzso and the zzso algae, which also have a red secondary zzso This relationship demonstrates that loss of zzso must have taken place in zzso independently of any other red zzso lineages and that the zzso of both already contained a red zzso zzso
