The genes that control development of embryonic zzso are poorly zzso Although zzso factor zzso is expressed in neural crest zzso cells, its role in development of embryonic zzso and other neural crest derivatives is unclear because mouse zzso zzso die before zzso We show that zzso zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso zzso complete early zzso normally and have neural crest zzso zzso of zzso which encodes the zzso for the Steel zzso is reduced in these zzso and, similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso are reduced in number and zzso The effects of zzso zzso injected into zzso and zzso zzso zzso support the notion that zzso works through zzso and additional target genes to mediate zzso cell number and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are small and zzso and unexpectedly, analysis of mosaic zzso suggests zzso regulates zzso differentiation through cell zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso we document reduction of other neural crest derivatives in zzso zzso zzso including jaw cartilage, enteric zzso and sympathetic zzso These results reveal that zzso regulates multiple steps of zzso development, and is required for development of other zzso and zzso neural crest zzso
