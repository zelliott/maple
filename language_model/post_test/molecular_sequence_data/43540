We report zzso analyses of zzso the zzso essential zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso factor zzso zzso A systematic family of zzso zzso was generated, and these zzso zzso zzso were introduced into zzso in both single and multiple copies to test for their ability to complement a zzso zzso zzso and support cell zzso All zzso proteins were zzso expressed in zzso The zzso tests indicated that a large portion zzso acids 208 to zzso as well as zzso acids zzso to zzso of zzso is required to support cell zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso analyses showed that two zzso deletions which remove portions of zzso zzso acids 2 to 115 dramatically decrease the ability of these zzso zzso proteins to bind zzso zzso bearing either of these two zzso zzso zzso also exhibit a zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso of zzso can correct this growth zzso as well as increase the amount of zzso interacting with zzso in zzso Our results provide the first combined genetic and zzso evidence that zzso binds to zzso zzso in zzso through zzso zzso sequences and that this binding is zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso binding zzso the affinity of the interaction of zzso for the zzso zzso domain of zzso was measured, and the zzso was found to be about 1 zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso domain of zzso actively zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso
