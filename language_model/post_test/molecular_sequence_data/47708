The role of the zzso region of zzso zzso I in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction was studied with three deletion zzso of its zzso zzso 1) complete zzso 2) the zzso domain zzso and 3) the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso force and relaxation were performed in zzso skeletal muscle fibers whose zzso zzso (along with zzso and zzso was displaced with high zzso of added zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fibers with a zzso complex restored the zzso sensitivity of zzso however, the levels of relaxation and force development zzso zzso of the fibers zzso 8) was drastically impaired with two of the zzso region deletion zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso retained approximately zzso relaxation when zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso skeletal muscle fibers was enhanced with all zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Interestingly, all three zzso of zzso increased the zzso sensitivity of zzso None of the zzso deletion zzso when zzso into zzso could inhibit zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and two of them zzso and zzso gave significant zzso in the absence of zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso is much more critical for the biological activity of zzso than the zzso region, consisting of zzso zzso Presumably, the zzso domain of the zzso region of zzso is a part of the zzso molecular switch during muscle zzso
