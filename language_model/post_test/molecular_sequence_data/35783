We have developed a strategy for efficient sequence analysis of the zzso of zzso coli K-12 using insertions of a zzso zzso into overlapping ordered zzso zzso clones to provide universal zzso sites, and zzso amplification of DNA segments adjacent to the zzso zzso clones were selected by blue plaque formation on a zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso points every zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso and segments between the zzso zzso and zzso arms were amplified by zzso zzso using one zzso and one zzso zzso Single strands of amplified DNA fragments were coupled to zzso zzso beads zzso zzso through their zzso tails, zzso zzso and used as templates for zzso automatic zzso zzso
