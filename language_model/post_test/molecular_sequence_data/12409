Type II zzso arthritis zzso is an animal model of inflammatory zzso with clinical and pathological features resembling zzso arthritis zzso We compared the expression of T cell zzso zzso V beta genes in T cells isolated from the inflamed zzso draining zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso mice zzso during the early phase of zzso We also investigated the profiles of zzso gene expression in T cells obtained from the same zzso We found that the expression of zzso V beta zzso in zzso zzso of mice, during the early phase of the disease was limited to zzso V beta 3 and 10 gene zzso In contrast, zzso V beta 4, 7, and 15 were zzso in the draining zzso zzso zzso and zzso V beta 2, 6, and 14 were zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequence analysis revealed that the T cell populations in the zzso zzso were zzso as determined by the limited zzso region diversity observed in the zzso zzso These results zzso for the first time, that zzso joint zzso T cells in zzso V beta a zzso mice use a restricted repertoire of zzso V beta zzso zzso there was zzso expansion of zzso T cells in zzso zzso in mice with zzso zzso Our results on zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso of zzso mice indicate that zzso T cell derived zzso may be the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as illustrated by the presence of transcripts for zzso and zzso but not zzso In zzso our results provide evidence that T cells with restricted zzso and more zzso zzso type T cells, are crucial in the early phase of collagen induced arthritis in zzso
