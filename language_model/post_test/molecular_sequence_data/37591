A few bacterial species are known to produce and zzso hydrogen cyanide zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso c zzso and several other zzso In the producer zzso zzso does not appear to have a role in primary metabolism and is generally considered a secondary zzso zzso zzso of zzso (especially fluorescent zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso producing zzso and zzso The zzso structural genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have sequence similarities with genes zzso various zzso acid zzso in particular with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso genes of zzso zzso by oxygen limitation requires the zzso zzso regulator zzso an zzso recognition sequence in the zzso region of the zzso promoter, and zzso amounts of zzso In addition, expression of the zzso genes depends on a regulatory cascade initiated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This regulation, which is typical of secondary zzso zzso itself during the transition from exponential to stationary growth zzso Cyanide produced by zzso zzso strain zzso has an ecological role in that this zzso accounts for part of the zzso capacity of strain zzso which suppresses zzso diseases on plant zzso Cyanide can also be a zzso of zzso in some zzso bacteria that have not been described as zzso However, in this case, as well as in other situations, the zzso function of cyanide is zzso
