We report a new zzso of alpha satellite DNA zzso which is found on all the human zzso zzso The zzso nature of the cloned DNA was established by partial zzso Southern analysis of restriction zzso DNA fragments from zzso hybrid cells containing only human zzso 21 showed that the zzso zzso repeating unit for zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso in zzso zzso profile derived from 13 normal individuals revealed the zzso of zzso of all zzso zzso grains over the five zzso zzso with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso 13, 14, 21, 15 and 22 zzso An average of zzso of grains was found on the zzso of each of the remaining 19 zzso zzso These results indicate the presence of a common zzso of alpha satellite DNA on the five zzso zzso and suggest an evolutionary process consistent with zzso exchange of sequences between the zzso The results further suggests that such exchanges are more selective for zzso 13, 14 and 21 than for zzso 15 and zzso The possible role of zzso alpha satellite DNA in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso involving the common and zzso association of zzso 13 and 14, and 14 and 21 is zzso
