zzso is a zzso zzso hydrocarbon and a zzso intermediate of the plant hormone zzso In flowering plants, zzso is zzso from zzso zzso zzso by two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recently, the moss zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and functionally zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces both zzso and zzso from zzso via zzso zzso Here, we cloned and analyzed the function of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso reaction of zzso to produce zzso but not zzso even though the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences share zzso zzso To determine the regions and zzso acids involved in zzso formation, we analyzed the zzso functions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso When the zzso region of zzso was exchanged with the zzso zzso region, the zzso zzso produced only zzso The replacement of zzso zzso with Met or zzso produced a zzso zzso that converted zzso to zzso as the sole zzso In contrast, replacing zzso with zzso zzso or zzso did not affect the zzso product profile as much as replacement of zzso of zzso by zzso Thus, the zzso and size of the side chain zzso at the zzso zzso acid zzso is responsible for zzso the zzso zzso by the addition of a water zzso
