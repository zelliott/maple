By zzso screening of a zzso library derived from zzso of zzso zzso with zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso and allergic manifestations, we isolated a protein identical to zzso zzso zzso The zzso named zzso has close zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso f 6) and with human zzso Using zzso zzso with a zzso zzso specific to zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in sheep zzso zzso Of the 58 zzso from patients with zzso 29 zzso were zzso positive to zzso zzso despite the high sequence zzso none were zzso positive to Mal f 6 or human zzso Only 26 of the 58 patients zzso had zzso specific to zzso whereas all patients zzso had zzso specific to Mal f 6 and human zzso zzso analysis showed that serum zzso zzso to zzso differed significantly in patients with and without allergic reactions (20 of 25, zzso versus nine of 33, zzso P zzso zzso zzso five of the 25 patients who had zzso allergic manifestations zzso and 21 of the 33 who did not zzso had specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso to zzso zzso induced a zzso response in 15 of 19 zzso patients' zzso regardless of the allergic manifestations, but it induced no zzso zzso Overall, these findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that does not zzso with zzso from other organisms and is involved in the allergic symptoms related to zzso
