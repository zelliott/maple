Inner zone zzso zzso is a protein specifically expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso of the adrenal zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be identical to that zzso the previously reported putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso From its structure, zzso was zzso as a member of a protein family containing a zzso domain, and zzso was proposed to be a zzso of this zzso Indeed, when zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso the zzso zzso had a brown zzso with maximum zzso at 400 zzso The addition of zzso shifted the zzso peak to zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso The possible role of zzso in zzso has been zzso and the zzso of adrenal zzso by the addition of an zzso zzso zzso has been zzso When zzso cells were transformed with plasmids for appropriate zzso zzso in the presence or absence of an zzso expression zzso and tested for their zzso activities, zzso of zzso was found to be specifically activated by zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, the available evidence suggests that zzso may have an important role in the functions of the adrenal zzso zzso and zzso
