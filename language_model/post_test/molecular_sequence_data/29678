zzso zzso is an important cause of zzso and gastrointestinal disease in horses and dogs in the zzso United zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso is rarely definitive because production and identification of zzso structures is zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for the identification of P zzso zzso DNA was extracted from 3 clinical zzso of P zzso and I isolate each of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The ITS I region of the zzso zzso gene of each isolate was amplified and zzso and the zzso sequences were aligned with published sequences for zzso zzso P zzso and P zzso A pair of P zzso zzso zzso and zzso were designed from variable regions within the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was developed in which the 1st round amplified the zzso region by use of universal zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso the internal P zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso was tested with DNA extracted from cultures of the zzso 10 clinical zzso of P zzso and 1 isolate each of P zzso P zzso P zzso P zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a single zzso pair zzso for each of the P zzso zzso but did not produce zzso for any of the other zzso zzso of this study suggest that zzso is a useful tool for the identification of P zzso
