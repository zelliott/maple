zzso zzso strains typically express both smooth zzso zzso with O zzso molecules and capsule zzso (K zzso on the zzso A single zzso in a gene that codes for a zzso zzso zzso zzso renders a strain with the zzso zzso zzso of capsule and zzso without O zzso molecules and outer core zzso The zzso gene was present in all the zzso zzso strains zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were unable to produce experimental urinary tract infections in rats and were completely zzso in two different animal models zzso and zzso zzso of the single zzso zzso gene in the corresponding zzso completely restored the zzso zzso zzso of capsule and smooth zzso independently of the O or K zzso of the wild zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso recovered the ability to produce experimental urinary tract infections in rats and zzso in the zzso and pneumonia animal zzso
