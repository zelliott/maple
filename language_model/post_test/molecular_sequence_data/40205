Recently, the systematic use of the molecular approach as a complement to the other approaches zzso biology, life zzso has brought help for the identification of species considered as different in the past to be zzso and zzso and distinctions to be drawn between species similar at the zzso zzso Among these species, we tried to clarify the situation of zzso zzso and zzso 1994, species that today include more than 50 zzso notably coming from zzso stages isolated from intermediate hosts belonging to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were isolated in France and zzso from various zzso before being zzso with their zzso by molecular analysis of various fields such as the zzso and ITS of the zzso DNA and the zzso of zzso zzso We thus show the presence of two zzso depending on the specificity of their intermediate host in which they were isolated zzso zzso or zzso zzso thus allowing separation of the species zzso zzso that had been described in the past as a probable new zzso
