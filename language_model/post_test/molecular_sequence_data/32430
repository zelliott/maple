The zzso assembly checkpoint zzso zzso the timing of zzso transition and is essential for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso strain zzso carries a deletion within the zzso gene that results in death of the zzso strain after two or three zzso Here we describe 11 zzso of the zzso zzso 10 identified in an zzso zzso zzso zzso screen and 1 isolated using the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso imaging of early embryonic cells and zzso zzso division, we demonstrate that there are two classes of zzso Eight zzso compensate for the loss of the checkpoint by delaying zzso zzso which zzso with zzso zzso zzso three zzso have normal zzso levels and normal zzso zzso Furthermore, in the class of zzso with delayed zzso zzso we have identified four zzso of known zzso zzso and zzso which are components of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have identified another zzso component capable of bypassing the checkpoint requirement that has not previously been described in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso significantly delays zzso onset both in zzso and in early embryonic zzso
