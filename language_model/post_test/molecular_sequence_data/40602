The transport activity and zzso specificity of two zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso regions zzso first 125 or 184 zzso and the rest of the zzso zzso zzso (up to the total protein length of zzso zzso were compared with those of the two native zzso Both zzso zzso were functional upon expression in zzso zzso cells, their presence improved the ability of cells to grow in the presence of high external concentration of zzso zzso or zzso (as zzso but not in the presence of the smallest zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the ability of zzso to export zzso and showed their significantly reduced transport capacity compared to the zzso zzso Despite the very high level of primary sequence identity zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso various parts of these proteins are not zzso without affecting the zzso transport zzso
