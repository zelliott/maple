zzso zzso zzso is a bacterial zzso involved in DNA repair and zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of two zzso large zzso and small zzso Thus far, little was known about the molecular structure of zzso the interactions between zzso and zzso the architecture of the zzso active site or its mechanism of zzso We used zzso methods to predict the structure of zzso which revealed four zzso an zzso zzso domain, a middle zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain and a short zzso zzso By series of deletion and zzso zzso experiments on zzso from zzso coli, we determined that the zzso domain is responsible for DNA zzso the zzso domain is involved in binding multiple copies of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the middle domain are important for the zzso activity but not for DNA zzso Altogether, we propose a model of zzso relationships in zzso
