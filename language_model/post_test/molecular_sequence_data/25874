zzso zzso copies of cucumber mosaic virus zzso zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso strain were constructed from partial zzso clones and were cloned downstream of zzso zzso zzso In one pair of zzso zzso proceeded from an zzso zzso promoter such that in zzso transcripts representing zzso 1 and 2 contained an additional 17 zzso at their zzso zzso In a second pair of zzso the zzso zzso junction was altered by zzso zzso such that the in zzso transcripts contained only an additional G zzso at their zzso zzso In addition, a full-length zzso copy of zzso zzso 3 was constructed from two overlapping zzso clones and was cloned downstream of an altered zzso promoter such that the zzso in zzso transcripts also contained only an additional G zzso at their zzso zzso In zzso transcripts derived from all clones contained an additional C zzso at their 3' zzso In zzso transcripts representing zzso 1, 2 and 3 which contained an additional zzso at each zzso were shown to be infectious together in several hosts of zzso
