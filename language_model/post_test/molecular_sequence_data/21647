The zzso zzso of the cardiac sodium channel zzso is an essential protein in the initial zzso phase of the zzso action zzso zzso modifications such as zzso are known to regulate zzso zzso Here, we used a zzso approach for the study of the zzso modifications of zzso using zzso cells as a model zzso We generated a stable cell line expressing zzso zzso the sodium channel, and analyzed zzso by zzso and zzso We report the identification of zzso zzso as a novel zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso between zzso I and II in zzso were found in zzso or zzso zzso The functional relevance of zzso zzso in zzso is underscored by the fact that zzso and zzso are known zzso zzso causing zzso and long zzso type 3 zzso zzso Our work describes for the first time zzso zzso in the zzso zzso channel zzso
