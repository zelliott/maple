zzso zzso zzso primarily expressed in the zzso plays an important role in the regulation of energy zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrate increased fat mass, higher feeding efficiency, zzso and mild zzso At least one specific zzso of zzso has been identified to be associated with human zzso zzso analysis of this altered zzso zzso has indicated that the zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the specific molecular zzso of zzso responsible for zzso binding and zzso signaling are currently zzso The present study is to determine the structural aspects of zzso responsible for zzso binding and zzso zzso On the basis of our theoretical model for zzso using zzso we have examined 19 zzso domain zzso acids selected for these potential roles in zzso binding and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of charged zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso domain 2 zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso dramatically reduced zzso binding affinity and zzso zzso zzso zzso of aromatic zzso acids zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso also significantly decreased zzso binding and zzso activity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso resulted in the complete loss of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and cell surface protein zzso and zzso interestingly, substitution of zzso in zzso with zzso or zzso switched zzso zzso into a zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso and zzso are important for zzso zzso while zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso are crucial for zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso in zzso is critical for zzso or zzso zzso These results provide important information about the molecular zzso of zzso responsible for zzso binding and zzso zzso
