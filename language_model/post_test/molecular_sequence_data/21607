zzso is one of the most widely used wide spectrum zzso zzso zzso In environment, zzso can undergo either zzso or zzso reaction to form zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is as toxic and as persistent as its parent zzso In the present study, zzso degrading bacteria were isolated from soil through selective enrichment technique using sulfur free medium with zzso as sole sulfur zzso Out of the 8 isolated bacterial zzso strain zzso was found to be the most efficient zzso zzso degrading zzso zzso and zzso zzso The bacterial strain was identified as zzso zzso strain zzso on the basis of zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was also found to degrade zzso zzso zzso using it as sulfur zzso No known zzso were found to be formed in the culture media during the entire course of zzso Besides, the bacterial strain was found to degrade all the known zzso zzso There was marked increase in the quantity of released zzso from the culture media with zzso as sulfur source as compared to zzso suggesting that the bacterial strain, zzso zzso strain zzso probably zzso zzso completely through the formation of zzso zzso
