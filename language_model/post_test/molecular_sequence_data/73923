zzso zzso zzso activity zzso is believed to be the zzso factor zzso by zzso to stimulate zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso Among the four zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene is strictly expressed in zzso localized to the synaptic region of the zzso To understand mechanisms of the regulation of zzso transcription, we studied the promoter activity of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso gene in response to zzso zzso containing the wild type or zzso zzso regions upstream of a zzso gene were zzso in zzso muscle zzso The promoter activity of these zzso was determined by zzso activity of expressed zzso zzso a combination of zzso deletion and zzso zzso we identified a zzso element zzso zzso which was crucial for zzso expression from the zzso zzso zzso This element was named ARE for zzso zzso zzso of ARE greatly diminished zzso zzso expression and deletion of ARE abolished completely the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analyses revealed a DNA binding activity in muscle nuclear extract that zzso with zzso Such interaction was enhanced by zzso stimulation of muscle cells and appeared to be dependent on nuclear protein zzso
