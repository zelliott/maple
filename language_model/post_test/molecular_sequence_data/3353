zzso is an zzso activity responsible for the final zzso of the zzso precursor protein leading to the production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely an zzso zzso since its activity can be inhibited by both zzso and zzso directed zzso zzso zzso Recent work has indicated that zzso 1 and 2 may actually be the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which lead to an increase in the production of a longer form of zzso are also the most common cause of familial Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso in an attempt to better characterize the zzso preferences of zzso we performed experiments to determine how zzso zzso in zzso would affect the generation of zzso peptides from full length precursor zzso that we have previously demonstrated to be zzso zzso at alternative sites and/or by zzso activities that are zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the production of zzso peptides from sites zzso to the primary zzso site zzso zzso and in several cases also decreased production of zzso zzso These results support a model in which the zzso zzso subtly alter the zzso of the zzso complex to favor the production of long zzso
