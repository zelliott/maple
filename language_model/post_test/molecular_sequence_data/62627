zzso regulation plays an essential role in development and often involves factors that interact with sequences in the 3' untranslated region zzso of specific zzso For example, zzso protein at the zzso of the zzso zzso directs zzso development, and this zzso requires selective translation of zzso localized zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso translation requires zzso protein bound to the zzso 3' zzso which zzso the translation of zzso zzso zzso While the function of 3' zzso zzso regulators is, in general, poorly zzso they presumably interact with the basic translation zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso interacts with the Cup protein and that Cup is an zzso protein that blocks the binding of zzso to zzso Cup mediates an indirect interaction between zzso and zzso and zzso function in zzso requires zzso Thus, zzso zzso translation via a zzso block in zzso zzso
