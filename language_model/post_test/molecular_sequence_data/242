A zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderately zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a sand soil sample collected from Xinjiang Province, China, and was characterized by using a zzso zzso zzso This isolate grew zzso at zzso degrees C and pH zzso It grew with zzso zzso zzso 0-2 zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso was closely related to members of the zzso zzso exhibiting the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarities to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso acid in the zzso zzso was zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso These zzso results supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso However, low zzso zzso values and distinguishing zzso characteristics allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of strain zzso from recognized zzso zzso On the basis of the evidence zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso AB zzso zzso
