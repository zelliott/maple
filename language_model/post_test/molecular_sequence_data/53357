Many zzso zzso display a modular structure in which a zzso module is attached to one or more zzso zzso Several zzso contain a module of previously unknown function zzso zzso zzso that had been implicated in zzso We have investigated the properties of two such zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso These zzso expressed either as discrete entities or as their natural zzso with the zzso zzso were zzso and their capacity to bind various carbohydrates and zzso zzso activity was zzso The data showed that zzso but not zzso increased the activity of the zzso against zzso zzso and bound specifically to zzso and various zzso In contrast, zzso exhibited no affinity for soluble or zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso site of zzso zzso approximately four zzso zzso The protein exhibited zzso values in the low zzso range for zzso zzso and zzso 24 zzso for zzso and 50 zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso values indicate that the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso is driven by zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso has been solved by X-ray zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso The protein is a zzso that presents a zzso and two zzso zzso on the walls of a shallow zzso that is likely to be the zzso zzso In view of the structural and zzso properties of zzso it is proposed that this and related zzso be zzso as family 22 zzso zzso
