zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso act as zzso channels transporting calcium zzso from the zzso zzso to zzso by forming zzso and are proteins localized to the zzso zzso zzso Despite the absence of classical zzso zzso calcium channeling occurs at the zzso zzso We have investigated putative calcium binding motifs in these zzso zzso methods indicate the presence of six zzso zzso in the zzso domain, one of the three zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The recently identified crystal structure of the zzso channel, which also forms zzso revealed that two zzso zzso an additional pore zzso and a selectivity filter are responsible for selective zzso zzso zzso The last three TM zzso of zzso and zzso are particularly well zzso and we found analogous pore zzso and selectivity filter motif in these zzso We obtained a three-dimensional structural model for the zzso zzso by zzso the distant structural similarity to the zzso zzso
