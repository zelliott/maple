zzso domain VI of zzso zzso receptors plays an important role in zzso binding and zzso zzso A human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed significantly enhanced zzso zzso binding zzso and G protein zzso The zzso are located at the top of zzso domain VI and about two zzso turns above zzso and zzso which are important for zzso binding and zzso zzso To determine the functional role of individual zzso of zzso and zzso we created stable A9 L cell lines expressing zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed greater potency at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso higher potency at zzso receptors than at zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso the concentration found in zzso modified zzso zzso exhibited zzso stimulation at zzso receptors but was inactive at zzso zzso In zzso binding experiments, zzso of zzso resulted in significantly increased zzso binding zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso did not change zzso binding affinity but rendered multiple zzso binding sites, and the zzso binding was sensitive to zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso is responsible for enhanced zzso potency and binding zzso whereas the zzso zzso alters G protein zzso The data suggest that zzso and zzso are potential targets for zzso of zzso binding and G protein zzso
