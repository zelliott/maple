zzso possess a zzso zzso apparatus that resembles that of zzso Here we report the zzso crystal structure of the zzso zzso factor complex formed by the zzso protein zzso the zzso factor zzso zzso and a DNA target, all from the zzso zzso zzso The overall fold of these two zzso zzso factors is essentially the same as that of their zzso zzso However, in comparison with the zzso complexes, the zzso zzso interface is more symmetrical, and in this structure the orientation of the zzso complex assembly on the promoter is zzso with respect to that seen in all crystal structures of comparable zzso zzso This study of the structural details of an zzso zzso factor complex presents the opportunity to examine the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso apparatus from a zzso viewpoint and to extend our understanding of the physical zzso of zzso zzso
