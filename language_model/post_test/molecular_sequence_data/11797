A zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso I containing two additional zzso in a loop next to zzso has been expressed in zzso coli, zzso and characterized zzso zzso studies suggest that the inserted zzso and zzso side chains of the modified loop sequence zzso could contact the bases 3' to the zzso bond in the major groove of a bound DNA, and that up to 10 zzso could interact with the zzso and potentially influence its cutting zzso The loop zzso zzso has an zzso lower specific activity than zzso and shows overall zzso characteristics similar to bovine pancreatic zzso zzso Compared with the zzso zzso the zzso shows a strongly enhanced preference for cutting the zzso zzso zzso see zzso or close zzso zzso Unexpectedly for a minor groove binding zzso the preferred cutting sites in opposite strands are staggered by 1 zzso in the zzso direction, causing the zzso of a zzso and a zzso step, zzso This finding demonstrates that the sequence context is relatively more important for the cutting frequency than the nature of the zzso step of the zzso bond, and clearly shows that base recognition is involved in determining the sequence selectivity of the zzso The importance of the sequence zzso to the zzso bond for the cutting rate suggests that the additional major groove contacts may require a distortion of the DNA associated with a higher energy barrier, resulting in an increased selectivity for flexible DNA sequences and a lower overall activity of the zzso zzso
