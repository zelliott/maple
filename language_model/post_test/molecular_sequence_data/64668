The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso plays an important role in maintaining zzso pH and zzso zzso zzso has a zzso structure composed of integral membrane and zzso tail zzso zzso of a zzso of approximately 40 zzso zzso zzso that is localized in the zzso area of its zzso tail caused cell growth zzso in highly saline conditions, possibly by decreasing zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene of this growth zzso was identified from a zzso zzso zzso The clone encodes a novel membrane protein zzso as zzso in the zzso data zzso zzso or deletion of zzso increases or decreases zzso cell growth, zzso However, in zzso cells, zzso of zzso alone did not suppress the growth zzso zzso and a zzso portion of zzso interact with the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso is zzso with zzso from zzso cell zzso zzso mainly resides at the zzso but zzso of zzso caused a portion of the zzso proteins to shift to the zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso is a novel membrane protein that can enhance zzso cell growth by interacting with the zzso domain of zzso and thereby possibly zzso the zzso activity of this zzso
