The zzso family of molecular water channels is widely expressed throughout the plant and animal zzso No bacterial zzso are zzso however, zzso bacterial genes have been identified that zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso a novel zzso DNA zzso was identified that contained no surface zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not identified in zzso zzso by Northern analysis and exhibited bacterial zzso usage zzso Southern analysis failed to demonstrate zzso in zzso zzso DNA, whereas a strongly zzso DNA was present in zzso DNA from zzso coli and other bacterial species and did not zzso to zzso The zzso DNA isolated from zzso coli contained a zzso pair open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso identical to known zzso When compared with other zzso zzso encodes a zzso insert preceding zzso loop C, truncated zzso and zzso zzso and no zzso at known zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increase in zzso water zzso which was zzso after 5 days of zzso was not inhibited with zzso exhibited a low zzso energy zzso zzso zzso zzso and failed to transport zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso expressing zzso transported zzso but exhibited limited zzso water zzso zzso comparison of zzso and zzso revealed a large separation between zzso and zzso consistent with an ancient gene zzso
