Members of the zzso family of zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known to function as zzso zzso To identify zzso proteins that might regulate zzso gene zzso we have characterized a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were expressed in all zzso zzso zzso suggesting the gene influences processes common to many cell zzso Like all zzso family members, zzso contains a zzso zzso domain related to the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso Two features found in the zzso of zzso regions rich in zzso and zzso regions, were also identified in most zzso family zzso zzso sequences capable of binding with high affinity zzso zzso to a zzso zzso protein containing the zzso zzso were isolated by using an zzso zzso protocol zzso The consensus sequence zzso of the zzso binding element zzso is related to, but distinct from, the 3' end of the zzso zzso response zzso The characterization of zzso and potential zzso site will assist efforts to assess the extent and mechanism by which zzso genes are regulated at a zzso zzso
