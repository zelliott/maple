The zzso (AP) sites, the major zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced directly by zzso stress and indirectly after zzso of damaged bases by DNA zzso are repaired by zzso zzso Among two zzso in zzso zzso zzso provides the major zzso activity, and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso provides zzso zzso We have cloned zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso and have shown that zzso of zzso and not zzso zzso this zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso agents, which is further enhanced by zzso zzso We also show that zzso present in zzso but not in zzso provides the zzso zzso activity together with zzso We confirmed the presence of zzso activity in zzso zzso and in crude cell zzso Thus zzso is distinct from zzso and is similar to zzso cells in having zzso as the major zzso
