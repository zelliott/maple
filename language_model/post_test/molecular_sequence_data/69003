zzso zzso also known as zzso or zzso is a major zzso zzso that bears the newly identified zzso zzso The aim of this study was to clone zzso zzso and investigate other forms of zzso present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from above mentioned cells were reverse transcribed zzso using specific zzso for zzso and amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso the different amplified zzso derived zzso fragments, spanning the whole coding and zzso regions, showed the near identity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Southern zzso with zzso amplified zzso originating from zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso showed a zzso amplified zzso zzso zzso zzso that was present in zzso and zzso but not on zzso on zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso indicated the presence of a major zzso zzso and a minor zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript was the only one observed on Northern blots of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that the structure of zzso expressed in zzso is similar, with the exception of the 3' zzso region, to that of zzso zzso in apparent molecular weight between zzso and zzso zzso may be due to zzso zzso
