The analysis of proteins by mass zzso imaging is an important biomedical application as spatial zzso can be used to identify markers for pathological zzso The direct detection and identification of proteins on tissue can be hindered by a number of factors including limited mass range and fragmentation efficiency as well as zzso with zzso zzso 

To overcome some of these limitations, zzso zzso of proteins was followed by detection of the resulting zzso zzso was applied by a zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso imaging experiments were performed with a zzso zzso imaging source attached to a zzso zzso mass zzso The mass accuracy under imaging conditions was better than zzso zzso This allowed for confident identification of zzso peptides by comparison with liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso of an adjacent mouse brain zzso 

A spatial resolution of zzso was obtained for zzso peptides on zzso Several zzso peptides of zzso showed matching spatial zzso and numerous zzso peptides of other proteins were zzso zzso images were generated with a bin size zzso range used for image zzso of zzso zzso Examples demonstrate that zzso images with lower selectivity can result in misleading information about the spatial distribution of zzso zzso 

The presented method combines a significantly improved spatial resolution for zzso peptides with zzso mass accuracy in a single experiment and thus provides highly reliable and specific zzso
