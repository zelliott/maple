From zzso to translation, zzso is zzso with zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso that mediate zzso processing, export from the nucleus, and delivery into the zzso Although the mechanism is unknown, export of mature zzso from the nucleus is a critical regulatory step in gene zzso zzso of zzso proteins have shown that many of these proteins are required for this essential cellular zzso In this study, we characterize the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was first identified as a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Swanson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso Our work indicates that zzso zzso export from the nucleus is dependent upon a functional zzso zzso zzso export of zzso from the nucleus is dependent upon ongoing zzso zzso II zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is modified within its zzso domain by the type I zzso zzso zzso Our experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso is required for the export of zzso from the nucleus and therefore establish an in zzso effect of this zzso Overall, these experiments provide evidence that zzso is an zzso protein that is required for zzso zzso export and whose export from the nucleus is regulated by zzso
