Cellular zzso is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest in which normal cells at the end of their lifespan fail to enter into DNA synthesis upon serum or growth factor zzso We examined whether proteins required for zzso cell cycle progression were zzso zzso in zzso human zzso Both the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso protein were expressed at similar levels in young and zzso zzso In contrast to young cells where both forms were zzso on zzso in response to serum, the zzso was not zzso zzso upon serum zzso whereas zzso was zzso on zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein in growing, zzso and zzso cells revealed no significant differences in levels between the different growth zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso A zzso were completely zzso in zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso C, zzso and E zzso were still expressed in zzso zzso cells although at reduced levels compared to young zzso The expression of early zzso zzso but not late zzso zzso indicates that zzso cells may be blocked at a point in late zzso We investigated whether zzso of zzso A, alone or in combination with zzso was sufficient for extension of lifespan or escape from zzso zzso expressing the zzso human zzso A or zzso genes zzso at a population doubling similar to controls, thereby showing that zzso A or zzso expression alone was insufficient for escape from zzso
