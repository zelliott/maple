Two zzso zzso targeted against the zzso gene of mouse zzso virus zzso which consisted of zzso zzso zzso core sequences and zzso sequences of different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested for zzso zzso effects on viral zzso zzso that expressed the zzso were zzso into mouse zzso cells and several resulting cell lines zzso expressing the zzso were selected and examined for zzso zzso zzso in acute and chronic stages of zzso The production of infectious progeny viral particles was significantly reduced in the zzso cell lines expressing either the zzso or zzso in acute zzso Although the in zzso zzso process of the zzso was slower than that of the zzso no difference was observed in zzso effects on zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso cells expressing zzso production of viral particles was also inhibited in the chronic stage of zzso zzso
