Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can treat clinical signs of experimental zzso zzso zzso and induce long-term T cell tolerance against zzso zzso In the current study, we produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso construct zzso suitable for use in zzso mice that develop zzso disease after injection of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso given zzso or zzso but not empty zzso or free zzso zzso zzso prevented relapses and significantly reduced clinical severity of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso mice, but did not inhibit zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso peptides in zzso mice, or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso RTL treatment of zzso caused stable or enhanced T cell proliferation and zzso of zzso in the zzso but reduced zzso of inflammatory zzso and zzso In zzso there was a modest reduction of inflammatory cells, reduced expression of very late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso but enhanced expression of zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso RTL therapy zzso a zzso switch that zzso the zzso potential of zzso zzso T cells without fully preventing their entry into zzso wherein they reduce the severity of zzso This mechanism differs from that observed using zzso RTL therapy in other zzso zzso These results strongly support the clinical application of this novel class of zzso class II zzso in patients with multiple sclerosis who have focused T cell responses to known zzso zzso zzso
