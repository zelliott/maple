zzso cloning and screening yielded a zzso clone corresponding to a zzso expressed in activated T cells, called zzso At the protein level, zzso a zzso member of the zzso zzso was found very zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, the hinge region included the zzso zzso completely zzso for both molecules and in mice and zzso By zzso mice with a human zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso which enabled to establish the zzso of the protein zzso and 40 zzso under reduced and zzso conditions zzso and its preliminary tissue zzso Also, zzso and zzso were very similar at the message and at the gene structure zzso The corresponding genes had previously been found to zzso on mouse zzso zzso and on human zzso zzso We show that they can be found on the same zzso artificial zzso bearing human zzso DNA, and that they are 25 to 150 zzso zzso These marked zzso and gene proximity strongly suggest that zzso and zzso are the direct products of a zzso event, and raise the question of the function of zzso
