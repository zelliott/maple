zzso is a key component of plant zzso The number of independent origins of zzso species traditionally has been zzso The objective of this study was to ascertain the number of origins of a zzso zzso zzso We screened 84 primer sets to identify zzso primer sets for the zzso wheat relative zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sets zzso and zzso were U zzso and zzso was a C zzso zzso DNA sequence comparison of the zzso locus was used to estimate the number of zzso events in the formation of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso data revealed at least two independent zzso of zzso zzso In the zzso hotspot region, located between genes zzso and zzso sequence analysis suggested that at least three zzso origins might have occurred zzso zzso zzso appears to be a zzso derived from multiple origins with minimal zzso change after its zzso
