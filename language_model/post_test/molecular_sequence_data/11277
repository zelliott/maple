Introduction of molecular zzso technology into an Australian zzso reference laboratory has resulted in the identification of three zzso of zzso zzso in the past 12 zzso Conventional zzso methods failed to identify the species of these zzso and zzso liquid zzso found that only one of the three zzso had a zzso acid pattern similar to that of the type zzso In contrast, all three zzso were rapidly identified as zzso zzso by zzso zzso gene sequence zzso Two zzso were recovered from the zzso zzso of children with cervical zzso confirming the zzso of this zzso However, the third isolate was obtained from the zzso of an elderly male with chronic lung disease without evidence of clinical or zzso zzso suggesting that isolation of zzso zzso should not imply zzso With the increasing use of molecular zzso technology in zzso laboratories, zzso zzso may be recognized more frequently as a pathogen or zzso zzso
