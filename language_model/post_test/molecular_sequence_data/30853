The C1 zzso of zzso zzso acts via 14 or more distinct zzso This zzso zzso its own synthesis as well as the synthesis of other gene zzso Previously, zzso of an auxiliary regulatory zzso zzso has been shown to increase expression of some zzso zzso genes zzso zzso but to decrease expression of others zzso zzso In this study the zzso gene was isolated on the basis of its ability to zzso stimulation of zzso coli zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso if and only if a source of C1 was zzso C1 alone, but not zzso alone, was partially zzso The zzso sequence encodes an zzso reading frame that begins with a zzso zzso and includes the sites of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso fusion genes was partially zzso in trans by a zzso zzso zzso or by zzso C1 alone, which was in agreement with effects on zzso zzso and with previous indirect evidence for zzso zzso zzso of both fusion genes by zzso C1 plus zzso or by a zzso zzso zzso was more zzso When the C1 source also included a zzso region upstream from C1 which encodes the zzso zzso repression of both zzso and zzso by C1 alone or by C1 plus zzso was much less effective, as if zzso zzso with C1 zzso zzso
