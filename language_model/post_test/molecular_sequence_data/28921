Using a functional zzso approach, we have identified and characterized a zzso form of zzso P from zzso zzso This study represents the first characterization of an insect zzso zzso The complete sequence of a zzso zzso zzso clone from zzso zzso showed the presence of a zzso zzso ORF, zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was zzso identical and zzso similar to rat and human zzso zzso zzso zzso acids important for zzso activity and the metal binding zzso were found to be zzso between zzso zzso and its zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso the zzso terminal zzso bond of substance P and zzso revealing its functional zzso Further zzso characterization showed the zzso to be a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is located exclusively in the zzso and is temporally regulated during zzso zzso In the adult fly, the protein could be detected in gut, zzso and zzso with a high level of expression in zzso
