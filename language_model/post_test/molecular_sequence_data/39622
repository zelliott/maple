The vast quantities of publicly available DNA sequencing data and zzso resources are enabling biologists to investigate age-old problems in biology that were not zzso zzso In this review, we discuss how comparative zzso is practiced and how the data can be used to make biological zzso with respect to zzso evolution and zzso Examples are taken from the well-known zzso zzso which are always a zzso target for zzso analyses due to their zzso role in the evolution of zzso In addition, we briefly discuss the application of zzso approaches to problems in comparative zzso
