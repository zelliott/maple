zzso zzso are major zzso responsible for zzso cell growth and for promoting cell zzso The zzso zzso protein presented here blocks in the cells the established zzso zzso and stimulates DNA zzso probably in zzso with more specific growth factors or zzso The zzso structure is closely related to that of zzso zzso intermediate zzso but the zzso is a zzso or sometimes a zzso which is zzso into the serum, where it is frequently bound to zzso Its specific biological functions are carried by the beta zzso and can be found on the two terminal zzso of the zzso the zzso properties being located mainly on the zzso The zzso zzso zzso possesses the same biological functions as the native one, since it zzso the zzso zzso state both in human and in mouse cell zzso On the contrary, zzso raised against zzso acids zzso located on the zzso domain of zzso inhibit this zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso and zzso zzso because of their opposite biological functions, are in balance and are part of a feedback system operating the regulation of normal zzso In pathological cases, zzso could play a role in the development of tumors, as we have found in juvenile zzso or in AIDS zzso
