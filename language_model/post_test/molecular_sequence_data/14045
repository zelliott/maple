The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso T was cloned by functional zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso double zzso The zzso sequence revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence showed similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene but not to the zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso T level was zzso in cells grown in rich medium compared to zzso zzso However, when the culture entered the zzso phase the zzso level increased in rich medium and decreased in minimal zzso By comparing the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene product with translated zzso sequences in various zzso evidence for the existence of putative zzso genes in the zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso
