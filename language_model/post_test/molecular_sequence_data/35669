We constructed derivatives of the zzso coli zzso zzso F that carry altered sequences in place of the major transfer zzso promoter, zzso Replacement of zzso with a zzso sequence resulted in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that could still express zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso on Western zzso On a second zzso zzso we replaced zzso with a zzso zzso late promoter zzso In hosts carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso properties of zzso could be regulated with zzso After zzso zzso transferred at the zzso frequency, expressed normal numbers of zzso and zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso No adverse effects on cell viability were apparent, and additional zzso could easily be crossed onto zzso A zzso deletion zzso had no effect on the zzso transfer zzso zzso of cam into zzso resulted in a zzso zzso which, after zzso exhibited the same zzso associated with other zzso zzso it could also be zzso by expression of zzso in zzso With zzso or its zzso we were able to label specifically the products of zzso genes located throughout the long zzso zzso by using zzso This feature can be used to investigate transfer protein interactions and to follow changes in these proteins that are associated with zzso mating zzso
