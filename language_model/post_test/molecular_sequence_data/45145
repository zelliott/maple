In order to detect and identify ubiquitous zzso raft marker zzso we isolated zzso zzso from different mouse zzso including the liver, zzso large brain, and zzso and analyzed their proteins via zzso Many protein spots were determined to be ubiquitous in all of the zzso zzso and were zzso via zzso and zzso Twelve proteins were identified as ubiquitous raft zzso and most of these were determined to be zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso c zzso Via zzso these proteins were shown to exist in zzso zzso zzso prepared using different organ zzso Since these zzso respiratory chains and zzso zzso complex were detected in zzso zzso raft zzso which had been isolated from the plasma membrane but not from the zzso and found in the cell surface when determined by zzso and zzso we conclude that plasma membrane zzso zzso might contain zzso respiratory chains and zzso zzso zzso
