The zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso syndrome zzso zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso have been mapped to the zzso region of the mouse X zzso and positioned with respect to other zzso zzso in this region using a total of zzso progeny from two separate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso the order of zzso and evolutionary zzso zzso has been established as zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso region of the human X zzso short arm, the position of evolutionary zzso with respect to key zzso has been established as zzso zzso These data have enabled us to construct a high-resolution genetic map for the approximately zzso zzso between zzso and zzso on the mouse X zzso which encompasses 10 zzso This detailed map demonstrates the power of high-resolution genetic mapping in the mouse as a means of determining locus order in a small zzso region and of providing an accurate framework for the construction of physical zzso
