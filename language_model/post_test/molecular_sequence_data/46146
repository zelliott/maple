zzso kidney zzso zzso with a supporting cell layer resulted in the rapid proliferation of various types of zzso including immature zzso Expressions of marker genes for multiple blood cell lineages were observed in the primary zzso However, after several passages, the zzso cells expressed only T cell and zzso marker zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that the zzso cells expressed zzso constant regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not express zzso and zzso Additionally, in zzso zzso analysis showed that the majority of zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso sequences of zzso variable regions zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso cells contained a zzso T cell repertoire, and most of the zzso and zzso sequences were functional, but the zzso and zzso sequences were zzso with frame shifts and stop zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso cells after serial passages predominantly contained zzso zzso zzso cells that simultaneously zzso zzso zzso To obtain zzso zzso cell zzso T zzso zzso single cells were picked up from the bulk culture, seeded into each well of zzso plates and cultured in the presence of supporting cells and zzso zzso T cell colonies formed from single cells after 2-3 zzso These colony cells expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expressed zzso but did not express zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, these results indicate that these zzso T cells resemble a zzso of zzso zzso helper T zzso
