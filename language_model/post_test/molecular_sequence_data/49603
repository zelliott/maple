The survival of zzso zzso the zzso agent of Sleeping zzso and zzso is facilitated by the expression of a dense surface coat of zzso zzso proteins in both its zzso and zzso fly zzso We have characterized zzso zzso zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex that adds zzso zzso anchors onto nascent zzso zzso of zzso (to give zzso resulted in the absence of zzso proteins from the cell surface of zzso form zzso and zzso of a pool of zzso zzso zzso some of which are surface zzso zzso zzso while viable in culture, were unable to establish infections in the zzso zzso confirming that zzso proteins are essential for zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso with zzso form zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso surface zzso and cell death with a defined zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicative of a block in zzso These data show that zzso proteins are essential for the viability of zzso form zzso even in the absence of immune challenge and imply that zzso is important for proper cell cycle zzso
