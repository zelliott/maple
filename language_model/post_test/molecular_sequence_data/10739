A zzso widely expressed gene of at least 30 zzso and six zzso was discovered via a hybrid zzso resulting from an inversion causing zzso zzso A segment of the zzso message of this gene has been shown by others to zzso a protein (named zzso interacting with the product of the von zzso gene and thus is expected to participate in pathways involving this tumor zzso zzso The mouse zzso message we isolated encodes a zzso of 160 zzso absolutely identical to that of zzso Even the 3' untranslated tails of the zzso show zzso zzso and both use the unusual zzso zzso zzso The mouse gene has a single zzso start while the human zzso has two major starts and a minor zzso This could result in zzso extensions of the human zzso A zzso with zzso zzso in the United Kingdom population was detected in the 3' tail of the zzso zzso is unlike other known proteins but a consensus for zzso zzso possibly suggests regulation by zzso
