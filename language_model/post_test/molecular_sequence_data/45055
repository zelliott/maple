The G protein zzso zzso zzso is expressed in taste and retinal and zzso zzso and plays a key role in taste zzso We identified zzso zzso and other zzso zzso proteins as binding partners for zzso by zzso zzso and pull-down zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically with the third zzso domain of zzso the sole zzso domain of zzso and the third zzso domain of zzso a zzso zzso zzso did not interact with the other zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with its zzso partner did not interfere with these zzso zzso The physical interaction of zzso with zzso in the cellular milieu was confirmed in pull-down zzso following zzso expression in zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso domain of zzso was via the zzso zzso tail of zzso (where AA indicates the zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution of the zzso sequence at the C zzso of zzso abolished its interactions with zzso in zzso and pull-down zzso zzso and zzso were identified in taste tissue and in zzso taste zzso zzso of zzso and zzso from brain and of zzso and zzso from taste tissue indicates that zzso interacts with these proteins zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso domain proteins interact with zzso G proteins via the zzso tail of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso zzso proteins may provide a means to target particular zzso zzso to specific zzso locations and/or zzso complexes involved in signaling zzso
