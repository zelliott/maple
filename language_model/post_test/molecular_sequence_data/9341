An unusual strain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected from a zzso child patient during the zzso survey of zzso in the state of zzso zzso Brazil in zzso 

The aim of this study was to carry out sequence analyses of the two outer zzso proteins zzso and zzso of the zzso strain detected in order to obtain further information of the genetic relationships between human and animal zzso 

zzso zzso was detected using a commercial zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso The analysis of the genetic relationship between human and animal zzso was carried out by sequencing the zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso gene of the zzso strain displayed the highest zzso identity to the canine strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated in zzso The zzso sequence showed the highest zzso identity to zzso canine zzso strain zzso isolated in Italy at zzso Furthermore, the zzso genes of zzso strains could be zzso into two zzso distinct zzso 

The present study reinforces the hypothesis that zzso zzso might be able to cross the species zzso and the lack of systematic surveillance of zzso infection in small animals zzso the ability to establish firm zzso zzso Moreover, in 2006 zzso vaccine was included in the Brazilian zzso Program, and selective vaccine pressure could increase the circulation of uncommon zzso This is the first report of zzso in over 20-year period of monitoring in zzso
