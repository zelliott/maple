Upper respiratory infections were reported to trigger multiple sclerosis zzso A relationship between zzso infections and zzso relapses was recently zzso 

To evaluate whether human zzso is associated with multiple sclerosis relapses and whether any particular strain is zzso 

zzso fluid was zzso from 36 multiple sclerosis patients at zzso critical time zzso zzso was performed to detect human zzso Positive zzso were zzso 

We found that zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso of specimens obtained at the onset of a zzso in 19 patients, in zzso specimens during zzso after zzso in 14 patients, in zzso specimens obtained in 5 patients on average a week after the onset of an zzso zzso zzso occurring within a window in time from one week before to three weeks after an infection, and in zzso specimens obtained after the onset of a zzso at zzso zzso not associated with any infection in 12 zzso Fifteen specimens from healthy control persons not associated with zzso were zzso The frequency of zzso presence in zzso was similar to that reported for community zzso Eight zzso from patients represented 5 different zzso zzso 

We were unable to reproduce previous findings of association between zzso infections and multiple sclerosis zzso zzso was not present in zzso zzso obtained during zzso zzso or zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso obtained from patients during zzso did not reveal any strain with predominance in multiple zzso
