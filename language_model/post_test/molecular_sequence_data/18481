zzso syndrome is an zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso median zzso associated with other zzso anomalies and severe limb zzso Learning and language disabilities are also zzso We mapped the zzso gene to a 122 zzso region at zzso through zzso analysis in 17 zzso zzso strategies identified an expansion of a region with several repeats of zzso or zzso motifs in the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso of zzso which contained from 14 to 16 repeats in the affected individuals and from 3 to 12 repeats in 520 healthy zzso A zzso substitution of a highly zzso zzso likely to affect the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso junction complex in trans with an expanded zzso was found in an unrelated individual with an zzso zzso thus expanding zzso mechanisms and zzso diversity of zzso zzso transcript abundance was reduced in both white blood cells and zzso cells of zzso individuals as compared to zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso in zzso led to underdevelopment of several zzso cartilage and bone structures, in agreement with the zzso zzso seen in zzso Our data thus suggest that zzso is caused by zzso in zzso and show that zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso and limb zzso
