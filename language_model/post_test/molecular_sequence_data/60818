The rat zzso zzso zzso gene belongs to an zzso class of viral G zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso open reading frame zzso shows 25 and zzso similarity with the gene products of zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is transcribed throughout the early and late zzso of infection in rat zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was found to result in three different zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso containing at least zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To investigate the function of the zzso zzso we generated two different zzso virus zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso a zzso from which the putative zzso C zzso has been deleted zzso These zzso viruses zzso with a zzso to zzso efficiency than zzso zzso virus in zzso Interestingly, unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso infected with the zzso develop a zzso zzso A striking difference between zzso and zzso viruses was also seen in zzso a considerably higher survival was seen among zzso zzso rats than among zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso gene encodes a novel zzso zzso that plays an important role in both zzso replication in zzso and the zzso of viral infection in zzso
