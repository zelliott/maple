The small zzso zzso and zzso are zzso proteins regulating a variety of cellular zzso Like other zzso the activity of Ral is regulated by the opposing effects of zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and zzso proteins zzso Although several zzso have been identified and zzso the molecular identity of zzso remains zzso Here, we report the first molecular identification of zzso which we have named zzso and zzso They are large zzso complexes, each consisting of a zzso zzso or zzso zzso and a common beta zzso These zzso complexes share structural and zzso similarities with the zzso sclerosis tumor zzso complex, which acts as a GAP for zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso rate of zzso by zzso zzso was required for this GAP zzso In zzso cells, zzso of the beta zzso led to sustained Ral zzso upon zzso growth factor zzso indicating that the zzso identified here are critical for efficient termination of Ral zzso induced by zzso zzso Our identification of zzso will enable further understanding of Ral signaling in many biological and pathological zzso
