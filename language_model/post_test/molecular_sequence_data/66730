The zzso expression of zzso and zzso during zzso is an important zzso of red blood cell zzso Whereas zzso is zzso transcribed early in zzso elevated zzso levels result in zzso occupancy at sites upstream of the zzso locus and zzso zzso zzso occupies these sites in the zzso active zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso abrogates zzso positive zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso analysis and quantitative zzso analysis with zzso cells expressing an zzso zzso zzso binding domain fusion to zzso revealed additional zzso switches 77 zzso upstream of zzso and within zzso 4 at zzso zzso Despite indistinguishable zzso occupancy at zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus other zzso switch sites, zzso functioned uniquely at the different zzso zzso induced zzso zzso at and near zzso but not at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region, which was zzso I hypersensitive in both active and inactive states, zzso equivalent zzso activities in zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso region exhibited considerably stronger zzso activity in zzso than in zzso cells, and other zzso switch sites were active only in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso capture analysis demonstrated zzso interactions between the zzso zzso region and zzso in the active and zzso zzso These results indicate that dispersed zzso factor complexes function via long-range zzso interactions and zzso distinct activities to regulate zzso zzso
