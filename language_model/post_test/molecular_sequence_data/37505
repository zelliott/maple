zzso is a psychoactive drug presenting a diverse array of biological activities, some positive, such as enhancement of cognitive performances, others negative, such as addiction zzso zzso that discriminate between the different zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso could present improved pharmacology and toxicity zzso 

Based on the recent crystal structure of a soluble zzso binding protein from zzso we have built atomic models of zzso and nicotine bound to the pocket of four different human zzso zzso The structures of the zzso zzso correlate with available zzso data, and reveal that the zzso for zzso selectivity are relying essentially on four zzso providing diversity of the zzso binding pocket both in terms of Van der zzso boundary, and zzso zzso We used our models to screen in zzso a large compound database and identify a new zzso candidate that could display zzso zzso 

The zzso models should be useful for the design of zzso zzso with diverse specificity zzso
