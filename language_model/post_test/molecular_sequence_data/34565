zzso a large zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso protein plays an important role in the organization of the zzso network and the maintenance of cell integrity in a wide variety of zzso and cell zzso Earlier experiments revealed the presence of zzso in the central nervous system, whereas the expression in the peripheral nervous system remained zzso Our results obtained with reverse zzso zzso provide evidence that zzso is expressed in structures of the rat peripheral nervous zzso In addition to zzso zzso transcripts we were able to reveal novel zzso zzso affecting the region coding for the central rod zzso Previous studies report a high, but zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso due to alternatively spliced first coding zzso and the zzso spliced small zzso 2 alpha and 3 zzso We demonstrate for the first time, using zzso zzso and zzso that zzso is expressed in zzso of the rat superior cervical zzso zzso zzso transcripts of single zzso zzso starting with zzso zzso as the first coding zzso contain the zzso spliced zzso 2 alpha but lack zzso zzso These data therefore suggest that zzso is expressed in rat zzso zzso as a zzso zzso with the molecular mass of 390 zzso
