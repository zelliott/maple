We studied the evolution of zzso in the Venezuelan zzso encephalitis zzso complex using zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequences from limited portions of the zzso zzso and 3' untranslated zzso regions of representative zzso The zzso complex constituted a zzso group of viruses zzso from a common zzso some zzso zzso varieties such as zzso III formed zzso groups while zzso I did zzso zzso II Everglades and variety ID zzso viruses formed a zzso group which also included all zzso variety zzso and zzso zzso zzso Everglades virus zzso from this ID lineage zzso North zzso zzso zzso years ago, followed by divergence of variety zzso and zzso zzso zzso Variety zzso viruses probably emerged from the variety ID lineage once during the early part of this century, while variety zzso viruses evolved at least two zzso These results identify the source of zzso zzso viruses as the variety ID zzso virus lineage which occurs in northern South America and zzso Even if variety zzso and zzso viruses are zzso recent, multiple zzso of zzso viruses from an zzso lineage suggests that other zzso zzso viruses may evolve again in the zzso The close genetic relationship of zzso II Everglades virus to the variety ID lineage also implies the potential for emergence of zzso zzso viruses in zzso
