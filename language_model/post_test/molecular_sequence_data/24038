The zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso in host zzso zzso acid zzso the plant tissue to values more suitable to zzso zzso However, we observed that the infected soybean zzso possessed a pH of zzso which is below that optimal for zzso activity zzso to zzso We investigated, therefore, the effects of pH (from zzso to zzso and zzso (5 to 20 zzso on the activity of the major basic zzso zzso and towards an zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso during soybean zzso We verified that only zzso activity is zzso by zzso while at the lowest pH levels, zzso escapes the zzso of a soybean zzso protein zzso These results, performed on zzso acid, were apparently consistent with data obtained from studies with soybean zzso zzso in which zzso activity was increased by zzso and zzso maintained its activity also at pH zzso possibly because at this pH the zzso contained in the plant tissue is zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that, during soybean infection, the expression of the putative zzso gene is delayed in comparison to the basic zzso The different zzso expressions of the two zzso and their differing responses to zzso zzso and zzso seem to be consistent with a possible zzso of the zzso PG activity in the host zzso
