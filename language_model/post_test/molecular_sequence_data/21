zzso function as receptors for zzso zzso zzso with zzso in cell zzso However, the molecular mechanism of their specific involvement in cell migration or in wound healing has not been zzso zzso Here, we report that a synthetic zzso zzso which contains the zzso sequence of the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso migration in in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in soluble zzso zzso Treatment of cells in solution with zzso resulted in the exposure of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso as well as in flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso bound to zzso but not to zzso zzso A zzso study revealed a role for zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding and migration of zzso zzso We conclude that binding of soluble zzso to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso which is associated with zzso zzso changes and zzso and leads to zzso zzso To activate zzso function through zzso could be a novel therapeutic approach for chronic zzso
