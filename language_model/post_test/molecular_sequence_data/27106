zzso systems play key roles in the survival and zzso success of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two large and diverse gene zzso zzso and zzso binding proteins zzso zzso are believed to transport zzso zzso from the environment to the zzso zzso 

We identified a family of zzso genes in the zzso zzso and characterized their expression using zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso genes were zzso a number comparable to the 57 zzso known from zzso zzso and 51 from zzso zzso As seen in other fully zzso insect zzso most zzso zzso genes are present in large zzso We defined six zzso of zzso each of which shows zzso expansion and zzso zzso data and zzso expression profiles from multiple larvae zzso of day three fifth zzso demonstrated that many zzso are expressed in zzso zzso although some zzso are expressed zzso and others exclusively in zzso zzso Some zzso zzso are expressed throughout zzso These results reveal that, although many zzso are zzso others may have more general zzso zzso 

zzso possess a number of zzso genes similar to other zzso Their expression profiles suggest that many zzso may be involved in zzso and zzso as well as general carriers of zzso zzso The expansion of zzso gene zzso and sequence divergence indicate that the zzso zzso family acquired functional diversity zzso with functional zzso Further investigation of the zzso of the zzso could give insights in the roles of zzso in zzso
