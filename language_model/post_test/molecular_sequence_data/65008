A sequence highly zzso to zzso III zzso was found in a database of human expressed sequence zzso The full-length open reading frame of the zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso was cloned using the zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso It encodes a typical type II zzso protein of 1039 zzso acids having zzso identity with zzso The zzso zzso transferred zzso to zzso with a zzso to form zzso as did zzso In specificity toward zzso zzso zzso it was quite similar to zzso in zzso however, the tissue zzso of the two zzso were quite zzso These results indicated that the two zzso have similar roles in different zzso
