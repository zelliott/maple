The rainbow trout zzso zzso beta gene consists of six zzso zzso in contrast to zzso which have seven zzso zzso The missing zzso appears to be at the zzso end of the zzso probably equivalent to zzso 1 or 2 of zzso Fewer and smaller zzso make the trout zzso beta only half the size of zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is seen between zzso 5 of trout and zzso 6 of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed two additional incompletely spliced zzso of the trout zzso beta zzso containing zzso 5 or zzso 4 and zzso All three transcripts are zzso in zzso zzso liver and zzso tissue from zzso challenged fish but only the fully spliced transcript is zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the latter transcript is also induced following stimulation of kidney zzso with zzso for 4 zzso A second zzso transcript is also detected but is larger zzso 3 zzso than any of the above, suggesting that it could be from a second zzso Southern zzso analysis also suggests at least two copies of the zzso beta gene or genes related to the 3' end of the zzso beta zzso are present in zzso
