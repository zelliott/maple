zzso zzso has been described for a number of viruses in the plant and animal zzso but the mechanisms of selection of zzso sites are poorly zzso The zzso zzso between two zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso virus was used to study the requirement for specific sequences and structures in the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso that disrupted either the stem or the loop of one of the two zzso zzso structures eliminated zzso zzso zzso However, zzso were detected if zzso zzso were generated that zzso a stable hairpin zzso These results provide evidence for the necessity of specific structures in the formation of zzso molecules in this zzso
