We have determined zzso sequences of three zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins by mass zzso of zzso zzso of the proteins zzso by two-dimensional zzso zzso gel zzso Three genes identified by the sequence of their zzso zzso the peptides identified in these three zzso The three proteins predicted from the gene sequences have significant similarity to other known zzso zzso and represent an zzso type zzso zzso and two zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso type zzso The sequences of both zzso predict formation of zzso active zzso through zzso zzso The prediction is supported by the presence in each of the two zzso of a zzso zzso that has the correctly processed zzso that creates the zzso zzso of the mature zzso This zzso cannot be generated by zzso because of the required zzso of a zzso zzso It is thus likely that there are at least two zzso active zzso zzso and zzso present in the mature zzso zzso from zzso zzso
