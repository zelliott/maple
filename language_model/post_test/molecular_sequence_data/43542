A zzso growth condition was defined for a zzso zzso strain carrying a zzso zzso of DNA zzso delta zzso delta zzso Under this condition, DNA zzso delta is zzso and causes a delay in zzso zzso Using a genetic strategy, we have isolated a panel of zzso that enter premature zzso when DNA replication is incomplete but which are not defective for arrest in zzso following DNA zzso We characterized the zzso zzso which enters premature zzso when S phase is arrested by genetic or chemical zzso However, this zzso is sensitive to neither zzso nor gamma zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to suppress the zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is a novel zzso of the cell cycle checkpoint gene zzso which we have named zzso zzso is a zzso which suppresses the zzso feedback control zzso of zzso when S phase is inhibited by either zzso or zzso but it does not suppress the zzso when S phase is arrested by a zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso in a variety of zzso zzso backgrounds indicate that strains containing zzso bypass zzso arrest but not zzso or late zzso zzso A model of how zzso monitors zzso progression to maintain the dependency of cell cycle events and coordinates with other zzso checkpoint gene products in responding to radiation damage is zzso
