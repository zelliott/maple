It is generally zzso that zzso play a central role in the progressive zzso observed in Alzheimer's zzso Important pathological properties of these zzso such as zzso and resistance to zzso degradation, depend on the ability of zzso to form zzso structures and/or zzso zzso zzso are known to zzso spontaneously in zzso with the formation of zzso zzso The intervention on the zzso zzso process can be zzso as an approach to stopping or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's zzso In the last few years a number of small molecules have been reported to interfere with the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso a hormone recently found to protect zzso against zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the progressive formation of zzso and/or zzso zzso These interactions between zzso and the zzso peptides have been demonstrated by circular zzso zzso and electron zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso for zzso zzso Our zzso zzso mass zzso zzso studies also proved that there is a zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso investigations suggested that the interaction took place on the zzso zzso zzso The wide-ranging application of these results would provide further information and help in biological zzso
