The insert of a clone from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library, showed an open reading frame whose deduced protein sequence presents a high zzso with all described zzso zzso The zzso active site zzso is completely zzso With a zzso zzso selected from a total zzso zzso by the isolated zzso a 12 zzso zzso was zzso from a zzso total protein zzso Furthermore, an zzso raised against a zzso zzso also recognizes a 12 zzso band in these zzso The zzso protein presents zzso activity, using the insulin reduction zzso Finally, a zzso activity was characterized in zzso zzso In all organisms where zzso were zzso they participate in a cascade of zzso exchanges, contributing to the maintaining of cell zzso Considering that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is probably submitted to an important zzso stress due to host zzso zzso protein could be involved in the survival strategies of this zzso
