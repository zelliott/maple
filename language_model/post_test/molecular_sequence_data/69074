The interaction of von zzso factor zzso with the alpha v beta 3 zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells is dependent on the zzso sequence present at zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso We compared zzso and its two zzso fragments, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso supported zzso cell zzso whereas zzso which contains the zzso zzso zzso binding domain, did zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso to immobilized zzso whereas soluble zzso did not, suggesting that exposure of the cell attachment domain involves a zzso modification of zzso zzso and zzso two zzso peptides of the zzso family, were potent zzso of cell zzso to zzso zzso approximately 15 zzso Complete zzso of zzso cell zzso to zzso was obtained in the presence of zzso of zzso zzso 9 to zzso which blocks zzso binding to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso 713 to zzso which blocks its binding to zzso zzso did not inhibit cell zzso to zzso These results indicate that zzso cell zzso to zzso is zzso by an zzso interaction with alpha v beta 3, but does not seem to involve a zzso zzso and show the importance of the zzso of the zzso zzso
