The gene zzso the major zzso protein of zzso zzso virus zzso has been identified by zzso using zzso zzso corresponding to different regions of the major zzso proteins of zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus 22 zzso A DNA zzso of zzso zzso was amplified using two zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso acid positions 146 to 153 and 304 to 313 of the major zzso protein of zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso derived from zzso was zzso to a zzso gene zzso This analysis revealed that only the zzso zzso DNA zzso X zzso zzso zzso to zzso viral map units zzso zzso to the amplified DNA zzso An zzso transcript of about zzso zzso was identified when the zzso product was used as a zzso zzso The same zzso transcript was detected when the zzso fragments X and Q zzso zzso zzso to zzso viral zzso were used as zzso This indicates that the expected gene is located within map coordinates zzso to zzso and zzso part of the DNA sequences of fragments Q and zzso The analysis of the DNA sequences of this particular region of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of one open zzso frame of zzso zzso The DNA sequences of this region zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with an zzso of zzso A high degree zzso of zzso acid sequence identity was detected between the major zzso protein of zzso and/or zzso and the zzso acid composition of the identified zzso zzso
