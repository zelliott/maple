zzso zzso is characterized by the appearance of zzso throughout the central nervous zzso It has many potential causes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well zzso Mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso Ring zzso zzso develop zzso zzso zzso We identified an interaction between a zzso motif in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso a component of the zzso sorting complex required for transport I zzso and demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso We examined the in zzso consequences of loss of zzso on zzso expression and function in the mouse zzso The pattern of zzso zzso differed in the brains of zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 month of age, zzso zzso mice had less zzso zzso while in adults, zzso mice had more zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso There was an associated increase in zzso growth factor zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso These results suggest that loss of zzso promotes zzso of zzso by other zzso and may prevent its disassociation from zzso zzso or cause it to form zzso zzso Our data zzso loss of normal zzso function in zzso trafficking in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
