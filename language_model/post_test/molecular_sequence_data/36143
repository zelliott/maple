Several naturally occurring zzso have now been well characterized with respect to their in zzso and in zzso zzso Through detailed zzso and genetic zzso it has become possible to alter the zzso specificity of each zzso using simple zzso base zzso Several laboratories, therefore, have designed zzso to cleave viral or other cellular transcripts in zzso with the hope of developing these molecules as zzso or therapeutic zzso In addition to zzso base zzso however, other factors such as protein or zzso zzso interactions are involved in the zzso zzso zzso Although several engineered zzso have been used successfully to reduce gene expression in zzso it is difficult to determine whether gene expression has been reduced by the zzso activity of the zzso or by its inherent zzso zzso In order to discriminate between these two activities and zzso potentially therapeutic zzso it is imperative to develop in zzso zzso in which the zzso activity of zzso is zzso
