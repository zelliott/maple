To explore the evolutionary consequences of zzso fluctuations in distribution of rainforest habitat we contrasted demographic histories of divergence among three lineages of Australian rainforest endemic zzso The zzso rainbow zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso indistinguishable northern and southern zzso DNA zzso lineages that are partially reproductively isolated at their zzso zzso The third lineage zzso zzso inhabits zzso just to the south of zzso zzso has blue, rather than zzso zzso and for zzso is more closely related to southern zzso zzso than is northern zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses supported more recent divergence between zzso distinct lineages than between zzso conservative zzso There was effectively no migration and therefore stronger isolation between southern zzso zzso and zzso zzso and low zzso migration between zzso conservative lineages of zzso zzso We found little or no evidence for strong differences in effective population size, and hence different contributions of genetic drift in the demographic history of the three zzso zzso the results suggest contrasting responses to long-term fluctuations in rainforest zzso leading to varying opportunities for zzso
