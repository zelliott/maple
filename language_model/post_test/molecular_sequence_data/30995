zzso replacement of zzso with a zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the alpha zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso reduces its ability to zzso zzso and causes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in Swiss zzso zzso of zzso alpha S caused markedly increased zzso zzso zzso activity, enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso sensitivity in response to zzso and the potent zzso inhibitor zzso zzso These results support a role for zzso in the regulation of cell zzso and suggest that zzso in a G protein can directly modify the ability of cells to respond zzso to zzso zzso
