A more sensitive screen for zzso major genes zzso expressed as the insect stage develops into an infectious form zzso has been zzso The screen zzso the observation that in zzso zzso zzso expressed genes are often associated with unique 3' untranslated regions zzso To obtain zzso zzso this region, zzso is zzso using an zzso primer containing the universal zzso sequence in the first strand reaction and an zzso zzso the spliced leader sequence in the second strand zzso The zzso are then zzso with zzso zzso to the zzso and the 3' zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplified using the universal zzso sequence as the zzso zzso screening with zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso previously identified zzso expressed zzso zzso cloned genes which had not been shown to be zzso zzso and zzso a new gene identified only as a match to two identical zzso major expressed sequence tags zzso that is zzso in the infectious zzso
