zzso such as the zzso precursor can be zzso at zzso zzso on passage along the zzso zzso The zzso site occurs in a sequence zzso that suggests these peptides are zzso for zzso zzso zzso but the presence of this zzso in zzso cells is zzso We have examined the specificity of zzso membrane zzso from zzso rat zzso zzso bovine adrenal zzso and the zzso cell line, for zzso of zzso fragments and zzso The zzso of zzso of peptides with the native zzso zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso fragments zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso The product of in zzso zzso was zzso indistinguishable from native zzso zzso with the sequence zzso zzso substitution of zzso to zzso were not zzso We conclude that a zzso zzso zzso like zzso can act on both the zzso precursor and its zzso zzso product, and occurs in the zzso complex of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
