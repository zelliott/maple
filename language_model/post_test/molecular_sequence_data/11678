zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso hormone zzso beta zzso zzso gene cause the syndrome of resistance to zzso hormone zzso The clinical zzso results from the antagonism of the normal zzso alpha and the zzso zzso beta zzso by the zzso beta 1 zzso via a dominant negative zzso There is, however, marked zzso of organ resistance within and among zzso with zzso This study examines the potential role of cell type in modulating the dominant negative potency of human zzso beta 1 zzso beta 1) zzso 

zzso zzso were performed in zzso and zzso cells, using a wild type zzso and three naturally occurring zzso zzso beta 1 zzso and three natural zzso hormone response elements zzso zzso was performed to detect levels of zzso beta 1 expression in these two cell zzso In order to determine how zzso beta 1 interacts with other cellular partners, zzso analyses using zzso and zzso nuclear extracts were zzso 

zzso studies using zzso zzso beta 1 in zzso and zzso cells, showed that the zzso zzso zzso of the different zzso varied between cell zzso Unlike the zzso zzso beta 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed the expected zzso dose responsiveness in these two cell zzso For each zzso zzso the magnitude of the dominant negative effect varied between the cell zzso The levels of zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells were zzso as determined by zzso zzso analyses showed differences in the formation of zzso and zzso depending on both the cell type and zzso zzso 

The cell type in which a zzso zzso operates affects the relative amounts of zzso and zzso Together with the nature of the zzso and the zzso this could zzso the dominant negative action of zzso receptors in different zzso which, in turn, could contribute to the variable zzso characteristics of zzso
