zzso is a type of zzso zzso that is zzso in response to infection and has been characterized in many insect species and one zzso The zzso locus of zzso zzso also contains the gene zzso which has been identified only in this species and encodes a zzso zzso zzso As a first step in studying the molecular evolution of the zzso and zzso genes among zzso species, we have isolated zzso clones that cover the zzso locus in zzso zzso The cloned region totals approximately 25 zzso within which a zzso zzso contains four zzso genes and one zzso All four genes have a high level of sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso about zzso identity in the coding regions, and the zzso positions are zzso As in zzso zzso and other insects, zzso zzso zzso elements are found upstream of these zzso zzso An zzso sequence was not identified in zzso zzso however, zzso Southern zzso suggest that zzso sequences are present in at least the zzso species zzso Analysis of 19 insect zzso genes identifies a common ancestral zzso before the divergence of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be identified by zzso zzso for zzso In contrast, the zzso species show zzso relationships for duplicated zzso zzso
