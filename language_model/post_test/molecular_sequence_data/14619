In the honey bee no zzso gene has been found, even though zzso stimulates the synthesis of juvenile hormone in this zzso We report here that honey bees and other zzso do have a typical zzso zzso although the peptides predicted have a somewhat different structure from that of other insect zzso zzso zzso to honey bee zzso reacted with material in the zzso zzso of the zzso nerves of abdominal zzso We were unable to find the zzso zzso using mass zzso in extracts from these zzso Thus the expression of this gene in honey bees is less important than in other insect zzso We also characterized the zzso gene which similarly appears to be very zzso expressed in worker honey zzso Unlike the zzso zzso which is zzso within zzso the zzso gene is much more variable in structure and was not found in zzso nor the zzso zzso zzso zzso The absence of significant expression of zzso hormone zzso in the honey bee may be due to the existence of a second zzso box in the zzso region of the zzso which explains the production of an zzso zzso a putative zzso precursor from which no zzso should be zzso Such a second zzso box was not found in other zzso and may therefore be specific for the two zzso zzso It is suggested that functional disintegration of this important zzso gene became possible in zzso because of the highly evolved social nature of the zzso
