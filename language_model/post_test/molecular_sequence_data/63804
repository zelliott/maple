Recently, as zzso data have become available for more organisms, the development of zzso markers from nuclear zzso zzso zzso has become more zzso However, new methods are needed to efficiently sort the large number of genes from zzso databases into more limited sets appropriate for particular zzso questions, while avoiding zzso and zzso Here we describe a general methodology for identifying candidate zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our method uses information from reference zzso to identify genes with relatively large continuous zzso regions zzso zzso zzso comparisons are used to help avoid genes with zzso copies or close relatives zzso gene zzso that might confound zzso zzso zzso boundary information is used to identify appropriately spaced potential zzso zzso Using this method, we have developed over 25 novel zzso which span a variety of desirable evolutionary rates for zzso zzso Although targeted for zzso zzso of zzso zzso many of these zzso appear to be useful across and within other zzso zzso zzso zzso and some are relatively rapidly evolving and may be useful for zzso species zzso within zzso This general method can be used whenever large-scale zzso data are available for an appropriate reference species (not necessarily within the focal zzso The method is also well suited for the development of zzso regions for zzso zzso and zzso zzso We provide an online database of alignments and suggested zzso for approximately 85 zzso that should be useful across zzso
