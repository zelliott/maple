zzso are an attractive target for de zzso zzso Usually, natural proteins incorporate two or more zzso or zzso metal zzso into their zzso to perform their functions, but the design of multiple zzso sites is usually difficult to zzso Here, we undertook the de zzso engineering of zzso sites, zzso and zzso into a designed coiled zzso structure based on an zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, we described two zzso zzso and zzso The former has two His zzso and forms a zzso coiled zzso after binding zzso zzso or zzso The latter has one His zzso which allowed binding with zzso and zzso but not with zzso On the basis of these properties, we newly designed zzso as a zzso zzso This zzso can bind zzso and zzso simultaneously in the zzso core of the zzso coiled zzso The first metal zzso binding induced the folding of the zzso into the zzso coiled zzso thereby promoting the second metal zzso zzso This is the first example of a zzso that can bind two different metal zzso This construction should provide valuable insights for the de zzso design of zzso
