zzso are a family of potent volatile compounds of diverse biological zzso They are used by insects and plants in chemical zzso are present in many vegetables and fruit and, in particular, impart zzso sensory attributes to wines of certain zzso including zzso zzso While pathways for zzso zzso have been zzso none of the steps have been confirmed zzso We have used the zzso progeny of a cross between a rapid flowering zzso dwarf zzso which does not produce zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify the major locus responsible for zzso of zzso in zzso grape zzso Two candidate zzso genes within the locus were identified and one was significantly associated with berry zzso levels using association zzso The zzso zzso by this gene zzso has high affinity for zzso precursors of zzso The gene is not expressed in the fruit of zzso zzso which lack zzso but is expressed in zzso zzso at the time of zzso of zzso in the zzso The results suggest that zzso is responsible for the final step in zzso synthesis in grape berries and is the major zzso of zzso zzso
