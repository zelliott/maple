The zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the two zzso circle, an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso proceeds via a short-lived Holliday zzso zzso We have made a synthetic zzso structure containing two zzso recognition target zzso sequences in order to investigate resolution by zzso zzso zzso We found that incubation of this model zzso with zzso generated two pairs of linear products in equal zzso Thus, resolution was equally likely to occur in either zzso zzso of zzso binding sites, so as to inhibit zzso affected the direction of zzso zzso was reduced adjacent to the altered binding zzso The overall efficiency of resolution increased when one zzso binding site was zzso In investigating the series of zzso zzso structures we found that resolution requires only two intact zzso binding zzso However, the zzso zzso interaction of additional zzso molecules may also be zzso Thus, resolution is more tolerant of the loss of zzso binding sites than is the complete zzso zzso
