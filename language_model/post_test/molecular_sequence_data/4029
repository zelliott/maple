The design and total synthesis of a novel insulin zzso zzso analogue 3, is zzso In this compound, the zzso implied in the two insulin zzso zzso bridges are replaced by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso bridge zzso zzso and zzso is zzso This zzso analogue zzso has been tested in three in zzso cell culture zzso using insulin as a zzso The data clearly showed that analogue 3 mimics insulin effects on DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis without loss of potency as compared to zzso To our knowledge, these are the first results showing that an isolated insulin chain displays functional properties similar to those of zzso The implication of these new findings in insulin zzso relationships and in a zzso structure determination is zzso
