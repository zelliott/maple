Major epidemic outbreaks of acute zzso result from infections with Norwalk or zzso zzso zzso zzso from stool specimens of volunteers zzso infected with Norwalk virus was used to construct zzso complementary DNA zzso and derive clones representing most of the viral zzso The specificity of the clones was shown by their zzso with zzso (but not zzso infection stool samples from volunteers infected with Norwalk virus and with zzso Norwalk zzso A correlation was observed between the appearance of zzso signals in stool samples and clinical symptoms of acute zzso in zzso zzso zzso between overlapping zzso restriction zzso zzso and partial zzso sequence information of the clones indicated that Norwalk virus contains a zzso zzso zzso of positive sense, with a zzso tail at the 3' end and a size of at least zzso zzso A consensus zzso acid sequence motif typical of viral zzso zzso zzso was identified in one of the Norwalk virus zzso The availability of zzso zzso and the new sequence information of the viral zzso should permit the development of sensitive diagnostic zzso and studies of the molecular biology of the zzso
