Members of the zzso family of zzso linear zzso antibiotics have been designed to form zzso zzso structures in membrane environments and switch from alignments parallel to the zzso surface to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Here the zzso in zzso buffer of two members of the family has been investigated by zzso The peptides form zzso or small zzso at pH zzso 5 but associate into zzso zzso at zzso zzso The diameter of these latter complexes can be considerably reduced by zzso Furthermore, the membrane interactions of the various zzso zzso with zzso or mixed zzso zzso have been investigated in zzso zzso In all the cases tested, the large zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in size were more active than the structures with the smallest zzso zzso in releasing the fluorescent dye from zzso In contrast, the relative activity after zzso depends on the specific environment zzso The data suggest that these zzso form zzso structures and support the notion that they can act in a manner comparable to zzso
