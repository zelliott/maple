In the zzso zzso zzso that lacks zzso the nuclear pore complex zzso has been proposed to serve a role in zzso zzso Here, using zzso zzso in living cells, we show that nuclear pore proteins of the zzso core complex, zzso zzso zzso and zzso serve to anchor zzso zzso at the nuclear zzso The integrity of this complex is shown to be required for repression of a zzso gene inserted in the zzso region of this zzso zzso Furthermore, altering the integrity of this complex decreases the efficiency of repair of a DNA zzso break zzso only when it is generated in the zzso region, even though the repair machinery is zzso These effects are specific to the zzso zzso Our observations thus confirm and extend the role played by the zzso through the zzso complex, in the functional organization of zzso They also indicate that zzso of zzso is essential for efficient repair of zzso occurring zzso and is important for preserving zzso zzso
