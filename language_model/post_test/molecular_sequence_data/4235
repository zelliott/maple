B cells that mediate normal, T zzso zzso immune responses must first pass through zzso centers zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso As they move through the dark zone and then the light zone in the zzso B cells are subjected to zzso zzso and switch zzso within their rearranged zzso genes and also participate in a number of other processes that control development into memory cells or cells specialized for zzso zzso To investigate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to B cell development within zzso we constructed a zzso DNA library enriched for zzso derived from human genes expressed in B cells at this zzso This library was found to contain a zzso structurally and functionally related to genes in bacteria and zzso for the DNA repair zzso zzso DNA zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that the human gene is expressed as two alternatively spliced zzso zzso within zzso B cells at levels greatly exceeding that found in other zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed that expression of this gene is most abundant within the dark zones of zzso Both the function and localized expression of this gene suggest that it may play a role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
