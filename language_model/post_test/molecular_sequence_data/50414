zzso zzso a zzso zzso is yellow colored due to the zzso of unusually polar zzso primarily zzso and zzso of zzso We have cloned and expressed the gene for the zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso The zzso has an apparent molecular mass of 45 zzso on an zzso zzso which is consistent with its calculated molecular zzso In zzso zzso activity was demonstrated using zzso and zzso as zzso The product zzso zzso and its intermediate zzso were identified by thin layer zzso The optimum pH and temperature ranges of the zzso are zzso and zzso degrees C, zzso A zzso plot indicates no apparent zzso regions, and zzso experiments suggest that the zzso is zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from the zzso zzso gene shows a small region of high similarity with other zzso and zzso that use either zzso zzso acid or a sugar as one of their zzso Based on these similarities, we propose that this zzso sequence is part of the zzso binding zzso
