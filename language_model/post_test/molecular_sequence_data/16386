zzso demands are now placed on clinicians for early diagnosis as we enter into an era of advancing treatment opportunities for the zzso zzso zzso monitoring of any therapeutic avenue will also be zzso To this end, we aimed to identify a range of urinary zzso that could be used to identify and characterize patients with zzso We analyzed 94 urine samples from 68 patients with zzso and 26 control individuals for zzso derived from zzso using zzso zzso mass zzso The zzso profile for each patient group was compared with that of the control zzso The zzso U test was used to measure the difference between each patient group and the controls for each zzso zzso samples from patients before and at successive times after bone zzso transplantation were also zzso A number of zzso were identified in the urine of each zzso zzso and for each of these, specific zzso profiles were zzso These profiles enabled the identification of all 68 patients and their zzso with the exception of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to assess three individuals after a bone zzso zzso and, in each case, a substantial reduction in the level of diagnostic zzso zzso was zzso The identification and measurement of zzso zzso in urine provides a sensitive and specific screen for the early identification of individuals with zzso The resulting zzso profiles not only characterize zzso but also provide a zzso fingerprint for the zzso monitoring of current and proposed zzso
