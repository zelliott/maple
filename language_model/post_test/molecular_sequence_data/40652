The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso anomalous zzso zzso to a resolution of zzso using the zzso zzso pipeline of the Joint Center for zzso zzso zzso as part of the zzso zzso zzso Initiative zzso This protein structure is the first representative of the zzso zzso zzso family and reveals a novel combination of two well known zzso (an zzso zzso fold followed by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses reveal partial similarities to zzso zzso with zzso from the zzso fold combining to form a unique active site that is likely to be involved in the zzso or zzso of molecules implicated in the synthesis of zzso zzso or other zzso The zzso context of zzso and zzso additionally supports a role in zzso zzso
