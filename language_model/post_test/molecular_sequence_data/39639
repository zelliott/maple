A bacterial zzso containing zzso copies of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA in tandem zzso copy of zzso type 1 zzso zzso copy of zzso with two origins of DNA replication zzso yielded three different DNA species when transformed into zzso zzso the input zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a composite zzso but lacking the zzso zzso and a zzso consisting of the remaining zzso copy zzso zzso with a different composite zzso together with the bacterial zzso zzso of the input construct was presumably via the zzso replication mechanism utilizing the zzso zzso while characteristics of the other two DNA species, including a requirement of two zzso zzso and the zzso replication zzso zzso zzso suggest they were generated via the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso protein essential for zzso DNA replication in zzso cells was not required in zzso The fact that the zzso protein zzso can be compensated by the bacterial replication machinery to support the zzso DNA replication process echoes previous suggestions that circular zzso DNA animal zzso plant zzso and zzso may have evolved from zzso zzso zzso
