We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obtained the full-length zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a highest identity zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a lower identity of less than zzso to the zzso zzso from other zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso gene existed as a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso The active zzso zzso contained four zzso and produced a strongly zzso zzso curve with zzso as the variable zzso zzso zzso a general zzso factor of zzso zzso in most species, did not affect the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso radically activated the zzso zzso zzso suppressed the reaction zzso at a higher concentration of zzso These properties indicate that zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso is regulated by unusual zzso zzso
