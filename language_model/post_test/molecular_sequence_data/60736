To understand how zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso are zzso in the zzso we cloned zzso zzso zzso and zzso their zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso only in the zzso but not in the zzso cells, and the length was zzso zzso The zzso clones contained multiple zzso of zzso We assume that zzso precursors are large zzso chains with an unusual zzso structure made of 10 successive similar stretches of zzso zzso Each stretch finishes with a zzso of zzso zzso immediately followed by the sequence of one zzso zzso The zzso of this precursor has zzso successive zzso repeating zzso zzso of the precursor may require zzso that cleave both zzso and zzso of zzso
