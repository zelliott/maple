We have cloned and characterized zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparison showed that the primary structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso have been highly zzso in zzso In contrast to the presence of a single zzso gene in zzso two distinct zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that both genes are zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso studies with specific zzso showed that both zzso genes are expressed and both receptors bind to zzso and zzso but not to zzso The zzso expression patterns of the two zzso and their zzso were determined using a combination of zzso whole mount in zzso zzso and zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso were found throughout zzso in a ubiquitous zzso In adult zzso zzso zzso was more abundant in liver and zzso and its level was increased after zzso treatment, whereas zzso zzso was not regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and proteins were expressed in overlapping spatial zzso but exhibited distinct zzso expression zzso In particular, the relative level of zzso zzso was low during early zzso and increased in the hatched zzso whereas the situation was reversed for zzso zzso In adult zzso the overall tissue distribution patterns of the two zzso were similar, but there were differences in their cellular zzso and relative abundance in defined zzso The differential expression pattern of zzso and zzso suggest that they may play distinct roles in regulating the growth and development of zzso
