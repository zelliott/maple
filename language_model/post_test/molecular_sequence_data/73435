The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in both the early and late stages of the viral life zzso Using our previously determined solution structure of zzso we have undertaken a rational zzso program aimed at mapping zzso relationships within the zzso zzso acids hypothesized to be important for zzso function were zzso and examined for effect in an infectious zzso clone of zzso In zzso we analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso the structure of zzso zzso protein containing such zzso These analyses identified three classes of zzso that were defective in viral zzso zzso proteins containing zzso at internal zzso that zzso distorted the structure of zzso zzso and prevented viral particle formation, zzso zzso at putative zzso zzso zzso that allowed correct folding of zzso protein but produced virus that was defective in particle zzso and zzso substitution of basic zzso in zzso A that caused some relocation of virus assembly to zzso locations and produced normally zzso zzso that were completely zzso
