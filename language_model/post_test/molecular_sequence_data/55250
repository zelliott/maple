Group A zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was found to have zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso zzso and zzso zzso To determine the exact origin and overall genetic makeup of this unusual zzso strain, the remaining genes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso in this zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso zzso not reported zzso The zzso and zzso genes of strain zzso were related closely to those of common human zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso whilst its zzso zzso and zzso genes were related more closely to those of zzso zzso and/or zzso genes of zzso strains than to those of other zzso zzso strain zzso might have originated from zzso events involving acquisition of four zzso zzso possibly from zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of strain zzso has provided important insights into the complex genetic diversity of zzso
