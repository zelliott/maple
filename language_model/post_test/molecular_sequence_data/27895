Generally, if zzso and normal proteins have similar molecular weights and electric charges, they cannot easily be distinguished from one zzso We have developed a unique method by which a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso can easily be distinguished from normal zzso with nearly identical molecular weight and electric zzso DNA sequencing data have suggested that in this special type of disease zzso zzso zzso there is an zzso acid substitution from Met to zzso at position 136 of zzso Since normal zzso has only one Met zzso the zzso zzso zzso should be a zzso zzso Using both an zzso acid zzso zzso against zzso and specific zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso with zzso we could distinguish between normal and zzso zzso Thus, normal but not zzso zzso was zzso with zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso All tested patients with the zzso zzso zzso were found to zzso exclusively zzso zzso zzso of this method is not restricted to a single family, as zzso of all the patients with this disease among Japanese, and more than half of all the patients with this disease reported in the world, are likely to have this unique zzso Thus, not only zzso zzso of DNA with restriction zzso but also that of protein with a chemical agent has been shown to be sometimes useful for the diagnosis and analysis of a genetic disease by careful examination of normal and zzso zzso acid zzso
