The zzso zzso zzso is a synthetic construct of a zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso In this work we show that zzso has all the properties of a zzso zzso zzso it is a zzso preserving cell membrane zzso when added to cultured zzso zzso thus zzso the zzso for employment in zzso for cell zzso zzso zzso Different types of intact cells catalyze the zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was influenced by zzso the zzso protein specific for zzso The results of comparative experiments with intact cells and with cell extracts demonstrate the zzso nature of this zzso Further, the possibility was ruled out of a transfer of zzso activity from damaged cells to the surface of intact zzso The zzso of the surface zzso activity to the plasma membrane appears to be relatively stable since zzso cell zzso obtained after zzso of intact cells with zzso or zzso did not show zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso activity remained with cells even after five consecutive washes with zzso or zzso This is in contrast to the zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso which is released from intact cells through the addition of zzso Data are presented which show that both zzso activities are exhibited zzso In conjunction with published evidence for an active export of zzso from cells as well as for the appearance of zzso zzso the demonstration of an zzso further supports the potential of zzso for zzso zzso The potential of zzso is demonstrated by its ability to zzso biologically active forms of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso which possesses the specific sequence for a zzso zzso
