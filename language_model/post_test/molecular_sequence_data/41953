The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the family of G zzso receptors and activates zzso when zzso by zzso or zzso Studies from other G zzso receptors have implicated the zzso region of the third zzso loop as being involved in the zzso of G zzso It has been suggested that the potential ability of this region to form an zzso zzso with positively charged zzso aligned to one face, may be important for this biological zzso To test whether the positively charged zzso zzso and thus an zzso zzso in the zzso terminal region of the rat zzso zzso are indeed important in the zzso of zzso by the zzso a zzso zzso was constructed in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso were simultaneously zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells expressing comparable numbers of zzso zzso wild type zzso or zzso were zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso human zzso zzso with the same high affinity as those expressing the wild type zzso Since the numbers of receptors and binding affinities between the two cell lines were comparable, any changes in zzso or zzso zzso zzso production could readily be interpreted as an zzso in the zzso zzso ability to activate zzso It was found, however, that zzso zzso production, the concentration of zzso required to elicit zzso zzso production, and the zzso levels of zzso produced in response to zzso were all unchanged in cells expressing zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
