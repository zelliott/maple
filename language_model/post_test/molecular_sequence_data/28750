The solution structure and dynamics of the human zzso factor X (FX) have been investigated to understand the key structural elements in the zzso form that zzso in the zzso zzso The model was constructed based on the zzso zzso zzso structure of zzso inhibited human zzso zzso The missing zzso acid zzso and part of zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso of the light chain were modeled based on the template of zzso zzso of the tissue factor zzso zzso structure zzso The zzso zzso and other missing segments of FX were introduced using zzso zzso The full zzso model of FX was subjected to zzso zzso of molecular dynamics simulation in zzso medium using the zzso zzso We observed significant zzso of the zzso zzso domain upon zzso leading to a compact zzso zzso The solution structure of zzso appears to be in a zzso zzso with the distance between the calcium zzso in the zzso domain and the zzso zzso estimated to be approximately 95 A in contrast to approximately 83 A in the activated zzso The latter is in close agreement with zzso studies on zzso The zzso zzso near the zzso zzso show significant differences between the zzso and activated zzso
