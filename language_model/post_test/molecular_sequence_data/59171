The zzso genes have been known to be involved in pattern formation during zzso development through differential expression along the zzso body zzso Human zzso of zzso regulatory region of zzso zzso was cloned from human zzso zzso The restriction map of the zzso insert was determined, of which a zzso region was zzso zzso plot between the zzso and the corresponding human sequence showed high sequence conservation over zzso in several zzso The zzso region has been reduced to about zzso zzso zzso human control zzso which contained several putative factor binding zzso The function of zzso was analyzed in transgenic mice and turned out to be a zzso regulatory element of human, setting the precise anterior boundary of expression in transgenic zzso at day zzso zzso a distinct anterior limit of expression was noted at the level of zzso in neural tube and spinal zzso in transgenic zzso These results indicate that the regulatory sequences as well as the molecular mechanism for zzso gene expression are highly zzso among zzso
