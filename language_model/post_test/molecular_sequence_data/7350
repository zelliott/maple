We analyzed a zzso structure of zzso the first identified zzso plant hormone, using two-dimensional zzso zzso From these data and molecular dynamics calculations we concluded that the zzso can adopt a zzso structure, which has previously been found in many specific zzso zzso Using zzso affinity zzso we showed that zzso binds strongly to zzso We suggest that the specific zzso interaction, particularly in a promoter region of the zzso zzso could effect gene expression and thus explain the biological activity of zzso
