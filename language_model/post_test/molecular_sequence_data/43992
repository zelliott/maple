A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displays specific activity with a variety of model zzso and secondary products of zzso zzso The zzso interacts with a range of model zzso zzso compounds, zzso acids and zzso The reported variations in zzso activity correlate with structural differences observed by zzso zzso Here, differences in the topography of the proposed zzso binding site between the zzso and the host zzso were zzso A rabbit zzso zzso was raised against the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and specific zzso against zzso were zzso using the zzso zzso These zzso were used to zzso the zzso in adult worms by zzso zzso The strongest zzso for zzso was localized in the zzso in all worms zzso This suggests that the zzso may be responsible for the metabolism of materials that are incorporated from the environment, as well as for molecules that are zzso or zzso from the zzso to the zzso It also demonstrates the accessibility of the zzso to an inhibitor or blocking zzso In addition, the structure and sequence of the gene zzso zzso have been zzso zzso analyses of the zzso gene suggests that it is a zzso zzso The zzso sequence analysis revealed that the gene is composed of four zzso and three zzso and potential regulatory elements were identified in the zzso zzso zzso
