zzso of structural proteins in the lung by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is thought to play a significant role in invasive zzso This fungus was found previously to zzso an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso We report that zzso zzso also zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso that can catalyze zzso of the major structural proteins of basement zzso zzso zzso and zzso The pH optimum for the zzso activity was zzso with zzso red as the zzso and the activity was not significantly inhibited by zzso A, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and gene zzso this zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The open reading frame, interrupted by three zzso would zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids composed of a putative zzso signal zzso and a zzso zzso preceding the zzso mature zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso has 70, 66, and zzso zzso to the sequences of those from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso motif zzso and the zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso are found in the presently described zzso indicating that it belongs to a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced in rabbits against both the mature and precursor forms of the zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso with both zzso detected a zzso mature zzso in the culture zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity was inhibited by the zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso in the culture zzso zzso to the product of the cloned zzso zzso electron zzso showed that the zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso invading zzso mouse lung and its zzso was directed toward the germ tubes of penetrating zzso
