Human zzso zzso zzso is a key host defense zzso that zzso zzso factors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso G zzso are zzso zzso zzso with sequence and structural similarities, and both are abundant in zzso zzso Unlike NE, zzso does not cleave zzso factors of enteric zzso Through zzso analysis, we identified regions in zzso that are essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at eight different positions were replaced with analogous zzso acids in zzso or with zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso proteins showed that a single zzso at position 98 and multiple zzso acid stretches in the three different regions zzso zzso and zzso determine zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso the zzso but not the zzso synthetic zzso zzso and did not degrade zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, exchanging the zzso acid at position 98 in zzso for the zzso equivalent enabled this zzso zzso to cleave zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso products of the zzso zzso factor zzso shows that zzso has specific zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso factor specificity maps to a distinct region close to zzso active zzso
