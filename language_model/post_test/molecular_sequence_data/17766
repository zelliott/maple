zzso typing of in zzso amplified DNA with zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 54 random Norwegian zzso arthritis zzso patients and 181 healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso specificity zzso were found in zzso of the patients, compared to zzso of the controls zzso risk zzso zzso p less than zzso All zzso zzso patients carried either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso while no patients were found to carry zzso zzso or zzso zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not increased, even among zzso zzso patients, and we were unable to detect any sharing of other class II zzso among zzso zzso No contribution of any zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso could be zzso The results suggest that in the Norwegian population zzso is primarily associated with a shared sequence at zzso zzso of the DR beta 1 chain, but only when this sequence is expressed on zzso zzso
