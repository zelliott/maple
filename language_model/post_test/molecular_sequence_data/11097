The zzso zzso of zzso form zzso DNA of the autonomous zzso minute virus of mice zzso consists of a sequence that is zzso except for a three zzso loop around the axis of symmetry and an interior zzso of three zzso zzso on one strand zzso the zzso zzso This zzso zzso repeat can exist in the form of a zzso strand zzso zzso or in an extended form, zzso to a copy strand zzso zzso We recently reported that the zzso zzso is processed in an A9 cell extract supplemented with the zzso zzso protein zzso This processing is shown here to result from the zzso zzso of the complementary strand at a unique position 21 zzso inboard of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA species terminating in duplex or hairpin zzso or in a zzso structure that has lost the zzso zzso are all zzso in the presence of zzso indicating that features distinguishing these structures are not zzso for zzso under the in zzso conditions zzso zzso of the hairpin structure is followed by zzso zzso generating the zzso duplex zzso while processing of the duplex structure leads to the release of free zzso zzso In the majority of zzso displacement synthesis at the right zzso stops a few zzso before reaching the end of the template zzso possibly due to zzso which is zzso bound to this zzso A fraction of the zzso duplex product zzso melting and zzso into hairpin structures zzso of a zzso zzso
