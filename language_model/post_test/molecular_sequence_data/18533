The zzso fungus zzso zzso is one of the most well-known species widely used to produce zzso products for natural food zzso and zzso Our previous research on the zzso zzso zzso and the regulator of G protein signaling zzso indicated that zzso G protein signaling pathways were involved in aspects of growth, zzso and secondary zzso production in zzso zzso To better understand the G protein signaling pathways in this zzso a zzso zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso gene zzso were cloned and investigated in the current zzso The predicted zzso protein consisted of 353 zzso acids and zzso consisted of 94 zzso zzso sharing marked similarity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in zzso zzso similar to those resulting from zzso zzso restricted zzso growth, lowered asexual zzso impaired zzso formation, and enhanced zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, deletion of zzso suppressed the defects in asexual development and in zzso of zzso and zzso caused by the absence of zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso and zzso form a functional zzso zzso and the zzso interacts with zzso to mediate signaling zzso which are zzso controlled by zzso for growth, reproduction and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
