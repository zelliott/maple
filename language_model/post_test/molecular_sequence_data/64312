A zzso slightly curved zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the zzso transition zone of a marine zzso zzso were zzso by means of a single polar zzso The strain reduced zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and used zzso zzso and zzso as electron zzso zzso zzso also grew by zzso of zzso zzso was oxidized incompletely to zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene revealed that strain zzso was related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso include incomplete as well as complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso shared important zzso and zzso traits with zzso zzso and zzso zzso including the ability to zzso zzso incompletely to zzso The zzso zzso gene similarities of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were respectively zzso and zzso zzso Combining zzso and zzso traits, we propose strain zzso to be a member of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso is proposed, reflecting the limited number of zzso consumed by the zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso zzso as a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso A common line of descent and a number of shared zzso traits support this zzso
