zzso new insertions were obtained from seven different locations in the nuclear zzso zzso for seven species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso They were analyzed allowing for terminal sequence conservation by adopting a flexible approach to exact zzso site position, and they were compared with 12 previously reported small zzso sequences from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Such insertions have previously been proposed to be zzso zzso group I zzso however, the methodology used here identified consensus terminal sequences characteristic of zzso zzso This finding is the first suggestion that multiple zzso zzso occur in zzso zzso
