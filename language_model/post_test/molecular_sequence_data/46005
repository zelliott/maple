The zzso of the cholesterol zzso gene zzso is greatly decreased in zzso zzso To determine whether the molecular structure of the promoter is responsible for this zzso we cloned the rabbit zzso promoter, identified the binding sites for zzso zzso factor zzso and liver X zzso zzso and studied the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on its zzso Adding zzso X zzso together with their zzso zzso to the zzso construct zzso into zzso cells greatly increased its zzso zzso did not increase promoter activity, nor did it enhance the zzso effect of zzso zzso the zzso binding site abolished the promoter baseline zzso zzso amounts of zzso abolished the effect of zzso and zzso enhanced the ability of zzso to decrease promoter activity below baseline zzso Thus, zzso of zzso in zzso rabbits is attributable zzso to the zzso of zzso X zzso which increases zzso expression to override the positive effects of zzso Although zzso is a competent factor for maintaining baseline activity, it does not further enhance and may suppress zzso zzso
