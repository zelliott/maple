The zzso protein is required for several outer membrane transport processes in zzso A short zzso zzso segment of zzso has been studied by zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The sequence of this zzso segment contains multiple zzso and zzso zzso repeats that maintain zzso zzso structures and flank a short connecting segment that adopts a zzso zzso This zzso zzso is shown to interact specifically with the zzso zzso the outer membrane zzso for zzso providing the first direct evidence that the zzso protein interacts with outer membrane zzso zzso with the zzso protein involves the extended structural element containing positively charged zzso repeats, and suggests a functional role for this segment of the zzso zzso As zzso is anchored in the zzso membrane the protein must, zzso span the zzso These data, together with studies described in the accompanying paper, suggest a model by which zzso serves to zzso zzso information over extended zzso from the zzso membrane to the outer zzso
