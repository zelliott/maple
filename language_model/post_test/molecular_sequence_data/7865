To study zzso T helper cells in zzso zzso zzso reacting against the zzso zzso zzso we have previously selected five zzso T cell zzso from zzso patients (or healthy zzso against full-length zzso human zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso these can all recognize zzso zzso from human zzso Recently, T cells selected with pooled zzso zzso synthetic peptides have shown greater zzso than zzso Hoping to validate that, we have characterized three zzso and six control T cell lines selected with pooled peptides zzso 33 zzso zzso covering the alpha zzso zzso recurring responses to three particular peptides each showed preferred zzso class II zzso zzso and zzso (or zzso However, none of three lines from zzso patients recognized zzso one from a previous zzso to this zzso in full-length alpha zzso otherwise they resembled those from zzso Moreover, no zzso line responded significantly to whole zzso alpha zzso or even to shorter zzso sharing one zzso with the zzso suggesting specificity for zzso not naturally processed by zzso from zzso Of 20 zzso maintained with individual zzso at least 10 responded to independently zzso overlapping zzso but four others depended on zzso in the original zzso A single line did recognize one longer zzso but only after zzso zzso the processing of this cryptic zzso was evidently the limiting factor here rather than its concentration or the T cell zzso zzso while synthetic peptides are essential for mapping zzso assessment of the zzso zzso T cell repertoire requires full-length zzso processed zzso
