Members of the zzso family of zzso distinguished by a core characteristic sequence of zzso are expressed in a wide range of zzso and zzso and exhibit diverse cellular functions, including DNA transcription, zzso and repair, zzso processing, translation, and zzso zzso Although zzso the function of most zzso proteins is zzso We and others have recently cloned zzso which harbors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in its N zzso zzso (also termed zzso and zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that a discrete domain within the zzso zzso region of zzso directly interacts with zzso This domain exhibits an autonomous repression function and is necessary and sufficient for zzso the zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, intact zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain is obligatory but not sufficient for this unwinding activity of zzso Together, our results support a novel paradigm for zzso repression and demonstrate the zzso role of the zzso domain of zzso
