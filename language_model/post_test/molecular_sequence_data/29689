There is increasing demand for efficient methods to relate zzso information from model organisms to other species of zzso Comparative genetic analyses are particularly valuable to identify functionally important sequence features on the basis of their evolutionary zzso We demonstrate here how a single segment of just 32 or less zzso coding zzso positions can be used to isolate zzso gene sequences from large numbers of species using a zzso zzso zzso The method was used to isolate and determine the zzso sequence of the zzso gene from zzso species ranging from human to zzso Two sequence motifs centered an average zzso zzso downstream of the zzso stop zzso have remained zzso for up to 350 million zzso One of the zzso zzso segments was used to select a primer for amplification of so-called comparative anchor zzso sequences zzso in regular zzso and shown to amplify zzso sequences from DNA samples from 30 out of 33 zzso In conclusion, we present a useful procedure to reveal functionally relevant sequence zzso and to select zzso for amplification of zzso sequences from a wide range of zzso
