We have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso This method was used to measure zzso for the vitamin zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso cell zzso Total zzso from zzso cells was reverse transcribed to obtain zzso which was amplified in the presence of zzso by zzso The zzso products were then zzso in liquid phase to a zzso zzso capture probe for the respective zzso The zzso products were bound to a zzso zzso plate and were detected by an zzso zzso to zzso zzso standard zzso for zzso and control zzso zzso and zzso were obtained after zzso amplification of serial zzso of zzso total zzso As an external standard, an zzso standard curve for zzso was obtained after zzso amplification of serial zzso of a full-length zzso zzso insert obtained from a zzso zzso Thus, we were able to develop a zzso zzso zzso for zzso DNA that is highly sensitive and has the specificity of zzso zzso
