The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 or zzso zzso zzso is expressed at high levels on the cell surface of T zzso and zzso where it mediates zzso and zzso adherence between zzso and other cell types by binding to zzso zzso molecules 1 and 2 on the zzso zzso To initiate studies of the molecular regulation of expression of the zzso zzso we isolated zzso clones corresponding to the zzso region of zzso identified the zzso start sites for zzso and characterized the zzso promoter sequence in transient expression zzso The zzso promoter zzso zzso directed functional activity of a zzso reporter gene in the zzso cell line zzso and the zzso cell line zzso but did not direct functional activity in three different zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter sequence indicated the presence of zzso zzso regulatory sequences with the region from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start sites responsible for most of the in zzso activity of the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso line, and the promoter sequence located within the first 17 zzso relative to the zzso start sites responsible for zzso promoter activity in the zzso cell zzso Identification of the zzso promoter provides the opportunity to identify unique zzso elements and zzso factors responsible for the zzso expression of zzso in human zzso Further, the zzso promoter may be useful in transgenic zzso and in zzso zzso to direct expression of zzso genes selectively in zzso
