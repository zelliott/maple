zzso abnormal zzso with impaired zzso zzso zzso have been described to contain single zzso zzso localized in certain positions of the gamma zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the role of the zzso sequence in the vicinity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso corresponding to gamma zzso was zzso and used to obtain zzso zzso These zzso when zzso zzso on the immobilized zzso bound to the intact zzso and zzso zzso with the same binding zzso However, they did not recognize the gamma zzso zzso on the zzso and reduced zzso zzso The lack of influence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso indicates that the gamma zzso zzso is not directly involved in the structure of the zzso site in the D domain of zzso It is suggested that substitution of zzso either by His or zzso in abnormal zzso results probably in zzso changes which disturb a proper orientation of the zzso site and reduce its zzso
