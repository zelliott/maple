A parallel association study was performed in two independent cattle populations based on 41 zzso targeted single zzso zzso zzso and four zzso markers to re-evaluate the multiple quantitative trait zzso zzso architecture for milk performance on bovine zzso 6 zzso Two distinct zzso located in the vicinity of the middle region of zzso but differing zzso regarding their effects on milk composition and yield traits were validated in the German zzso zzso A highly significant association of the protein zzso zzso zzso with milk composition traits zzso the zzso molecular relevance of the zzso gene in zzso region 1, whereas in zzso region 2, significant and tentative associations between gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the promoter region and zzso 9 of the zzso gene for milk yield zzso were zzso For the German zzso population, only zzso showed a tentative association with milk yield traits, whereas those zzso with significant effects in German zzso zzso zzso zzso showed fixed zzso Even though our new data highlight two zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso region 2, based on the results of our study, currently no unequivocal conclusion about the zzso background of this zzso affecting milk yield traits can be zzso zzso the German zzso and zzso zzso known for their divergent degree of dairy type, differ substantially in their zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
