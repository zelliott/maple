zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family of bacterial zzso Recently, we demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, and G lie in the regions of zzso acids regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso respectively, by the reaction of zzso with truncated zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso acids in these zzso regions of zzso by zzso zzso and examined the effect of these zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso H or S completely lost the zzso activity of the zzso but these zzso still bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso C and G also completely lost their zzso activity, but still bound to zzso zzso In the zzso region of zzso the zzso zzso required for zzso zzso is replaced with zzso zzso we zzso zzso of the zzso region for zzso The zzso activity of this zzso zzso decreased by adding hydrogen zzso or storing at 4 degrees C, and the decreased zzso activity was restored by adding zzso
