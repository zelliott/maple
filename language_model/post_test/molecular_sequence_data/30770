Using a synthetic zzso mixture constructed for a zzso zzso of the bovine zzso as a probe, zzso coding for the full-length zzso of zzso zzso was isolated from a human zzso zzso library constructed on zzso zzso zzso After zzso into the zzso zzso site of zzso and zzso both strands of the insert were zzso using a shotgun zzso Starting from the first start zzso which was immediately preceded by a zzso region including four overlapping zzso consensus zzso an open reading frame for a zzso zzso was zzso This zzso had an Mr of zzso started with zzso and ended with zzso The identity of the isolated zzso was confirmed by comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence with resolved sequences of the zzso peptides of bovine zzso zzso The coding strand of the zzso revealed no special regulatory or zzso signals within 82 zzso preceding the start zzso and no zzso signal within 247 zzso following the stop zzso The coding region, containing a zzso repeat close to the zzso end, was longer than, and very different from, that of the bacterial zzso This region seems to be of zzso origin and shows marked zzso with sequences found in a variety of human, zzso zzso and viral genes and zzso By computer analysis, the first 200 zzso of the zzso end of the coding strand appear able to form a very stable secondary structure with a free energy change of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
