In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates the zzso of hundreds of genes zzso diverse zzso factors, including the type II zzso system zzso and type III zzso system zzso and their associated zzso type IV zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso regulator that is zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is thought to be the major zzso protein that regulates these important zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we have identified a gene zzso zzso an additional putative zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso which we zzso refer to as zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso modeling predicts that zzso is composed of a zzso zzso zzso domain and an zzso zzso zzso domain and is structurally similar to zzso protein zzso A regulatory zzso We show that zzso binds to zzso zzso via its zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso protection zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso a zzso change upon zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso defined the zzso promoter and a zzso site that are necessary for zzso zzso Although zzso is highly regulated by zzso deletion of zzso did not affect known zzso functions, including the zzso the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in a mouse model of acute pneumonia, or protein expression zzso zzso zzso fluorescent protein was found to be localized to the zzso old cell pole in a zzso zzso These results suggest that polar zzso of zzso may be important for its zzso
