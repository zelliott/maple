zzso criteria for the identification of zzso zzso zzso species has relied on zzso identification methods such as host zzso zzso for cattle or zzso and/or the location of zzso inclusion bodies within the zzso red zzso zzso comparisons of new and available zzso zzso were investigated to zzso the relationships among these closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences from 13 zzso zzso (South Africa, zzso Zimbabwe, Israel, USA, Australia and zzso three zzso zzso (South Africa and zzso two zzso zzso zzso and South zzso and two unknown zzso species isolated from wild zzso (South zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and distance trees separated all zzso zzso (and the two wild zzso zzso from the two South African zzso zzso (including original vaccine strain, zzso zzso The Japanese zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the lowest sequence identity to the remaining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships could not be resolved through the zzso zzso zzso whereas strong zzso branch support is demonstrated in the zzso distance tree using zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso species and zzso were confirmed to belong to the same cluster showing strong branch support to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso serving as appropriate zzso Based on zzso zzso a specific zzso method was developed which amplified zzso zzso vaccine zzso zzso zzso This study confirms the suitability of zzso zzso sequences to define zzso and demonstrates the usefulness of zzso sequences for defining species of zzso zzso
