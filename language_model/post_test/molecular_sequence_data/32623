zzso biology as a broad and novel field has also a chemical zzso whereas synthetic biology generally has to do with zzso of new forms of life zzso zzso which do not exist in nature, zzso synthetic zzso is concerned with the synthesis of chemical structures such as zzso zzso zzso zzso forms, and other which do not exist in zzso Three examples of this zzso synthetic zzso approach are given in this zzso The first example deals with the synthesis of proteins that do not exist in nature, and dubbed as 'the never born zzso zzso This research is related to the question why and how the protein structures existing in our world have been selected out, with the underlying question whether they have something very particular from the structural or zzso point of view (for example, the zzso The zzso are produced in the laboratory by the modern molecular biology technique, the zzso display, so as to produce a very large library of proteins having no zzso with known zzso The second example of chemical synthetic biology has also to do with the laboratory synthesis of zzso but, this time, adopting a zzso synthetic zzso the zzso zzso of short zzso where short means that they have a length that can be obtained by zzso zzso for example, from the zzso of zzso zzso The scheme is illustrated and discussed, being based on the zzso zzso zzso by peptides endowed with zzso zzso zzso during chain growth is determined by zzso under the contingent environmental conditions, zzso the peptides which result zzso are eliminated from further zzso The scheme is tested preliminarily with a synthetic chemical zzso method and brings to the synthesis of a zzso zzso which has no zzso with known zzso and which has a stable zzso zzso Finally, the third example, dubbed as 'the minimal cell zzso Here, the aim is to zzso a cell model having the minimal and sufficient number of components to be defined as zzso For this purpose, zzso are used as shell zzso and attempts are made to introduce in the interior a minimal zzso Several groups all around the world are active in this field, and significant results have been zzso which are reviewed in this zzso For example, protein expression has been obtained inside zzso generally with the green fluorescent zzso zzso Our last attempts are with a minimal zzso consisting of 37 zzso a set which is able to express proteins using the zzso zzso These minimal cells are not yet capable of zzso and this and other shortcomings within the project are critically zzso
