zzso zzso receptors zzso are a principal zzso of zzso zzso zzso channel with prominent roles in zzso and disease processes in the central nervous zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso currents as well as being a requisite zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso profoundly changed our understanding of chemical synaptic communication in the central nervous zzso The binding of both zzso and zzso is necessary to cause opening of the zzso zzso zzso Although binding of either zzso alone is insufficient to cause current flow through the channel, we report here that stimulation of the zzso site zzso zzso through the zzso complex, zzso the receptors for zzso zzso zzso binding alone does not cause the zzso to be zzso this requires both zzso and zzso site zzso of zzso The zzso effect of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso site zzso zzso and is blocked by competitive zzso site zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso are primed for zzso by zzso site zzso Our results demonstrate zzso signal zzso through zzso the zzso site of zzso and zzso a model for modulating zzso communication in the central nervous zzso
