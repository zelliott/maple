zzso zzso bacteria have the important role in evaluating water zzso A zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso was constructed to investigate the general toxicity of zzso The gene of zzso amplified by zzso from zzso was cloned into zzso easy zzso and zzso The correct zzso product and zzso zzso were zzso with zzso I, zzso I, then be fused and imported into zzso with zzso Several clones were selected and zzso by zzso and zzso The result revealed that the length of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso When it was zzso and blasted with the zzso in zzso the zzso of the sequences reached zzso indicating the amplified result zzso The sequencing result of the zzso fused with zzso revealed that the gene of zzso had been inserted into the multiple clone site correctly, and the insert direction and reading frame were also zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso then added the zzso pollutants and observed the responding zzso The effect of zzso inducing the zzso strain was best with the dose only of zzso zzso while need the dosage of zzso reached zzso zzso
