zzso of the primary defense mechanisms against pathogens relies on the appropriate expression of pathogen recognition receptors zzso triggering the early release of zzso molecules of the innate immune zzso To analyze the impact of this system on the zzso of infections of the zzso zzso zzso we characterized the bovine gene zzso the key zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso and mapped its precise position on zzso zzso The sequence information was used to establish real-time zzso zzso zzso to measure the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso together with those of zzso 5 zzso an early zzso zzso zzso of the innate system, in healthy and infected zzso zzso zzso strongly increased zzso to zzso the zzso zzso of all of these genes except zzso Slight zzso infections already caused a substantial increase in the copy numbers, though they did so the least for zzso zzso was not zzso since zzso abundance was low in zzso control quarters of the zzso but high in the severely infected quarters of the same zzso The number of zzso copies correlated well with those of zzso indicating coordinated regulation of these two zzso during infection of the zzso Their coordinated regulation explains our unexpected observation that pure zzso zzso infections caused a strong increase also in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso is expressed predominantly in the zzso zzso cells zzso of the infected zzso Our data therefore suggest a significant contribution of the innate immune system to counteract zzso and attribute a prominent zzso function to the zzso
