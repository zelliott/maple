zzso zzso was performed on the class A zzso zzso at zzso zzso which is centrally located in the zzso binding site where it can participate in both zzso and zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso gave a zzso zzso zzso and zzso but which showed a zzso lower affinity zzso for zzso and zzso and a zzso lower zzso zzso activity for zzso In contrast, the zzso activity for zzso was similar to the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso gave a zzso zzso only zzso with an affinity and zzso activity for these compounds approximately zzso lower than the zzso but no zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso produced an zzso capable of zzso zzso only at a low zzso zzso the zzso active site was done from the refined 2 A X-ray structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso into the active site and were energy minimized with the zzso empirical force zzso zzso were stable only when zzso was made zzso and zzso was made zzso zzso energies and distances were calculated for fully hydrated zzso complexes with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso data from all zzso and the zzso interactions from zzso confirmed that the zzso has a structural as well as a functional role in binding and zzso of zzso This highly zzso zzso also plays a zzso specificity role by hydrogen binding the zzso acid group of zzso more tightly than zzso
