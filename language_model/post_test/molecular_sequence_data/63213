In screening for potent zzso proteins zzso from plant seeds, we had zzso a zzso zzso zzso from the seeds of a medicine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso the protein can inhibit the growth of both zzso and zzso Then a zzso zzso zzso was cloned by the rapid amplification of zzso ends based on the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of this zzso show similarity to plant zzso zzso transfer zzso Northern zzso zzso revealed that this zzso zzso designated zzso was expressed in zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco enhanced resistance to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso significantly, while no visible zzso in plant growth and zzso Our data confirm the zzso and zzso function of zzso from zzso seeds and suggest the potential of zzso in improving disease resistance in zzso
