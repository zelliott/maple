The zzso zzso family is a newly identified group of regulatory peptides involved in various aspects of zzso Different forms of zzso are the result of zzso zzso during zzso evolution, but nothing is known about the AM genes before divergence of zzso zzso In the present study, we identified novel AM genes in zzso (a zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso and two zzso zzso The AM of zzso possessed features of both zzso and zzso with gene structure and overall precursor sequence more similar to zzso of zzso and zzso but mature sequence more similar to zzso A sequence reminiscent of zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso another zzso zzso present in the zzso of zzso zzso exists in the zzso AM zzso An AM gene with both zzso and zzso characteristics was also found in zzso and an additional zzso gene was detected in zzso zzso The zzso AM gene from zzso and zzso was expressed zzso in all zzso examined including the skeletal muscle, while the zzso zzso gene transcripts were detected more specifically in the zzso Taken together, the ancestral gene of the AM family appears to possess both zzso and zzso characteristics as observed in the zzso AM zzso and the general structure including zzso was retained by the extant zzso zzso but the mature sequence was retained by the extant zzso zzso
