A zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was cloned by colony zzso using two zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso acid sequences of native zzso zzso and one zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that zzso contains an zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of 340 zzso acids and the zzso of the zzso appeared to zzso to a signal zzso and a zzso processed by a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One domain, which might interact with zzso acid, is highly zzso not only in zzso zzso but also in bacterial and plant zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso but three forms (the mature form, a zzso form and an zzso processed zzso of zzso zzso were present among the zzso zzso
