The microbial community structure of cork with marked zzso aromas was analyzed using zzso zzso gel zzso of amplified zzso zzso zzso zzso and discs were used for DNA extraction and were analyzed by using selective zzso for bacteria and zzso zzso clearly differed from discs harboring a different zzso zzso Moreover, zzso samples of both types were shown to have a specific zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in all samples and were assumed to make only a small contribution to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found almost exclusively in zzso zzso tainted zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were most common in cork zzso where only small amounts of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were the most commonly found bacteria in either control or tainted cork zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso with low amounts of zzso and zzso These results are discussed in terms of biological degradation of zzso compounds by specific zzso Reliable and straightforward microbial identification methods based on a molecular approach provided useful data to determine and evaluate the risk of zzso formation in zzso
