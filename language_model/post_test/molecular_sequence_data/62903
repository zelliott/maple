zzso NO zzso zzso expression is limited to the zzso cell layer of the zzso and developing outer zzso in zzso zzso Using deletion analysis of the previously defined zzso promoter zzso at least three distinct regions that contribute to the zzso zzso expression pattern were zzso One such positive element, designated zzso which comprises at least three distinct zzso was found to include sufficient information to duplicate the zzso expression pattern when four or more copies were used in conjunction with a zzso minimal zzso While known regulators of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso interact with zzso in zzso zzso zzso two groups of proteins that interact specifically with zzso were identified in zzso library zzso Members of one group include zzso zinc finger zzso Members of the second group contain a novel, zzso zzso region and were designated the zzso zzso zzso proteins on the basis of zzso features of this zzso The zzso proteins are nuclear localized and specifically bind in zzso to zzso zzso repeats located within zzso The widespread expression patterns of the zzso and the large number of zzso repeat potential target sequences in the zzso zzso indicate that zzso proteins may affect expression of genes involved in a variety of plant zzso
