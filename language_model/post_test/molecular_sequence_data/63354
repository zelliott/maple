In recent years, several factors required for zzso assembly and/or early growth of newly formed primordial zzso have been zzso but additional factors likely remain to be zzso We have used zzso zzso to compare gene expression in the zzso mouse zzso at 48 h (when primordial zzso are being zzso and at 96 h (when early zzso growth is taking zzso after birth to that of zzso collected zzso h after birth (when zzso have not yet been zzso zzso genes according to their pattern of expression revealed the presence of one cluster of 24 genes for which expression consistently increased at 48 and 96 zzso The top zzso in this cluster encodes a approximately zzso zzso containing an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein is a member of the zzso zzso protein family, termed zzso or zzso It has a zzso zzso that includes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso the zzso is first detected on zzso Day 18, decreasing thereafter to minimal levels on the day of zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso increases again at 48 and 96 h after birth, coinciding with the time of zzso assembly and the initiation of early zzso growth, zzso The specific expression of zzso in zzso and its zzso pattern of expression suggest a role for this gene in the regulation of zzso zzso
