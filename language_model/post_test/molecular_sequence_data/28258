The zzso zzso region of the zzso gene of zzso zzso has been zzso to a point zzso zzso upstream of the putative zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso The sequence reveals a number of symmetry elements between zzso to zzso and two blocks of high local AT content between zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso at about 10 discrete sites up to 110 zzso upstream of the putative zzso initiation zzso Some minor zzso start sites were also observed between the zzso at zzso and a second zzso zzso at zzso suggesting that zzso may also be zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso upstream region has shown that the gene lacks a functional zzso box, and has identified a zzso element that is necessary for normal zzso promoter function during zzso This motif has significant zzso with a component of the zzso promoter which acts to regulate zzso expression by binding a zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso motif may play a similar role in regulating zzso expression and that there may be similarities between factors that regulate zzso expression in zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso
