The molecular basis has been determined for differences in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso leukemia virus of the zzso mouse strain zzso its relative in the zzso mouse strain zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso virus zzso selected in zzso zzso zzso type C virus induced by zzso from the zzso zzso cell line is zzso negative and replication zzso In contrast, viruses produced late after zzso induction in chemically transformed zzso cells zzso are zzso positive and zzso zzso viruses can be converted to zzso viruses by being grown in certain transformed cell zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso cells, which is zzso negative and replication zzso as well as two zzso zzso zzso derived by in zzso zzso zzso exchange between the zzso molecular clone zzso and the zzso zzso virus clone zzso revealed that the zzso in zzso lies 3' of the zzso site located in the pol zzso zzso sequencing established that the zzso zzso zzso was integrated within the R region of an zzso zzso long terminal repeat zzso in reverse orientation and that the virus differed from the infectious zzso zzso zzso by a point zzso substituting zzso for zzso at the potential precursor zzso site for zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso are identical to zzso zzso zzso except that they have zzso at this site and the normal zzso site is thus zzso in these zzso The zzso zzso zzso was blocked in processing of zzso whereas clones zzso and zzso had normal zzso of the zzso precursor into zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and the in zzso zzso zzso zzso had a single copy of a zzso zzso element in the zzso whereas two copies of this sequence are present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso at the envelope precursor processing site of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is sufficient by itself to convert the virus to the zzso zzso zzso Thus, we have established that a single point zzso at the processing site of the envelope precursor protein zzso is responsible for the difference in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso leukemia virus from zzso and zzso mice and that the basis for in zzso conversion is a zzso at this zzso
