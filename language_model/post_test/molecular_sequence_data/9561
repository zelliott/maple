zzso interacting with C zzso zzso is well zzso throughout evolution and plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity by regulating the trafficking and zzso modification of its interacting zzso zzso contains a single zzso zzso zzso interaction domain, which is zzso and shown to interact with over 60 zzso most of which play roles in zzso zzso Several reports have suggested the role of zzso in disorders such as zzso pain, brain trauma and stroke, drug abuse and zzso schizophrenia and zzso zzso lead compounds that block zzso interactions are also now becoming zzso Here, a new modeling approach was developed to investigate binding affinities of zzso zzso Using these methods, the binding affinities of all major zzso interacting proteins are reported and the effects of zzso zzso on these interactions are zzso These modeling methods have important implications in defining the binding properties of proteins interacting with zzso as well as the general structural requirements of zzso zzso The study also provides modeling methods to support in the drug design of zzso for zzso zzso which may further aid in development of the family of zzso zzso as a drug zzso
