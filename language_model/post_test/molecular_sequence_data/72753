The zzso pattern of a recently recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso was established for the first zzso The reference zzso together with 31 environmental and clinical zzso belonging to this species, were examined for their zzso composition by zzso zzso All strains tested exhibited the same zzso zzso zzso were identified as belonging to the type without additional zzso chemical groups zzso I) and the type with a zzso group zzso zzso the identification of the latter was reinforced by the presence of zzso as seen by zzso zzso zzso This zzso profile permits the clear differentiation of zzso zzso from other related species, as members of the zzso zzso zzso This fact is especially zzso strains of zzso zzso are very difficult to differentiate from other species of the zzso zzso complex by means of conventional zzso zzso Moreover, the characteristic zzso profile exhibited by the strains of zzso zzso supports the recent proposal which considers them as members of a new zzso
