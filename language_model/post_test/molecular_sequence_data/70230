The molecular and genetic control of the interaction between tomato races of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tomato was zzso Based on zzso zzso and analysis of in zzso bacterial growth, tomato line Hawaii zzso is resistant to zzso race 1 zzso but not to zzso race 2 zzso Two zzso clones from a zzso library of zzso race 1 zzso converted the normally virulent race 2 zzso to zzso on Hawaii zzso The two clones contained the previously isolated, zzso zzso gene zzso and their activity was localized to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso growth of race 2 zzso in the resistant line Hawaii zzso and an zzso zzso in zzso prevents this zzso In addition, a dramatic increase in zzso leakage of leaves of Hawaii zzso occurred after zzso zzso with race 2 zzso carrying zzso The zzso sequence of zzso revealed one major open reading frame zzso that zzso well with activity analysis of zzso zzso zzso 2-2 encodes a putative protein of 374 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso resistance in Hawaii zzso was studied in a total of 587 zzso individuals from crosses between Hawaii zzso and susceptible zzso The inheritance of zzso resistance in Hawaii zzso appears to be governed by more than one zzso
