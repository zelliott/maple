zzso is a new program for generating multiple zzso alignments of zzso zzso By using a zzso of zzso zzso to find the shortest path through a specially constructed zzso zzso is able to align zzso sequences to zzso structures in zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the operation of zzso and demonstrate the program's zzso We also describe the use of zzso in an zzso procedure that zzso the process of structural modeling and alignment of zzso zzso
