The induction of heat shock genes zzso is thought to be primarily regulated by heat shock zzso factors zzso which bind target sequences on zzso zzso called heat shock elements zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso untranslated regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and we found, in addition to the zzso and divergent zzso multiple sets of zzso elements that have not been reported previously in zzso By means of in zzso analysis of a green fluorescent protein reporter zzso driven by the zzso promoter, we demonstrate that zzso do not represent the minimal regulatory elements for heat shock zzso since the zzso is tightly regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso also showed that zzso are zzso bound to the zzso whereas zzso elements are engaged only after heat zzso This is the first demonstration by in zzso analysis of functional zzso and zzso elements in zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence of a functional link between zzso and zzso elements in the zzso of the heat shock zzso
