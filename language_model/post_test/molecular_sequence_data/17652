The crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined by single crystal X-ray zzso and their zzso properties investigated by molecular mechanics energy zzso zzso of zzso are zzso space group zzso a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, beta zzso zzso degrees, Z zzso 2; those of zzso zzso are zzso space group zzso a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, Z zzso zzso The first compounds zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that represents one of the most potent compounds in inducing the zzso release from human zzso that reflects the zzso zzso From the crystal structure, it is shown that the orientation of the zzso side chain is largely affected by the presence of the bulky zzso zzso was shown to be inactive after zzso of the zzso zzso in the original zzso Nevertheless, the crystal structure does not reveal any influence of the presence of the zzso zzso bond on the backbone zzso The X-ray results have been used to generate parameters for empirical energy zzso zzso a strategy based on random generation of zzso followed by zzso was applied to investigate the zzso space of zzso in comparison with normal zzso From molecular free energy calculations, it is shown that the main influence of the introduction of a zzso bond on the molecular structure is to prevent the existence of zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso a larger number of zzso are found to form zzso hydrogen bonds involving the zzso group, reducing its availability to interact with the zzso For the first time, the theoretical prediction of the existence of zzso zzso for zzso is zzso The resulting zzso are compared to previously active structures of these zzso zzso
