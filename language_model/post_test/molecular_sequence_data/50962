In order to show zzso zzso of fusion proteins with an engineered soluble zzso zzso we have constructed a fusion gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso domain from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The two fusion partners were separated by a zzso recognition sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The fusion protein zzso was expressed zzso in zzso zzso After disruption of the cells zzso was shown to bind to cellulose when present in total crude cell zzso This step efficiently removed the majority of zzso host zzso While immobilized on zzso zzso could be zzso into the expected zzso Upon zzso the zzso part was released from the zzso while the zzso tag, zzso the cellulose binding domain, stayed bound to the cellulose zzso
