zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso with the zzso skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso human zzso zzso were isolated and characterized and the zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso a protein of 31 zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso suggests that the first 7 zzso zzso acids are zzso the next 19 zzso zzso acids form a single zzso zzso and the last 5 zzso zzso acids are zzso The zzso and zzso sequences are not well zzso among the three species, but the zzso sequence is highly zzso Like zzso zzso is highly expressed in rabbit zzso skeletal muscle, but it is expressed to a lower extent in zzso muscle and to an even lower extent in cardiac muscle, where zzso and zzso are highly zzso It is expressed in only trace amounts in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso genes resemble each other in having two small zzso with their entire coding sequences lying in zzso 2 and a large zzso separating the two zzso Brody disease is an inherited disorder of skeletal muscle function, characterized by zzso impairment of muscle zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso have been associated with the zzso zzso inheritance of Brody disease in three families, but not with zzso dominant inheritance of the zzso A search for zzso in the zzso gene in five Brody families, four of which were not linked to zzso did not reveal any zzso in coding, zzso junction or promoter zzso The zzso deletion of zzso in the coding sequence of zzso in Brody disease family 3, leading to a zzso and zzso following zzso in zzso is the fourth zzso zzso to be associated with zzso zzso Brody zzso
