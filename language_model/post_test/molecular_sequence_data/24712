In this article, recent progress related to the use of different types of zzso fusion handles or zzso for the zzso of zzso proteins are critically zzso In addition, novel aspects of the molecular cassette concept are zzso together with areas of potential application of these fundamental principles in molecular zzso As evident from this review, the use of these concepts provides a powerful strategy for the high zzso isolation and zzso of zzso proteins and their derived zzso generated from functional zzso or zzso studies, as part of the zzso technology leading to their commercial development, and in the study of molecular recognition phenomena per zzso In addition, similar concepts can be exploited for high sensitivity analysis and zzso for the zzso of protein zzso interactions at the molecular level, and for the zzso and directed orientation of proteins for use as zzso
