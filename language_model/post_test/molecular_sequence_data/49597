The zzso ring complex zzso consisting of multiple protein zzso can zzso zzso zzso Although many zzso of the zzso have been identified, a complete set remains to be defined in any zzso In addition, how the zzso interact with each other to assemble into zzso remains largely zzso Here, we report the characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso gamma ring protein with zzso repeats zzso With the exception of zzso zzso is the only zzso component identified to date that does not contain the grip zzso which are signature sequences zzso in zzso zzso By performing zzso after zzso zzso in zzso cells, we show that zzso directly interacts with the grip zzso zzso zzso zzso 91, zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may play a scaffolding role in zzso zzso We also show that zzso and zzso like zzso and 91, can interact directly with zzso zzso of any of these grip zzso proteins with zzso promotes zzso binding to zzso zzso In contrast, in the same zzso zzso interacts with zzso but does not facilitate zzso zzso
