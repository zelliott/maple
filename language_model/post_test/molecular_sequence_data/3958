zzso zzso on zzso zzso the capacity to release zzso zzso in zzso The expression of its gene is modulated by nutritional mechanisms dependent on dietary fatty zzso with specific zzso effects of zzso fatty acids zzso The presence of consensus binding sites of zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso in the zzso zzso region of the rat zzso gene has led us to consider the hypothesis that zzso alpha could be involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso by long chain fatty acid zzso Our results have shown that the zzso promoter activity is specifically inhibited in the presence of zzso in zzso zzso cells, whereas saturated zzso have no zzso In zzso cells, the zzso promoter activity is induced by the zzso of zzso alpha or zzso zzso zzso repress the promoter activity only in zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas they have no effects on the promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso From gel shift mobility zzso zzso and zzso experiments, two specific binding sequences have been identified that appear able to account for both zzso by zzso alpha and regulation by zzso in zzso The binding of zzso alpha to its zzso sites is specifically inhibited by zzso fatty zzso zzso A in zzso These data strongly suggest that the mechanism by which zzso suppress the zzso gene zzso involves an zzso of the binding of zzso alpha to its zzso sites in the presence of zzso fatty zzso zzso
