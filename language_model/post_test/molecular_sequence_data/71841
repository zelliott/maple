Human zzso zzso is a highly variable locus showing extensive zzso with zzso ranging from six to zzso repeat zzso zzso and maternal zzso rates to new length zzso were estimated from zzso at zzso and zzso per zzso respectively, indicating that zzso is one of the most unstable zzso isolated to zzso zzso at this locus was also zzso by small pool zzso of zzso and blood zzso Male zzso instability varied from zzso to zzso per zzso and increased with tandem array zzso In contrast, the frequency of zzso in zzso (blood) DNA was far lower zzso consistent with a zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso zzso were further characterized by zzso zzso repeat mapping using four major zzso sites within the zzso zzso This highly zzso system revealed a wide variety of changes in zzso structure, including simple zzso zzso and deletions and more complicated zzso and zzso transfers of repeat blocks, as seen at other human zzso The main mode of zzso zzso however, resulted in extremely complex zzso reorganization with evidence of zzso transfer plus the generation of novel repeats by zzso at the zzso level, suggesting that zzso instability at zzso is a complex zzso zzso
