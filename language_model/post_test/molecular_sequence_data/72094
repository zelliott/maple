We report the cloning of a zzso zzso human zzso 8 zzso using the regulator zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso as a bait to screen a human fetal lung zzso library by the zzso zzso zzso This gene was found broadly transcribed and its zzso size is about zzso zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso band zzso and it encodes a zzso zzso zzso 8 contains in its zzso half a zzso domain found highly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso on target zzso zzso of zzso which are involved in zzso trafficking and zzso In zzso 8, a zzso zzso domain may constitute a zzso zzso It was recently shown that zzso zzso currents can be regulated by zzso zzso a zzso family member, through direct zzso zzso This raises the possibility that zzso 8 may also be involved in such zzso
