We detected the expression of outer surface proteins zzso and zzso and characterized the genes zzso the two zzso of eight zzso zzso zzso from patients in zzso Six of the eight strains shared a common zzso zzso in their zzso and/or zzso proteins to zzso zzso zzso against zzso and were identified to have a zzso zzso zzso on their zzso and zzso genes by Southern zzso zzso One strain, zzso did not express zzso zzso which was due to lack of the zzso zzso Gene cloning and sequencing analysis revealed that it had only one zzso open reading frame with 819 zzso which was similar to the zzso zzso The deletion of the zzso gene could be explained by a zzso zzso based on the common zzso sequences on the zzso zzso
