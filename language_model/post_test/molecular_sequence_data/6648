The zzso zzso zzso zzso locus producing the zzso zzso zzso in zzso is shown to consist of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso arranged in an zzso zzso This differs from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which produces zzso zzso by the complete absence of zzso The deletion covers a region of zzso zzso and includes the entire zzso gene as well as the sequence both upstream and zzso As a result, zzso zzso zzso shares a zzso region common with zzso zzso but includes an additional 10 zzso zzso and a section in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso proteins detected zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso but no translation product for either zzso or zzso was zzso A construct prepared from the zzso zzso locus which has a truncated zzso gene produces zzso rather than zzso confirming this gene is involved in a zzso step in the production of zzso Further, changes made to this zzso result in reduced levels of the zzso
