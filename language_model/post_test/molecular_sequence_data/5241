zzso for identifying the zzso of zzso C virus zzso in clinical specimens are frequently based upon the direct zzso of viral zzso sequences by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification, or by zzso based methods, in which the infecting zzso is zzso from the pattern of zzso zzso to zzso peptides or zzso proteins used as zzso in an zzso Linked zzso zzso zzso Although zzso by zzso zzso methods show generally highly zzso results with the zzso zzso from zzso typing zzso zzso zzso zzso there exist a small number of samples that produce zzso zzso To investigate the underlying reasons for the zzso we obtained zzso samples from zzso and four samples from patients with chronic zzso C that produced zzso results between a zzso based zzso zzso I and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences in the zzso region zzso core, and zzso region were used to identify the zzso of the circulating virus and to identify zzso acid changes in zzso that might alter zzso In 14 samples, sequence analysis of all three regions was zzso with the results of the zzso zzso There were few if any zzso acid zzso in zzso that might have accounted for the zzso zzso results, which were found predominantly in samples from individuals with a history of multiple exposure to zzso It remains unclear whether the detection of zzso in such zzso samples zzso to previous expression of a different zzso than detected by zzso or whether the virus population in plasma is more restricted in zzso diversity than the population in the liver or at other sites of viral zzso
