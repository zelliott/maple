zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and triggers the production of zzso antibiotics zzso zzso and S in zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene zzso was localized in a zzso regulatory island which controls the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and analyzed by gene zzso The zzso gene is flanked by zzso another zzso zzso gene catalyzing zzso reduction of an zzso precursor into a zzso compound, and zzso zzso a zzso regulator for zzso zzso The deduced product of zzso possessed moderate similarity to a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso located in similar gene arrangement to that in the regulatory island of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso created by means of zzso zzso showed no differences in growth in liquid medium or zzso on solid medium compared to a zzso strain, suggesting that zzso does not play any role in primary metabolism or zzso differentiation of zzso zzso In contrast, no initiation of zzso production or zzso production was detected with the strain zzso until 18 h of zzso at which time full production of zzso occurs in the zzso zzso The delayed zzso production of the strain zzso was fully restored to the level of the zzso strain either by the zzso addition of zzso or by zzso of the intact zzso zzso indicating that the lack of zzso production at the initiation phase of zzso production is the sole reason for the zzso of zzso production, and the zzso gene is of primary importance for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
