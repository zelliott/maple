As the use of zzso therapy becomes more widespread across Africa, it is imperative to characterize baseline molecular zzso and zzso peculiarities of drug targets in zzso B zzso zzso We zzso and analyzed 35 reverse zzso zzso and 43 zzso zzso sequences from 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso revealed that the zzso viruses were zzso zzso zzso G zzso and zzso zzso Six of 35 zzso individuals zzso primary zzso for zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and curiously three of the six were infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals had significantly more drug resistance zzso than the other zzso zzso zzso zzso By combining data on zzso zzso bias with the influence of the differential genetic cost of zzso we were able to predict some zzso which are likely to predominate by zzso under drug zzso Some zzso zzso occurred within zzso for zzso B7 and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso at positions implicated in immune zzso Balanced zzso was also observed at predicted zzso zzso sites in the zzso of zzso G zzso The zzso zzso usage and zzso observed suggest the involvement of differential pathways for drug resistance and zzso viral evolution in zzso zzso zzso G, and zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso therapy may have significant consequences for efforts to provide effective therapy to the populations infected with these zzso zzso
