We have examined the nature of signal zzso involving zzso protein zzso in marine zzso zzso Of particular interest is the marine zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso promoter zzso acid is produced and may interfere with signal zzso We have identified zzso protein zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was characterized zzso and appears to consist of two different zzso in the zzso zzso Whole cell extracts of zzso zzso and zzso minimum treated with the specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or zzso demonstrated altered zzso of zzso zzso zzso most likely involving regulation of a protein zzso via zzso zzso A primary candidate for zzso regulation is protein zzso zzso which in zzso zzso possesses a classical zzso consensus zzso zzso We demonstrate that a zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso corresponding to this zzso zzso site can be effectively zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso We speculate that zzso activity among several lower zzso may be zzso directly by zzso zzso Higher zzso may have developed inhibitor proteins to provide more complex regulation of protein zzso zzso
