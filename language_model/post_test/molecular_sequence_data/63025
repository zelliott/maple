It has been demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not -C or zzso from the cell zzso It remained zzso however, whether selective zzso of specific zzso molecules is zzso between different groups of human and zzso zzso zzso zzso To address this, we analyzed a large panel of zzso zzso zzso proteins and we found that this property is zzso among zzso zzso from the M, N and O groups of zzso as well as those from zzso the precursor of zzso and a variety of other highly divergent zzso zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso ability to selectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso and zzso killing of zzso infected cells is zzso among different zzso zzso lineages and preceded the zzso transmission of zzso from chimpanzees to zzso
