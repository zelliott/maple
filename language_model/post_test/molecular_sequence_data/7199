We reported that specific biological activities are confined to three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso the potent ability to stimulate the zzso differentiation of zzso cells is in the zzso zzso zzso 1) domain zzso to as zzso 1 domain zzso the zzso activities that stimulate zzso cell migration and inhibit zzso differentiation are in the central zzso zzso domain zzso domain zzso and the activity that stimulates cell migration in a zzso manner is in the zzso zzso zzso 2) domain zzso 2 domain zzso Human plasma zzso which was zzso without exposure to a zzso such as zzso exhibited no zzso 1, zzso 2, or Cell domain zzso By exposure to zzso or surface zzso zzso showed Cell domain activity but not those of the zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso Whether the cryptic domain activities are disclosed or not depended on whether or not the responsible zzso were zzso exposed from confined environments of zzso structure as confirmed by zzso measurement and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso We then investigated the action of zzso zzso zzso in liberating the zzso 1, zzso and zzso 2 domain zzso zzso released only the Cell domain zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and especially zzso A additionally liberated the zzso 1 and zzso 2 domain zzso The zzso 1, zzso 2, and Cell zzso acquired much higher activities when they were freed from linkage with adjacent zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
