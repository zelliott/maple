The zzso autonomous zzso element zzso was introduced into zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso transformation of leaf zzso All the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and either zzso or zzso for the zzso resistance gene used to select primary zzso The zzso zzso frequency was determined using the zzso zzso of restoration of zzso zzso activity and expression of zzso resistance among progeny zzso Some of the zzso plants zzso zzso zzso in zzso progeny at a high frequency zzso to zzso and contained one or more zzso zzso zzso In the primary zzso zzso zzso probably occurred during plant zzso or early zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso plants at a low frequency zzso or zzso zzso Two zzso of this latter class, containing a unique zzso zzso element, were chosen for further study in the expectation that their zzso resistant progeny would result from independent zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of 32 zzso plants zzso or zzso selected after respectively one or two zzso of these primary zzso showed that 27 had a zzso zzso at a new location and 5 did not have any zzso zzso zzso zzso copy number varied from one to six and almost all zzso events were zzso Southern analysis of the zzso and zzso progeny of these zzso plants showed that zzso continued to transpose during four generations, and its activity increased with its copy zzso The frequency of zzso zzso from different zzso remained low zzso or zzso zzso from zzso to zzso generations when only one zzso copy was zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
