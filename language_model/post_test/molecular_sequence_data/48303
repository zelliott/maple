zzso from animals has been considered to be a preferable approach to alleviate the shortage of human zzso Pigs are the most suitable candidate because of the anatomical and zzso similarities shared with humans as well as ethical zzso However, it may be associated with the risk of transmission of infectious zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are of particular concern because they have been shown to zzso human cells in zzso To date, researches on the molecular characteristics and potential zzso of zzso are still zzso In this report, an infectious replication competent clone of zzso from zzso pigs zzso in China was generated and zzso This infectious clone will contribute to studies on zzso zzso and control of zzso in zzso using Chinese miniature zzso 

The zzso DNA of zzso from zzso was amplified in two overlapping zzso Then the two fragments were isolated, zzso and fused to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso a molecular clone of zzso designated as zzso was zzso Its zzso and replication competency were characterized in zzso cells by zzso real-time fluorescent quantitative zzso western zzso indirect zzso zzso as well as sequence zzso 

The ability of zzso to zzso human cells and produce infectious zzso were shown after zzso of the clone into zzso cells and infection of zzso derived from this zzso zzso The expression of zzso proteins were detected in zzso cells infected with the virus derived from the clone by the indirect zzso zzso and western zzso The results of sequences analysis and comparison combined with the zzso based zzso result demonstrated that the zzso belonged to zzso zzso Compared with a previous zzso DNA clone of zzso zzso G to A zzso occurred in the zzso gene of zzso was found, whereas zzso proteins have the potential to inhibit the replication of a variety of zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso so we presumed these G to A zzso might be the contribution of zzso zzso 

Altogether, an infectious replication competent clone of zzso from Chinese miniature pigs zzso termed zzso was generated, characterized and zzso
