The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was cloned as a series of overlapping zzso chain reaction zzso generated fragments using zzso designed to conserve toxin sequences previously zzso The toxin gene has an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso acids giving a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The sequence identity between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso for the light chain and zzso for the heavy zzso This is much lower than reported identities for the type E zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identity between light chains and zzso between the heavy zzso Previously identified zzso regions in other zzso zzso were also zzso in that of zzso zzso An zzso upstream of the toxin coding region was zzso This shows strong zzso to the 3' end of the gene coding for the zzso zzso component of the zzso toxin from zzso zzso type C zzso
