zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso family of the zzso class in the zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso have caused major therapeutic problems worldwide due to emergence of zzso zzso producing zzso zzso systems serve as a basic zzso zzso mechanism to allow organisms to sense and respond to changes in many different environmental conditions including zzso zzso 

In the present study, we investigated the role of an zzso zzso zzso in bacterial physiology and zzso resistance by generating zzso zzso zzso deficient in the zzso component derived from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was determined under hostile conditions, zzso stresses encountered in the gastrointestinal environment and deletion resulted in higher sensitivity to zzso zzso and acid zzso The zzso was more susceptible to zzso and zzso than the zzso strain, and zzso restored the altered zzso The relative change in expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were decreased in zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso of outer membrane protein profiles indicated a conspicuous difference in the knock out zzso zzso shift zzso demonstrated direct binding of zzso to promoter region of zzso in a concentration dependent zzso 

The zzso envelope stress response system is known to be activated by zzso in zzso membrane composition and zzso zzso and this systematic investigation reveals its direct involvement in zzso zzso resistance against clinically significant antibiotics for the very first zzso zzso results displayed in this report reflect the zzso role of the zzso signaling system and diversity of the zzso zzso in zzso virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
