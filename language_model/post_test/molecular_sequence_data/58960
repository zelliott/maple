zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso in the zzso liver via three sequential zzso In the present studies, we cloned and characterized the zzso gene for zzso the zzso of the zzso that localized to the zzso zzso The structure of the gene was determined by analysis of two zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and compared to the known rat zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso of mouse zzso DNA indicated that zzso is a zzso zzso The gene spans at least 35 zzso with seven zzso and six zzso Two zzso start sites, 139 and 148 base pairs upstream of the translation start site, were detected by primer extension and reverse zzso chain zzso These experiments indicated that the zzso gene is transcribed from a single zzso Finally, the zzso gene was localized to mouse zzso 11 by zzso zzso These experiments represent the first cloning and characterization of a full-length zzso gene involved in zzso zzso
