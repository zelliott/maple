Human zzso clones that recognize a zzso from zzso heat shock protein 60 in the context of zzso were found to be sensitive to changes in the zzso chain of the restricting element, optimal responses being seen with the combination zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso were only able to present zzso peptides to zzso clones when peptides were present throughout the period of zzso of T cells with zzso presenting zzso In contrast the optimal zzso zzso could also stimulate zzso clones zzso when incubated with peptides for 1 h and then thoroughly zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso influenced the strength of binding of zzso peptides to the zzso zzso Modeling studies identified zzso acid 31 of zzso as the zzso zzso most likely to account for this zzso This is the first demonstration that the relatively limited zzso displayed by zzso has functional zzso
