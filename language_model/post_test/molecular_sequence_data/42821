We have zzso an zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat liver, and raised a specific zzso against the zzso protein in zzso zzso studies using this zzso on rat zzso zzso at both light and electron microscopic levels, showed a specific zzso of the zzso of protein zzso zzso in the developing zzso of the zzso The protein was transferred to the zzso zzso from the zzso apparatus at late zzso phase, and remained present in the zzso of zzso during cap phase, zzso phase, and maturation zzso In addition to the zzso the protein appeared in the nucleus of zzso during maturation phase, and was localized in the nucleus of zzso zzso By zzso analysis, almost all of the zzso of protein zzso zzso in the zzso was found to be zzso by an zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso extraction was required for complete zzso of the protein in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso of protein zzso zzso is a new zzso soluble zzso and that the protein begins to enter the nucleus of mature zzso in the zzso and tightly binds to the nuclear components in zzso zzso
