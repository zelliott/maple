Although numerous zzso studies have been performed recently to identify zzso changes in protein zzso only a limited display of relatively abundant proteins has been zzso The aim of this study is to identify novel proteins as potential tumor markers in primary zzso cancer zzso using a high-resolution two-dimensional gel zzso zzso 

zzso using an zzso gel for zzso focusing was used to compare protein profiling of 10 zzso cancer zzso and adjacent normal zzso zzso expression and zzso modification of several proteins were examined using Western zzso analysis and zzso 

zzso proteins of 107 spots zzso that were zzso expressed between matched normal and tumor zzso were identified by mass zzso Among them, 42 unique proteins zzso zzso significantly increased or decreased in the zzso They include zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso 2 zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso channel 1, whose elevated expression in tumor zzso was confirmed by Western zzso analysis and zzso Interestingly, only zzso 1 of two transcript zzso of zzso translation initiation factor zzso was greatly zzso in most of the tumor zzso Moreover, zzso modifications of the zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso also were zzso 

We identified several novel proteins with altered expression in primary zzso cancer using zzso zzso This method is a powerful technique with which to search for not only quantitative but also qualitative changes in a biological process of interest and may contribute to the deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms of human zzso
