zzso cells present spontaneous zzso action zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which can be modified by altering the activity of zzso or zzso zzso We took advantage of this spontaneous activity to screen for effects of a zzso toxin zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso We report that zzso increases the frequency of zzso zzso as do two zzso of zzso channels, zzso and zzso zzso patch clamp experiments show that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso current zzso but does not block other zzso currents zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso channels zzso and L zzso in these zzso In addition, we describe the sequence of a full zzso clone of zzso which shows that zzso has no zzso to other known zzso of zzso channels and gives insights into the processing of this zzso We conclude that zzso is a selective inhibitor of zzso which can be used to probe the role of this channel in the control of cellular zzso Based on the effect of zzso we suggest that zzso is an important zzso of the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
