A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso sample collected from zzso Island in the South China Sea, zzso Growth was found to occur in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and at zzso zzso zzso The zzso type was determined to be zzso containing zzso zzso acid and zzso The major cellular fatty acid identified was zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso and zzso The polar lipids were found to consist of zzso zzso zzso and one unidentified zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was determined to be zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain zzso zzso should be assigned to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A combination of zzso analysis, zzso zzso values, zzso characteristics and zzso data supports the suggestion that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso marina zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
