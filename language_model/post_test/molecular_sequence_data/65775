Recent zzso of microbial zzso data has demonstrated that lateral gene transfers constitute an important and universal evolutionary process in zzso while those in zzso zzso are still regarded as unusual, except for zzso gene transfers from zzso and zzso Here we thoroughly investigated the bacterial genes derived from a zzso zzso on the nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Exhaustive zzso detection and Southern zzso analysis suggested that approximately zzso of zzso zzso in terms of the gene repertoire of zzso are present on the insect nuclear zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso located the transferred genes on the zzso region of the zzso short arm of the X zzso zzso evolutionary and other lines of evidence indicated that the transferred genes are probably derived from a single lateral transfer zzso The transferred genes were, for the length zzso structurally zzso freed from functional constraints, and zzso zzso zzso most, if not all, of the transferred genes have been zzso Notwithstanding this, the transferred genes were zzso detected from Japanese and Taiwanese populations of zzso zzso while the number of the transferred genes detected differed between the zzso The transferred genes were not detected from zzso zzso species, indicating that the transfer event occurred after zzso of zzso zzso which was estimated to be one or several million years zzso These features of the zzso transferred zzso genes are compared with the evolutionary patterns of zzso and zzso zzso fragments acquired by nuclear zzso through recent zzso gene zzso
