Many zzso transcripts have been reported to contain sequences similar or complementary to zzso zzso Past zzso and experimental analyses have suggested a possible functional role of such zzso sequences in the regulation of zzso Here, we zzso the occurrence and abundance of zzso sequences in human zzso Using the wealth of data from zzso and zzso zzso our study indicates that zzso sequences with long highly similar zzso sequences are most likely zzso In contrast, analysis of the occurrence of zzso sequences covering the entire direct and complementary zzso human zzso zzso revealed that many of them are significantly zzso or zzso suggesting their possible involvement in zzso regulation of gene zzso
