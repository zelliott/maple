The selective production of zzso and zzso is highly desirable from the viewpoint of zzso zzso We have manipulated the activity level of a zzso for this purpose because hydrogen and zzso production are closely correlated with each zzso First, we cloned the zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso its expression using an zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso gene cluster contained three adjacent open reading zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso could accommodate an zzso which is the zzso domain of the zzso zzso and zzso contained no zzso but could accommodate several zzso zzso The zzso genes were zzso and the level of the transcript was zzso in the zzso zzso When the zzso zzso of the zzso upstream region zzso zzso was expressed under the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter, significant reduction of zzso translation was observed, indicating that this zzso zzso is effective in strain zzso zzso of hydrogen in the zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity was comparable in both the control and zzso zzso but hydrogen zzso activity significantly decreased in the zzso strain zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso proteins are involved in hydrogen zzso zzso the level of zzso in the zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso production decreased to zzso compared to the control zzso Thus, we successfully altered zzso productivity by controlling electron flow in an zzso zzso zzso
