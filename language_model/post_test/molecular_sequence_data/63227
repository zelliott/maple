We have recently constructed a zzso zzso consisting of two zzso hairpin zzso of zzso connected via a long flexible zzso and were able to show that this zzso can be used to zzso connect DNA zzso This approach provides a second structural element zzso the zzso base zzso for the assembly of zzso DNA zzso from smaller DNA building zzso Since none of the existing zzso techniques for studying this kind of system were found suitable for detection and zzso of the formation of the resulting complexes, we chose zzso correlation zzso zzso In the present study we show that zzso allowed us in a versatile and fast way to investigate the binding of zzso zzso to zzso In particular it also shows its power in the quantitative detection of the formation of zzso complexes and the in investigation of binding under zzso zzso
