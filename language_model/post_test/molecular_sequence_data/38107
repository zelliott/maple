A series of zzso zzso directed against zzso were produced by zzso rabbits with peptides that were zzso unrestrained zzso or zzso restricted by zzso A variety of sites within the region zzso zzso 254 to 290 of zzso were zzso In zzso studies, each of the zzso against the linear and zzso peptides recognized only a single zzso band of 54 zzso in human liver zzso fraction and bound to zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, the relative intensity of zzso bands was considerably stronger for those zzso raised against zzso zzso Similarly, in an zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso peptides bound 10 to 100 times more strongly to zzso zzso than zzso raised against the corresponding linear zzso None of the zzso raised against linear peptides had any effect on zzso zzso activity of human zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso zzso targeted against zzso 254 to zzso 261 to zzso and zzso to 268 of zzso inhibited zzso activity by a maximum of 60, 75, and zzso zzso In contrast, despite binding strongly to zzso an zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso to 290 did not inhibit zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso to 268 of zzso included zzso and zzso and indicates a role for these zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso with peptides zzso restricted by zzso to mimic loop regions of zzso resulted in strongly binding zzso that when targeted appropriately were able to inhibit zzso zzso
