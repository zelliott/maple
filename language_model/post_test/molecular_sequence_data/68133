To investigate mechanisms of cartilage zzso destruction by a study of the effects of a specific zzso of zzso B and an inhibitor of several zzso zzso zzso on cartilage zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were treated with either zzso human zzso alpha zzso zzso or zzso acid in the presence or absence of the zzso and zzso release was zzso Tests for zzso effects of the zzso included zzso rates of protein synthesis and zzso and effects on other zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso B zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso release at zzso zzso but failed to significantly inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of zzso was zzso to both zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso B is implicated in zzso zzso loss of cartilage zzso Its lack of involvement in zzso zzso zzso release suggests the existence of at least 2 pathways of cartilage zzso breakdown, which may zzso at the zzso of a zzso zzso
