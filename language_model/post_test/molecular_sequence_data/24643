Divergent architecture of shoot models in flowering plants reflects the pattern of production of zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene of tomato is a member of a novel zzso family of regulatory genes zzso zzso and zzso that controls this zzso We have identified and describe here several proteins that interact with SP zzso and with its zzso from other zzso a zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor, a novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso has two potential binding sites for zzso zzso one of which is shared with zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso proteins partially ameliorates the effect of the zzso zzso Analysis of the binding potential of chosen zzso SP zzso in relation to zzso features known to be zzso in this new family of regulatory zzso suggests that associations with other proteins are required for the biological function of SP and that zzso binding and zzso association zzso of SP may be zzso We suggest that zzso genes zzso a family of zzso proteins with the potential to interact with a variety of signaling proteins in a manner analogous to that of zzso zzso
