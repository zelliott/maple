The potential of zzso to produce natural products has been exploited for zzso Recent zzso sequence analyses have revealed a previously zzso zzso potential and zzso In order to rationally exploit this potential, we have developed a zzso genetic screening zzso In this zzso zzso approach, genes that zzso tailoring zzso from natural product zzso pathways serve as indicator genes for the identification of strains that have the genetic potential to produce natural products of zzso We chose zzso which are known to be involved in the synthesis of zzso as representative zzso From zzso screening of 550 randomly selected zzso zzso we identified 103 novel putative zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the corresponding putative zzso and the determination of their sequential context with mass zzso analysis of cultures zzso revealed a distinct correlation between the sequence and secondary zzso class of the zzso The described screening strategy allows rapid access to novel natural products with predetermined structural zzso
