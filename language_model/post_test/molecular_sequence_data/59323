The beta zzso zzso factor zzso which binds the A3 motif of the rat I and human insulin zzso is modulated by zzso zzso A single zzso in the zzso binding site of the human insulin promoter zzso the stimulation by high zzso only in normal zzso supporting the suggested zzso role of zzso in the zzso expression of the insulin zzso zzso binding activity was observed in all zzso zzso We have therefore zzso this activity from the rat zzso zzso and found that a single zzso of 45 zzso was responsible for DNA zzso Its zzso acid zzso determined by zzso provided direct evidence that zzso zzso to insulin promoter factor 1 zzso also known as zzso and that, in addition to its essential roles in development and differentiation of pancreatic zzso and in beta zzso gene zzso it functions as zzso of the zzso effect on insulin gene zzso in differentiated beta zzso The human zzso coding for zzso has been zzso its cell and tissue distribution is zzso Its expression in the zzso cell line alpha zzso zzso the zzso human insulin promoter more efficiently than the zzso zzso It is demonstrated that high levels of zzso zzso inhibit the expression of the human insulin gene in normal zzso but not in transformed beta zzso zzso These results suggest the existence of a control zzso such as requirement for a zzso of zzso which may be present in limiting amounts in normal as opposed to transformed beta zzso
