The zzso zzso proteins are zzso factors involved in zzso zzso Many of the zzso zzso proteins bind DNA zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of a human zzso zzso complex revealed that interactions between the two proteins are zzso by the zzso zzso which zzso into a zzso pocket in zzso It was also found that the zzso zzso domain is larger than the zzso zzso zzso containing an additional zzso that is joined to the C zzso of the zzso by a turn of zzso These extra zzso zzso had previously been shown to augment the cooperative interaction of zzso with zzso partners, as well as enhancing the DNA binding of zzso zzso In order to characterize the role of the fourth zzso zzso in greater detail, we have examined the backbone structure of the enlarged zzso zzso domain in solution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the additional zzso of zzso is unfolded when the protein is free in solution and that its folding is triggered by binding of zzso to zzso In contrast, no change in zzso is observed upon mixing the zzso protein with zzso in the absence of zzso This study suggests a model for the assembly of a stable zzso zzso zzso
