zzso of T4 zzso to the zzso coli host cell is zzso by six long and six short tail zzso After at least three long tail zzso have bound, short tail zzso extend and bind zzso to the core region of the host cell zzso zzso serving as zzso stays during penetration of the cell envelope by the tail zzso The short tail zzso consist of a zzso zzso zzso of gene product 12 zzso The zzso A crystal structure of a heat and zzso zzso of zzso reveals three new zzso a central right-handed triple zzso a zzso zzso domain containing a zzso and an zzso zzso reminiscent of but different from the zzso triple zzso The zzso of the zzso domain shows weak zzso to zzso a zzso protein connecting the short zzso to the zzso suggesting that the zzso motifs of zzso and zzso are zzso Repeating sequence motifs suggest that the zzso zzso extends further towards the N zzso and is zzso in the long tail zzso proteins zzso and zzso
