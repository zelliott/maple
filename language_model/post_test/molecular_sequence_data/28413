The zzso sequence for zzso gene of zzso zzso was determined from zzso clone zzso The sequence was composed of zzso zzso which included the zzso zzso of the complete coding region, the 86 zzso of the zzso zzso region and the 110 zzso of the 3' zzso region containing a zzso zzso In addition, the zzso tail was also zzso A potential zzso binding site was located 20 zzso upstream of the initiation zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence deduced from the zzso sequence was zzso zzso in zzso The size of the zzso was zzso zzso by the northern transfer zzso
