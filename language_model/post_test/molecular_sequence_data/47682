zzso replication protein A zzso is a zzso zzso protein with multiple functions in DNA zzso repair, and genetic zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso zinc finger motif zzso that has a potential role in regulation of DNA replication and repair zzso zzso Park, zzso and Lee, zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wood, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even though the zinc finger itself is not essential for its DNA binding activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso DNA zzso binding activity is regulated by zzso zzso through its zinc finger zzso zzso interaction was zzso zzso by the reducing agent, zzso zzso whereas treatment of zzso with zzso agent, zzso zzso acid zzso zzso significantly reduced this zzso The effect of zzso was reversed by the addition of excess zzso suggesting that zzso zzso binding activity is regulated by zzso zzso regulation of zzso interaction was more effective in the presence of zzso M zzso or zzso Cellular zzso factor, zzso was able to replace zzso in stimulation of zzso DNA binding activity, suggesting that zzso protein may be involved in zzso zzso in zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zinc finger zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso did not require zzso for its zzso binding activity and is not affected by zzso Together, these results suggest a novel function for a putative zinc finger in the regulation of zzso DNA binding activity through cellular zzso
