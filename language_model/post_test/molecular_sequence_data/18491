Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from three Chinese marine solar zzso All were observed to have zzso cells that zzso in distilled water, stained zzso and formed zzso zzso They were found to grow zzso at zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The major polar lipids were identified as those typical for members of the zzso but also included major zzso zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unidentified zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of the three strains were zzso zzso showing most similarity to sequences of members of the family zzso and zzso together as a distinct zzso in zzso tree zzso The zzso gene similarities between the three strains were zzso and lower to the sequences of other zzso Their DNA zzso contents were determined to be zzso The zzso zzso and zzso properties suggest that strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso represent a novel species in a new zzso within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
