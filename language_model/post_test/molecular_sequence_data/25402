The zzso of human zzso zzso was tested in several zzso zzso was as efficient as zzso coli or plant and zzso zzso when zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso or for the reduction of zzso On the other hand, zzso was poorly reduced by zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso as monitored in the zzso reduction zzso When reduced with zzso zzso zzso was much less efficient than zzso m and zzso zzso the respective specific zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso could be used in the zzso of zzso although less efficiently than zzso zzso proving nevertheless that it can be reduced by the iron sulfur zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso Based on sequence zzso it was expected that zzso would display a zzso similar to zzso zzso f rather than to zzso zzso However the observed behavior of zzso did not exactly fit this zzso The results are discussed in relation to the structural data available for the zzso
