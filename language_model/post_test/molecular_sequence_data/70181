zzso peptides were used as models for studying the zzso of ice nucleation zzso We chemically zzso four peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso that consisted of two to six repeats of the consensus repeating zzso unit of ice nucleation proteins and evaluated their zzso by circular zzso zzso These model peptides exist predominantly as random coils in zzso solution, but adopt zzso structures in the presence of zzso The stability of their secondary structures was investigated by monitoring the pH and time dependence of their circular zzso zzso Our results indicated that the zzso content of the zzso exhibited a significant pH zzso while that of the zzso and zzso peptides did zzso The zzso was the only zzso that transformed from the zzso to a zzso structure upon zzso We suggest that the overall zzso of the ice nucleation protein could be a zzso
