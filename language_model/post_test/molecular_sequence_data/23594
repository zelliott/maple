zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso for a variety of cell zzso The zzso acid mature zzso protein is zzso by sequences in zzso 20 and 21 of a gene spanning over 110 zzso In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso of bovine zzso sequence zzso to zzso 19 through 21 from zzso genes from other zzso zzso The cloned gene zzso had an unusual sequence composition in the form of an zzso zzso zzso in the coding zzso The sequence was expressed at low levels in kidney tissue and the corresponding zzso contained the zzso zzso The level of similarity between the bovine zzso sequence and the human, zzso zzso zzso and canine corresponding sequences varied from zzso to zzso however, when only sequences zzso the mature zzso protein were zzso the level of similarity between the bovine sequence and the sequence from these species was 59% to zzso The sequence similarity of the deduced mature protein was lower zzso to zzso than the sequence similarity of the deduced zzso Although the cloned sequences could originate from a bovine zzso zzso the possibility exists that they originate from the functional zzso zzso An as yet unidentified mechanism to zzso the stop zzso would allow the synthesis of a functional zzso zzso zzso the cloned sequence could originate from an zzso zzso
