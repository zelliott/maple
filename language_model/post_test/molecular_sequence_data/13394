The two zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso are generated by alternative zzso of the zzso zzso and differ in the length of their third zzso loop involved in zzso to zzso As zzso by zzso chain reaction, the long zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso and to a lesser extend in the zzso zzso whereas the short zzso zzso is relatively more abundant in the zzso and the zzso zzso Changes in circulating sex hormone levels modulated the zzso without affecting the total amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of male rats increased the ratio zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and decreased it in the zzso zzso zzso substitution reversed the effect of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso had a similar effect to that of testosterone in the zzso zzso indicating that testosterone may act after zzso of zzso In the zzso zzso alone reversed the effect of zzso In the zzso neither zzso nor hormonal treatments modified the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of animals with specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed that steroids were acting through their specific zzso zzso These observations suggest a molecular zzso zzso relevant, by which circulating sex hormones could zzso zzso transmission in areas implicated in zzso and parental zzso
