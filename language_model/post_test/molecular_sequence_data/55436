zzso zzso can zzso methanol as its sole carbon and energy source, and the scientific interest in this zzso zzso has focused largely on exploring its potential as a zzso for the conversion of methanol into zzso and zzso We present here the zzso sequences of the important zzso zzso model strain zzso zzso zzso and the alternative zzso strain zzso zzso The zzso diversity of these two strains was demonstrated by a comparative zzso methanol zzso displaying highly different methanol consumption and zzso profiles, as well as major differences in their zzso production levels (406 zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso zzso Both zzso are small zzso zzso zzso compared to those of other related zzso and zzso has two plasmids zzso and zzso while zzso has only one zzso In particular, we focus here on genes representing zzso pathways for methanol zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso the important zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso acid cycle including the zzso pathway, and the zzso pathways for zzso and zzso Several unique findings were made, including the discovery of three different methanol zzso genes in each of the two zzso zzso zzso and the zzso analyses were accompanied by gene expression zzso Our results provide new insight into a number of peculiar zzso and zzso traits of zzso zzso and open up possibilities for zzso zzso engineering of this zzso for the production of zzso acids and other useful compounds from zzso
