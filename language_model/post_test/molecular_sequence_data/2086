zzso screening of a zzso library was used to isolate zzso for zzso that are induced in zzso virus 40 zzso human zzso Several of these zzso hybrid select zzso which zzso zzso proteins found in the zzso component of zzso zzso One of these zzso was used to study the zzso of normal and transformed cell lines derived from various zzso We found that zzso zzso the novel zzso proteins is expressed in two zzso zzso cell lines derived from the oral zzso four zzso zzso cell lines, and two zzso zzso zzso or transformed zzso cells or cell lines derived from zzso of the zzso do not express zzso which zzso to these zzso The results from this study suggest that these zzso may be used to detect markers of transformation in certain cell zzso
