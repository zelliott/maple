zzso can influence the selection of functional zzso zzso or zzso of zzso T zzso However, quantitative changes in affinity of zzso zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso zzso interactions may alter zzso density and zzso zzso zzso zzso The possibility exists to use zzso zzso to induce a partial signal to zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells and, consequently, to regulate zzso zzso Based on binding zzso and resolution of the zzso structure of an influenza virus zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the human zzso class II zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso predicted to modify either zzso class zzso density or zzso zzso When we examined their zzso using cloned human zzso cells, the zzso in general, zzso a zzso in potency reflected by a reduction in both proliferation and zzso production zzso zzso and zzso Although the analogue zzso diminished zzso production, none of the zzso tested could selectively induce only zzso or zzso zzso in general, the zzso functions of the zzso cells examined here were resistant to selective manipulation by the zzso zzso this suggests that for some clones of chronically activated T cells zzso of selected functions may be difficult to zzso
