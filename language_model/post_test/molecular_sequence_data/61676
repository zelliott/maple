The zzso zzso zzso from bovine liver has been isolated from the zzso membrane fraction and zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein required zzso zzso to retain its highest zzso The zzso had a molecular mass of approximately 70 and approximately 140 zzso as evidenced by a single protein band on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso degradation of zzso suggested that it might have a blocked zzso Further zzso mapping coupled with tandem mass zzso determination identified three zzso fragments, zzso zzso and zzso which are highly zzso to human, zzso and mouse zzso The zzso zzso showed pH and temperature zzso at pH zzso and 37 degrees C, zzso The apparent zzso and zzso values were estimated to be 11 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using both zzso and zzso zzso showed potent zzso of zzso with an zzso of 11 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso modification and zzso coupled with zzso competition study suggest that two zzso groups are involved in the zzso but not located in the zzso binding pocket or zzso active zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso near neutral pH and zzso by zzso indicating the modification of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso modification and the extent of zzso showed that two essential zzso zzso per active site are necessary for complete bovine liver zzso zzso
