zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso exhibit one of two distinct zzso in zzso extremely zzso or zzso Previous studies implicated the type I zzso zzso response as being a major factor in controlling infection by zzso zzso To further investigate the possibility that the host zzso response zzso the zzso of the two zzso zzso the zzso of mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso to infection was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso primary mouse zzso zzso zzso cultures as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were also susceptible to lethal infection by zzso zzso Unlike zzso or parental 129 mice, zzso and zzso values for zzso were the same in zzso mice indicating that in these mice infection always progressed to zzso zzso zzso in the skin at the site of zzso and invaded zzso root zzso as efficiently as zzso in zzso zzso Since the zzso host zzso zzso protein zzso by the zzso gene of zzso zzso virus has been implicated in zzso the host zzso response and the zzso of zzso deletion zzso of zzso is very similar to that of zzso zzso the zzso gene was deleted from zzso zzso zzso and replaced with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Like the parental zzso virus, the Delta zzso zzso zzso efficiently in zzso zzso and did not induce a strong zzso zzso The zzso of the Delta zzso zzso was also the same as the parental zzso virus in zzso mice, indicating that the zzso protein does not zzso the different zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, the Delta 41 deletion virus induced a strong zzso response but was still able to undergo multiple rounds of replication in zzso cultures, albeit at a slower pace than the parental zzso This was reflected in zzso as the Delta 41 zzso had an zzso equivalent to that of the parental zzso virus although the time to death was zzso These results indicate that while the zzso protein is involved in preventing and/or suppressing an zzso response, it is not responsible for the ability of zzso to overcome zzso induced resistance of zzso cells and does not zzso the divergent zzso of the two zzso zzso in zzso
