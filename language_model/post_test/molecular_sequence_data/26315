We describe here the construction of a family of expression zzso based on the zzso promoter of the zzso coli zzso gene by removing regulatory sequences downstream of the zzso and replacing them with the zzso zzso These zzso allow cloning of foreign genes in such a way that their products are zzso either in the form of fusion proteins of different zzso or without fusion partners, with or without the original zzso initiation zzso One of the zzso contains a synthetic zzso sequence that helps to stabilize the product of the cloned zzso These zzso allow high-level regulated expression of foreign zzso even if their products are relatively short zzso
