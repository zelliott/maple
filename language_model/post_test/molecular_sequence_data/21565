zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso pathogen that causes zzso disease on many economically important zzso zzso This pathogen exploits sequential zzso and zzso infection strategies to colonize the zzso Transition from zzso to a destructive zzso phase called the zzso switch is critical in symptom zzso zzso zzso likely zzso an arsenal of proteins that are implicated in maintaining a compatible interaction with its zzso Some of them might be transition zzso 

A directional zzso library was constructed from zzso isolated from infected Lens zzso leaflet zzso displaying the zzso switch of zzso zzso and zzso expressed sequence tags zzso with an average read of zzso 600 zzso from the zzso end were zzso Nearly zzso of the zzso were predicted to zzso proteins of zzso origin and among these, 162 zzso were predicted to contain zzso signal peptides zzso in their deduced open reading frames zzso The 162 sequences could be assembled into 122 tentative zzso zzso 32 zzso and 90 zzso zzso analyses of zzso revealed four potential groups: zzso cell envelope associated proteins zzso candidate zzso and other zzso Eleven candidate zzso genes were identified based on features common to characterized zzso zzso zzso they zzso small, soluble zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins with a putative zzso For a selected subset of zzso and candidate zzso zzso zzso showed that these transcripts were either expressed zzso in both in zzso and in zzso or induced during plant zzso Using potato virus X zzso based transient expression zzso we showed that one of the candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 that encodes a zzso zzso domain containing zzso unlike zzso proteins from other zzso pathogens was unable to elicit a hypersensitive response zzso 

The current study zzso proteins zzso zzso at the in zzso zzso transition of zzso zzso Some of these proteins may have a role in establishing compatible interaction with the host zzso
