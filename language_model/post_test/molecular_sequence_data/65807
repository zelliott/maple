The regulation of the zzso responses may be influenced by the proteins that associate with zzso receptors zzso rather than solely with the receptors zzso zzso is expressed in blood vessels and may play an important role in vascular zzso We hypothesized that specific proteins interact with zzso to zzso its response to zzso By means of a zzso two hybrid screen, we discovered that zzso a zzso protein associates specifically with zzso zzso and zzso consistently zzso in a variety of human zzso zzso breast zzso whereas zzso and zzso did not zzso zzso response zzso zzso increased by zzso when zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cells zzso or zzso Moreover, there was a synergistic effect of zzso zzso with zzso treatment on the reduction of zzso cell migration zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso associates with zzso and is capable of modulating zzso gene transcription, as well as cell zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in modulating the response to zzso and zzso zzso perhaps even within the context of vascular zzso
