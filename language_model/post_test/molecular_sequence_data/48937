zzso is a zzso integral membrane zzso specifically associated with plasma membrane zzso in zzso and zzso cells including zzso and zzso stem zzso Here we report the identification as well as molecular and cell biological characterization of zzso zzso and human zzso a zzso zzso structurally related to zzso zzso to as zzso Although the zzso acid identity between zzso and zzso is low zzso their zzso organization is zzso similar, suggesting an early gene zzso zzso Like zzso zzso exhibits a characteristic membrane zzso with five zzso segments and two large zzso zzso zzso Upon its zzso expression in Chinese zzso zzso cells as a green fluorescent protein fusion zzso zzso was also found to be associated with plasma membrane zzso as revealed by its zzso with zzso suggesting a related zzso zzso with this, zzso shows a similar tissue distribution to zzso being highly expressed in the adult kidney and detected all along the zzso tract as well as in various other zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso was not detected in the eye, which perhaps explains why a zzso function zzso in the human zzso gene causes retinal zzso but no other obvious pathological zzso Finally, we present evidence for the existence of a family of zzso membrane zzso the zzso which are zzso in zzso
