The zzso binding zzso of zzso and zzso compete for the same site on zzso filaments with similar binding zzso Both contain tandem repeats of approximately 125 zzso zzso the first of which is shown to contain the zzso zzso We have replaced the zzso binding domain in the zzso half of zzso by that of zzso The hybrid zzso filaments almost as efficiently as does zzso or its zzso half, but unlike the latter, requires calcium zzso The hybrid binds two zzso zzso and caps the barbed ends of filaments in the presence or absence of zzso The cap produced by the hybrid binds with lower affinity than that of zzso and is not zzso It zzso from filament ends with a half life of approximately 15 zzso Although there is no extended sequence zzso between these two different zzso binding zzso our experiments show that they are functionally equivalent and provide new insights into the mechanism of zzso zzso
