zzso B viruses of zzso 5 are associated frequently with sporadic cases of neurological diseases, zzso of meningitis, and chronic diseases such as zzso and zzso In this article, 15 strains of zzso B5 isolated from patients with neurological disorders and healthy people were investigated by partial sequencing in the zzso half of the zzso region and compared to other published sequences of zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso All zzso B5 sequences showed less than zzso zzso difference between each other and a minimum of zzso of divergence with zzso sequences from other zzso B zzso Within the zzso B5 group of zzso four clusters were individualized and may zzso to four zzso one zzso with large geographical distribution, containing most recent strains that have circulated from 1984 to 2000, another zzso represented by the zzso Faulkner strain, isolated in the early 1950s, and two intermediate zzso zzso strains isolated from 1970 to 1999 and closely related to zzso zzso disease zzso This study confirms the ability of partial sequencing in zzso to determine zzso and to genetically characterize zzso B5 field zzso It gives a first approach on the molecular epidemiology of these zzso which have a particular importance in human zzso
