zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso membrane protein that plays a central role in the metabolism of zzso and in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Numerous studies have established that this protein is expressed both in the zzso zzso and at the zzso plasma zzso zzso evidence has suggested that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso membrane with two distinct zzso zzso To further characterize the membrane zzso and targeting of this zzso an zzso site was engineered into zzso to serve as a zzso probe for the zzso of the cellular location of zzso zzso The zzso for zzso and this zzso zzso zzso were then expressed in zzso and in zzso zzso Analysis of total expressed protein in these systems indicated that zzso was largely zzso suggesting that expression in the zzso was primarily of a type I orientation zzso However, analysis, by zzso labeling procedures, of zzso expressed at the surface of zzso zzso cells, showed it to be fully zzso indicating that the zzso form targeted to this site originally had a type II orientation zzso in the zzso The surface expression of zzso was also confirmed by zzso zzso scanning zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso to the charge at the zzso domain was demonstrated by altering the net charge over a range of 0 to zzso The introduction of one positive charge led to a significant inversion in zzso zzso based on zzso site zzso A truncated form of zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso domain was also detected on the zzso surface of zzso zzso cells, demonstrating the existence of at least one additional zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be integrated into the membrane with multiple zzso zzso and is inserted into the zzso membrane with two zzso zzso one of which is targeted to the plasma membrane where it mediates zzso acid zzso
