Three members of the zzso zzso family were characterized in zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso 2 and the orphan zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso cells, all three receptors displayed a high degree of zzso signaling zzso The structurally zzso zzso zzso served as a zzso silent zzso upon zzso zzso however, it signaled with a similar efficacy to the three related zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso and of zzso zzso 2 through the zzso zzso C zzso was approximately 50% of their zzso capacity as determined through zzso zzso zzso These two receptors also showed very high zzso activity in zzso of zzso response zzso zzso zzso displayed a clear but lower degree of zzso activity through the zzso zzso and zzso response element zzso In contrast, zzso signaled with the highest zzso activity in respect of zzso of serum response zzso transcription, in part, zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso feeding experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso but could be trapped at the cell surface by an inverse zzso whereas zzso remained at the cell zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso activity of both the zzso zzso and zzso could systematically be tuned up and down depending on the size and zzso of the side chain in position zzso in the context of an aromatic zzso at zzso and a large zzso zzso at zzso It is concluded that the three zzso receptors display an unusually high degree of zzso activity, the structural basis for which is determined by an aromatic cluster on the inner face of the zzso ends of zzso VI and zzso
