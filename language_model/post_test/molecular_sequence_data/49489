zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the core zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso does not contain a zzso domain, and it specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso We have solved a zzso A resolution structure of the zzso domain of human zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso The structure reveals a unique organization of a mainly zzso zzso domain and a central open zzso structure, an active site consisting of a SAM binding pocket, and a potential zzso binding zzso We also show that a flexible, positively charged region at the C zzso of the zzso domain is critical for zzso binding and zzso zzso These structural and zzso zzso combined with molecular zzso provide zzso insights into the zzso mechanism and zzso specificity of zzso zzso
