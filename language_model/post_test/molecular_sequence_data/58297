The zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso DNA templates specifying zzso regions yielded terminated and zzso transcripts of the expected zzso zzso of the zzso regulatory protein plus UMP led to greatly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to probe possible secondary structures in the zzso zzso that were proposed to play roles in controlling zzso zzso predicted to disrupt zzso structures suppressed zzso whereas zzso predicted to disrupt the stem of zzso zzso strongly promoted termination at the usual termination zzso zzso that disrupt a previously zzso zzso structure, called the zzso the formation of which interferes with formation of the downstream zzso suppressed zzso We propose that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is governed by switching between alternative zzso versus zzso plus zzso structures, and that zzso acts by zzso binding to and stabilization of the zzso
