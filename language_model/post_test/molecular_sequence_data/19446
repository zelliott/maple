zzso peptides in zzso T cell responses to pathogens and tumors are not always tight zzso to zzso class I zzso Furthermore, zzso peptides that bind zzso to the zzso can be problematic when designing vaccines to elicit zzso T cells in zzso or for the production of zzso zzso for enumerating zzso T cells in zzso Thus, to enhance zzso binding to zzso class I, we have engineered a zzso bond to trap zzso peptides into the binding groove of zzso zzso class I molecules expressed as zzso zzso or zzso These zzso with zzso zzso termed zzso oxidized properly in the zzso zzso zzso to the cell surface, and were recognized by T zzso zzso a zzso trap created remarkably tenacious zzso complexes because the zzso zzso of the zzso was not displaced by zzso competitor zzso even when relatively weak binding peptides were incorporated into the zzso This technology promises to be useful for DNA vaccination to elicit zzso T cells, in zzso study of zzso T cell development, and construction of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and tracking of T zzso when the zzso zzso has relatively weak affinity for the zzso
