zzso rate processes in zzso solutions of zzso zzso pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso at 36 degrees C were investigated by measuring the rotating frame relaxation times of the backbone zzso spins as a function of the zzso zzso Two different zzso exchange processes were zzso A first local rate process involved the zzso zzso and zzso had a correlation time of about zzso zzso and was related to zzso of the zzso of the zzso bond zzso A second, faster zzso mode was superimposed on the zzso bond zzso and was tentatively attributed to local zzso motions in the zzso sequence zzso The correlation time for the overall zzso tumbling of the protein was found to be 2 zzso using the assumption that relaxation is dominated by zzso zzso and chemical shift zzso modulated by zzso molecular zzso
