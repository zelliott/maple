An zzso method is described for determining zzso acid zzso zzso for peptides which contain more than one zzso of the same zzso or basic zzso zzso The method is based on using the differences in C alpha H zzso chemical shifts which result from zzso sequence zzso and possibly secondary structure effects to resolve zzso for zzso reporter zzso adjacent to each zzso zzso group in two-dimensional total correlation zzso zzso zzso Acid zzso zzso were determined for each of the four zzso zzso ammonium groups of the zzso zzso zzso for the C zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the four zzso ammonium groups, which overlap in the one-dimensional spectrum, were resolved using the C alpha zzso zzso zzso cross zzso in the zzso zzso Chemical zzso zzso data were obtained for each zzso zzso ammonium group from one-dimensional zzso taken from two-dimensional zzso zzso measured as a function of zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ammonium groups were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The chemical zzso zzso data were also analyzed by a zzso procedure to obtain relative acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to relative zzso for the zzso ammonium groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso To further demonstrate the utility of this method, acid zzso zzso were determined for the six zzso groups of the zzso zzso Chemical zzso zzso zzso were obtained for the C beta zzso zzso adjacent to the two zzso zzso groups using one-dimensional zzso taken from zzso zzso measured as a function of zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso groups were determined to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative acid zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso by the zzso calculation zzso
