The binding of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso DNA targets zzso zzso and zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso It is found that the zzso bind zzso to their complementary targets, weaker to targets containing one mismatch and not to targets containing two zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso system, it is found that a zzso zzso bound downstream from the promoter causes zzso zzso arrest at the zzso binding site only when the zzso is bound to the template zzso Finally, it is shown that primer extension by zzso DNA zzso on a zzso template is arrested at an occupied zzso zzso binding zzso These results are discussed in relation to zzso as potential zzso and zzso zzso
