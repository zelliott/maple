Recent studies have implied that the zzso zzso small zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as zzso zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, and as zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso is thus considered a key to understanding the fundamental metabolism of the earliest zzso We describe for the first time the crystal structure of zzso which displays dual zzso zzso The crystal structure unexpectedly shows that four molecules create an zzso assembly with zzso zzso linkages having a skewed 222 zzso zzso Although the overall fold of the zzso zzso is related closely to domain 4 of the zzso zzso one zzso in the zzso structure is replaced by a short loop with relatively high temperature factor zzso Because this region is essential for discriminating the structurally similar zzso based on interactions with its diversified zzso the loop structure in the zzso must be dependent on the presence of a zzso The flexibility of the loop region might be a structural basis for recognizing both zzso and zzso zzso of two distinct zzso zzso and zzso
