We have approached the development of a human zzso virus type 1 zzso therapeutic product by producing immune cells zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were made resistant to zzso by the introduction of a DNA construct zzso that contained three independent zzso sequences directed against two functional regions, zzso response and zzso of the zzso zzso Each sequence was incorporated into the transcribed region of a zzso zzso gene to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressed all three zzso zzso zzso and these transcripts accumulated in the zzso These cells were subjected to two successive challenges with zzso zzso zzso The surviving cells showed normal growth characteristics and have retained their zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that essentially all of the surviving cells produced zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso zzso was observed, no zzso formation was observed, and zzso zzso gag sequences were not zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso similarly yielded no infection at a relatively high zzso of zzso As a further demonstration that the zzso zzso directed against zzso was functioning in these zzso immune cells, zzso expression of zzso zzso was shown to be specifically inhibited in cells expressing zzso and zzso response region zzso zzso
