zzso is a zzso factor common to several zzso pathogens that is required for zzso survival and growth in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso is induced by zzso zzso Despite the high level of zzso zzso induction in zzso zzso the zzso protein is hardly detected in a zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso expression is dependent on a zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso promotes zzso degradation by the zzso zzso providing a negative regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso that prevent both regulation and interaction between the two zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso led to a decrease of the replication rate of zzso This study highlights the role of peptides in bacterial regulatory mechanisms and provides a natural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
