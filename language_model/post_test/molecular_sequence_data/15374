To investigate the effects of zzso in domain III of the zzso C virus zzso internal zzso entry sequences zzso on the response of chronic zzso zzso zzso patients to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was extracted from 19 chronic zzso zzso patients receiving zzso therapy who showed dramatic differences in their response to combination therapy after initial viral zzso zzso domain III was cloned and 15 clones for each patient were zzso The obtained sequences were aligned with zzso zzso zzso using the zzso program and zzso zzso zzso of zzso secondary structure and zzso stability of the major zzso in each patient was performed using the zzso zzso program with Turner energies and selected constraints on base zzso 

Analysis of zzso secondary structure revealed that insertions in domain III altered zzso base pairing of stems and reduced molecular stability of zzso which may ultimately reduce binding affinity to zzso zzso zzso zzso in domain III were statistically more prevalent in sustained viral response patients zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to breakthrough zzso zzso zzso 5) zzso 

The influence of zzso within domain III on the response of zzso patients to combination therapy depends primarily on the position, but not the frequency, of these zzso within zzso domain zzso
