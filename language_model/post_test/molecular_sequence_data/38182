The pulse of zzso that triggers zzso metamorphosis activates six early genes in a primary response made visible by zzso zzso zzso The secondary response is detected by the induction of over 100 late zzso only a few of which have been subject to molecular genetic zzso We present a molecular and zzso analysis of the zzso gene responsible for the late puff at zzso This gene contains overlapping zzso B, and C zzso units of which the A unit encodes two zzso and the B unit zzso The C unit, which exhibits little activity, encodes one of the B zzso Evidence that zzso but not zzso zzso is zzso responsive derives from their zzso zzso profiles and from zzso zzso showing that zzso induction of the zzso puff requires sequences adjacent to the zzso end of zzso but not those adjacent to the zzso end of zzso zzso lethal zzso showed that zzso is required not only for zzso but also zzso and for embryonic and zzso zzso The zzso proteins contain a common zzso zzso sequence that is zzso identical to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso tests of zzso proteins altered by zzso zzso showed that they exhibit zzso zzso zzso proteins are widely distributed among late zzso and zzso zzso and are unlikely to be involved in cell cycle zzso
