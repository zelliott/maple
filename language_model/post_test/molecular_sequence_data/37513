To study the effect of sequence zzso between different zzso of zzso on the zzso properties of the zzso protein of strong zzso region at position zzso by using zzso zzso 

Thirteen representative sequences from zzso zzso 1 to 6 were selected to design synthetic genes zzso for this zzso zzso These genes were assembled by zzso from synthetic zzso and expressed in zzso as hybrid proteins with zzso zzso All 13 fusion proteins were zzso from bacterial zzso and used to test a panel of zzso positive zzso zzso obtained from patients infected with zzso zzso 1 through zzso 

A comparison of sequences derived from different zzso zzso showed that the primary structure of this strong zzso region is highly zzso zzso zzso between different zzso sequences varied from zzso to zzso All but one protein zzso with zzso to zzso of serum zzso Although a variable degree of zzso specific zzso zzso was zzso only one protein demonstrated a noticeable preference to zzso with zzso against the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, closely related proteins derived from the same zzso or zzso zzso with significantly different efficiency with zzso zzso 

Different zzso zzso genes were successfully zzso expressed and zzso zzso zzso has a profound effect on the zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This finding should be considered in the development of diagnostic tests for the efficient detection of zzso activity in serum zzso
