zzso virus zzso 3 zzso was associated with severe dengue zzso in Thailand during zzso We studied Thai zzso viruses isolated from hospitalized children in Bangkok with differing disease severity during that zzso zzso were zzso at their zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso which are regions that play a pivotal role in viral zzso Our results indicated that the primary sequences as well as the secondary structures at both ends of Thai zzso viruses were highly zzso over almost three zzso We found zzso insertions and deletions at the variable region zzso that is located just downstream of the zzso protein 5 zzso stop zzso among these zzso The zzso tree derived from the size zzso of zzso in the 3' zzso divided zzso into four zzso and Thai zzso viruses in this study belonged to zzso zzso The replication efficiency of the candidate viruses with different lengths at the zzso were assessed in the zzso zzso and human zzso cell zzso Our results show that the viruses with zzso insertions at zzso zzso better than the virus that contained zzso Our findings indicate that Thai zzso demonstrated a remarkable conservation of zzso over 28 zzso zzso with disease severity suggests that both primary sequences and secondary structures of the 3' zzso do not appear correlated with disease severity in zzso
