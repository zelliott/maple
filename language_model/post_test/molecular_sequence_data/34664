zzso zzso ID zzso is an zzso zzso hypothetical protein from zzso zzso strain zzso with a calculated zzso of zzso and a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity to zzso exist in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso Here we report the zzso backbone resonance assignments of zzso About zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 88 zzso of zzso were zzso On the basis of these assignments, three zzso regions and four strand regions were identified using the zzso zzso This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of zzso and studying its interaction with its zzso if any, and/or with other zzso
