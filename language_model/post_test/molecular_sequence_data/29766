zzso surface proteins of zzso zzso are one major group of zzso currently being investigated and tested as malaria vaccine zzso Two recently described zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso are zzso proteins that each contain a single zzso domain and appear to have arisen by an ancient gene zzso zzso The genes are found in tandem on zzso 2 of zzso zzso and the zzso region of the zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In these species, there is only a single zzso designated zzso zzso a single zzso domain similar to the zzso domain in both zzso and zzso zzso of mice with zzso provides mice with high levels of protection against lethal challenge with blood stage zzso zzso In this study, we show that in zzso zzso which is quite zzso distant from zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso can be found with their relative arrangements with respect to the surrounding genes mostly zzso However, the gene for zzso found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is absent from zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes have a zzso structure and zzso proteins with potential signal and zzso anchor sequences and a single zzso domain near the zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso proteins show that each of the zzso react with distinct proteins of 62 zzso for zzso and 86 zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized zzso over the entire surface of zzso zzso zzso as expected, zzso the zzso zzso was found to be associated with an zzso zzso location consistent with zzso or over the polar zzso
