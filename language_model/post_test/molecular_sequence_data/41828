The zzso gene encodes a small nuclear zzso zzso zzso thought to be involved in zzso of zzso A closely related zzso zzso is zzso expressed in all zzso except the brain, where zzso is predominantly zzso The mouse zzso of the zzso gene has been shown to be functionally imprinted in mouse brain, being expressed only from the zzso derived zzso zzso has been mapped to human zzso zzso within the shortest region of deletion overlap for the zzso zzso We have now demonstrated functional zzso of the human zzso gene using reverse zzso followed by the zzso chain reaction zzso No expression was observed in cultured skin zzso of zzso patients, but was found in all zzso patients and normal controls zzso We have also demonstrated a zzso DNA zzso imprint within zzso 5 of the zzso zzso which suggests an zzso mechanism by which zzso expression of this gene might be zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is expressed only from the zzso derived zzso 15 in humans and therefore may fulfill one major criterion for being involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso
