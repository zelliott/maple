zzso zzso serves as a mechanism to control cellular zzso The zzso zzso sensor in zzso responds to zzso zzso acids by zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso The processing zzso zzso is regulated via zzso degradation of its zzso associated zzso zzso We find that degradation of the zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso zzso sites and zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso acid zzso the zzso is modified in a series of linked events by a set of general regulatory factors involved in diverse signaling zzso First, an zzso zzso zzso change triggers zzso zzso by the zzso active plasma zzso zzso zzso I zzso Next the zzso becomes a zzso for zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso Finally, the modified zzso is zzso zzso by the zzso zzso These integrated events are requisite for zzso the zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso The zzso zzso motif resembles the zzso and zzso zzso of regulators in the zzso zzso zzso Our work defines a novel zzso zzso cascade that regulates an zzso signaling zzso and illustrates how general signaling components are recruited to distinct pathways that achieve conditional and specific signaling zzso
