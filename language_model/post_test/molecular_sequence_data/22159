The zzso zzso zzso zzso uses molecular oxygen to zzso a zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso to the zzso active zzso zzso degrade and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso results in multiple zzso zzso a fatal zzso The previously determined zzso crystal structure revealed two crucial zzso zzso in the active site, one of which was thought to be implicated in zzso zzso The other zzso zzso zzso in a novel zzso mechanism that does not rely on any zzso Here, we present crystal structures of the individual zzso zzso zzso and employ chemical probing of zzso zzso which defined the zzso to differ strongly in their zzso This striking difference in zzso is explained by the distinct roles of these zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso an zzso complex as an essential cornerstone for the structural evaluation of the zzso formation mechanism has remained zzso We also present two zzso complexes with zzso and zzso peptides that mimic zzso The peptides isolate a small cavity that is a likely binding site for molecular oxygen and could host zzso oxygen zzso during zzso zzso zzso these zzso complexes directly unveil the molecular bases of zzso zzso binding and zzso Because of the zzso nature of zzso sequences in other organisms, this binding mechanism is of general zzso Furthermore, several zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso are explained by this binding zzso
