zzso zzso is an extreme zzso considered to be a rich source of stress responsive genes and an zzso database revealed that zzso of its genes are zzso In order to ascertain its function, a gene zzso of unknown function was made full length using zzso cloned and zzso The full length gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso for a protein that belongs to the universal stress protein zzso family that was named zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso and exhibited characteristic zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso Further, zzso analyses suggested a probable role in zzso process of zzso compounds including signal zzso In zzso transcript profiling exhibited a significant expression response zzso to salt stress, additionally abundant of zzso transcripts were observed during drought, heat and cold stress, reaching a maximum increase of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, at 12 or zzso The zzso expression of this gene in zzso coli provided enhanced stress tolerance and zzso cells have higher growth rate compared to zzso alone and showed growth at up to a zzso dilution in the spot zzso It was predicted that zzso may be directly involved in tolerance mechanisms or function as a molecular switch zzso zzso to activate the stress zzso zzso However, further investigation will be required to determine its role as a molecular switch and mode of action during zzso
