A previous study zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso intermediate chain zzso from the zzso outer arm zzso is in direct contact with zzso in zzso suggesting that this protein may be involved in binding the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso genetic analysis of this chain recently demonstrated that it is a zzso repeat protein essential for outer arm assembly zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We have now transcribed and translated zzso in zzso and demonstrate that this zzso binds zzso and zzso whereas a zzso protein (the zzso intermediate chain zzso of zzso outer arm zzso does zzso Thus, zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso Taken together with the previous results, these findings indicate that zzso is likely to provide at least some of the adhesive force that holds the zzso to the zzso zzso and support the general hypothesis that the zzso intermediate chains are involved in targeting different zzso to the specific cell zzso with which they zzso Analysis of the binding activities of various zzso deletion zzso translated in zzso identified discrete regions of zzso that affected the binding to zzso two of these regions are specifically missing in zzso Previous studies also showed that zzso is in direct contact with zzso the current work indicates that the region of zzso that mediates this interaction is zzso with two of zzso zzso zzso This supports the hypothesis that these repeats are involved in zzso interactions within the zzso zzso
