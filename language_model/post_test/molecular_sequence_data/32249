zzso zzso was originally isolated as a general zzso factor required for zzso zzso zzso transcription, and later found to be a zzso of zzso complex that has been implicated in regulating protein zzso during zzso In this study, zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of human zzso caused leaf zzso and abnormal leaf zzso without altering the overall growth of the zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed and the zzso fusion protein is primarily targeted to the zzso At the cellular level, zzso of zzso expression reduced the zzso sizes and zzso zzso The affected cells produced excessive amounts of zzso oxygen zzso Furthermore, the transcript level of various zzso and zzso genes was severely reduced in the zzso leaf zzso These findings indicate that depletion of zzso activity zzso affected development and/or physiology of zzso and zzso in plants, possibly by zzso efficient zzso of the nascent zzso proteins into the zzso
