Adult zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso virus zzso exhibit extremely low levels of zzso virus zzso do not succumb to zzso disease, and are protected from experimental challenge with zzso zzso of zzso Similarly, rare humans found to be infected with zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso display exceptionally low viral burdens and do not show evidence of disease progression after many years of zzso zzso zzso zzso the rapid zzso and zzso degradation of cell surface zzso and enhances virus zzso in primary human T cells and zzso Although expression of zzso zzso also leads to zzso of cell surface zzso levels, no evidence for zzso zzso enhancement of virus zzso was observed in earlier zzso Thus, it remains unclear whether fundamental differences exist between the activities of zzso and zzso zzso To establish more clearly whether the zzso and zzso zzso gene products are functionally zzso we compared the replication zzso and zzso of zzso of zzso that either do zzso or do not zzso delta zzso zzso intact zzso gene zzso zzso replicates more rapidly than zzso viruses in both human and zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso As previously described for zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhances virus zzso within each cycle of virus zzso As a strategy for evaluating the in zzso contribution of zzso zzso zzso and long terminal repeat regulatory sequences to the zzso of zzso disease, we constructed zzso zzso in which the zzso coding and zzso regulatory regions of zzso were replaced by the corresponding regions from zzso zzso zzso displays enhanced zzso and accelerated replication zzso in primary human and zzso zzso infections compared to its zzso zzso Converse zzso containing zzso zzso in an zzso background zzso also exhibit greater zzso than matched zzso viruses zzso delta zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso like that of zzso does enhance virus replication in primary cells in tissue culture and that zzso and zzso zzso are functionally interchangeable in the context of both zzso and zzso
