zzso are the main storage compound in zzso zzso To account for the prevailing zzso zzso synthesis in this species, a zzso library of zzso zzso was screened by using the onion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso A full length zzso clone was isolated with significant zzso to zzso type zzso and zzso The functionality of the zzso was tested by zzso expression in zzso zzso The zzso protein demonstrated both zzso and zzso zzso activities zzso with a maximum zzso ratio of zzso The activity of zzso was investigated with respect to zzso stage, tissue distribution, and zzso in zzso status expression and compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were predominantly expressed in the zzso part of zzso leaves and leaf zzso zzso of both genes declined along the leaf zzso in parallel with the spatial occurrence of zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso was highly expressed in zzso active zzso where very low zzso zzso activity and zzso amounts were zzso suggesting a zzso regulation of zzso zzso gene expression increased only in zzso leaves following similar increases of zzso content in zzso zzso and zzso leaf zzso zzso of zzso gene expression depends on the tissue according to its zzso zzso
