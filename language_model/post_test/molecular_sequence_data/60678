The zzso zzso zzso is frequently zzso in human zzso This critical regulatory zzso controls the zzso transition of the zzso cell cycle by positive and negative regulation of zzso genes required for DNA zzso To assess the value of the zzso factors zzso as targets for zzso strategies, we have initiated a program aiming to develop zzso targeting specifically these proteins in zzso and in zzso The cellular activity of zzso is the result of the zzso association of two families of zzso zzso and zzso which then bind zzso Here, we use a two hybrid approach to isolate from zzso libraries zzso zzso that specifically interact with zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso One of these is a potent inhibitor of zzso binding activity in zzso and in zzso zzso blocks cells in zzso and the free variable region from this zzso has the same zzso Our experiments argue that the variable region of this zzso is zzso and that it functions by binding zzso with a motif that resembles a zzso zzso region, and blocking zzso association with zzso These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using zzso synthetic peptides that specifically target zzso interaction motifs within cell cycle zzso These results also emphasize the critical role of the zzso zzso for cell proliferation and might allow the design of novel zzso agents targeting the zzso zzso
