zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in the scavenging of zzso oxygen species zzso into molecular oxygen and hydrogen zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in aquatic zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified using an zzso zzso zzso zzso database generated by zzso zzso A multiple sequence alignment of zzso zzso sequences revealed high zzso with other insect sequences in terms of the zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed that they were grouped with zzso of other organisms, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso Aedes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso was analyzed during different zzso stages and following exposure to various environmental zzso with different mode of actions zzso zzso cadmium, zzso and zzso zzso gene expression was significantly up or down regulated in response to exposure to the chemicals zzso The overall results suggested that zzso gene expression provided a platform for the understanding of zzso stress responses caused by exposure to various environmental zzso and the zzso genes could be used as zzso for environmental disturbances such as zzso stress initiated by zzso
