The synthesis of zzso gels based on zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso sequences is zzso The influence of the conditions of preparation and of the gel structure on the equilibrium degree of swelling zzso zzso was zzso To evaluate the potential of such gels for controlled delivery of zzso and drugs, the release of zzso of different molecular weights was studied and the rate of release was found to depend mainly on the equilibrium degree of swelling and not on the structure of the zzso However, the degradation of the gels by a mixture of zzso zzso isolated from rat liver zzso or zzso was dependent on both the equilibrium degree of swelling and the structure of the zzso zzso of the zzso sequence and structure of the zzso acid zzso The release of the zzso drug zzso zzso in gels was zzso the rate of release being higher at lower zzso In addition, a gel was zzso which contained a zzso in the zzso and zzso bound via a zzso zzso and in this case, incubation with zzso led to degradation with simultaneous release of the zzso
