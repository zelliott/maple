zzso I, an zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso debris of zzso zzso contains four aromatic zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have been shown to be crucial for zzso In order to investigate zzso and zzso of the aromatic zzso acid zzso of zzso I in zzso zzso its zzso zzso and/or zzso I in which zzso and zzso are replaced by zzso were zzso zzso zzso spectral studies showed that three peptides are considerably different in zzso in zzso solution at pH zzso whereas they take similar zzso in the presence of neutral egg zzso zzso zzso zzso Energy transfer zzso showed that the distances of zzso and zzso are 16 A zzso of zzso A, zzso of zzso zzso and 18 A zzso of zzso A, zzso of zzso zzso in buffer but are 12 A zzso of zzso A, zzso of zzso zzso and 18 A zzso of zzso A, zzso of zzso zzso respectively, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso indicated that zzso takes at least three zzso in buffer and in zzso zzso where zzso of three zzso zzso vary by changing the medium from buffer to zzso zzso Although zzso I is not in zzso structure in buffer in spite of its rigid zzso zzso its interaction with zzso zzso appears to induce zzso structure via minor zzso of zzso backbone and side chain zzso resulting in zzso the distance of zzso
