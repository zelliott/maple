zzso zzso is one of the main zzso factors of zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso has zzso properties and has been shown to play a role in zzso We previously cloned a gene cluster zzso which is involved in the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment of the first gene in this cluster indicated similarity with zzso zzso These genes zzso a zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso was transformed with the zzso gene from zzso zzso The zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains showed that the zzso zzso zzso gene could restore the smooth zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used to demonstrate that the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso this zzso We constructed a zzso zzso zzso zzso which expressed a zzso zzso zzso of reduced molecular weight that did not react with zzso raised against the parental zzso These results show an essential role for the zzso gene in the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also showed a reduction in its ability to adhere to and invade zzso zzso However, it was still able to colonize chickens to the same level as the zzso zzso The serum resistance and zzso activity of this zzso were not changed compared to the parent zzso The ability of the zzso to take up DNA and integrate it in its zzso was reduced zzso These results show that zzso of zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso
