zzso of a region, including the zzso zzso sequence between genes 6 and 7 of mouse zzso virus zzso zzso zzso into an zzso defective interfering zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso in helper zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso system was used to determine how sequences zzso the zzso region affect zzso zzso zzso and to identify the minimum zzso sequence required for zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region between genes 6 and 7, but with different lengths of upstream or downstream zzso zzso were zzso All zzso zzso had an zzso zzso region that was identical to the 3' region of the zzso leader zzso which contains two zzso repeat zzso These zzso included 0 to 1,440 zzso of upstream zzso sequence and 0 to zzso zzso of downstream zzso zzso An analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso species revealed that there were no significant differences in the ratios of zzso to zzso zzso zzso for any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacked the zzso region zzso sequences and contained a series of deletions within the zzso zzso sequence were constructed to determine the minimum sequence necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso Small amounts of zzso zzso zzso were zzso from zzso zzso zzso with the zzso consensus sequences zzso and zzso whereas no zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed from zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso These analyses demonstrated that the sequences zzso the zzso sequence between genes 6 and 7 did not play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation and that the zzso consensus sequence was sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso
