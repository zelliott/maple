zzso finger protein zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory activity by zzso zzso zzso In this study, through a screen of zzso zzso in activated human zzso we have identified zzso zzso as the most abundantly bound zzso target zzso and have characterized this interaction via zzso zzso zzso Compared to the zzso cells, zzso zzso produced higher levels of zzso zzso In addition, the plasma level of zzso in zzso mice was markedly higher than that in zzso zzso To determine the in zzso significance of zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso Along with decreased zzso zzso in their paw zzso there were significant functional and zzso improvements in the inflammatory arthritis of zzso mice when zzso was zzso although zzso reflecting systemic zzso was notably zzso Furthermore, the marked zzso of zzso plaque formation caused by zzso zzso in the zzso mouse model of zzso was also rescued by zzso zzso Taken together, our data indicate that the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso plays an important role in modulating localized inflammatory processes in zzso that are zzso from the systemic manifestations of chronic zzso
