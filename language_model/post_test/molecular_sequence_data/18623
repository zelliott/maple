Plant tolerance to zzso constraint involves complex and integrated functions including control of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Several members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, which comprises zzso zzso permeable to zzso and zzso or to zzso only, have been shown to play major roles in plant zzso and zzso zzso Among them, zzso has been identified as corresponding to a quantitative trait locus zzso of salt tolerance in wheat but was not functionally zzso Here, we isolated two zzso zzso from a zzso zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigated the functional properties of the zzso zzso using a zzso zzso technique, after expression in zzso zzso Both zzso displayed high selectivity for zzso their zzso to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso being ten times lower than that to zzso Both zzso and zzso transported zzso with low zzso although the zzso of the zzso was observed at a zzso concentration four times lower in zzso than in zzso External zzso did not inhibit zzso transport through these zzso zzso slightly inhibited zzso but not zzso Overall, these data identified zzso zzso as new zzso zzso within the zzso family, displaying their own functional zzso Furthermore, they showed that important differences in affinity exist among zzso wheat zzso zzso This suggests that the salt tolerance zzso involving zzso may be at least in part explained by functional zzso among wheat zzso zzso
