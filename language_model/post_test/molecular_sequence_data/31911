The zzso zzso zzso belongs to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Group zzso is unique among the zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Normally, the zzso involved in the zzso of the repeating units of zzso zzso are zzso by a set of zzso located in the region of the bacterial zzso zzso of zzso factor is associated with the presence of the zzso Factor zzso can be lost spontaneously in the subcultures of some zzso In these cases, the zzso negative zzso become indistinguishable from the zzso classified in other zzso We noticed lower activity of zzso zzso with rabbit zzso against zzso zzso when compared with the activity of zzso zzso which may indicate a partial zzso of the expression of factor zzso on the surface of the bacterial zzso The main aim of our study was to answer the question whether the products of different zzso pathways combine on the outer side of the zzso zzso thus forming a single chain or separate zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were isolated by mild acid degradation of both obtained zzso and their structure was established using sugar and zzso analysis and zzso zzso The primary structure of two separate zzso chains isolated from zzso zzso were zzso
