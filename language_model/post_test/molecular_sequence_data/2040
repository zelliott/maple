The zzso and energetic consequences of zzso zzso in zzso related to zzso or formation of zzso structure are not well zzso zzso of zzso and zzso DNA sequences from biologically relevant sources were studied by theoretical methods under different zzso conditions and demonstrate that zzso zzso produces a localized pattern of zzso zzso energetic, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso These findings suggest how this modification may influence zzso interactions and support current zzso The results reveal previously zzso potential effects of zzso zzso which could critically affect normal and zzso cellular processes by altering zzso events, zzso zzso zzso stability and cellular zzso
