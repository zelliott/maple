zzso zzso produces one zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined and refined at zzso A with zzso agreement factors R and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The crystal exhibits zzso space group symmetry and contains two protein zzso in the zzso zzso The core structure of the zzso zzso including the disposition of a zzso b prosthetic group, is closely related to those of other zzso although it appears to be the only zzso III zzso that has been characterized that does not bind zzso The zzso iron in one zzso of the native zzso appears to be zzso zzso possibly with a zzso or zzso group in a compound zzso zzso zzso acid is known to bind in the active site of zzso promoting the breakdown of reaction zzso compound I and compound zzso The structure of an zzso crystal soaked with sodium zzso at pH zzso has also been determined to zzso A (with R and zzso values of zzso and zzso respectively), revealing at least 36 separate zzso or zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso In turn, the number of water molecules refined into the models decreased from zzso in the native zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso Extra density, interpreted as zzso is found in a location of both structures that involves interaction with all four zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso confirm that zzso does not bind as a zzso of the iron and that zzso does bind in the zzso zzso The stability of the zzso or zzso acid zzso found inside the zzso zzso pocket has been investigated by calculations based on density functional zzso
