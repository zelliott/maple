A zzso zzso highly repeated DNA zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the restriction zzso zzso or zzso zzso is known to be zzso in the zzso zzso of all the zzso in zzso zzso and the related species zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be present in varying amounts in the zzso DNA of a range of species of zzso including representatives of the two main zzso zzso and zzso A zzso of sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was carried out in order to determine the level of conservation of the sequence within and between species of zzso zzso 204 zzso zzso zzso clones were made of zzso from three individuals of zzso zzso and one individual each of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all members of the zzso zzso and the zzso species zzso A number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso clones were also made from DNA of a single zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso Three distinct types of zzso were identified in all species zzso except for zzso zzso where only two of the types were zzso The types were distinguished on the basis of certain recurring divergent patterns in zzso zzso from zzso zzso Type 1 is mainly zzso by the presence of an zzso site at positions zzso and type 3 mainly by the presence of an additional base zzso at position zzso Type 2 normally lacks the zzso site and the C at position 14, as well as having a number of other distinguishing zzso zzso and its three types have remained remarkably constant in sequence since before the divergence of zzso zzso from other species in the zzso species group, about 10 million years zzso zzso of all 204 zzso clones and comparison with consensus sequences for the three types shows less than zzso divergence at any one position in the zzso There is good evidence from examination of zzso and zzso clones of zzso that the different types are zzso with each other, and all three types are likely to be present on all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones constructed from zzso fragments of zzso zzso DNA show evidence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with the pattern type zzso zzso 1 that is much more common than would be expected on a random zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
