The isolation and molecular characterization of the gene coding for zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso is zzso There are 2 copies of the gene per zzso zzso repeated in a zzso tandem orientation and located in a single zzso of approximately 950 zzso Northern zzso analyses indicate the presence of a single transcript of zzso zzso which is zzso when zzso reach the stationary growth zzso zzso zzso zzso gene codes for a 175 zzso acid long zzso showing zzso sequence identity with zzso proteins from zzso and approximately zzso with its counterparts from higher zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso and higher zzso share along their molecules a similar distribution pattern of theoretically functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is not recognized by zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of mice with one dose of zzso zzso protein and a second dose of zzso protein zzso linked to the zzso from zzso zzso zzso a high zzso level against this zzso zzso which is mostly of the zzso zzso as well as a strong increase in zzso proliferation zzso
