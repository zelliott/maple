Within the zzso of higher zzso cells, short zzso repetitive sequences appear to be zzso but also remarkably varied with respect to copy number and zzso Many of these repeat families, including the human zzso family, can be transcribed by zzso zzso III, and evidence has accumulated from a variety of sources that levels of repeat transcripts whose zzso is dependent on zzso zzso III are sensitive to cellular transformation as well as changes in differentiation zzso Although zzso repetitive sequences have in the past been dismissed as zzso the discovery of the linkage to differentiation state, as well as other recent developments, suggest that the question of repeat sequence functionality should be zzso
