The zzso zzso is essential for stress tolerance and zzso in zzso We investigated the importance of this zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso using the highly virulent zzso Island, Canada, outbreak strain zzso Three genes zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and degradation, zzso zzso zzso were deleted in this strain, creating the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Delta zzso As in zzso zzso cellular zzso was reduced in the zzso Delta and zzso Delta zzso which could not grow and died, respectively, at 37 degrees C on zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso in zzso Delta is directly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso support their linkage to the control of zzso in this zzso However, unlike zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Delta zzso demonstrated, in addition, defects in zzso and capsule production, supporting an influence of zzso on these zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Delta zzso was not due solely to its 37 degrees C growth zzso as shown in zzso studies and confirmed by zzso zzso Furthermore, an intact zzso zzso controls protein zzso zzso and cell wall integrity in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso synthesis zzso plays a central role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso through multiple zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso but zzso of the synthesis zzso zzso and zzso has profound effects on survival of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso These results highlight the central importance of this zzso in the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso zzso
