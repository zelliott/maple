This paper describes a zzso zzso zzso strain causing an unusual zzso Several zzso obtained from an zzso patient were identified as members of the zzso zzso complex zzso by the commercial zzso system and zzso standard zzso Further molecular approaches were undertaken for a more accurate characterization of the zzso Up to seven different zzso sequences were zzso ranging from zzso zzso genes such as zzso zzso DNA to zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso The results obtained identify the zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso an example of the internal zzso described for members of the zzso particularly within that zzso The application of other molecular approaches is recommended for more accurate identification of bacteria described as MAC zzso
