zzso formation is a unique feature of some fluorescent zzso zzso zzso which can be used for probing the proximity of zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously been used for homogeneous detection of single zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso with zzso fluorescence, is able to form zzso zzso maximum about zzso zzso and is well suitable for zzso acid zzso We have shown the utility of zzso in the zzso DNA zzso for detection of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso substitution in the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso strains resistant to zzso The zzso pair can be generated either from zzso zzso zzso or from zzso modified zzso and zzso
