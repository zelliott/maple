The zzso zzso is critical for the regulation of reproduction in all zzso Study of the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso has been the focus of studies on subjects as diverse as zzso zzso stress, nutrition, processing of auditory information, migration, global climate change, and evolutionary zzso Until now, analysis of zzso in zzso has been limited to measurement of zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulation has been impossible because of lack of knowledge of the zzso gene zzso despite many attempts in the last 20 years to identify zzso Thus, the relative roles of zzso social, zzso and evolutionary influences upon zzso zzso regulation have remained zzso Here, we report the first cloning of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso its zzso and zzso Although the zzso of its translated precursor zzso between chicken zzso precursor zzso was only zzso zebra zzso zzso precursor contained an zzso acid sequence that can be processed into chicken zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso combined with zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso area of sexually mature zzso zzso zzso signal was greatly reduced in sexually immature zzso zzso mass of female birds was positively correlated with zzso zzso level in the zzso These data will now permit molecular analysis of the regulation of zzso reproduction by physical, social, and zzso cues, along with fine scale analysis of selection pressures acting upon the zzso system of zzso zzso
