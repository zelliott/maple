zzso zzso by a gene that is zzso in zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso is a modular protein composed of a zzso module and a zzso zzso zzso zzso is the founding member of the zzso family and regulates the levels of zzso present in zzso Multiple reports have described the capability of zzso to form zzso although the function of these zzso and their relationship with zzso remains zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso zzso depends on zzso conditions, suggesting that zzso bonds are involved in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso in which individual zzso zzso were replaced by zzso and then tested the ability of each protein to zzso using zzso protein as well as a zzso cell culture zzso zzso was the only zzso zzso unable to form zzso in both zzso We also generated a zzso zzso lacking the last three zzso zzso zzso and this zzso also failed to zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso were able to bind zzso and maintained wild type zzso activity against both zzso and biologically relevant zzso Furthermore, zzso was fully capable of participating in the zzso process driven by a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is not required for zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso or for the formation of a functional zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso is specifically involved in the zzso process of zzso zzso the zzso zzso constitutes a valuable tool to analyze the zzso implications of zzso zzso
