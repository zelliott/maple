zzso disease virus zzso is a zzso zzso zzso virus that replicates and transcribes in the nucleus of infected zzso Recently, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso can zzso its zzso zzso through binding to the protein X, which is zzso in the overlapping open reading frame zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This observation suggested a unique strategy of zzso trafficking of a viral protein that is essential for the formation of a functional zzso zzso zzso However, neither the mechanism nor the consequences of the zzso retention or nuclear export of zzso zzso complex have been zzso In this study, we show that zzso P contains a bona fide nuclear export signal zzso and can actively shuttle between the nucleus and zzso A transient zzso analysis of zzso clones that mimic the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso domain of P is responsible for the zzso zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso and functional analysis revealed that the zzso zzso within the zzso domain are critical for the activity of the zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso B or small interfering zzso for zzso of zzso strongly suggested that a zzso zzso mediates nuclear export of zzso Fluorescence loss in zzso analysis confirmed the zzso shuttling of zzso Moreover, we revealed that the nuclear export of P is not involved in the zzso of the zzso activity by X in the zzso zzso zzso Our results may provide a unique strategy for the zzso transport of viral zzso which could be critical for the formation of not only infectious zzso in the zzso but also a persistent viral state in the zzso
