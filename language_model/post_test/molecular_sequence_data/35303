zzso complexes form between the synaptic zzso protein zzso and the plasma membrane proteins zzso and zzso to drive membrane zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso and its accessory zzso zzso functions to clamp synaptic zzso zzso We performed zzso simulations of the zzso complex and discovered that at equilibrium the zzso zzso forms tight links with both zzso and zzso To simulate the effect of zzso zzso between zzso and membrane on the zzso complex, we calculated the zzso force and performed simulations with an external force applied to zzso We found that the partially unzipped state of the zzso bundle can be stabilized by interactions with the zzso zzso suggesting a simple zzso explanation for the role of zzso in fusion zzso To test this model, we performed experimental and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which has a point zzso in zzso that causes increased spontaneous zzso We found that this zzso zzso the interaction of the zzso zzso with zzso partially imitating the zzso zzso zzso Our results support a model in which the zzso zzso zzso fusion by binding to the zzso zzso thus preventing full zzso zzso
