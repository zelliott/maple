During fetal development, zzso and human zzso cells rearrange and express a highly restricted set of zzso heavy chain variable region genes zzso zzso We noted that a zzso gene of the restricted human fetal repertoire, designated zzso potentially could zzso the zzso region of two human zzso zzso factor zzso These zzso factors share a zzso zzso zzso defined by zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso that recognizes an zzso heavy chain zzso present on many human zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso Recently, we found that the zzso zzso also is expressed frequently by zzso zzso zzso B cells from patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso or small zzso zzso However, zzso zzso B cells from patients with zzso of zzso center cell origin rarely express this zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso cells from two unrelated zzso patients express a zzso gene that shares greater than zzso zzso with a rearranged zzso gene previously isolated from the zzso cell DNA of another zzso patient and that is identical to zzso zzso Using the zzso chain reaction, we find that this zzso gene is zzso and presumably zzso in the zzso DNA of all examined cases of zzso zzso or small zzso zzso Thus these data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso marker for a zzso and zzso restricted zzso gene that is expressed at high frequency in zzso zzso zzso and early zzso zzso
