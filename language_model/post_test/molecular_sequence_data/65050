A full-length zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes the zzso The zzso expression pattern was examined by reverse zzso chain zzso Positive signals were detected in the zzso heart, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in muscle and zzso However, two types of products were zzso The zzso sequences revealed the existence of 2 zzso zzso named zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence evidence suggests that these two zzso come from a zzso gene transcribed in an alternative zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of 4 zzso The zzso transcript zzso contains zzso I, II, and IV, whereas the zzso transcript in heart, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contains all 4 zzso The appearance of zzso III in zzso zzso changes the sequence content in the latter half of the mature zzso starting within the zzso of the 40th zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso III matched no zzso in public protein databases, while the 2 zzso zzso in this segment preserved the zzso conservation characters of zzso zzso family zzso The common organization of zzso genes between zzso zzso and zzso crustaceans suggests that the zzso gene has a zzso structure in these zzso
