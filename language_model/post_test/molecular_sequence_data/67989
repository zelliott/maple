zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso protein functions by a novel mechanism which involves the direct interaction of the zzso protein and cellular factors with zzso transcribed viral zzso zzso the zzso responsive element zzso zzso cells do not efficiently support zzso zzso activity because of a zzso of zzso zzso Human zzso 12 appears to zzso one of these zzso zzso We have designed zzso zzso sequences which contain the zzso zzso sequence derived from the zzso zzso zzso which binds to the zzso zzso coat zzso These zzso zzso zzso were zzso into zzso and human cells with a zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein which contains the zzso binding domain of the zzso coat zzso zzso zzso which contain the zzso coat protein binding region inserted into the three zzso zzso region support a high level of zzso by zzso coat protein zzso in both human and zzso zzso This result suggests that the zzso zzso zzso may act to allow zzso to interact effectively in a zzso complex which includes zzso cellular factors, and zzso zzso
