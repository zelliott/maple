zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso typically associated with zzso bark zzso zzso During this study, the zzso associates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from Costa zzso were studied using zzso and DNA zzso zzso associates belonged to four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are evidently primary zzso zzso of their respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso They both have zzso evolved distinct zzso adaptations including the production of large, solitary and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso contained an zzso zzso species, but its nutritional importance for its zzso is zzso An auxiliary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found associated with both zzso zzso and the zzso species associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso is genetically quite similar to the zzso zzso zzso 8 from zzso Large differences in zzso between these two species suggest the rapid zzso resulting from the close zzso of the former with its zzso zzso The ITS zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 8 were not zzso suggesting that alternative markers such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso should be used, together with zzso and ecological data, for species zzso in this zzso The primary zzso zzso described here are derived from zzso ancestors, and represent two independent lineages of zzso zzso in the zzso and a new ecological strategy within zzso
