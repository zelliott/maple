A zzso region of DNA from zzso zzso zzso containing genes zzso proteins involved in the zzso of zzso was zzso The DNA sequence of a zzso zzso from this region revealed four open reading frames zzso to zzso three of which are fully contained within the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso by zzso shows 37% identity to a zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing plasmids with zzso on a zzso zzso zzso were able to produce zzso acid, an zzso version of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso by zzso zzso is zzso identical to that of zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso by zzso shows zzso identity to a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso experiments of zzso abolished zzso production, indicating the involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso
