zzso zzso exerts its zzso effects mainly through zzso of a subset of zzso genes zzso but relatively few of fish zzso have been isolated and characterized so zzso Here, we report two fish zzso termed zzso and zzso cloned from a zzso zzso library constructed with zzso obtained from zzso carp zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso cells infected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Database search revealed that both zzso had a high-level zzso with all members of a well zzso gene family with multiple zzso repeat zzso zzso including human zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso in some other zzso zzso The transcripts of zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cells but could be induced by active zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Analysis of expression difference between them and zzso signal factors, zzso and zzso indicated that their transcriptions were zzso possibly through zzso signal pathway, which was further supported by the induction analysis in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of protein zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence representing putative zzso was also revealed when zzso and zzso were used to search the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that these fish zzso form a unique clad independent of zzso zzso reflecting a distant evolutionary relationship from zzso These studies identified the first zzso zzso and zzso zzso
