A zzso clone specifying a cell wall protein was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso library was constructed in the expression zzso zzso zzso 11, with the zzso isolated from actively growing zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows that the zzso protein contains an zzso zzso signal zzso We have designated this protein zzso for zzso zzso cell Wall zzso Northern zzso identified zzso transcript only when zzso zzso was growing in the zzso zzso The zzso protein seems to be zzso bound to the zzso cell wall since it is not released from the cell walls by sodium zzso zzso zzso but it is zzso following partial degradation of zzso by zzso zzso The protein is localized in the outer surface on the tip of the growing zzso cells and is found partially cryptic in zzso locations, suggesting that it zzso directly in the zzso wall zzso
