zzso zzso in marine surface zzso populations was investigated in the Southern Ocean, where the Antarctic zzso Current meets the islands of the Scotia Arc and is subjected to zzso zzso zzso of nutrients and seasonal zzso zzso Total zzso population density, zzso zzso distribution and six of eight dominant members of the zzso community were found to be consistent across 18 zzso sites at eight locations around the Scotia zzso zzso from seven independent zzso zzso gene clone libraries zzso sequences in total) and fluorescent in zzso zzso suggested that microbial zzso were predominantly homogeneous between Scotia Arc sites, where the zzso zzso and the zzso cluster were the dominant bacterial zzso Of the zzso zzso sequences generated, zzso zzso shared zzso similarity with marine zzso and 331 zzso matched published sequences previously detected in permanently cold Arctic and Antarctic marine zzso Taken together, results suggest that the dominant zzso groups are consistent between locations, but significant differences may be detected across the rare zzso
