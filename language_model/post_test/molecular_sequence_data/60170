We cloned and zzso the zzso zzso gene zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and constructed a zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso gene consisted of zzso zzso coding for a protein of 450 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene product showed extensive similarity with those of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso Although the zzso could grow zzso it showed no growth in the presence of 2 zzso zzso a zzso zzso In contrast, growth of the zzso strain was not significantly inhibited by 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity was increased zzso under these zzso In addition, the level of zzso zzso activity in the zzso strain was increased zzso upon exposure to air, and the elevated level of the zzso was retained throughout the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may be important in protection of zzso zzso against zzso zzso
