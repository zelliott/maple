The zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso have been compared to those of zzso in which the linkage between the zzso and Gal was altered from zzso to zzso and to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results revealed that unlike the compact and rigid zzso head group found in zzso where the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the sugar chain of zzso is in an open spatial arrangement, with the zzso no longer interacting with zzso freely accessible to external zzso The structure of zzso can be regarded as that of zzso with an extension of the terminal zzso The inner portion of zzso is that of zzso zzso the very rigid zzso zzso The terminal zzso linkage is flexible and fluctuates between two limiting zzso In zzso the outer zzso acid gains zzso rigidity due to the presence of the outer zzso in position 4 of zzso This zzso has two zzso zzso zzso linked in zzso
