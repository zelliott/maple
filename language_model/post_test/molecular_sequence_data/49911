An zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with four zzso zzso The primary structure of zzso contains two zzso regions aligned in tandem with four functional zzso At 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with a zzso value of 22 zzso and a Hill zzso of zzso Each zzso seems to have different affinity for zzso it is high in zzso and zzso and low in zzso and zzso In our zzso model, the order of zzso to zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso is detected in various zzso zzso it is high in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso moderate in brain, zzso heart, and zzso and low in liver and zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso is prominently localized in the zzso of both zzso and lung respiratory zzso and especially enriched in the zzso segment of the zzso zzso Several proteins in the zzso zzso bind to zzso in the presence of zzso suggesting that they are possible target proteins of zzso One of these target proteins is zzso identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso may have some roles in the zzso zzso or adaptation through interaction with this zzso zzso zzso zzso
