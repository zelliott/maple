The generally accepted hypothesis regarding the origin of zzso zzso proposes zzso convergence from open environments towards the use of subterranean zzso We evaluated this hypothesis for South American zzso using conventional and zzso zzso with independent zzso By using a molecular approach based on zzso b and zzso zzso we evaluated zzso zzso time of origin, the ancestral trait of zzso and ancestral zzso of species belonging to the Andean zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the Andean zzso is highly zzso with one zzso grouping all zzso forms and another grouping all zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso originated in the zzso transition, in the zzso zzso of southern South zzso We conclude that the origin of zzso zzso traits did not necessarily occur under a general model of open zzso the origin of these traits depends on the zzso relationship of the zzso with the zzso
