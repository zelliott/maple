A novel zzso strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso soil sample of the medicinal plant zzso zzso and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso Good growth occurred at zzso zzso at pH zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso 2 zzso were light red to red, round and lacked aerial zzso cells zzso to the zzso The zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso Polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso and two unknown zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso zzso belonged to the family zzso and consistently formed a distinct zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso On the basis of evidence from this zzso zzso study, a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
