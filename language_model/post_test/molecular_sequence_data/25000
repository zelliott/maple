zzso predictions are critical for directing the experimental study of protein zzso Therefore it is paradoxical when an apparently erroneous zzso prediction seems to be supported by zzso 

We analyzed six cases where application of novel or conventional zzso methods for protein sequence and structure analysis led to zzso predictions that were subsequently supported by direct zzso We show that, on all six occasions, the original prediction was zzso and in at least three cases, an alternative, zzso zzso zzso incompatible with the original one, could be zzso The most unusual cases involved the identification of an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso for which experimental zzso of apparently erroneous zzso predictions were zzso Using zzso analysis, multiple alignment and zzso zzso we have identified the unique zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso as a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

In each of the analyzed cases, the original zzso predictions could be zzso and, in some instances, alternative strongly supported predictions were zzso The nature of the experimental evidence that appears to support these predictions remains an open zzso Some of these experiments might signify discovery of extremely unusual forms of the respective zzso whereas the results of others could be due to zzso
