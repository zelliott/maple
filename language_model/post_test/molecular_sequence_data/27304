zzso zzso virus zzso isolated in zzso cells could be adapted to zzso cells after several blind zzso In this study, we have determined the complete zzso sequences of the zzso of the wild type zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso strain and identified zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso of zzso H and F proteins from zzso revealed that the zzso zzso in addition to zzso in the H protein was necessary for the zzso H protein to use zzso efficiently as a zzso and that the zzso substitution in the F protein was important for enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains harboring the F protein with the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso protein revealed that both zzso F and H proteins were required for efficient zzso formation and virus growth in zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso zzso strain harboring the zzso protein penetrated slowly into zzso cells, while a zzso zzso zzso strain harboring both the zzso and zzso proteins penetrated efficiently into zzso cells, indicating that the zzso protein compensates for the inefficient penetration of a zzso zzso strain harboring the zzso zzso Thus, the F and H proteins zzso function to ensure efficient zzso zzso growth in zzso zzso
