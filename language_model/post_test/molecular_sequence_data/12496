Experimental zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disease of the central nervous system zzso induced in zzso by activated zzso T cells specific for various zzso proteins such as zzso basic protein and zzso zzso The disease is characterized by breach of the zzso barrier, zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso local inflammation and zzso in the form of zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of administration of zzso to two members of the beta 2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the onset and progression of zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso interactions leading to T cell and zzso zzso to inflammatory sites and T cell zzso Our results show that zzso zzso could completely block the induction of zzso and zzso zzso significantly delayed the onset and diminished the severity of clinical signs of zzso even when injections were initiated at the first appearance of clinical zzso
