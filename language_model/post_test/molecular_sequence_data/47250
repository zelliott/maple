zzso zzso channels have diverse functions, including zzso zzso zzso and sensory zzso The ability of these channels to discriminate between different zzso is critical for their normal zzso Several findings suggest that zzso channels have a pore structure similar to zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined the accessibility of native and introduced zzso in the putative P loop of zzso We identified zzso that span a barrier that excludes zzso as well as zzso and large zzso zzso from the zzso This segment contains a structural element zzso involved in selectivity of zzso The results are not consistent with predictions from the zzso channel zzso suggesting that zzso zzso channels have a novel pore zzso
