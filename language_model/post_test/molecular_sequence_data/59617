zzso exist today in small isolated populations on the islands of Borneo zzso zzso zzso zzso and Sumatra zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the basis of their zzso behavioral and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso populations are generally considered as two separate subspecies, there is no universal agreement as to whether their genetic differentiation is sufficient to consider and manage them as species, subspecies or population level zzso zzso A more precise zzso description would affect many conservation management decisions about captive and zzso zzso 

We analyzed the amount and patterns of molecular genetic variation in zzso populations using cellular DNA from zzso from two locations in Sumatra and nine zzso four isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso DNA restriction zzso length zzso nuclear zzso (or variable number tandem zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences led to three major zzso First, the genetic distance and zzso differentiation between zzso and zzso zzso is large, greater than that between the common zzso Pan zzso and the pygmy zzso or zzso Pan zzso The genetic distance suggests that the two island subspecies zzso approximately zzso million years ago, well before the two islands separated and long enough for zzso zzso Second, there is considerable endemic genetic diversity within the zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they have not experienced recent bottlenecks or founder zzso And third, there is little genetic differentiation among four geographically isolated populations of zzso zzso consistent with gene flow having occurred between them until zzso 

Our results are consistent with the view that the genetic differentiation between zzso and zzso zzso has reached the level of distinct zzso Furthermore, our findings indicate that there is not a genetic imperative for the separate management of geographically isolated zzso zzso
