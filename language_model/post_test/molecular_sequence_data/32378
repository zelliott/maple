zzso are zzso zzso found in the cell walls of red zzso They are classified according to the number and the position of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso zzso and carries at least three zzso per zzso zzso The sole known zzso zzso of zzso the zzso from zzso zzso has been zzso cloned and zzso zzso analyses have revealed that the zzso referred to as zzso is the first member of a new family of zzso zzso zzso which is unrelated to families zzso that contains zzso and zzso that contains zzso This large zzso zzso zzso features a zzso region, suggesting the presence of a zzso connecting at least two independent zzso The zzso region is predicted to fold as a zzso The main degradation products have been zzso and characterized as zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso the zzso linkage of zzso zzso zzso zzso laser light zzso and zzso monitoring of the zzso degradation of zzso indicate that zzso proceeds according to an zzso mode of action and a mechanism of inversion of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in the present study we demonstrate that the active site of zzso comprises at least 8 zzso zzso to zzso and that a zzso zzso binds in the zzso zzso to zzso and can be zzso into zzso and zzso
