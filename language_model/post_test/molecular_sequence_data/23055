zzso zzso constitute a large family of zzso proteins in plants that may be needed for a variety of key cellular functions including regulation of transcription, zzso zzso and zzso However, no member of this gene family has been reported to date in zzso animals, or zzso zzso We have identified four genes with putative zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein or zzso The zzso zzso levels increased slightly during zzso zzso zzso localized to both zzso and the proportion of stained zzso cells increased by zzso during zzso zzso zzso specifically bound to both the regulated zzso and zzso ran gene promoters in their zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso containing the zzso domain zzso the DNA binding zzso zzso analysis revealed that an zzso sequence was required for binding of zzso to these zzso We also found that zzso recognized similar binding zzso Using zzso plasmids and zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso binding sites are positive zzso elements of the zzso and ran gene promoters in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso family gene found in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be an important zzso zzso and that its binding sites are positive promoter elements for certain zzso zzso
