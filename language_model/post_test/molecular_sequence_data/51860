The zzso chain reaction was used to amplify and partially sequence the zzso zzso zzso genes of symbiotic bacteria within the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso probing with fluorescent zzso showed that the amplified sequences originated from a single species of zzso which is closely related to zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a variety of shapes and zzso These data support the hypothesis, first proposed on the basis of electron zzso that the zzso undergo a zzso transformation as part of the symbiotic zzso
