Four zzso bacterial strains isolated from clinical respiratory sources were characterized using a zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso these strains were found to be zzso similar to each other and were shown to belong to the zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso side chain zzso major polar zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso major fatty zzso zzso fatty acids with a considerable amount of zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso carbon zzso were consistent with the assignment of the novel strains to the zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the novel strains were related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso gene sequences showed these strains were related to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso gene sequencing is a more powerful tool than zzso zzso gene sequencing for zzso identification within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests supported the zzso and zzso differentiation of the novel strains from related zzso These data indicated that the new strains represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
