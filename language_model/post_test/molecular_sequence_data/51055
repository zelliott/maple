We report the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso gamma chain which associates with the zzso form of zzso to form the low affinity zzso for zzso zzso gamma zzso expressed on human natural killer zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso gamma from a zzso zzso zzso line established that this zzso is identical to zzso zzso zzso gamma previously identified in human zzso as part of a high affinity zzso for zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso zzso zzso gamma gene expression in a series of zzso and zzso zzso clones reveals that zzso zzso zzso gamma is not directly linked to zzso activity since clones of the zzso zzso lack zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso but nevertheless mediate zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is expressed in various types within the zzso system as part of zzso surface receptors involved in different biological zzso
