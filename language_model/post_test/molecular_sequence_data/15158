In the zzso central nervous system zzso an important contingent of zzso zzso are localized in the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso area of the zzso zzso They constitute an zzso and functionally zzso group of cells involved in a variety of regulatory mechanisms, from locomotion to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary cultures represent a useful tool to study molecular mechanisms involved in their development and zzso zzso information has been gathered on the zzso zzso development and maturation in zzso as well as on the molecular features of zzso primary zzso Here we investigated in detail the gene expression differences between the tissue of origin and zzso zzso primary cultures enriched in zzso zzso using zzso zzso We integrated the results based on different zzso of the zzso zzso By using zzso gene network techniques and promoter sequence analysis, we also uncovered mechanisms that might regulate the expression of zzso genes involved in the definition of the identity of specific cell types in the zzso zzso We integrate zzso and functional zzso together with zzso zzso Moreover, we propose guidelines for the zzso analysis of zzso gene expression zzso Our findings help to clarify some molecular aspects of the development and differentiation of zzso zzso within the zzso
