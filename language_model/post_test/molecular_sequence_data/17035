zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso specifically eliminate a large fraction of their zzso by the process of zzso zzso The eliminated DNA zzso remains only in the zzso zzso Very little is known about the nature of the sequences eliminated from zzso zzso We cloned a fraction of the zzso and zzso 90 clones that total 32 zzso The following organizational patterns were demonstrated for the zzso zzso All do not contain open reading zzso Each zzso contains 1-3 families of short repeats zzso zzso highly zzso within families zzso Most repeats are separated by zzso up to 50 zzso zzso zzso regions were found between fragments, motifs from zzso zzso in zzso Among fragments there occur groups in which the same motifs are ordered in the same zzso However, zzso between the motifs differ in length and zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso occurring in all zzso were zzso Analysis of motifs revealed zzso each occurring within several zzso Thus, motifs may be regarded as mosaic structures composed of zzso (short zzso Taken together, the results provide evidence of a high organizational ordering of the DNA sequences restricted to the zzso With this in mind, it appears incorrect to refer to this part of the zzso as zzso Moreover, zzso is redundant for only the zzso zzso function is to be sought in zzso zzso
