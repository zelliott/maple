The human zzso is an zzso that interacts with several zzso proteins such as the zzso zzso containing zzso complex and zzso zzso This study presents the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain of human zzso The structure reveals a groove composed of zzso zzso with characteristic properties of a zzso zzso A comparison of the 12 zzso in the zzso unit reveals the presence of two major zzso an open zzso with a well accessible groove and a tight zzso with a less accessible zzso The zzso in the backbone between the open and the tight zzso matches the differences seen in previously determined structures of individual zzso zzso zzso suggesting a general plasticity within this fold zzso The flexibility observed in the putative protein binding groove may enable zzso to recognize multiple interaction zzso
