The properties of a zzso zzso zzso system, which consists of two zzso zzso strands and in which stem II is deleted zzso with a zzso zzso are zzso The effects of temperature, zzso and metal zzso on the zzso reaction were similar to those for the parent zzso with stem zzso The zzso zzso showed a much lower zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso where the parent zzso showed full zzso zzso However, increasing the concentration of zzso from 10 to 100 zzso restored the zzso activity of the zzso zzso to the original level zzso zzso zzso zzso CD zzso experiments with zzso using a zzso zzso were carried zzso zzso of stem II resulted in an about zzso reduction of the apparent zzso binding affinity when the zzso zzso of zzso are zzso The results were analyzed by zzso analysis and compared with those for the parent zzso The analysis showed that the zzso concentration dependence data in CD and zzso experiments for the zzso zzso can be explained by a two zzso zzso binding zzso These results that stem II is important for maintaining the zzso of the zzso core suitable for zzso zzso
