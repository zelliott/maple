Brown zzso zzso zzso bites are normally associated with zzso skin zzso zzso zzso massive inflammatory response at injured region, zzso zzso causing zzso and zzso zzso Brown zzso zzso has a complex composition containing many different zzso of which a well-studied component is the zzso zzso This toxin alone may produce zzso zzso inflammatory response and zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin belongs to a family of toxins with zzso zzso characterized as zzso Here, employing a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso we cloned and expressed two zzso zzso of the zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso for signal peptides and complete mature zzso zzso tree analysis revealed a structural relationship for these toxins compared to other members of zzso zzso molecules were expressed as zzso zzso fusion proteins in zzso coli and were zzso to zzso from cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso resulting in proteins of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Additional evidence for related toxins containing zzso identity comes from zzso zzso using zzso against crude zzso toxins and zzso raised with a zzso zzso zzso zzso toxins showed differential functionality in zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso with zzso spreading upon zzso injection, while zzso evoked transient swelling and zzso upon injection zzso Light microscopic analysis of skin zzso revealed zzso a collection of inflammatory cells in and around blood vessels and a zzso network at the zzso Moreover, differential functionality for zzso toxins was also demonstrated by a high zzso activity for zzso and low activity for zzso as well as greater in zzso zzso zzso and blood vessel zzso induced by zzso and residual activity for zzso Cloning and expression of two zzso zzso toxins demonstrate an zzso family of zzso toxins that act in zzso for deleterious activities of the zzso and open possibilities for zzso applications for zzso toxins as research tools for understanding the inflammatory response, vascular integrity and zzso zzso zzso
