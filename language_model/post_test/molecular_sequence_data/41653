Common bacterial blight zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso factor of common bean zzso zzso zzso production around the zzso Two major zzso quantitative trait zzso zzso linked to the sequence characterized amplified region markers zzso and zzso are located at zzso 6 and 8, zzso Using zzso cloning approach, four bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones from the zzso locus and one zzso clone containing zzso were zzso by Roche zzso technique and subsequently assembled using merged zzso from three different zzso Based on the quality of the zzso only the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were used for candidate gene marker zzso development and candidate gene zzso zzso For the zzso zzso 21 novel genes were predicted in zzso by zzso using zzso gene model, whereas 16 genes were identified in the zzso zzso For each putative zzso one or more primer pairs were designed and tested in the contrasting near zzso zzso Overall, six and nine zzso markers were found in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso association mapping was conducted in a breeding population of 395 dry bean lines to discover zzso zzso Two zzso per each locus showed better association with zzso resistance than the zzso and zzso zzso which include zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The strong associations between zzso resistance and the zzso 10 and 14 from zzso locus and the zzso 10 and 11 from zzso locus indicate that the genes 10 and 14 from the zzso locus are potential zzso underlying the zzso zzso whereas the genes 10 and 11 from the zzso locus are potential zzso underlying the zzso zzso The superiority of zzso was further validated in a zzso zzso line population zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso are recommended to replace zzso and zzso for zzso selection of common bean with resistance to zzso
