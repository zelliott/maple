zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso zzso of higher plants and comprises 2 zzso zzso rod zzso and zzso zzso Here, I show that zzso controls the rate of the interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which cut off a zzso rod zzso domain, and zzso were used in detailed surface zzso resonance zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso chiefly involved extremely fast binding and zzso reactions and the zzso affinity for zzso was stronger than the zzso affinity for zzso The zzso constant values were determined as approximately zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso
