The zzso and zzso zzso zzso are two zzso zzso Both are characterized by zzso in the zzso and deficient expression of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso showed that zzso zzso acts intrinsic to the zzso which is the only cell type expressing the zzso gene in the zzso zzso genetic studies by several groups demonstrated that zzso is a deletion zzso in the zzso zzso zzso no zzso is produced in the zzso zzso In zzso however, partial expression of the zzso gene was zzso Interestingly, zzso was expressed in a mosaic fashion in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso genetic studies revealed that the zzso zzso has duplicated zzso genes in tandem on a zzso part zzso of zzso zzso The reduced expression was based on the level of zzso A large portion is zzso in the upstream zzso and an intact copy is located zzso We showed in zzso zzso that zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso segment is zzso and it forms zzso duplex, with the zzso transcribed from the normal gene located zzso
