In zzso zzso D is activated to zzso D by incubation at low zzso To investigate the mechanism of this zzso zzso human zzso D and two zzso were generated in a zzso expression zzso One zzso carried a point zzso within the zzso domain, which resulted in a zzso inactive zzso form zzso The other carried a point zzso within the zzso which prevented zzso by processing at the zzso zzso Neither zzso is capable of processing itself to form zzso D, and zzso is not able to process zzso Despite the inability of zzso to cleave either its own or a zzso zzso it did exhibit activity against a synthetic zzso zzso The ability of intact precursor zzso to cleave a zzso but not a protein zzso offers new insights into the mechanism of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso D can process the inactive zzso zzso to the zzso demonstrating that processed species are capable of zzso zzso molecules in an zzso zzso In addition, kinetic studies provide evidence for a zzso mechanism for the conversion of zzso D to zzso D, one phase where the first molecules of zzso D are formed at a low rate and a second phase where the process is zzso accelerated by newly formed zzso D zzso Finally, with the help of the zzso zzso and zzso it was observed that at least two additional zzso activities, found in zzso media from insect cell culture, are capable of zzso zzso D by zzso it within the zzso This observation suggests that there are likely to be multiple zzso in the zzso zzso that are capable of zzso zzso D, thereby triggering the second zzso zzso This may also be important for solid tumors, where the presence of zzso D has been correlated with tumor growth and zzso
