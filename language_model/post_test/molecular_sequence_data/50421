Analysis of zzso containing zzso DNA zzso zzso from calf zzso has revealed the presence of a zzso to 3' zzso activity that is specific for a single strand of duplex zzso This activity is capable of degrading a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso When a second zzso primer is zzso 3 bases upstream, degradation of the downstream primer is strictly dependent on DNA synthesis from the upstream zzso Replacement of the downstream primer by an zzso of identical sequence results in a similar pattern of zzso zzso The activity has been highly zzso and found to zzso in zzso zzso with a zzso of 56 zzso as judged by zzso zzso zzso of calf DNA zzso alpha and delta on zzso activity are also observed but with differences in the pattern of zzso
