zzso proteins and zzso factors zzso are highly related zzso proteins that are important components of the zzso cellular zzso zzso By regulating the expression of a large number of genes that have zzso zzso zzso zzso regulators may take part in virtually all zzso of cellular function, including cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Individual members of the zzso family can function as zzso or zzso depending on which promoter they bind and the zzso with which they zzso A long-standing research aim has been to define the mechanisms by which zzso factors and zzso regulate gene expression and cellular function in a zzso and zzso zzso Most members of this family have been identified in zzso with at least 21 zzso proteins zzso in the human zzso and members are also found in zzso worms and zzso zzso proteins have highly zzso zzso zzso zzso that function in DNA zzso The zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso domain, can vary significantly between family zzso
