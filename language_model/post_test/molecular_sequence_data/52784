The expression of the cellular form of the prion protein zzso gene is required for prion replication and zzso in zzso zzso zzso The identification of the cell types expressing zzso is necessary to understanding how the agent replicates and spreads from peripheral sites to the central nervous zzso To determine the nature of the cell types expressing zzso a green fluorescent protein reporter gene was expressed in transgenic mice under the control of zzso zzso of the bovine zzso gene regulatory zzso It was shown that the bovine zzso gene is expressed as two populations of zzso differing by alternative zzso of one zzso zzso untranslated zzso in 17 different bovine zzso The analysis of transgenic mice showed reporter gene expression in some cells that have been identified as expressing zzso such as zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso In addition, expression of green fluorescent protein was observed in the zzso of the enteric nervous system and in a restricted subset of cells not yet clearly identified as expressing zzso the zzso cells of the zzso zzso and the zzso cells of both the zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso These data provide valuable information on the distribution of zzso at the cellular level and argue for roles of the zzso and zzso cells in the spread of infection from the periphery to the zzso Moreover, the transgenic mice described in this paper provide a model that will allow for the study of the zzso activity of the zzso gene promoter in response to zzso zzso
