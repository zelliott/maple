The zzso zzso plays important functions in T cell development and in T cell zzso In zzso zzso is a zzso consisting of an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso In humans, only the zzso has been zzso and it has been thought that zzso consists of zzso of this zzso We have isolated functional zzso clones zzso human zzso zzso and show that the zzso beta protein is expressed on the surface of zzso human T zzso zzso clones zzso multiple forms of the human zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso These structural zzso which are likely to arise by alternative zzso differ in the sequences zzso the zzso domain, which can consist of 19, 30, or 52 zzso zzso One of the zzso lacks zzso sequences corresponding to a zzso zzso domain, and may zzso a zzso zzso beta zzso The protein product of the human zzso beta gene can be detected by a recently described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso recognized by this zzso requires zzso of the zzso alpha and zzso beta gene zzso About zzso of human zzso alpha positive zzso and peripheral blood zzso express zzso beta at the cell zzso zzso of the zzso beta chain is thus zzso between human and zzso and the zzso zzso beta zzso may have distinct roles in T cell function and zzso
