In this report we describe zzso zzso zzso zzso an efficient and zzso method for introducing a zzso into a zzso Each round of zzso can remove up to 11 base pairs from a randomly selected site within the target gene and replace them with any length of DNA of predetermined zzso zzso the number of bases to be deleted and inserted can be independently regulated providing greater versatility than existing methods of zzso zzso zzso multiple rounds of zzso will provide a diverse zzso library that contains multiple zzso throughout the zzso Additionally, we developed a simple zzso procedure that eliminates zzso zzso containing zzso or stop zzso As a proof of principle, we used zzso to generate zzso zzso lacking zzso activity and recovered active zzso using a second round of zzso Furthermore, a single round of zzso yielded unique, inactive zzso of zzso
