The zzso zzso of zzso repeats in human DNA is largely composed of recently inserted zzso Here we document additional members of the zzso zzso that are found in zzso but not in the zzso zzso of human and gorilla, confirming the relatively recent and independent expansion of this zzso zzso in the zzso zzso As further evidence for the youth of this zzso zzso one zzso zzso repeat is specific to Pan zzso whereas others are present in Pan zzso as zzso The zzso tails of these zzso repeats have different lengths in Pan zzso and Pan zzso The zzso caused by the presence and absence of zzso zzso repeats and the length zzso attributed to their zzso tails should provide valuable genetic markers for zzso studies of zzso zzso The existence of zzso zzso repeats is a major sequence difference between human and zzso zzso
