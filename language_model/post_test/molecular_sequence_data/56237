The effect on translation of multiple copies of the initiation zzso zzso at the initiation site in a zzso zzso carrying a short leader sequence was tested in translation experiments in zzso DNA, corresponding to a zzso zzso sequence consisting of the zzso leader region of zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso and the goat zzso zzso zzso was prepared and transcribed in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out to change the sequence around the initiation zzso zzso In a wheat germ translation system, the yield of protein obtained using the zzso with a zzso of the zzso zzso at the initiation site was zzso times that achieved when only one zzso was zzso The rate of formation of the zzso initiation complex was measured by the zzso binding zzso using zzso A good correlation was observed between the ability to form the complex and translation zzso
