The zzso members of the zzso zzso protein family group into zzso zzso to share common zzso The zzso VI zzso contains 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso has little effect on the tightly organized zzso ribbon in zzso cells as seen by zzso zzso In striking contrast, we found zzso was strongly required for normal zzso ribbon zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso scattered the zzso ribbon into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not wild type or zzso zzso produced a similar zzso zzso By electron zzso zzso depletion produced short, isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At low expression levels, wild type and zzso zzso showed little concentration in the zzso region, but zzso were observed and most were in ruffled regions at the cell zzso There was zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso marker, zzso zzso zzso as expected, displayed an entirely diffuse zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso transport of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso had little, if any, effect on zzso transport of zzso Additionally, after a zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso inhibited cell growth, while zzso of zzso zzso but not wild type or zzso zzso produced a zzso progressive cell zzso In double zzso experiments with zzso the zzso ribbon was fragmented, a result consistent with zzso and zzso acting in zzso 

We provide the first evidence for distinctive zzso effects on zzso organization, zzso trafficking and cell zzso When combined with the evidence that zzso and zzso have diverse roles in zzso function, while zzso regulates zzso function, our data indicate that zzso VI zzso members, although related by zzso and structure, share limited functional zzso
