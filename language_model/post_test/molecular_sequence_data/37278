The family of zzso hormones and their zzso zzso receptors represent an excellent system for comparative zzso zzso We have engineered single chain molecules of human zzso zzso zzso fused to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to create the zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso and zzso The expression and zzso of these fusion proteins were examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso binding zzso demonstrated that each of the proteins was zzso In the case of zzso minimal binding of zzso hormone was observed due to the continued occupation of zzso by the fused zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso and zzso however, did not prevent binding of zzso zzso zzso presumably due to the lower affinity of zzso The zzso zzso levels in cells expressing the zzso complex was approximately zzso higher than that in cells expressing zzso zzso in zzso zzso production were also observed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso increases, zzso Whereas the affinity and specificity of zzso for zzso are extraordinarily high, the hormone is capable of binding to and zzso both zzso and zzso under these conditions that mimic high zzso zzso These findings were confirmed by adding high zzso of zzso to cells expressing zzso and zzso Although the functional interaction of zzso and zzso has been recognized in zzso zzso there are no reports linking zzso to zzso zzso This study, however, suggests that such a functional interaction is capable of occurring under conditions of high circulating levels of zzso zzso the first zzso of pregnancy and in patients with zzso zzso
