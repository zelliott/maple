Fewer than 500 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remain in the zzso Due to low numbers and their solitary and zzso nature, tiger zzso across their range in the Russian Far East and China are zzso zzso of sick zzso are rarer zzso Serious zzso disease observed in several wild zzso since 2001 suggested disease emergence in this endangered zzso To investigate this possibility, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso were performed on zzso from 5 affected zzso that died or were destroyed in 2001, 2004, or zzso Our results reveal canine distemper virus zzso infection as the cause of zzso disease in two zzso and definitively establish infection in a zzso zzso encephalitis with zzso zzso nuclear viral zzso and positive zzso for zzso by zzso and zzso were present in the two zzso with available brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene products were obtained from brains of these two zzso by zzso and a short zzso of zzso P gene sequence was detected in zzso zzso tissue of a third zzso zzso zzso tiger zzso groups with an zzso strain in zzso seals zzso zzso Our results, which include mapping the location of positive zzso and recognition of a cluster of cases in 2010, coupled with a lack of reported zzso zzso in zzso zzso prior to 2000 suggest wide geographic distribution of zzso across the tiger range and recent emergence of zzso as a significant infectious disease threat to endangered zzso zzso in the Russian Far zzso 

zzso of disease emergence in wildlife is a rare zzso Here, for the first time, we identify and characterize a canine distemper virus zzso the second most common cause of infectious disease death in domestic dogs and a viral disease of global importance in common and endangered zzso as the zzso of zzso disease and fatal encephalitis in wild, endangered zzso zzso We establish that in 2010 zzso directly or indirectly killed zzso of zzso zzso zzso of positive cases over an expansive geographic area suggests that zzso is widely distributed across the tiger zzso zzso interactions are increasing as human populations grow and expand into wildlife zzso zzso animal reservoirs for zzso and identifying the zzso strains that are zzso to and among wildlife species, including zzso zzso and zzso critically endangered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for guiding conservation and zzso zzso
