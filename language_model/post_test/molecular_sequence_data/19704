Double zzso occur in zzso zzso which are zzso zzso zzso factors implicated in zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso studies suggest important differences in the zzso zzso tail binding of different zzso zzso In human and zzso zzso double zzso bind zzso zzso zzso zzso tail, which is a hallmark of zzso active zzso in all zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso double zzso and pinpoint their differences with that of the human zzso double zzso The most zzso zzso in these double zzso are the two zzso that orient zzso Only a subset of zzso zzso can form an aromatic cage for zzso zzso and zzso binding requires correctly oriented zzso These factors zzso zzso zzso double zzso from interacting with the zzso zzso zzso Despite great sequence similarity between the human zzso and zzso zzso variation within an insert likely prevents zzso double zzso from binding zzso zzso zzso zzso tail as efficiently as in zzso By using the available structural and zzso data we highlight the evolutionary specialization of zzso double zzso and provide insights about their targeting zzso
