The root of the tree of life has been a holy zzso ever since Darwin first used the tree as a metaphor for zzso New methods seek to narrow down the location of the root by excluding it from branches of the tree of zzso This is done by finding traits that must be zzso and excluding the root from the zzso those traits zzso However the two most comprehensive attempts at this strategy, performed by zzso and Lake et zzso have excluded each other's zzso 

The zzso zzso of Lake et zzso rely on high quality alignments between zzso that zzso before the last universal common zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment artifacts may skew their zzso We have reviewed their data using protein structure information where zzso Several of the conclusions are quite different when viewed in the light of structure which is zzso over longer evolutionary time scales than zzso We argue there is no polarization that excludes the root from all zzso and that zzso robustly exclude the root from the zzso 

We conclude that there is no contradiction between the polarization zzso The combination of these zzso excludes the root from every possible position except near the zzso
