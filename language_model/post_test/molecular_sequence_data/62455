zzso A zzso zzso is the most common primary zzso in the zzso Here, we identify a zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso shown previously to be zzso in zzso patients, from a human kidney zzso zzso This protein contains a zzso tandem repeat of 19 zzso acids consisting of many zzso zzso and zzso zzso and likely to be extensively zzso thus, this gene was classified in the zzso family and named zzso The human zzso gene contains at least four zzso and is localized close to zzso on zzso zzso We found variations in repeat numbers in the zzso tandem domain, suggesting zzso of this zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso analyses revealed that human zzso zzso was expressed most highly in kidney and moderately in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of human kidney revealed that zzso protein was localized in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso proteins produced in zzso canine kidney and zzso cells indicated the zzso of zzso protein in a membrane fraction and extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso canine kidney cells demonstrated that zzso protein was localized on the plasma zzso zzso of zzso zzso in a human kidney cell line was zzso by tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Two species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting from alternative transcription, were identified in human zzso whereas only one zzso was observed in mouse zzso Mouse zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso cells of zzso zzso and the expression increased dramatically with the progression of lupus zzso in the kidney of zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of mouse zzso was zzso in zzso zzso acutely injured by zzso or unilateral zzso zzso These characteristics suggest that the production of zzso is correlated with development and progression of zzso and other zzso zzso
