The zzso segment is an important part of the zzso sensor in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, which are members of the zzso of zzso channels, have little inherent sensitivity to zzso despite the presence of an zzso zzso We made zzso between a zzso rat zzso channel zzso and the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso to determine the basis of their divergent gating zzso We found that the zzso zzso segment can support a zzso mechanism of zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso has a potentially functional zzso sensor that is silent during zzso In addition, we found that the zzso loop of zzso increases the relative stability of the open zzso of zzso effectively converting zzso into a zzso zzso A single charged zzso in the loop makes a significant contribution to the relative stabilization of the open stage in zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso channels such as zzso contain a zzso sensor which, in the zzso zzso range, is stabilized in an activated zzso that is zzso for pore zzso
