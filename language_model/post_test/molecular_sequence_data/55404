The effects of culture conditions on zzso zzso production and its possible zzso have been zzso A newly isolated zzso zzso zzso belonged to zzso zzso and showed a remarkable zzso producing zzso was used for this zzso Corn steep zzso soybean meal and ammonium zzso were found to be the key factors in the zzso according to the results obtained from the zzso experimental zzso The optimal concentration range of the three factors was examined by the zzso ascent path, and their optimal concentration were further zzso via response surface zzso approach and determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The concentration of the obtained zzso increased significantly with zzso medium zzso zzso when compared with zzso medium zzso zzso and the zzso productivity was about zzso (The zzso time was shorten from 72 to 42 zzso To observe zzso effects, batch zzso was carried out at various working zzso At a working volume of zzso zzso the final zzso concentration and yield were zzso and zzso zzso at 36 h with a zzso productivity of zzso zzso zzso This result shows similar amount of zzso obtained in zzso zzso and it is possible to scale up to larger zzso without major zzso
