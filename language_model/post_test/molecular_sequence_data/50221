Several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso These zzso were targeted to cleave zzso zzso zzso at up to nine different zzso zzso Each zzso consisted of a chain of up to nine zzso zzso each flanked by a different targeting zzso The zzso were functional in zzso and gave rise to zzso specific partial and/or complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more efficient than zzso or zzso targeting a subset of the same zzso In contrast to zzso a zzso zzso targeted to cleave at nine different sites within a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was active and showed the same specificity of zzso when it was part of a large zzso zzso We conclude that zzso retain the specificity of zzso but they are more efficient per zzso zzso copy and they remain active when they are part of a large zzso A zzso zzso or zzso under control of the zzso late promoter, the zzso gene promoter or the zzso zzso respectively, were zzso with the infectious zzso DNA clone zzso into zzso zzso T4 zzso Each zzso resulted in a specific zzso of zzso replication as determined by zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso with an zzso zzso zzso transcript resulted in the specific dramatic reduction of the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso are also functional zzso A zzso sequence comparison of the target sites indicates that the zzso could potentially be effective against all thirty zzso zzso presently zzso Their use may help to slow the selection of viral escape zzso and thereby prolong their zzso We anticipate that zzso will also be more effective in the successful targeting of less variable cellular zzso
