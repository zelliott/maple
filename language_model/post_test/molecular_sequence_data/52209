In this study, we have used zzso labeling by zzso as well as zzso by zzso toxin zzso and zzso toxin zzso to identify zzso proteins associated with mouse zzso plasma zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso can be zzso labeled by zzso zzso and zzso by both zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso wheat germ zzso and zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso we have further characterized zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso is found to bind zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso in a zzso and zzso manner with a zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to display a zzso activity which zzso zzso at a rate of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso activity can be readily inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso Most interestingly, zzso binding significantly enhances the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or CT zzso the zzso increase in zzso binding to zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso being the first reported zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso plays an important role in promoting the interaction between zzso zzso and its underlying membrane zzso through zzso
