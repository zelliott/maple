zzso editing affects zzso zzso and transfer zzso in plant zzso by zzso exchange of zzso and zzso bases in both seed and zzso zzso Distribution of the phenomenon among zzso has been unclear since zzso editing has been detected in some but not all zzso and zzso A more detailed understanding of zzso editing in plants required extended data sets for zzso and sequences zzso Toward this aim an internal region of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was analyzed in a large collection of zzso and green algae zzso The zzso zzso sequences predict editing in 30 zzso 2 zzso and 7 simple zzso and leafy zzso zzso No editing is, however, required in seven species of the complex zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso editing among the zzso on the other hand, reaches zzso of up to zzso of zzso being zzso zzso of zzso editing from the zzso sequences was confirmed by zzso analysis in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso zzso exchanges predicted to zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso in the zzso includes the removal of zzso stop zzso by frequent reverse zzso zzso zzso no zzso editing events were identified by zzso analysis in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The findings are discussed in relation to models on the zzso of land zzso
