zzso zzso constitute the largest zzso zzso zzso zzso Since discovery of zzso P as a structurally unidentified zzso and zzso compound in 1931, continuous and tremendous advances have been made regarding molecular and functional characterization of zzso and their zzso revealing diverse molecular species of zzso peptides with a zzso consensus zzso not ubiquitous but wide distribution and multiple biological activities of zzso and their receptors in central and peripheral zzso elaborate and complicated zzso and multiple functional zzso of zzso evolutionary aspects of zzso zzso and the implication of zzso peptides and receptors in many disorders of current keen zzso Indeed, the zzso systems are now regarded as promising targets of novel clinical agents aimed at a variety of pathological symptoms and processes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this review, we present an overview of basic knowledge and a buildup of recent advances in extensive fields of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides zzso These findings shed new light on zzso the biological and zzso significance of zzso zzso evolutionary relationship of the structures and functions between zzso and zzso zzso family peptides and zzso and zzso the binding mode for the zzso family peptides and their receptors and the zzso zzso of the complexes that are essential for design and development of leading zzso
