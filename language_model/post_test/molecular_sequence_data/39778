Most zzso methods assume that the sequences evolved under zzso stationary and zzso zzso zzso zzso in data intended for studies of zzso suggests that the data did not evolve under these zzso zzso a zzso application for analysis of zzso content, reads sequence alignments in several formats and plots the zzso content in a zzso Once zzso zzso can be identified, thus allowing for decisions on the zzso of the data for zzso zzso
