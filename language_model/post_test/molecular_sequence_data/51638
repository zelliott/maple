zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso more than one specific DNA zzso This is due to the presence of several target recognizing zzso zzso in these zzso Such zzso form part of a variable zzso in the zzso primary zzso which separates zzso zzso core sequences responsible for general steps in the zzso zzso By zzso rearranging and exchanging several zzso of zzso zzso we demonstrate their modular zzso they mediate target recognition independent of a particular zzso or core sequence zzso We show also that zzso zzso can accommodate zzso material of zzso origin within their variable region without losing their zzso The remarkable plasticity with respect to the material that can be integrated into this region suggests that the zzso core sequences preceding or following it form zzso functional zzso In spite of the documented flexibility zzso zzso could not be endowed with novel zzso by integration of putative zzso of zzso zzso pointing to differences between zzso and zzso zzso in the way their core and zzso sequences zzso
