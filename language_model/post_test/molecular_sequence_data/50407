We measured kinetic parameters in zzso and directly analyzed zzso and zzso levels in zzso to study recognition of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso by zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that, in addition to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso base zzso also affect zzso An zzso change has a small effect, but a change to zzso or zzso significantly lowers zzso for in zzso zzso and leads to appreciable zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso results in a zzso essentially zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso does not have such an zzso zzso crucial for zzso zzso recognition of zzso are located at the end of the zzso zzso These elements include a weak base pair or a mismatch between zzso zzso 1 and 72 and base pairs zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso 1 and 72 are less important than the fact that they do not form a strong zzso base zzso Interestingly, the negative effect of a zzso base pair between zzso 1 and 72 is suppressed by zzso of the neighboring zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso The presence of zzso or zzso could destabilize the zzso base pair at the end of an zzso zzso Thus, in some zzso the zzso base could affect stability of the base pair between zzso 1 and 72 and thereby the structure of zzso at the end of the zzso zzso
