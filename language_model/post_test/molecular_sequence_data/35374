The zzso of zzso turnover has been increasingly recognized as a zzso for gene expression regulation at the zzso zzso In zzso cells, most zzso are zzso via the zzso pathway, in which the removal of the zzso tail is the initial and zzso zzso zzso a zzso specifically degrades zzso from the zzso is highly zzso from zzso to zzso zzso in higher plants have been shown to be involved in plant development and stress zzso However, little is known about the zzso and zzso properties of zzso in zzso In this research, we cloned the zzso gene from zzso zzso and studied the properties of the zzso zzso The results showed that zzso was a zzso with zzso sequence zzso structural features, and zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso mode with the optimal reacting conditions at pH 7 and zzso zzso had similar activity when coordinated with zzso and zzso while the zzso bound to zzso or zzso was almost zzso zzso could induce zzso zzso with the disruption of the native structure, while zzso zzso and zzso could stabilize zzso against zzso zzso by reducing protein zzso Among the various metal zzso zzso showed the strongest protective effect on zzso stability, zzso that zzso might play a role in regulating zzso stability in the zzso zzso cells under some stressed zzso These findings provide a starting point for further investigation of the zzso functions of zzso in zzso zzso
