To investigate the structural context of the fusion zzso region in human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso zzso protein zzso was used as an zzso zzso partner for the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso truncated zzso zzso The bacterial expression of the zzso zzso resulted in soluble zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso of fusion zzso zzso in the zzso zzso indicating that the fusion zzso is available for interaction with zzso despite the presence of an zzso zzso zzso Limited zzso experiments indicated that the zzso domain zzso sequence zzso protects fusion zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso stability therefore depends on a functional interaction between zzso and zzso domain zzso regions in a zzso zzso hairpin zzso In addition, zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso sequence zzso stability to the fusion zzso zzso zzso The functional role of the zzso domain zzso sequence was assessed by zzso zzso of the full-length envelope zzso with 11 of 12 single zzso zzso resulting in zzso to zzso enhancements in zzso fusion zzso By contrast, single zzso zzso in zzso did not significantly alter zzso stability, indicating that multiple zzso within the zzso domain zzso region and the fusion zzso and adjacent zzso segment contribute to stability, thereby zzso the potential effects of the zzso The zzso effects of the zzso are therefore likely to be caused by zzso of the zzso zzso Our observations suggest that the function of the zzso domain zzso sequence in the zzso envelope zzso is distinct from its role in stabilizing the fusion zzso region in the zzso zzso hairpin zzso of zzso
