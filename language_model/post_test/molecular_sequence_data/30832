A native structure containing the major zzso common zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through a combination of differential zzso and zzso density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that this structure is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso reacted with the zzso zzso of zzso coli, as determined by zzso zzso of two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso of the isolated complex revealed a zzso structure with a diameter of approximately 16 zzso which was very similar in appearance to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso with the deduced sequences of the zzso coli zzso zzso related zzso proteins from zzso and zzso zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso the wheat zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso protein indicated sequence identity at 8 of 22 to 10 of 22 zzso zzso to zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso of zzso is zzso to the zzso protein and related zzso found in a wide variety of zzso and zzso and thus may represent a heat shock protein involved in protein folding and zzso
