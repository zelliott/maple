DNA sequencing technology has proven very valuable for zzso the zzso of poorly accessible zzso such as zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and shotgun sequencing of zzso zzso and its zzso we examined the composition and diversity of microbial communities from the recently discovered Jan zzso zzso field, located on zzso Ridge in the zzso zzso The communities were dominated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso These are zzso involved in zzso metabolism and typically found in zzso fluid mixing zzso zzso and diversity predictions differed systematically between extracted DNA and zzso samples as well as between zzso and shotgun zzso These differences were more substantial than those between two biological zzso zzso zzso shotgun sequencing differences could be explained to a large extent by bias introduced during zzso caused by preferential zzso zzso while DNA zzso zzso differences were thought to be caused by differences between the activity levels of zzso Further, predicted diversity from zzso samples was consistently lower than that from zzso In zzso this study illustrates how different methods can provide complementary ecological zzso
