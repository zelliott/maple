zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso produces highly active zzso complexes called zzso This strain was already shown to bind to zzso however the molecular zzso involved is not zzso In this context we focused on the gene named zzso zzso a zzso protein of unknown function, containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along with 23 zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso In the microbial kingdom the gene zzso is only found in zzso zzso and the very close strain recently zzso zzso zzso zzso Its presence in zzso zzso guided us to analyze its function and its putative role in zzso of the cells to zzso The zzso of zzso was shown to bind to zzso cellulose and was assigned to the zzso zzso No zzso activity on cellulose was found with a zzso displaying representative zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain was constructed, and we found that zzso is neither involved in binding of the cells to cellulose nor that the protein has an obvious role in cell growth on zzso We also characterized the role of the zzso scaffolding protein zzso in zzso of zzso zzso to zzso since zzso scaffolding protein has been proposed to mediate binding of other zzso bacteria to zzso A second zzso was constructed, where zzso was zzso We unexpectedly found that zzso is only partly involved in binding of zzso zzso to zzso Other mechanisms for cellulose zzso may therefore exist in zzso zzso In addition, no zzso zzso were observed at the cellular surface of zzso zzso what is in contrast to reports from several other zzso producing zzso These findings may suggest that zzso zzso has no dedicated molecular mechanism to zzso the zzso at the cellular zzso
