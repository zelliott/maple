zzso of human fetal zzso contain factors that can stimulate or inhibit zzso incorporation into fetal bovine zzso zzso An zzso factor was zzso to zzso by zzso and zzso high performance liquid zzso The zzso action was due to cell zzso The first 25 zzso acids of the zzso segment were identical to the human lung and pancreatic zzso zzso The isolated protein released zzso acid from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had the same effects as the zzso zzso including its zzso zzso of fetal bovine liver zzso zzso No decrease of zzso incorporation was seen in fetal bovine zzso cells, zzso cells, or zzso cells incubated with the zzso zzso No release of zzso or cell zzso was observed with human zzso or fetal bovine zzso zzso and bee zzso which have low sequence zzso are nearly zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were less active than the pancreatic zzso These results support the zzso effects observed with other zzso zzso The high sensitivity of liver zzso cells towards some zzso zzso suggest that these zzso may be involved in the elimination of zzso zzso cells at the end of zzso
