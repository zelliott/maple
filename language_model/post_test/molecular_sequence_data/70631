The zzso open reading frame on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a member of the zzso motif zzso zzso family of zzso of Mr zzso By cloning and expressing this gene in zzso coli and zzso zzso we have shown the product to be a zzso zzso zzso with a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the preferred zzso and zzso in zzso shows that zzso and zzso zzso are produced by attack at zzso and zzso and zzso zzso are produced by attack at zzso with a zzso of 56 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso but not zzso zzso or other zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso which was shown to be expressed in log phase zzso cells by zzso displays optimal activity at pH zzso 50 degrees C, and zzso zzso zzso (or 200 zzso zzso It has an absolute requirement for a reducing agent, such as zzso (1 zzso and is inhibited by zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a Ki of 80 zzso Its function may be to eliminate potentially toxic zzso zzso during zzso
