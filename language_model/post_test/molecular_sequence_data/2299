zzso of the human zzso virus zzso rev protein is required for expression of virus structural zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso regions important for Rev zzso We found that proteins with single zzso acid substitution zzso concentrated within the zzso zzso and zzso of Rev were for the most part zzso zzso zzso revealed that Rev was localized predominantly in the zzso However, a deletion zzso that lacked the basic stretch of zzso acids zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso and was no longer zzso zzso with this zzso a zzso fusion protein containing this basic rich zzso at its zzso zzso was targeted to the zzso These observations indicate that the zzso rev protein has a distinct nuclear zzso sequence and suggest that zzso regulation of gene expression involves nuclear zzso
