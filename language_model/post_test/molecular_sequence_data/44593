Most zzso zzso zzso consist of a zzso and a cellulose binding domain zzso joined by a zzso We have used zzso as a model compound for the zzso chain to investigate the interaction between the soluble zzso and zzso The binding of zzso to family I zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso cause line broadening effects and decreasing zzso relaxation times for certain zzso zzso whereas there are no effects in the presence of a zzso which binds zzso to zzso Yet it remains uncertain how well the soluble zzso mimics the binding of zzso to the zzso
