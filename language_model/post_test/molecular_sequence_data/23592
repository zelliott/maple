Identification of genes specifically expressed in adult and fetal zzso is important in zzso our understanding of zzso development and zzso In this study, a novel human transcript, designated human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was identified by zzso of adult and fetal human zzso zzso zzso with a human zzso zzso containing zzso zzso The zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at zzso higher levels in adult human zzso than in fetal zzso zzso and zzso analyses against the human zzso database indicated that zzso was a novel zzso zzso of human zzso zzso tissue distribution experiments demonstrated that the zzso transcript was highly expressed in adult human zzso and in healthy zzso but not in zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso transcript is chiefly expressed in germ cells and is most likely involved in zzso
