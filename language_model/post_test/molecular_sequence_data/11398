The most suitable conditions for selective zzso zzso of zzso derived from zzso with zzso acid zzso and the subsequent separation of the derivatives by zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso which zzso at zzso zzso when excited at 315 zzso were readily detected in zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso described here, which exploited the zzso of the zzso acid group of the zzso acid zzso of the zzso replaced each weak zzso acid group of the parent sugar by two strong zzso acid zzso This allowed for zzso over a wide range of pH and improved the resolution of the derivatives when compared to those obtained with zzso zzso under identical separation zzso The separation of zzso was best achieved when 75 zzso zzso pH zzso was used as the running zzso The zzso and separation conditions described zzso are expected to be readily zzso to the zzso zzso of other zzso such as those derived from zzso
