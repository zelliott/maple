zzso pore domain zzso zzso channel 3 zzso is a new member of the tandem pore domain zzso channel zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso with four putative zzso segments and two pore regions was isolated from guinea pig zzso An zzso sequence was cloned from a human zzso zzso Although zzso is zzso identical to zzso the zzso zzso sequence is only zzso zzso Analysis of the gene structure identified an zzso within the zzso zzso motif of the first pore zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed strong expression in brain but very weak zzso levels in other zzso zzso zzso recordings of zzso expressed in zzso cells showed that the single channel zzso relation was inwardly zzso and open probability increased markedly with zzso zzso of external zzso zzso increased the mean single channel current measured at zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso revealed an zzso zzso zzso current that was strongly decreased in the presence of lower zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso abolished pH zzso This zzso which is located at the outer part of the pore adjacent to the selectivity zzso may be an essential component of the zzso pH zzso
