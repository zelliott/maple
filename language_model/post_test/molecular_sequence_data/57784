zzso of protein secondary structure is an old problem and progress has been zzso Recently, spectacular success has been claimed in the blind prediction of the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso When predictions in this and other test cases are assessed zzso some claims of prediction success turn out to be zzso but a kernel of real progress remains: protein structure prediction can be improved substantially when a family of related sequences is zzso Enough so that molecular biologists equipped with a new zzso acid sequence and a multiple sequence alignment in hand may be tempted to test the new prediction zzso
