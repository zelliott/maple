zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso either individually or zzso did not increase zzso acid production by the fungus zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso do not seem to contribute in a major way to flux control of the metabolism involved in the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso did not influence the activities of other zzso in the pathway, nor did it change zzso zzso zzso However, in strains zzso zzso the level of zzso zzso a positive zzso zzso of zzso was reduced almost zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso using zzso product and zzso zzso found zzso showed that such a reduction in the zzso level could decrease the specific activity of zzso in the cell zzso Thus, the fungus seems to adapt to zzso of zzso by decreasing the specific activity of the zzso through a reduction in the level of zzso zzso
