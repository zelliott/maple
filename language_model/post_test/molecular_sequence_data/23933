The structural organization and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso In the zzso zzso three zzso zzso were identified by zzso of zzso and factor zzso zzso sites at various zzso The first domain of the zzso zzso located between zzso 50 and 84, was not required for the stability, membrane association, interaction with zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the comparable domain of the zzso protein zzso also had little effect on its function, demonstrating that this region is not required for membrane zzso or zzso with zzso The second and third zzso zzso of zzso zzso located between zzso zzso and 371 and zzso 425 and zzso respectively, create a zzso loop of approximately 60 zzso In contrast to the first zzso domain, the second and third zzso zzso were both required for zzso zzso In addition, zzso in the zzso loop zzso the zzso zzso indicating that this region of the protein is important for zzso structure and zzso zzso in the extreme zzso region of zzso also disrupted zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that in contrast to other members of the zzso zzso that are soluble zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may interact in the zzso as well as within the membrane and/or the zzso of the zzso zzso
