A zzso protein that was present at higher levels in zzso 2nd zzso larvae than in feeding 2nd zzso larvae of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso were raised against this zzso The zzso were subsequently used to screen a zzso library that was constructed using zzso from 2nd zzso zzso Eight identical zzso clones were zzso The zzso clone had a zzso insert and the longest open reading frame coded for a zzso acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high similarity to zzso zzso and therefore, the zzso clone was named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed by using zzso as well as zzso activity zzso zzso was closer in similarity to insect zzso members than zzso zzso The apparent zzso of the zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso However, the zzso had a zzso higher affinity towards zzso than zzso zzso using Northern zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that the fat body was the major tissue where the zzso was zzso and zzso Higher levels of zzso protein were present in zzso 2nd zzso larvae compared to feeding 2nd and 6th zzso larvae, suggesting that besides zzso zzso may have other roles during insect development that are not readily apparent at zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso expression system and an active zzso was zzso
