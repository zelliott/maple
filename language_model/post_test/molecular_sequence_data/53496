The basic zzso zzso factor zzso is required for proper nervous system development in zzso It is expressed in zzso precursors during embryonic development and is thought to play a role in specifying zzso zzso To investigate the regulation of zzso zzso the zzso start site of the gene was identified and a zzso zzso ending in the first zzso was shown to possess zzso promoter zzso This zzso zzso was able to promote expression of reporter genes in zzso cells under conditions in which expression of zzso zzso was zzso zzso the zzso zzso was able to drive expression of a zzso reporter gene in transgenic mice in most zzso in which zzso is normally zzso including those peripheral zzso that fail to develop in zzso zzso zzso These findings identify a regulatory region containing elements responsible for appropriate expression of a gene with a crucial role in generating the zzso nervous zzso
