The zzso properties of a viral zzso from the surface of zzso disease virus particles have been successfully zzso by multiple zzso in zzso regions of zzso coli zzso By increasing the number of viral peptides per zzso zzso the average zzso of hybrid proteins in a competitive zzso zzso zzso have decreased to values close to that presented by natural zzso Moreover, the zzso diversity of these new zzso zzso when measured with different zzso zzso has also been largely reduced, indicating a better presentation of the zzso located in the viral zzso Although zzso zzso binding could have been zzso by multiple zzso zzso modifications of the viral zzso due to the presence of other insertions or a cooperative zzso binding cannot be zzso In addition, a zzso zzso analysis have grouped together the zzso proteins with the native virus, suggesting that increasing the number of insertions could be a good strategy to reproduce the zzso properties of an zzso zzso in a natural zzso zzso
