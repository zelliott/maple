Since the discovery of zzso zzso in zzso there has been a general belief that this mechanism operates only in zzso zzso zzso Recently, studying zzso zzso zzso we observed a zzso structure of the S zzso segment that was consistent with generation by zzso between viruses from two genetic zzso Here we show zzso rescue of zzso virus carrying zzso S zzso zzso Independent attempts yielded S zzso molecules of similar zzso the majority of them carried a break point located close to one of the break points suggested for natural zzso zzso virus zzso from the original zzso was able to grow to the same zzso in cell culture and showed the same characteristic zzso pattern when stained for the zzso zzso While competent, the zzso virus appeared to be slightly less competitive than the wild zzso zzso analysis of the S zzso clones obtained from the zzso zzso virus confirmed that all S zzso molecules were of zzso zzso This provides the first example of a zzso zzso virus constructed using zzso zzso
