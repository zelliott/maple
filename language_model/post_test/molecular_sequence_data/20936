zzso zzso are copies of zzso genes that have accumulated indicators of zzso zzso (such as zzso and premature stop zzso but nonetheless remain zzso Recent experimental evidence indicates that transcribed zzso may regulate the expression of zzso zzso through zzso zzso or generation of small interfering zzso zzso Here, we assessed the zzso evidence for such transcribed zzso of potential functional importance, in the human zzso The most obvious indicators of such functional importance are significant evidence of conservation and selection zzso 

A variety of zzso zzso from multiple sources were pooled and filtered to obtain a subset of sequences that have significant zzso zzso zzso and premature stop zzso and that have clear evidence of full-length zzso zzso We found 1750 such transcribed zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso to approximately zzso of human zzso zzso We checked for zzso conservation of zzso in other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dog and zzso About half of the human zzso are zzso in zzso zzso but zzso very few in mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso monkey show evidence of selection pressure zzso to surrounding zzso zzso on: zzso their zzso content, and zzso their rate of zzso zzso This is in spite of zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to synonymous substitution zzso zzso with a lack of zzso zzso Furthermore, we have identified 68 human zzso that are zzso zzso in at least two other zzso Interestingly, we observe three zzso sequences zzso in dog that have intermediate character zzso evidence of both zzso ability and zzso and discuss the implications of zzso 

Through evolutionary analysis, we have identified candidate sequences for functional human transcribed zzso and have zzso 68 strong candidates for further investigation as potentially functional transcribed zzso across multiple zzso zzso
