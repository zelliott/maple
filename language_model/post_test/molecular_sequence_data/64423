zzso zzso serve as zzso examples of zzso complexity with diverse modifications zzso on many different zzso that comprise a zzso zzso To help crack this code more zzso we demonstrate a new strategy for protein characterization wherein complete zzso descriptions are obtained by database retrieval instead of manual interpretation of zzso data from high-resolution tandem mass zzso zzso A database of nearly 50 zzso modified zzso zzso sequences was created and zzso with 91 zzso zzso from electron capture zzso of a zzso form zzso Da zzso unmodified zzso selectively accumulated in a zzso zzso transform hybrid mass zzso The correct form atop the retrieval list indicated zzso at zzso zzso at the N zzso and zzso at zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A statistical evaluation reveals the critical role of mass accuracy and that zzso zzso are retrieved as zzso zzso The zzso of shotgun zzso to forms of zzso with up to six zzso is demonstrated, with zzso to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other protein classes zzso
