zzso has been shown to promote zzso zzso and cell spreading in many cell culture zzso In this study, we present data demonstrating that zzso not only promotes zzso but also zzso process outgrowth in rat zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso cell spreading was apparent by 6 zzso and nearly 50% of the exposed cells extended zzso zzso These zzso effects of zzso were both zzso and zzso In the presence of zzso a protein synthesis zzso both zzso spreading and zzso outgrowth were zzso indicating that de zzso protein synthesis is required for the effects of zzso to take zzso Of the other zzso zzso tested, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and only zzso partially zzso the effects of zzso Although zzso cell zzso and spreading have been extensively zzso this is the first report that this zzso zzso can cause zzso zzso The zzso zzso effects of zzso were distinct from those of nerve growth factor in that the response to zzso was considerably more zzso but apparently lacked the ability to sustain continuous outgrowth and networking of zzso zzso also induced the levels of zzso and zzso two proteins associated with zzso differentiation of zzso zzso In cells grown in zzso defined zzso zzso was capable of promoting zzso outgrowth when the cells were zzso on surfaces zzso with normal growth zzso zzso or zzso while it failed to cause these zzso changes in cells zzso on zzso or zzso zzso Similarly, zzso also promoted zzso outgrowth from rat sympathetic zzso attached to zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso maintained on zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso nearly completely prevented the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso interaction is responsible for the zzso zzso
