zzso zzso the primary zzso agent of human dental zzso is an zzso zzso zzso The goals of this study were to identify the zzso required for zzso formation by this zzso and to zzso the zzso that some of the known global regulators of gene expression play in controlling zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene (for zzso regulatory zzso was found to zzso a novel protein of zzso zzso acid zzso A strain carrying an zzso zzso copy of zzso formed longer chains than did the parental strain, zzso in liquid culture, and was unable to form zzso as shown by an in zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso of the zzso responsible for synthesis of zzso II zzso of the bacterial zzso system was also identified in zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso of the gene zzso did not alter colony or cell zzso or diminish the capacity of zzso zzso to form zzso We also examined the role of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso control protein zzso in zzso zzso in zzso formation, and the results showed that loss of zzso resulted in about a zzso decrease in the ability to form zzso on an zzso zzso From these data, we conclude that zzso and zzso may regulate genes that are required for stable zzso formation by zzso zzso
