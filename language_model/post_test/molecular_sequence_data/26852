zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso soil zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by catalyzing the zzso conversion of zzso zzso to zzso The zzso is also able to catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso with ca zzso higher zzso but zzso zzso lower zzso The gene zzso from zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The protein produced with a zzso zzso exhibited the same specific activity as the zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso has been solved at a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso unit of the zzso unit cell with parameters a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, and c zzso zzso A contains four molecules of zzso The zzso belongs to a group of zzso with a common structural feature, the so-called zzso zzso zzso The zzso of 380 zzso acid zzso has two zzso similar zzso exhibiting an zzso The active site is situated in a zzso between these zzso The four zzso molecules are arranged as a zzso with 222 symmetry for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso have different relative positions with respect to the zzso zzso resulting in a closed zzso for zzso A and two distinct open zzso for molecules B and zzso The zzso domain of zzso C is zzso The zzso active site contains the putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso for which zzso roles are proposed based on a zzso experiment of the zzso zzso zzso The active sites of zzso and the closely related zzso most likely a zzso zzso have been zzso The overall architecture including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso This positioning of zzso allows zzso (as zzso to zzso zzso and (as zzso to donate a zzso to the zzso carbon atom of the resulting zzso zzso Interestingly, the active site of zzso zzso zzso type I also contains a zzso that zzso with zzso rather than zzso It has been proposed that the initial step in this zzso is a zzso generating a zzso zzso zzso
