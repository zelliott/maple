The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates a key zzso in zzso as its activity directs the steroid zzso pathways toward zzso or sex hormone zzso zzso of the zzso gene is zzso regulated in zzso zzso by zzso We showed that DNA between zzso and zzso in the rat zzso gene was bound uniquely by zzso zzso zzso which regulated both zzso and zzso zzso in mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso experiments in mice indicate that zzso is not mandatory for zzso zzso We studied zzso gene regulation in the zzso using human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of reporter zzso gene zzso containing serial deletions of the zzso zzso region of the rat zzso gene showed that DNA between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, as it did in adrenal and zzso zzso zzso zzso further identified a region between zzso and the zzso box that was bound by zzso zzso of zzso reporter zzso containing zzso to zzso of the rat zzso DNA zzso to the minimal promoter of the zzso zzso gene showed that this DNA increased both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso identified two zzso complexes with zzso cell nuclear extracts that were different from complexes formed with zzso cell extracts and did not involve zzso zzso analysis of the zzso DNA showed that zzso nuclear proteins bound to a site zzso but not identical to, the zzso zzso One complex involved zzso zzso zzso which bound to DNA sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso rat zzso gene transcription, thus demonstrating a zzso effect of zzso zzso also bound to a similar region of the human zzso zzso and the DNA region to which zzso bound was zzso active in zzso zzso zzso was also found in extracts from rat zzso and bound to the zzso rat zzso zzso These data demonstrate a role of zzso in regulating zzso gene zzso These data further indicate that although human zzso is not normally expressed in the zzso factors that could activate this gene are indeed zzso
