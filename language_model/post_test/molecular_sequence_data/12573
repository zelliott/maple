In search of proteins which interact with activated steroid hormone zzso we screened a human liver zzso zzso expression library with the zzso zzso We identified and cloned a zzso sequence of zzso zzso that encodes a protein of zzso zzso This protein consists predominantly of zzso zzso acids and contains a putative zzso nuclear zzso zzso The in zzso translated zzso protein runs in zzso gels with an apparent molecular mass of 46 zzso By use of the zzso expressed fusion protein with zzso zzso we have found that interaction is not limited to the zzso zzso but included other nuclear zzso notably, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso also occurs with the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and even with receptors not zzso with zzso Association with steroid hormone receptors depends on prior zzso zzso release from heat shock zzso The sequence identified here appears to be a general partner protein for nuclear hormone zzso with the gene being expressed in a variety of zzso zzso
