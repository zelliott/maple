The zzso sequence of zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The functional significance of the deduced open reading frame was evaluated by deletion of an internal zzso restriction site in zzso and by the creation of zzso deletions using zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out with zzso zzso strain zzso a zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso isolate zzso zzso hosts carrying complete zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with deletions of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso These zzso failed to grow on zzso however, they grew on zzso accumulating zzso zzso These results indicated the zzso zzso was not required for zzso of the unstable zzso zzso zzso zzso elimination of zzso from this zzso is proposed to generate zzso which is a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The relationship of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with 15 other zzso and sequences of unknown function from bacteria, plants and animals revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso region with a zzso consensus flanked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are related zzso These zzso are unrelated to the Type I, II and III zzso zzso that include the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
