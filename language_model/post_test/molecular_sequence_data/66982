In the present study zzso relationships of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined using DNA sequences from the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster and from the zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso species traditionally classified in zzso representatives of the zzso species that have recently been transferred to the zzso were zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is zzso similar to zzso differing only in zzso zzso was also zzso The analyses included 101 specimens from the zzso representing 49 zzso zzso from both DNA regions were zzso simultaneously using direct zzso under the zzso zzso zzso The results support the inclusion of the zzso species and zzso in zzso while the current zzso zzso is not zzso As zzso is zzso zzso within zzso the new combination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Further, species concepts need to be zzso as some species do not appear as zzso entities in the zzso
