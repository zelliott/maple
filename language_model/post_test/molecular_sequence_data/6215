A new technique, coupled amplification and zzso zzso zzso has been developed that allows for simultaneous multiplex amplification and zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso method that combines in one zzso DNA amplification by zzso with DNA zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso By virtue of a difference in the melting temperatures of zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso DNA hybrids, the method allows preferential amplification of DNA during stage I and zzso zzso during stage II of the zzso In stage I, target DNA is amplified using zzso zzso zzso values between 68 degrees C and 89 degrees zzso in a zzso zzso cycle that employs a 94 degrees C zzso step and a 72 degrees C zzso zzso In stage II, zzso of zzso products by competitive zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso values between 51 degrees C and 67 degrees zzso located between the zzso zzso is accomplished by several cycles of zzso at 94 degrees C followed by zzso at 55 degrees zzso zzso products are zzso at their 3' ends and analyzed zzso on a fluorescent DNA zzso The zzso procedure has been used successfully to analyze human zzso DNA for zzso zzso zzso zzso Because product detection occurs zzso with target amplification, the technique is zzso highly sensitive, and specific and requires minimal sample zzso
