This paper reports the identification of five zzso complementary zzso acids zzso zzso peptides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso gene 1 and 2A and zzso are zzso in gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a 24 zzso acids insert in the mature zzso region and form zzso has a deletion of 23 zzso acids in the middle of the zzso message associated zzso zzso The mature peptides from the zzso zzso and zzso are 29 zzso zzso However, the mature zzso is 31 zzso acids from zzso zzso 53 zzso acids from zzso and 55 zzso acids from zzso The zzso significance of multiple forms of zzso zzso is zzso Organization of zzso gene 1, which is similar to the zzso zzso gene has been zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acids was widely detected in goldfish brain and several peripheral zzso
