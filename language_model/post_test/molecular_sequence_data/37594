Here we describe five zzso arranged and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located upstream of the previously identified competence gene zzso The zzso of the deduced proteins zzso and zzso exhibit the zzso zzso zzso motifs of zzso zzso the deduced protein zzso is similar to type IV zzso zzso is similar to the zzso coli zzso which has been implicated in the stringent zzso No zzso of zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso A zzso in zzso or zzso led to zzso reduced transformation zzso and a zzso in zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect the natural transformation zzso zzso studies clearly demonstrated that zzso is involved in natural zzso whereas the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were due to polar effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the twitching zzso zzso and of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggested that the competence gene zzso is not essential for the zzso of type IV zzso and expression of the type IV zzso property of twitching zzso zzso zzso between zzso and a zzso zzso gene were constructed, and analysis of zzso zzso revealed increased expression of zzso during prolonged exponential and stationary zzso
