Main zzso zzso genes were isolated from a seawater fish, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso of genes zzso seven zzso receptors were zzso one consists of five or more members, termed zzso to 5 of zzso zzso and the other appears to be a single copy zzso termed the zzso zzso zzso members show extremely high zzso acid sequence similarities of about zzso to one another, and are zzso related to zzso with the highest similarity of zzso zzso shows zzso similarity to zzso zzso both FOR members are zzso among zzso of the fish main zzso zzso family outside the zzso zzso family, although similarities between zzso receptors and those of zzso zzso are lower than those among zzso zzso In zzso zzso shows that both zzso of zzso genes are expressed randomly over the zzso zzso throughout all zzso zzso and no segregation of the signals was zzso On the other hand, when three members of a zzso zzso zzso gene family, related to the zzso zzso were used as zzso they were also randomly expressed over the same zzso as the main zzso zzso This is in contrast to the expression profiles observed for zzso and zzso where the main or zzso zzso receptors are expressed in zzso zzso It is thus suggested that the expression pattern of fish zzso receptors varies depending on the species, although fish zzso receptors are highly related to one another in their primary structures, and are zzso distinct from those of zzso
