The contact area of zzso II from zzso zzso zzso when interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso spinning zzso zzso For this purpose, the carbon signals for more than zzso of the zzso of the bound zzso were zzso zzso between the solution and solid-state chemical shifts of the free and bound form of the toxin are confined to distinct surface zzso zzso II of the short toxin was identified as the main interaction zzso In addition, loop III of zzso II shows several strong responses defining an additional interaction zzso A comparison with the structures of zzso bound to the zzso protein from snail species zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of zzso bound to an zzso domain of an zzso of the zzso reveals different contact areas for long and short zzso
