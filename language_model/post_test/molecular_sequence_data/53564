The family zzso of zzso zzso comprises members of closely related zzso which are known to be involved in a variety of zzso important zzso On the basis of two highly zzso zzso zzso we have identified a new member of this family by zzso amplification and zzso zzso The longest zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso It contains the zzso zzso motif and displays high zzso to the other zzso family members except for its zzso for which a signal sequence of 20 zzso can be zzso This interpretation was supported by expressing fusion proteins formed with green fluorescent protein which localized to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a major zzso zzso zzso For zzso studies, the complete protein was expressed in zzso 9 insect zzso When zzso zzso were used as zzso efficient zzso was only observed for zzso (and to a lesser extent zzso The activity was inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso and by other known zzso zzso but surprisingly zzso was without zzso This newly identified zzso zzso zzso is a zzso member of family zzso and may be another example of the small subset of zzso zzso
