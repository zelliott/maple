In zzso zzso an zzso signaling pathway, which includes the zzso and zzso zzso controls longevity and stress zzso zzso of this zzso activates the zzso zzso factor zzso whose zzso targets are suggested to play an essential role in controlling the zzso governed by this zzso We have surveyed the genes that have the zzso consensus binding element zzso within putative regulatory zzso Here, we show that one such zzso termed zzso is a positive regulator of longevity and stress zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is zzso in a short-lived zzso zzso zzso is a putative zzso protein with an SCP domain and is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is required for the extension of the life span of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso reduces both life span and stress resistance of this zzso zzso whose expression is dependent on zzso is the first example of a putative zzso protein that positively regulates longevity and stress zzso
