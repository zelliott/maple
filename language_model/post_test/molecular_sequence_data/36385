Toward the goal of reducing diagnostic false zzso while retaining high sensitivity, a zzso zzso zzso procedure has been developed for detecting zzso human zzso virus zzso gag target DNA zzso Master mix for amplification 2, in a hanging gel zzso at the reaction tube top, remains zzso from the reaction space of the tube during amplification zzso A zzso excess of inner over outer zzso is built into the procedure to assure the high sensitivity of zzso zzso The master mix for amplification 2 is then introduced into the reaction space by zzso and the second amplification is performed as zzso The zzso zzso procedure shows sensitivity approaching that of the zzso control zzso which detects a single copy of zzso gag target DNA at zzso frequency, typically with zzso yields of specific amplification zzso
