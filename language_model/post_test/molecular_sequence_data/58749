We have isolated zzso clones zzso zzso zzso from human liver and its three zzso from human fetal zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequence of human zzso showed zzso identity with that of rat zzso and the three zzso showed zzso zzso identity with human zzso and zzso zzso identity with each zzso We tentatively termed these zzso human zzso related protein zzso zzso and zzso Human zzso showed zzso zzso identity with chicken zzso zzso response zzso protein of relative molecular mass of 62 zzso which is involved in zzso growth cone zzso Human zzso showed zzso zzso identity with two partial zzso sequences of rat zzso zzso on after division, 64 zzso which is specifically expressed in zzso zzso Human zzso and zzso showed a lower degree of zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus we describe a novel gene family which displays differential tissue zzso zzso human zzso in liver and zzso human zzso in zzso human zzso zzso expressed except for zzso human zzso mainly in heart and skeletal zzso
