An alternative synthesis of zzso zzso is zzso and its zzso reaction with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso Under normal zzso conditions with a zzso amount of zzso zzso showed only marginal activity for zzso with the zzso zzso consistent with our previous zzso However, when used in a relatively large zzso zzso could promote the zzso of the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso In addition to the initial zzso product, a series of large zzso were also formed due to the tandem zzso to the terminal zzso zzso in the intermediate zzso In the absence of an external zzso zzso could zzso the zzso zzso to form zzso and zzso having the zzso zzso zzso This is the first example of an zzso zzso of activated zzso zzso This zzso zzso may find useful applications for the synthesis of novel artificial zzso
