zzso brain zzso is the most common event leading to stroke in zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms associated with brain zzso we applied the technique of zzso differential display and isolated a gene that encodes a recently discovered zzso zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the rat focal stroke model of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso we determined that AM zzso expression was significantly increased in the zzso zzso up to zzso at 3 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 6 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and remained elevated for up to 15 days zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso studies localized AM to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso displacement revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of AM to zzso receptors in brain zzso The cerebrovascular function of AM was studied using synthetic AM zzso onto rat zzso vessels using a zzso window or applied to canine zzso arteries in zzso zzso applied zzso produced zzso relaxation of zzso zzso vessels zzso zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso AM administration at a high dose (8 zzso prior to and after zzso increased the degree of focal zzso injury zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of both AM zzso and zzso in zzso cortical zzso the demonstration of the direct zzso effects of the zzso on cerebral vessels, and the ability of AM to exacerbate zzso brain damage suggests that AM plays a significant role in focal zzso brain zzso
