zzso family zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso the effects of environmental stresses on zzso In seeds, proposed roles for zzso include protecting cellular integrity during zzso and/or zzso extending longevity in the dehydrated state, and providing zzso for energy generation during zzso A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso the first committed zzso in the zzso of zzso was cloned from tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seeds, and its expression was characterized in tomato seeds and zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated in developing tomato seeds zzso with maximum dry weight deposition and the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in mature, desiccated seeds but declined within 8 h of zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso accumulated again in zzso seeds prevented from completing zzso by dormancy or water zzso zzso zzso seeds maintained zzso zzso amounts after zzso unless supplied with zzso whereas zzso acid zzso did not prevent the loss of zzso zzso from zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso tomato seeds indicated that zzso amounts of zzso are not necessary for its zzso during seed zzso In all cases, zzso zzso was most prevalent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso but not by cold in zzso seeds, whereas both stresses induced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso implications of zzso expression patterns in seeds and leaves are discussed in light of the hypothesized role of zzso in plant stress zzso
