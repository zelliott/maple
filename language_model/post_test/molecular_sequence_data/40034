zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the maturation and zzso processes of the zzso zzso and zzso various cellular responses including nuclear metabolism and cell cycle zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso among all known zzso zzso and is not zzso by zzso in the zzso reactions demonstrated previously in zzso We report here that the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso carrying a zzso of zzso to zzso at the active site is inactive in maturation and zzso zzso To further understand the zzso mechanism zzso by zzso we have determined, at zzso A resolution (1 A zzso zzso zzso the X-ray structure of zzso zzso A comparison of the structure of zzso suggests strongly that zzso zzso require a zzso change prior to zzso of zzso or zzso bond in the maturation and zzso processes zzso Moreover, analysis of the interface of zzso and zzso has led to the identification of four unique zzso acids in zzso that facilitate the binding of zzso By means of an in zzso zzso we further demonstrate a novel function of zzso in zzso the zzso linkage in zzso and zzso zzso The results disclose a new mechanism of regulation of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
