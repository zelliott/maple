zzso of zzso bacteria to host cells is a crucial step during zzso The presence of specific zzso factors on the bacterial cell surface determines the zzso of the pathogen to the zzso expressing certain surface zzso The zzso is zzso primarily by zzso structures called zzso Three distinct zzso structures can be produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes zzso a total of nine zzso zzso named zzso through zzso and six zzso named zzso through zzso All the zzso genes are located on zzso islands and can be acquired and lost by different zzso The aim of presented studies was assessment of zzso of zzso genes among zzso zzso strains isolated from different infections, including invasive infections, in zzso 

Thirty-one zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from wounds, blood, nose and zzso were investigated for presence of 15 zzso zzso The studies were conducted using zzso Gene specific zzso were designed on the basis of the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All the zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from invasive infections possess every tested genes in contrast to zzso strains that revealed highly mosaic structure of zzso gene zzso zzso in gene content were detected in zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso Complete set of genes in zzso zzso gene cluster was detected in all but two zzso The two strains did not possess any of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso strains could be related to adhesive zzso zzso of our studies suggest that ability to express all types of zzso is indispensable for causing invasive infections by zzso zzso zzso Whereas full set zzso genes is not necessary for causing classical zzso
