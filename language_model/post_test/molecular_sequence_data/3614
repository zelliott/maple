The zzso zzso zzso zzso a variety of zzso cells by injecting its linear zzso DNA zzso into the host cell zzso while the protein zzso is left zzso The virus membrane and several structural proteins are involved in zzso DNA zzso In this work we identified a new zzso protein of zzso zzso of gene zzso resulted in a zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso The absence of the protein zzso did not compromise the particle assembly but led to a zzso in zzso DNA zzso In zzso particles the zzso membrane is unable to undergo a structural transformation from a zzso to a zzso zzso Since zzso particles are able to increase the zzso of the host cell envelope to a degree comparable to that found with zzso zzso we suggest that the zzso formation is needed to zzso the DNA from the zzso particle rather than to reach the host cell zzso
