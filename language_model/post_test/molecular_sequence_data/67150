In recent years, zzso zzso zzso have become an exciting area of zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in zzso zzso However, little is known about zzso in zzso In this study, we investigated the presence of zzso in zzso of zzso mice bearing zzso melanoma by using the differential display reverse zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso within the zzso zzso We took advantage of the ability of zzso to bind zzso in order to identify zzso of zzso activated during tumor zzso Thus, zzso that zzso with zzso were reversed zzso zzso zzso zzso and the secondary structure was zzso The ability of transcripts obtained by in zzso zzso to activate zzso was also zzso We detected a highly structured transcript of 220 zzso with no open reading frame zzso which is able to activate zzso and it is only expressed in zzso of zzso mice bearing zzso zzso zzso the 220 zzso transcript may be included in the class of zzso that act by zzso protein activity and our data suggest that regulation of gene expression in activated zzso by this zzso could be zzso by zzso through the zzso of the zzso factor zzso
