Fifty four bacterial strains were isolated from root zzso of the grain zzso zzso zzso Lens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso grown in cultivated lands of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso clustered the strains into 15 zzso zzso The nearly complete sequence of the zzso zzso gene from a representative strain of each zzso pattern showed that the strains were closely related to members of the family zzso of the zzso zzso alignments between globally aligned sequences indicated that the strains from zzso zzso had zzso identity with zzso zzso and those from zzso zzso zzso and zzso with sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso had zzso zzso and zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and those from zzso zzso had zzso identity with sequences from zzso zzso zzso of the strains from zzso zzso had zzso identity with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, determined as zzso zzso production, was detected in zzso formed after zzso of the corresponding host plant with the representative zzso zzso
