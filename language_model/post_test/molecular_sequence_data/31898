zzso possess an innate immune system that responds to invading zzso In this study, a zzso zzso library was constructed to screen for immune zzso genes in the fat bodies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso challenged with zzso zzso Four hundred putative zzso clones were identified by suppression zzso zzso zzso including 50 immune zzso zzso three zzso zzso eight cell cycle and zzso zzso five zzso and energy metabolism zzso five transport zzso 40 metabolism zzso ten stress response zzso four zzso and translation regulation genes and 77 unknown zzso To verify the reliability of the zzso data, the zzso of a set of randomly selected immune zzso genes were confirmed by zzso reverse zzso zzso and real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso These identified immune zzso genes provide insight into understanding the innate immunity in zzso zzso
