To investigate the effect of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso for zzso zzso zzso on the production of zzso in a transformed zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso synthesis was performed based on zzso extension of a short region of the gene through a series of zzso chain reactions zzso The artificial zzso gene contained zzso preferred by the zzso translation zzso The sequence was then integrated into a zzso expression zzso zzso The fusion construct was active and the transformed zzso cells produced higher level of zzso compared with the plant zzso zzso zzso 

zzso transformed with the zzso zzso zzso were more efficient in terms of production of zzso than those transformed with the plant zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso zzso of foreign genes by serial zzso reactions can be a solution to low efficiency of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso
