Despite sequence information from many zzso the evolution of the zzso Y zzso family of peptides has been difficult to resolve, particularly among zzso zzso We have used zzso location and sequence analyses to identify zzso and gene zzso in zzso fish zzso Our analyses support origin of zzso and zzso zzso zzso from a common zzso in early zzso evolution through a zzso zzso We report here that the zzso zzso generated zzso of both zzso and zzso and that all four genes are still present in the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has probably been lost whereas zzso zzso zzso seems to lack zzso Some of the previously published zzso sequences were misidentified and actually constitute zzso Our analyses confirm that the zzso previously named zzso in some fish species is a duplicate of the zzso gene and hence should be called zzso The zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso are predominantly expressed in brain, as detected by zzso whereas zzso and zzso are expressed in several zzso including brain, zzso and zzso Thus, also the resemblance in expression pattern supports the fish gene zzso zzso Our study shows that when sequence comparisons give ambiguous results, zzso location can serve as a useful criterion to identify zzso This strategy may help to resolve relationships in several families of short zzso
