zzso peptides are often generated by zzso zzso zzso of solutions containing peptides and a sodium zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso charged zzso zzso commonly provides specific sequence zzso However, these zzso may be difficult to form by directly zzso a zzso In the application of a recently described technique for forming metal containing zzso zzso in the gas phase, zzso zzso zzso charged zzso are formed via zzso zzso reactions of multiply zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso reactions can also be used to form zzso + zzso through the reduction of charge states of multiply charged, zzso zzso zzso The specificity and flexibility of the techniques employed provide a highly controlled means of generating zzso zzso and protein zzso Thus, the zzso presented here have potential for forming zzso not readily observed via zzso or zzso Furthermore, the use of zzso reactions to form zzso peptides zzso direct comparisons of the fragmentation behavior of zzso + zzso peptides formed in the absence of zzso with that of zzso + zzso peptides generated by directly zzso a sodium zzso zzso Thus, in addition to descriptions of the formation of zzso + zzso peptides in the gas phase using zzso zzso results from zzso of reaction products are presented zzso
