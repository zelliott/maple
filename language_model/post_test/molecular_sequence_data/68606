A group of zzso organisms zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso or healthy dogs, zzso zzso of all zzso from this zzso Since they formed a unique DNA zzso group within the zzso zzso and exhibited distinctive zzso properties, they were collectively termed the HC zzso A zzso zzso analysis was made of this zzso The zzso of four dog zzso and a single human isolate was unique and could be distinguished zzso from other zzso zzso microscopic zzso revealed defining characteristics of zzso The zzso zzso gene of the nominated type strain zzso zzso was zzso and its analysis delineated the group as a new species of zzso This conclusion was supported by relative DNA zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso We therefore propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso The species most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA probe was cloned from zzso zzso for use in routine laboratory identification and zzso zzso The zzso source, zzso tolerance and lack of zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that this new zzso species zzso the lower zzso rather than the zzso
