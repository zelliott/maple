The Kidd zzso blood group locus encodes a zzso zzso that is expressed on human red cells and on zzso cells of the zzso zzso in the zzso Here, we report the identification in human zzso of a novel zzso designated zzso which encodes a protein identical to the previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso except for a zzso zzso zzso substitution and a zzso zzso deletion after zzso zzso which leads to a zzso of zzso zzso versus 391 in zzso zzso typing by zzso chain reaction and transcript analysis by zzso protection zzso demonstrated that zzso encodes the true Kidd blood zzso zzso zzso which carries only 2 zzso zzso Upon expression at high levels in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid transfer of zzso (which was insensitive to zzso zzso or zzso a high water zzso and a selective zzso of small zzso including zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso However, at plasma membrane expression levels close to the level observed in the red cell zzso zzso water transport and small zzso zzso were absent and the zzso transport was poorly inhibited by zzso zzso but strongly inhibited by zzso These findings show that, at zzso expression levels, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not water zzso and that the observed water zzso is a feature of the red cell zzso zzso when expressed at zzso high zzso
