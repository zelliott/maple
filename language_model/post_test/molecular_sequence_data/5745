Previous studies suggested that the zzso gene plays an essential role in the development of zzso skeletons and nerves of zzso neural crest zzso To clarify this role, we have identified the zzso elements in mouse and zzso zzso genes responsible for the expression in the crest cells using a transgenic approach with the zzso reporter zzso In zzso 49 zzso sequences in the zzso zzso region upstream were essential and sufficient to direct the zzso expression in the zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso region, located far downstream (from zzso to zzso zzso had almost identical zzso Between them, several DNA sequences were zzso and zzso analyses indicated that motif A was critical for the zzso expression in the zzso region while motif B was critical in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso B, zzso contains the core motif for binding of zzso proteins while motif A, zzso does not match any known consensus binding sequences for zzso zzso The zzso zzso that expressed zzso under these zzso is most likely to zzso to zzso crest zzso Thus the molecular machinery regulating zzso expression in these cells appears to be zzso between mouse and fish, zzso a crucial role of the zzso gene in development of the zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso
