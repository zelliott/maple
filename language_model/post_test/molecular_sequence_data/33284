zzso zzso in zzso growth factor zzso have recently been described as the genetic cause of one form of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it remained unclear to date how these zzso lead to loss of biologically active zzso in the zzso 

We here report a novel zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 2, which changes zzso 129 from zzso to zzso zzso in a previously described individual affected by zzso The zzso zzso as well as two known zzso zzso zzso and zzso were introduced into an expression zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso to yield zzso zzso and zzso whole zzso zzso zzso and zzso media from zzso and zzso cells expressing these zzso were subjected to Western zzso analysis using zzso goat zzso and zzso zzso 

We detected zzso and zzso protein species in total zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso The zzso band, representing zzso zzso was not zzso in the zzso fraction of zzso from zzso cells expressing zzso and in comparison with zzso only small amounts of zzso were zzso into the zzso Similar results were obtained for cells expressing zzso and zzso 

Our data for the first time directly show that zzso zzso associated with zzso impair zzso in zzso resulting in poor zzso of the zzso hormone thereby explaining the characteristic zzso zzso of zzso carriers in zzso
