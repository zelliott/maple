zzso receptors zzso 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 play a crucial role in the recognition of viral entities and zzso of the innate immune zzso This work presents sequence analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso depicts novel zzso and describes zzso of zzso in zzso zzso infected and healthy zzso zzso 48 samples of the breed zzso were analyzed for the presence of zzso Within 20 zzso 14 were silent whereas 6 were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso infected compared to zzso sheep were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These three zzso were localized in extra zzso zzso rich zzso region of zzso while zzso zzso zzso was located within zzso zzso Both zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in extra zzso zzso The secondary structure analysis of zzso zzso and zzso revealed zzso zzso motif structure, however with some irregularities compared to cattle and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso between sheep and cattle wherein no zzso were zzso In both zzso zzso zzso were highly zzso with occurrence of 4 silent zzso zzso in zzso and zzso may play an important role as predisposition factor for zzso zzso zzso Considering the sequence zzso among zzso cattle and human genes zzso zzso and zzso we predict their similar function, zzso and downstream zzso
