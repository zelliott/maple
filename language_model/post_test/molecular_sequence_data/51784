To determine if zzso in the structural gene for zzso hormone zzso zzso are present in women with zzso 

Patients with hyperprolactinemia and controls were studied zzso for zzso zzso gene zzso 

Patients seen in a clinical setting were studied at a medical school laboratory zzso 

Fifteen women with hyperprolactinemia and two fertile controls with normal zzso levels were zzso 

zzso zzso acid zzso was extracted from each patient and subjected to Southern zzso analysis and zzso chain reaction zzso For Southern zzso analysis, DNA was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso to two DNA zzso for zzso zzso zzso II to IV, which zzso for the structural zzso were amplified by zzso 

zzso sizes from zzso were compared among patients and zzso zzso zzso products of zzso II to IV of the zzso zzso were also zzso 

No large zzso zzso or zzso were identified in women with hyperprolactinemia or controls by Southern zzso Each of the zzso was present and of normal size by zzso in the study patients and zzso 

No large deletions of the zzso zzso gene appear to be present in our patients with zzso Small zzso zzso or point zzso are not excluded by this zzso
