In previous work, we saw that zzso zzso a zzso zzso is produced by zzso zzso cancer cells and that zzso cancer cells express the zzso zzso Here, we examined the possibility that zzso acts as an zzso growth factor for zzso cancer zzso zzso of zzso gene expression by exposure to zzso zzso zzso resulted in greatly decreased cellular zzso Exposure of zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for a sequence in the second coding zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in decreased zzso production and a zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso However, the addition of zzso zzso failed to restore the proliferation of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso did not consistently inhibit cell growth nor did zzso enhance precursor frequency in a limiting dilution zzso These results suggest that zzso does not directly induce the proliferation of zzso cancer cells although zzso zzso production is needed for optimal cell zzso As the majority of zzso zzso zzso produce zzso the direct specific zzso of zzso gene expression is of potential therapeutic zzso
