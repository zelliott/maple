zzso of the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso causes zzso with a vast range of clinical severity from zzso onset with early zzso to onset after age 40 with rare episodes of zzso zzso The cause for this zzso is not zzso We report two patients from one family with highly divergent clinical course, one presenting zzso with a fatal form and the other at age 45 with benign zzso zzso The patients are compound zzso for two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso C and zzso + zzso zzso zzso The zzso containing each zzso are identical between the two patients, as are the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments show that the abnormal zzso transcripts generated by both zzso are identical in these two zzso We characterize promoter and zzso sequences of the zzso gene and find also in these regions no sequence differences between zzso Finally, we perform cloning experiments and find that in the zzso case, clones of zzso zzso zzso expressed from the zzso carrying the zzso + zzso zzso C zzso are zzso more than clones of zzso from the zzso with the zzso + zzso zzso C zzso whereas in the zzso case the two types of clones are equal, indicating skewed expression towards the zzso + zzso zzso C zzso in the zzso zzso Although we are yet to understand the mechanism of this differential zzso our work suggests that zzso imbalance may explain clinical zzso in zzso zzso in some zzso
