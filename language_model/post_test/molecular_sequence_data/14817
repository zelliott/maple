zzso zzso in which peptides were immobilized on cellulose zzso through zzso were zzso The peptides were subsequently detached from the zzso by ultraviolet zzso zzso for 3 zzso and were used to search for functional peptides that inhibit the activity of zzso derived from human pancreatic zzso zzso acid replacement with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso for the first and seventh zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso as previous reported, led to enhancement of the zzso effect of the zzso on zzso In particular, one of the resulting zzso zzso showed a stronger zzso effect than zzso (which is used as a zzso zzso or inhibitor zzso zzso
