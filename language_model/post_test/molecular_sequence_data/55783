A small number of zzso proteins are zzso and zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha and beta zzso was assessed by zzso labeling of zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells or insect zzso zzso The fatty acid was incorporated into all of the alpha zzso examined zzso zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso including those that are also zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso was released by treatment with base, suggesting attachment to the protein through a zzso or zzso zzso Limited zzso zzso of activated alpha o and alpha s resulted in release of the zzso portions of the proteins and radioactive zzso These data are consistent with zzso of the proteins near their zzso zzso most likely on zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso may provide an additional mechanism for regulation of signal zzso
