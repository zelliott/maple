The molecular basis of zzso interaction in zzso cancer patients has not been well zzso This lack of clarification is zzso the development of specific zzso for these zzso This study aimed to identify a set of zzso peptides zzso for the specific zzso of cancer patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso of the world population, with the highest expression among Brazilian zzso zzso and the lowest in the zzso population zzso We report zzso four zzso zzso zzso and 7 zzso peptides with the ability to induce zzso zzso zzso to tumor cell lines in the peripheral blood zzso cells of zzso cancer zzso These peptides might be useful for the development of a zzso zzso for zzso cancer zzso
