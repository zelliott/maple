zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso requires a reverse zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso The first description of an active form of a zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso H activities is reported zzso The zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso coli to facilitate zzso of the zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein was detected only when zzso acid zzso zzso by the zzso gene were added to the zzso of the reverse zzso H zzso This suggests that the zzso domain could play a role in proper folding of reverse zzso Several zzso properties of the zzso zzso were zzso including the effect of zzso zzso temperature and of the chain zzso zzso zzso on its zzso zzso zzso H activity was examined by monitoring the zzso of a zzso zzso Our results suggest that the distance between the zzso H and zzso active sites zzso to the length of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein produced in zzso coli should be useful for further zzso and structural analyses and for a better understanding of the role of zzso in the zzso of reverse zzso
