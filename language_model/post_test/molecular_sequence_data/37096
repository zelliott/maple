zzso between the zzso sequence of zzso and that deduced from a published zzso clone suggested the presence of an additional zzso gene in humans, zzso zzso amplification of zzso DNA yielded overlapping clones covering zzso of zzso DNA and extending from zzso upstream from zzso translation initiation to zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Southern zzso analysis showed the presence in humans of two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These two genes share zzso sequence identity and have similar zzso sizes and zzso Short zzso insertions zzso or zzso in zzso 1, 3, 9, and 11, and deletions zzso or zzso in zzso 4, 6, and 11 differentiate the two zzso zzso amplification of human kidney zzso followed by restriction zzso analysis showed that zzso is the zzso zzso expressed in zzso
