Ran is a small zzso that is essential for nuclear zzso zzso processing, maintenance of structural integrity of zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso is a highly zzso Ran zzso zzso zzso zzso We sought to use zzso egg extracts for the development of an in zzso zzso for zzso activity in nuclear zzso protein import, and DNA zzso Surprisingly, when we used zzso zzso to zzso zzso from zzso egg zzso we found that the extracts were also depleted of zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, suggesting that these proteins form a stable zzso In contrast to previous observations using extracts that had been depleted of zzso only, extracts lacking both zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit defects in zzso of nuclear zzso nuclear zzso or DNA zzso zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso to zzso extracts to restore only one of the depleted proteins caused abnormal nuclear assembly and inhibited nuclear transport and DNA replication in a manner that could be rescued be further addition of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Ran proteins could partially rescue nuclear function in extracts without zzso or without zzso in a manner that was correlated with their zzso binding zzso These results suggest that little zzso or zzso is required for nuclear zzso nuclear import, or DNA replication in the absence of the other zzso The results further suggest that the balance of zzso and zzso is critical for proper nuclear assembly and function in zzso
