Bangladesh has an overall low zzso prevalence of zzso in the general population and zzso among key affected zzso but it is one of few Asian countries that has yet to reverse the zzso In order to do this, it is important to understand the transmission dynamics in this zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso relationships of zzso zzso C strains from Bangladesh and related strains from other countries, and thereby clarify when and from where zzso C was introduced in the country and how it subsequently spread within zzso The zzso analysis included 118 zzso gag sequences and 128 sequences from other countries and was performed using the zzso zzso Our analysis revealed that the vast majority of zzso sequences zzso zzso fall into a large regional cluster of samples from Bangladesh, India, China and zzso which dates back to the early zzso Following its establishment in the region, this strain has entered Bangladesh multiple times from around 1975 and zzso but extensive zzso transmission could only be detected among drug users and not through sexual zzso In addition, there have been multiple (at least zzso introductions of zzso C to Bangladesh from outside this region, but no extensive spread could be detected for any of zzso Since many zzso remain zzso while zzso the true extent of the transmission of each strain remains unknown, especially among hard to reach groups such as clients of sex workers and returning migrants with zzso
