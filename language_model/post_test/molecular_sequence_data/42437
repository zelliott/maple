DNA sequence analysis of overlapping shotgun and restriction fragments have revealed the entire sequence of the human lens fiber cell intrinsic membrane protein zzso gene (also termed zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene contains 5 zzso zzso a mature protein of 173 zzso zzso which displayed a very high degree of identity zzso with that of bovine zzso deduced from a bovine zzso zzso The zzso range in size from 52 bases zzso 1) to about 340 bases zzso zzso The zzso consist of two large segments zzso B and zzso of about 4,700 bases and 1,800 zzso respectively, and two small segments zzso A and zzso of about 450 and 250 bases zzso Seven zzso family DNA repeats are found within the human zzso zzso The zzso gene includes 100 bases of zzso zzso zzso
