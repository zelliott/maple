zzso DNA of the green zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso mapping directly revealed that, before zzso zzso DNA of maternal zzso type zzso zzso zzso is heavily zzso whereas that of paternal zzso type zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso analyses with zzso zzso visually showed zzso to occur exclusively in zzso DNA of zzso zzso and not in zzso zzso or nuclear DNA of either zzso To clarify the relationship between zzso and maternal inheritance of zzso DNA, we have isolated and characterized a zzso zzso a DNA zzso The deduced zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and contains a zzso zzso domain at the C terminal and a zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso region has an zzso domain, suggesting zzso is transferred to zzso This finding could be directly shown by green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found to be absent in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso however, transcript levels clearly increased in zzso but not zzso zzso These experiments suggest that the zzso protein is located in zzso and that it specifically zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA in zzso zzso This conclusion was further strengthened by the observation that, during zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso DNA is heavily zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The results provide evidence that zzso zzso plays a critical role in maternal inheritance of zzso genes in zzso zzso
