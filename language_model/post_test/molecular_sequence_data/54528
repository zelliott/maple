Members of the human zzso family of editing zzso can inhibit various mobile genetic zzso zzso zzso can block the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso virus type 2 zzso but does not inhibit zzso In contrast, zzso zzso can block zzso but has only limited effects on zzso or zzso What dictates this differential target specificity remains largely zzso Here, we modeled the structure of zzso based on its zzso with the zzso domain of zzso and further compared the sequence of human zzso to those of 11 nonhuman zzso zzso We then used these data to perform a zzso analysis of zzso examining its ability to restrict zzso zzso and foreign zzso DNA and to edit a zzso DNA zzso The results revealed an essential functional role for the predicted zzso zzso groove located around the zzso zzso zzso Within this region, zzso acid differences between zzso and zzso are predicted to affect the shape of the zzso zzso zzso transferring some of these zzso zzso to zzso zzso the latter protein with the ability to block zzso and zzso These results suggest that the target specificity of zzso family members is partly defined by structural features influencing their interaction with zzso zzso
