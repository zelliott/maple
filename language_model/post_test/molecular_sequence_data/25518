A zzso zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart were isolated from zzso zzso libraries using a human zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The clones contain a zzso open reading frame predicting a zzso acid, zzso 18 zzso protein which is similar in size to, and which shares 68 and zzso zzso with, human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern blots show the presence of a single zzso species of about 800 zzso However, zzso Southern blots suggest the presence of at least one other zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso was engineered for expression in zzso coli, and the resulting zzso zzso like zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso zzso zzso activity which was sensitive to zzso by zzso A in zzso These results indicate that the gene which we have cloned encodes a zzso zzso zzso We designate this gene zzso zzso Interestingly, the predicted zzso zzso protein contains only two zzso zzso which do not align with any of the four zzso zzso among zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso mechanism may not involve an zzso zzso as previously reported for zzso zzso
