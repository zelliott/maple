Renal zzso of a zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso was evaluated following intravenous infusion into zzso The zzso contained 21 zzso zzso of the infused dose at five hours after infusion and 3 zzso zzso of the infused dose at four days after zzso The concentration of zzso was greater in the kidney than in the liver, zzso or plasma at both zzso zzso zzso of zzso label averaged 17 zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso and 64 zzso zzso of the infused dose at five hours, one day, and four days after zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was retained in the kidney was the intact zzso at both five hours and four days after infusion, while full size zzso was not found in the urine at either zzso Light microscopic zzso showed that zzso zzso was most prominent in the early zzso zzso zzso microscopic zzso indicated that zzso was not confined to the brush border or zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso fluid to plasma concentration ratios of zzso label averaged 7 zzso zzso in zzso space and 6 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Despite restriction of zzso by plasma protein zzso as indicated by the low zzso space to plasma concentration ratio, the calculated zzso zzso rate for zzso was sufficient to account for the large amount of zzso found in the kidney after intravenous zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso plays a prominent role in the disposition of zzso infused zzso and raise the possibility that zzso could exert zzso effects in this zzso zzso
