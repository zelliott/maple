We describe the zzso zzso response of a zzso zzso zzso disease patient zzso Interestingly, this patient had T cells recognizing zzso in the context of human zzso zzso zzso molecules of both zzso For the zzso zzso zzso was identified as the zzso zzso As zzso carries zzso at zzso zzso but is otherwise identical to zzso and not considered associated with zzso disease, we aimed to characterize this zzso zzso response in zzso By zzso of zzso zzso zzso we identified an zzso zzso for several zzso zzso This zzso was identical to an zzso zzso previously identified in zzso zzso In zzso this was the dominant zzso zzso whereas no zzso response was found toward two other zzso zzso These findings correlated with zzso binding data demonstrating that this zzso bound better to zzso than the two other zzso zzso Although zzso to zzso exchange at zzso improved binding of all three zzso to zzso no such effect was observed for zzso The differential ability of zzso and zzso to harness a zzso charged anchor at zzso may result in fewer potential zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data further indicate that zzso is a zzso factor for zzso zzso
