zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso reactions via the zzso zzso of the zzso active center zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein with a fold characterized by a central zzso surrounded by zzso zzso The interaction of the zzso zzso zzso 5) of zzso against the remainder of the protein involves the close packing of zzso surfaces, opening the possibility of studying a fine-tuned molecular recognition zzso To evaluate the relevance of this interaction on the folding mechanism of zzso we characterize zzso a truncated zzso of zzso devoid of the last stretch of 15 zzso acid zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso may possibly represent a molecular form where the folding process becomes zzso giving rise to a structure exhibiting the features of a molten zzso zzso This was assessed by circular zzso intrinsic fluorescence, binding of the probe zzso zzso zzso limited zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso bringing forth the restoration of zzso signatures and zzso zzso This represents a molecular event of zzso structure selection where both partners gain order, thus leading to long-range consequences on zzso In this context, the binding of the zzso zzso could signify a late event in the consolidation of the overall zzso zzso
