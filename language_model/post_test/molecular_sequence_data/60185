The zzso zzso of 58 peptides that varied in size from 2 to 39 zzso acids and varied in charge from zzso to zzso are zzso The zzso were conducted at 22 degrees C using a zzso linear zzso column and a 50 zzso zzso buffer at pH zzso Excellent separation of peptides and highly reliable zzso maps of protein zzso are routinely obtained using these experimental zzso The zzso data were used to test existing theoretical models that correlate zzso mobility with physical zzso The results indicate that the zzso model that zzso zzso mobility with the zzso zzso zzso offers the best fit of our reliable experimental zzso Furthermore, we also obtained the zzso zone zzso profile of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso sequencing standard, zzso and horse zzso under the same experimental conditions as described zzso The resulting zzso maps were compared with corresponding theoretical zzso
