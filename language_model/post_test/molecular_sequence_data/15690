zzso acid recognition is often zzso by zzso or zzso regions that fold into zzso on zzso A zzso bearing the DNA recognition zzso of zzso zzso displays type II zzso zzso structure as judged by zzso temperature, and zzso effects on the CD zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso zzso is stabilized at the zzso while the zzso forms at the zzso half of the zzso zzso of the zzso angles of the DNA binding zzso in the crystal structure and analysis of the zzso chemical shift indexes confirm that the zzso half is a zzso zzso while the zzso half adopts a zzso zzso zzso These regions precisely match two locally driven folding zzso which partake in the native zzso core and zzso a zzso switch in the DNA binding zzso The zzso shows only weak and unspecific residual DNA zzso zzso lower zzso and zzso lower discrimination capacity compared with the zzso Thus, the precise side chain zzso required for modulated and tight zzso binding by zzso zzso is largely determined by the zzso strained zzso zzso zzso by this unique zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
