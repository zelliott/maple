Plant zzso are important zzso contributing to numerous food and zzso zzso They zzso essential functions in all zzso cells, including zzso and zzso making breeding of zzso crop plants an impossible zzso To obtain zzso zzso a novel zzso based screening system to select for fully active but zzso zzso was zzso Despite similar biological functions, plant zzso share only limited zzso acid sequence identity to zzso zzso Thus, it should be possible to select for zzso zzso zzso that have kept their biological zzso These zzso were subsequently tested for zzso and their zzso folding was zzso As zzso we developed a conditional zzso zzso zzso strain and made use of a zzso zzso zzso from tomato that enabled zzso for efficient zzso After random zzso and transformation of tomato zzso zzso e 1) into the designed zzso strain, we were able to screen for functional tomato zzso zzso Testing these zzso for zzso binding revealed that two zzso showed a strong reduction in zzso binding of four zzso e 1 zzso patients and one birch zzso allergic zzso This result, for the first time, provides strong evidence that selection of zzso zzso e 1 zzso is zzso Furthermore, this knowledge provides the basis for the molecular breeding of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
