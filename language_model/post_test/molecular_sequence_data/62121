The zzso in animal cells provides a major zzso site that regulates the zzso zzso temporally and zzso throughout the cell zzso We report the identification in zzso zzso of a large zzso zzso protein that can bind to zzso zzso studies reveal that this novel zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 309 zzso zzso zzso with the zzso ring complex and the zzso zzso We show that zzso is required for zzso nucleation zzso by zzso and that it interacts with the zzso small zzso These findings suggest that the zzso activity of the zzso requires the function of zzso
