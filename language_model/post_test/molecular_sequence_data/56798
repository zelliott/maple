We have established two zzso human lung zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso from their original cell line zzso To discover which proteins are associated with zzso resistance, we carried out a two-dimensional gel zzso to analyze differences in protein zzso between zzso zzso and zzso A protein spot zzso 50 zzso zzso was reduced markedly and a spot zzso 50 zzso zzso was increased when zzso and zzso were compared with zzso A spot zzso 58 zzso zzso newly appeared only in zzso Cell zzso showed that the zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 50 zzso zzso fell within the nuclear zzso while the zzso 58 zzso zzso was found among the zzso and zzso zzso zzso after in zzso zzso of the dramatically reduced spot zzso revealed that it was identical to 50 zzso type I zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso reduction was zzso with a zzso increase in zzso resistance in zzso Our report is the first to suggest the possible association of marked zzso reduction and zzso resistance in zzso and zzso
