A zzso that encodes human zzso a constituent protein of the zzso zzso system, was cloned with zzso zzso zzso as a probe from a human liver zzso library constructed with an expression zzso zzso zzso The longest size of zzso of the isolated clones was about 750 base long zzso zzso On the other hand, we determined the primary structure of human zzso from the zzso terminal zzso by the 12th zzso including a zzso zzso In addition to the finding that most zzso zzso cloned zzso with the synthetic DNA probe composed of the possible sequences for the zzso we confirmed that zzso zzso encodes the partial primary structure of zzso in an open reading zzso
