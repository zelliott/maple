The spinal zzso injury and zzso gene zzso zzso which was identified in our screen for genes zzso after spinal zzso injury, zzso a protein belonging to the zzso response zzso protein zzso family of zzso zzso Our previous study showed that zzso functions as a zzso zzso However, the target gene regulated by zzso and its roles in injured zzso remain zzso In this study, we showed that zzso is widely distributed in the central nervous zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso Following mechanical injury to zzso zzso was induced and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the nucleus where it bound to zzso zzso factor zzso gene promoter zzso In addition, zzso and zzso studies confirmed that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso expression in injured zzso As expected, the culture zzso of zzso cells zzso expressing zzso contained higher levels of zzso and more remarkably promoted zzso outgrowth in a spinal zzso slice culture model in zzso than the zzso of control zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel regulator of the zzso gene and may play an important role in the repair and/or zzso of damaged neural zzso by specifically zzso zzso promoter zzso
