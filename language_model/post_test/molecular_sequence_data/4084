zzso of a human melanoma cell line by a zzso zzso resulted in transmission of a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso to some of the cells infected by the zzso followed by zzso integration, and expression of the zzso zzso One zzso carried a tissue factor zzso zzso that generated high zzso melanoma zzso and another zzso was a control without the zzso zzso that generated low zzso zzso Some high zzso melanoma clones contained the zzso zzso and others did not, and some low zzso melanoma clones contained the zzso zzso and others did zzso Each type of melanoma clone was tested for its zzso potential in severe combined zzso zzso mice, by zzso injection of the cells to generate lung zzso None of the low zzso clones that either contained or lacked the zzso zzso generated lung tumors, consistent with earlier results showing that high zzso expression promoted zzso The high zzso clones containing the zzso zzso were strongly zzso in contrast to the high zzso clones lacking the zzso zzso which were zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso integrated into different zzso sites in different melanoma zzso suggesting that the effect of the zzso zzso on zzso depends not on integration per zzso but instead on expression of the zzso zzso A role for the zzso zzso in zzso and possibly other cell functions is an unexpected finding, because the zzso appears to lack significant coding potential for a functional zzso The zzso effect might be zzso directly by a zzso zzso zzso or by a zzso or small protein zzso by one of the short zzso in the zzso zzso
