Over the last two decades, zzso syndrome virus zzso has emerged as a major pathogen in zzso shrimp aquaculture and has caused substantial economic zzso The disease was first discovered in Ecuador in 1991, and the virus is now globally distributed with the greatest concentration of infections in the Americas and Southeast zzso To determine the evolutionary history of this virus, we constructed a zzso containing 83 zzso zzso from 16 countries sampled over a 16-year zzso This zzso was zzso using a relaxed molecular clock in a zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso We found zzso evidence that the zzso epidemic did indeed originate in the Americas sometime around 1991 zzso We estimated the zzso zzso substitution rate at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso gene zzso In addition, the zzso was able to independently corroborate many of the suspected routes of zzso transmission around the zzso Finally, we asked whether zzso emergence in new geographic locations operates under a quick fuse zzso rapid appearance of widespread zzso Using a relaxed molecular clock, we determined that zzso is almost always discovered within a year of entering a new zzso This suggests that current monitoring programs are effective at detecting novel zzso zzso
