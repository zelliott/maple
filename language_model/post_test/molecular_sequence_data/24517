Two distinct protein zzso pathways that employ zzso signal peptides function in the plant zzso zzso These two systems are precursor specific and distinguished by their energy and component zzso Recent studies have shown that one zzso is zzso to the bacterial general export system called zzso The other one, called the zzso pathway, was originally considered to be unique to plant zzso However, it is now known that zzso transport systems are widely present in zzso and even present in zzso Here we review these protein transport pathways and discuss their capabilities and mechanisms of zzso
