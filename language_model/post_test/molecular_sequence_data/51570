The zzso protein found enriched in the zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction of the zzso in bovine lens zzso cells is zzso processed to a stable zzso zzso The 115 zzso protein and the zzso zzso have been zzso by a combination of zzso exchange and zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping using reverse phase zzso and subsequent zzso sequencing confirmed that the zzso zzso is derived from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also a component of the zzso as well as being a major component of the zzso soluble fraction of lens plasma zzso which have been extracted with buffers containing zzso zzso The zzso zzso has escaped identification as a breakdown product of the zzso protein because it is not zzso by a commonly used zzso zzso zzso specific for the bovine zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso is important in determining the zzso of the zzso zzso and that part of this function is satisfied by the zzso protein zzso Both the zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso were unable to form either beaded or intermediate filaments on their own but they were able to form short zzso rods indicative of an intermediate stage in intermediate filament zzso zzso zzso the assembly properties of the 53 and zzso proteins indicate that there are sequences in the zzso protein which inhibit in zzso zzso This is similar to the situation with zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso protein is a zzso intermediate filament zzso
