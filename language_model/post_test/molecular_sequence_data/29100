We have previously shown that the protein zzso inhibitor beta zzso form of the zzso protein zzso inhibitor exists in multiple zzso some of which are specific zzso of the zzso protein zzso whereas others also inhibit the zzso zzso zzso Van zzso and Walsh (1997), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now demonstrated that the switch from a zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor to one with dual specificity arises as a consequence of alternate gene zzso We have confirmed using zzso produced pure protein that a single inhibitor species has dual specificity for both zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso each with very high and closely similar zzso zzso The gene zzso converted a protein with 70 zzso acids into one of 109 zzso zzso and did not change the zzso potency to zzso but changed it from a protein that had no zzso zzso zzso activity to one that now inhibited zzso in the zzso zzso
