The zzso structural model proposed for sequences that mediate zzso of certain zzso contains zzso three stems and 13 zzso zzso zzso deletion and base substitution zzso were carried out on a 58 base zzso containing the sequence of the zzso structure of the plus zzso of the zzso of zzso transient streak virus, and the effects on zzso zzso zzso showed that there is flexibility in the sequence requirements for zzso in zzso but zzso of the zzso sequence or predicted secondary structure generally reduced the efficiency of zzso
