The genes for the zzso Surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso are transcribed in zzso expression sites zzso There are about 20 different zzso per zzso zzso Usually, only one is active at a time, but zzso can switch the zzso that is active at a low rate zzso per cell per zzso To study zzso and zzso of zzso we have generated a line of zzso zzso zzso with three zzso marked with a different drug resistance zzso We show that a selection with any combination of two of these drugs leads to an unstable zzso zzso in which the two zzso containing the corresponding marker genes switch backward and forward at a very high rate zzso per cell per zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso We conclude that the unstable zzso state is a natural intermediate in zzso zzso It only involves two zzso whereas the other zzso are not zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso can exist at several different stable levels of zzso zzso a zzso zzso shows a low level of expression of promoter zzso zzso the level of zzso can be zzso increased, leading to partially activated zzso
