Generation of zzso transgenic crop plants by expression of the zzso crystal protein zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso is a standard crop improvement zzso In such cases, adequate expression of the most appropriate zzso against the target insect zzso of the crop species is zzso It is also considered advantageous to generate zzso with multiple toxin systems to control rapid development of zzso resistance to the zzso zzso of yellow stem zzso zzso zzso zzso a major zzso insect zzso of rice, cause massive losses of rice zzso Studies on insect feeding and on the binding properties of zzso to brush border membrane receptors in the zzso of zzso larvae revealed that zzso and zzso are two individually suitable candidate genes for developing zzso zzso Programs were undertaken to develop zzso rice with these zzso genes independently in a single zzso A zzso gene was reconstructed and placed under control of the zzso zzso 1 promoter, along with the first zzso of the zzso zzso 1 zzso and the zzso zzso The gene construct was delivered to zzso zzso of zzso an elite zzso rice zzso using the particle zzso zzso Six highly expressive independent transgenic zzso lines were zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso of two such lines revealed that the transferred synthetic zzso gene was expressed zzso in the zzso generation of these lines and that the transgenic rice plants were highly toxic to zzso larvae and lessened the damage caused by their zzso
