The full-length sequence and zzso expression of zzso zzso are zzso zzso of the gene are first detected in the zzso zzso where the zzso zzso is forming and subsequently in the definitive zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso which plays an early zzso role in the zzso of the zzso zzso and a later role in zzso control of zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression is not zzso specific because the zzso zzso the only structure expressing the zzso is not zzso to the zzso zzso instead, the zzso zzso of zzso is a specialized region of the zzso zzso called the zzso We propose that zzso the zzso of an zzso zzso of the zzso included a zzso zzso that expressed zzso as well as an zzso that did not, and zzso the zzso zzso soon disappeared in the zzso line of descent but zzso not before there was a zzso transfer of zzso expression from the zzso zzso to the nearby zzso Such a transfer could have provided part of the genetic program enabling the zzso to separate from the zzso zzso and migrate away as the zzso of the zzso zzso
