The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned into zzso coli and zzso It consists of 336 zzso zzso including the zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso This zzso gene is located 225 base pairs downstream from the gap gene and is part of the gap zzso Previous studies have shown that the specific activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso do not change zzso in zzso zzso although the two zzso appear to be under the control of a common zzso The translated zzso acid sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso is less zzso than those of zzso zzso A comparison of known sequences for zzso zzso revealed a high degree of conservation of structure with 102 zzso acid positions being retained by zzso In general, the zzso acid positions at the boundaries of zzso and zzso regions and those connecting these regions were more highly zzso than the zzso acid positions within regions of secondary zzso
