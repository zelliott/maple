zzso zzso by zzso the zzso determining regions zzso of a zzso zzso to a human framework aims to reduce the response of the human immune system against a foreign zzso zzso however, some zzso zzso acids from the framework have to be retained to recover binding zzso 

To redesign zzso a mouse zzso zzso zzso that binds the human zzso growth factor zzso and zzso the binding of zzso to be a human zzso 

The light and heavy chains of zzso and zzso respectively, were selected as human zzso zzso zzso for zzso based on their high zzso with the corresponding sequences of zzso zzso zzso modeling was used to analyze the possible effects of mutating zzso zzso that zzso the zzso 

zzso dramatically reduced the binding capability of the zzso zzso modeling suggested that two zzso acids zzso 76 and zzso zzso among five zzso heavy chain variable region zzso zzso underlying the zzso were critical for zzso zzso The five zzso were zzso back to the original zzso zzso acids in different combinations contained in six zzso of humanized zzso In agreement with molecular modeling zzso The zzso in which three zzso zzso were retained zzso 75, zzso 76 and zzso zzso exhibited a similar capacity to inhibit the binding of zzso zzso to its zzso as compared with the original zzso This humanized zzso was at least zzso less zzso in African Green monkeys than the zzso zzso 

Only very few zzso in the zzso may be necessary to recover the binding capability of a humanized zzso zzso modeling can serve as a powerful tool to identify zzso critical for zzso
