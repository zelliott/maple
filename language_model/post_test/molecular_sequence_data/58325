Spinal sensory zzso root zzso zzso zzso display slowly zzso zzso zzso and rapidly zzso zzso zzso Na zzso zzso of the zzso Na current and enhancement of zzso Na current have been demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the adult rat after zzso and may zzso abnormal zzso We show here that zzso levels of transcripts zzso the zzso zzso which is associated with a slowly zzso zzso current when expressed in zzso are reduced significantly 5 days following zzso of zzso zzso and continue to be expressed at reduced levels, even after 210 zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso which are present at low levels in control zzso zzso show a pattern of zzso increased zzso In zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso showed a decreased signal for zzso and an increased signal for zzso in both large and small zzso zzso following zzso zzso levels of zzso may explain the selective loss of slowly zzso zzso zzso The abnormal zzso properties of zzso zzso following zzso injury thus appear to reflect a switch in Na channel gene zzso
