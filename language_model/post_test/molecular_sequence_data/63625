The zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso were detected to bind to the promoter region of the resuscitation promoting factor 2 zzso gene involved in growth and zzso of zzso zzso zzso sites were identified by zzso analysis and verified by zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deregulation of zzso expression was demonstrated in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The deduced network of regulatory interactions provided insights into the complex regulation pattern of zzso expression in zzso zzso
