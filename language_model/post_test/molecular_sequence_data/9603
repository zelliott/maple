zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso de zzso zzso zzso pathway, and is the molecular target of the zzso zzso compound zzso sodium zzso We have shown previously that the activity of the zzso human zzso displays pH and zzso sensitivities that zzso a critical role for one or more zzso zzso in zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the results of zzso scanning zzso for each of the 8 zzso zzso of the zzso human zzso In most cases, the replacement of zzso by zzso had little effect on the zzso values of the two zzso zzso and zzso or on the overall zzso of the zzso zzso Replacement of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso however, completely abolished zzso zzso The loss of activity for the zzso zzso was unexpected, since this zzso is not zzso in the zzso rat zzso in the zzso zzso this zzso is an zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso in the human zzso led to a full recovery of zzso activity, indicating that a zzso is not required at this zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso led to about a zzso reduction in zzso activity relative to the zzso zzso with no significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was, however, at least zzso less sensitive to zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso While the zzso and other zzso zzso displayed zzso values for zzso zzso between 6 and 10 zzso the zzso zzso was inhibited less than zzso at zzso of zzso as high as 150 zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso binding to the zzso
