zzso (AP) sites are zzso DNA zzso which occur spontaneously and following exposure of cells to zzso radiation or chemical zzso zzso (Human zzso zzso 1), the major zzso in human cells initiating repair of zzso sites, shows strong sequence zzso to DNA repair zzso from bacteria, zzso and other zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso gene and determined its complete zzso zzso The site of zzso initiation has been mapped to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of five zzso and is unusually small (less than zzso zzso from zzso initiation site to zzso zzso with zzso of the protein coding region and the entire 3' untranslated region contained within a single zzso The first zzso is zzso zzso of three zzso show sequence zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso the zzso gene has been zzso to human zzso zzso zzso
