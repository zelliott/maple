In response to environmental challenges, plant cells activate several signaling pathways that trigger the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported to be involved in zzso regulation under drought zzso Here, two zzso zzso of the zzso gene are shown to play a crucial role in zzso zzso This role was demonstrated by zzso each zzso resulting in enhanced sensitivity to water deficit zzso The zzso zzso zzso despite the fact that one of which lacks the first two zzso zzso the first zzso DNA binding domain, both zzso to the nucleus and promote guard cell zzso in response to water zzso Moreover, zzso expression is increased in response to a low level of zzso and decreased in response to high level of zzso At initial stage of drought stress, the plant system may zzso the root growth behavior by regulating zzso zzso thus promotes root growth for increased water zzso In contrast, severe drought stress zzso the expression of the zzso zzso resulting in zzso closure and root growth zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso plays a dual role in zzso stress responses in zzso through its involvement in zzso regulation and root zzso
