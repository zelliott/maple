The silk zzso of zzso zzso a highly zzso tissue contains high levels of DNA zzso zzso delta and zzso but not DNA zzso However, we detected the latter activity in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso has been zzso to zzso from the zzso zzso by a series of column zzso and affinity zzso zzso The zzso satisfied the criteria to be designated as DNA zzso based on its small size, requirement for high concentration of zzso zzso for zzso activity, sensitivity to zzso and zzso to zzso It is a zzso zzso of zzso 40 zzso and the zzso for zzso ranges between zzso zzso DNA zzso is zzso and zzso distinct from DNA zzso from the silk zzso of zzso zzso The zzso showed a preference for gapped DNA, and could not zzso ultraviolet zzso template beyond the zzso zzso The absence of any associated zzso and zzso activities from this zzso and its conspicuous absence in the highly zzso zzso imply that it is unlikely to participate in the DNA zzso zzso
