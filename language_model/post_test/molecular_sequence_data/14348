zzso of zzso zzso is a common zzso modification in proteins and has been studied extensively because of its important biological effects, such as those on zzso activity, protein zzso and zzso zzso However, characterization of the sites of zzso of a protein has been a difficult zzso zzso In this study, mass zzso has been used as an zzso tool to characterize the zzso of zzso an zzso zzso Upon incubation of the protein at alkaline pH for 5 zzso intact mass analysis of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated an increase in the mass of zzso zzso suggesting possible zzso of the zzso The sites of zzso have been identified using the conventional bottom-up approach using a zzso liquid zzso connected on line to an zzso zzso mass zzso and top down approach by direct infusion of the intact protein and zzso inside zzso These chemical modifications are shown to lead to stabilization of an unfolding zzso which can be observed in equilibrium unfolding zzso
