We investigated the zzso profile of zzso B zzso and zzso C zzso viruses and the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso zzso consecutive patients with zzso were included in the study - 18 of them with zzso zzso and 20 with zzso single zzso zzso additional patients with zzso without zzso were recruited as the control zzso zzso activity was evaluated by detecting and zzso both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso region, encompassing the zzso zzso signal involved in viral zzso was zzso by direct zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso in comparison with zzso zzso whereas two different zzso zzso profiles were detected in zzso with or without circulating zzso zzso zzso D was prevalent in the three groups and zzso zzso zzso was found to be the infecting strain in all zzso Lower zzso in the zzso region was found in zzso in comparison with zzso single infection zzso zzso zzso A synonymous zzso zzso was found in all zzso zzso cases not related to the presence or absence of circulating zzso and a zzso zzso strain, characterized by the same zzso pattern, was identified in three zzso zzso The zzso pattern of the zzso region was closely related to zzso replication efficiency, and specific zzso zzso selectively associated with zzso zzso could be linked with accelerated zzso disease zzso
