zzso diminution in the zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an interesting case of zzso programmed DNA zzso in higher zzso At the molecular level, it is a rather complex event including zzso zzso new zzso formation and DNA zzso Analysis of a cloned zzso zzso zzso revealed that it has been newly created during the process of zzso diminution by the addition of zzso repeats zzso to a zzso breakage site zzso et zzso zzso However, zzso addition does not occur at a single zzso zzso but at many different sites within a short zzso region, termed zzso zzso breakage region zzso Here we present the cloning and the analysis of 83 different zzso amplified zzso addition sites from the region of zzso The lack of any obvious sequence zzso shared among them argues for a zzso healing process, rather than for a zzso zzso This hypothesis is strongly supported by the existence of zzso zzso corresponding to and being in frame with the newly added zzso repeats at almost all of the zzso addition zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso are not only added to the ends of the retained zzso portions, but also to the eliminated part of the zzso which later on become zzso in the zzso This result suggests that de zzso zzso formation during the process of zzso diminution represents a zzso process which can heal any broken DNA zzso
