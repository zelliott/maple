zzso A and B are the major components in an zzso mixture of zzso peptides from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectral studies coupled with zzso acid analysis indicate that the gross structures of zzso A and B are zzso zzso where zzso is a zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso where Ade is a zzso unit, zzso zzso zzso a minor zzso zzso differs in gross structure from zzso A in possessing a zzso acid unit zzso in lieu of zzso whereas zzso D, a minor zzso zzso differs from zzso B in possessing a zzso unit zzso instead of an Ade zzso
