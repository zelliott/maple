zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso from human zzso and zzso In order to raise zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with a preparation from zzso or with a mixture of eight synthetic peptides that were deduced from the primary structures of zzso and human zzso zzso zzso were raised in rabbits against five synthetic peptides deduced from the zzso acid sequence of human zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were characterized by their ability to recognize zzso in various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso With one exception all zzso zzso recognized zzso on zzso some were particularly zzso one bound active zzso in zzso when used as capture zzso most zzso recognized immobilized zzso in zzso Two zzso zzso out of nine gave particularly excellent results in zzso zzso zzso and fibers on sections from rat and zzso zzso With the help of nine synthetic peptides it was possible to evaluate two major binding sites for the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso
