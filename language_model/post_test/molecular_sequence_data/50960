zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso fatty acids such as zzso and zzso acid into zzso zzso zzso zzso which then serve as zzso for other zzso leading to the production of a variety of secondary zzso In order to explore the characteristics of the individual zzso zzso in more detail larger amounts of the pure zzso are needed and their production in a zzso host is therefore zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 were expressed in zzso zzso with the aid of zzso coli shuttle zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso 2 under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene promoter yielded significant amounts of active zzso inside the cell, both with zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene on zzso plasmids or integrated in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signal sequence in front of the pea zzso 3 yielded zzso active zzso zzso in the zzso but large amounts of inactive zzso 3 remained inside the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can be achieved either zzso with the zzso promoter or zzso with the zzso zzso
