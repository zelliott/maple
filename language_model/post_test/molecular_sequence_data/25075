Two zzso full-length zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso in the zzso Norway spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso segregation analysis confirmed that the two zzso belong to the same DNA gene zzso Southern analysis was performed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso A small gene family was discovered when zzso zzso were zzso The isolated gene locus was termed zzso and found to exhibit the largest zzso zzso sequence zzso so far in the plant zzso This is due to comparatively long zzso zzso and to an additional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two full-length zzso zzso is zzso From zzso variation, one single exchange of an zzso acid was zzso The zzso zzso zzso regions that were zzso for zzso among three different spruce zzso zzso zzso revealed that all three individuals could be zzso distinguished from each zzso The results are discussed with respect not only to zzso site evolution among zzso but also to particular zzso features of a zzso zzso in comparison to zzso in zzso
