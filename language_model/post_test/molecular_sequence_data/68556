The zzso sequences of the zzso gene from five Danish human zzso zzso zzso representing all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and group zzso and from the American type strain zzso were determined and compared with the published zzso sequence from the German zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso Fuchs, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was present in all zzso regardless of the presence or absence of its product, zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso from the seven zzso were aligned and revealed zzso sequence identities ranging from zzso to zzso zzso were scattered throughout the zzso acid zzso A zzso tree was constructed and revealed three distinct zzso groups zzso to zzso corresponding to the three delineated zzso zzso analysis revealed that the seven zzso proteins tested have both common and specific zzso There is significant zzso diversity, since even zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso utilizing zzso as a test zzso should include all three zzso zzso in order to obtain a zzso zzso
