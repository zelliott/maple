The principal protein component of the elastic fiber found in elastic zzso is zzso an zzso zzso zzso that is assembled from a high molecular weight zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso have been considered separate and independent, such that changes to one region are not thought to affect the zzso However, results from these solid-state zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso in protein folding exists between the two domain zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso has three zzso sequences from zzso 20 and 24 of the soluble zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso constructed from zzso 21 and zzso In the middle of each zzso domain is a zzso zzso When this zzso is replaced with zzso as in zzso its properties are zzso In addition to the expected increase in zzso content and the resulting increase in rigidity of the zzso zzso changes to the organization of the zzso regions are also zzso Using one-dimensional zzso zzso with magic angle zzso techniques, including spectral editing and relaxation zzso evidence for a change in dynamics to both domain types is zzso Furthermore, it is likely that the zzso groups of the zzso of the zzso zzso are also affected by the substitution to the hinge region of the zzso zzso This zzso between the two domain types brings new questions to the phenomenon of zzso in zzso zzso and strongly suggests that functional models for the protein must include a role for the zzso zzso
