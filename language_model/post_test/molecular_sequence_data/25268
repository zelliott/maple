The zzso zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been identified and cloned in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso sequence and zzso analysis showed that these genes are organized into a zzso zzso with the gene order zzso the latter two genes zzso zzso and a zzso protein with an unknown function, zzso The zzso is immediately followed by an IS element that is zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and determination of its zzso sequence demonstrated that the zzso gene starts with a zzso zzso and encodes a 105 zzso acid protein (Mr zzso zzso zzso studies with the zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso is active as a zzso A zzso zzso gene was identified in strain zzso and appeared to zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene could be expressed under control of zzso promoter sequences resulting in overproduction of zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acids (Mr zzso zzso and shows the characteristics of a zzso integral membrane zzso The deduced primary structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso In contrast, the organization of the zzso genes differs significantly between those zzso zzso zzso zzso in specific zzso was observed between the derived zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and that of zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso which suggest a common function in the transport and zzso of these structurally related zzso
