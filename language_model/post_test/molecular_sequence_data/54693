The requirement of zzso organisms to control damage caused by zzso oxygen species has led to the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso are a large family of zzso which zzso hydrogen zzso at the expense of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso a zzso protein and zzso a zzso zzso Although both zzso contain the zzso zzso motifs zzso and zzso identified as critical for hydrogen zzso instability, both were stable to high zzso of hydrogen zzso demonstrating different functions to their zzso zzso zzso zzso also contains two zzso zzso and five different zzso zzso The activity of both zzso was specific for the zzso system; however, both could also be zzso by the zzso system when coupled to the zzso specific zzso zzso Analysis of zzso genes in zzso zzso showed that only zzso which is zzso was sensitive to the external zzso hydrogen zzso However, both zzso zzso zzso zzso were sensitive to zzso free zzso and both zzso protected DNA from free radical zzso The results demonstrate that the hydrogen zzso zzso and the zzso activity of the zzso are separate activities that are independent of the zzso and zzso zzso
