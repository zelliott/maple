The authors describe a method in which the population frequency of zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently detected and their zzso zzso accurately zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were used to demonstrate the zzso Blood from zzso individuals was zzso DNA was zzso and target sequences were zzso amplified and analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso were separated into zzso based on melting properties of the double DNA zzso zzso of the different zzso were determined by calculating the area under the zzso zzso zzso and zzso equilibrium estimated from the pooled data were verified by analyzing zzso of the samples randomly selected from the blood donor zzso The method zzso is equally suitable for zzso and/or zzso analysis of zzso in which sample treatment is kept to a zzso The potential zzso of the method is beyond zzso numbers of zzso
