The zzso S zzso zzso is a recently zzso member of the G zzso zzso zzso zzso and is activated by the zzso S zzso zzso and zzso are widely expressed in central nervous system and are known to have crucial roles in asthma zzso locomotor activity, zzso anxiety and food zzso The zzso system was previously thought to have first evolved in the zzso Here we examine the origin and the molecular evolution of the zzso using zzso comparative analyses and document the molecular basis of divergence of the zzso from its closest zzso zzso In this study, zzso sequences have been identified in a zzso and a zzso suggesting an earlier emergence of a zzso sequence in the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso is most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the group of zzso zzso Gene structure features were zzso with the zzso zzso and supported the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso A zzso analysis between the zzso zzso and the well studied zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed several putative zzso acid sites that may account for the observed functional divergence between zzso The data can facilitate experimental studies aiming at deciphering the common features as well as those related to zzso binding and signal zzso processes specific to the zzso
