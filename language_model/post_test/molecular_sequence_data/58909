The zzso of the zzso zzso is considered problematic both at the zzso and zzso zzso Such a difficulty arises from the highly homogeneous zzso displayed by this group of fish and, consequently, from the paucity of the key zzso characters suitable to address their zzso and zzso In the present work, we have approached the zzso and evolutionary relationships of seven species of zzso six of which from the Mediterranean Sea, on the basis of the DNA sequences of two zzso genes zzso b and zzso zzso Despite the zzso zzso exhibited by the zzso considered, the two species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a remarkable genetic divergence compared to all the other members of the zzso The relative rate test revealed a significantly higher rate of evolution along the zzso zzso
