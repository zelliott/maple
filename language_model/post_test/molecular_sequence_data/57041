zzso zzso carries a highly zzso set of genes which zzso a set of zzso zzso Although it is likely that these zzso affect the zzso in favor of the zzso we do not understand the molecular basis of this zzso We zzso recent evidence that defines two types of interaction between the bacterial toxin and host cellular receptors that may zzso the host immune response to zzso zzso An interaction between the toxin and class II products on zzso can result in zzso of zzso activity and thus impair zzso expansion of T cells specific for bacterial zzso Studies using zzso II zzso suggest that this may reflect transmission of a negative signal to zzso after zzso of class II zzso A second interaction between a subset of zzso including zzso with zzso products stimulates both zzso proliferation as well as zzso zzso T cells zzso We put forward the hypothesis that this interaction reflects binding of a zzso zzso of SEC to zzso expressed by activated target zzso We suggest that this interaction may serve to inhibit the host response by zzso of zzso zzso to sites of infection by zzso zzso and by local elimination of zzso memory T zzso
