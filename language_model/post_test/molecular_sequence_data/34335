Previous research has shown that an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso class C zzso zzso is the most abundantly expressed gene in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries after immune stimulation of zzso zzso zzso However, to date, the expression pattern, the zzso activities and the zzso properties of the zzso C zzso have not been zzso In contrast, it is known that zzso C zzso presents an unusual and high level of zzso of unidentified biological zzso zzso to provide a better understanding of the features of this interesting zzso we have investigated its function using four different cloned and expressed zzso of zzso C zzso and zzso zzso C zzso The in zzso results suggest that this zzso mainly present in zzso could be acting as an immune system zzso zzso because its zzso was able to alter the expression of zzso zzso genes (as the zzso peptides zzso B and zzso B, the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso Moreover, the in zzso results indicate that zzso C peptides have zzso and zzso zzso Their zzso expression in a fish cell line zzso protection against two different fish viruses zzso and zzso Cell extracts from zzso C expressing fish cells were also able to attract zzso All together, these results suggest that zzso C should be considered not only as an zzso but also as the first zzso zzso identified in zzso and one of the few examples in all of the zzso
