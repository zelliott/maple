The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso machine essential for zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows involvement in folding and assembly of a small range of proteins linked to essential cellular processes such as zzso assembly and zzso zzso zzso has a classic zzso architecture, with two zzso zzso rings stacked zzso enclosing a folding zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso assists folding is distinct from other zzso with no zzso wall lining a potential zzso cage, and a sequential rather than concerted zzso zzso zzso We have solved the crystal structure of zzso zzso in complex with zzso at zzso zzso resolution, revealing the zzso zzso and the location of discrete patches of zzso zzso zzso that mediate specific interactions between zzso and its zzso The intrinsic asymmetry is revealed by the structural individuality of the zzso zzso which display unique zzso zzso binding properties, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The location of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the outside of the barrel, confirmed by zzso studies, is unique to zzso zzso zzso
