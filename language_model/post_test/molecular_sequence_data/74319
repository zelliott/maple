The stress response in cells involves a rapid and transient zzso zzso of stress zzso It has been shown that zzso limits its own zzso zzso functioning as a zzso of heat shock factor 1 zzso during the zzso of the stress zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso Through this interaction, zzso zzso both zzso and heat zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In cells expressing short hairpin zzso directed against zzso zzso cannot repress zzso zzso A reduction of zzso levels also provoked a significant increase of zzso protein levels and an increase of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Via zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is bound to the zzso gene promoter under zzso conditions and that its binding increases during heat shock zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that zzso is a key regulator of the heat shock stress zzso
