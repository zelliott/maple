zzso acid is the most common naturally occurring zzso acid, as well as being the zzso precursor of this group of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be the key zzso of zzso acid zzso in rat liver, and it is a regulator of cell surface zzso The zzso region of this zzso zzso displays sequence similarities with zzso zzso zzso whereas the sequence of its zzso region is similar to sequences of members of the sugar zzso zzso High level zzso of active zzso was established by using the zzso zzso For functional zzso zzso zzso was performed on different zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a drastic loss of zzso activity with almost unchanged zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the putative zzso active site lost their zzso activity but retained their zzso zzso To estimate the structural zzso effect due to zzso zzso the zzso state of all zzso was determined by gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso were shown to form a zzso like the zzso zzso indicating little influence of zzso on protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed mainly zzso zzso with small amounts of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was also significantly different from that of the zzso zzso Therefore the loss of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can largely be attributed to incorrect protein zzso In contrast, the zzso site of zzso zzso seems to be involved directly in the zzso process, and the zzso acids zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are essential for the zzso zzso The fact that either zzso or zzso activity are lost selectively provides evidence for the existence of two active sites working quite zzso
