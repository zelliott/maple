zzso growth factor binding proteins zzso have various zzso cellular activities, including zzso cellular zzso followed by zzso regulation, although mechanisms of cellular entry remain zzso zzso we focused on their zzso cellular entry mechanism in terms of protein zzso domain zzso activity, which is an emerging technique useful for clinical zzso The peptides of 18 zzso acid zzso derived from zzso and zzso which involve zzso regions, zzso cellular delivery of an zzso protein into zzso and zzso zzso Relative protein delivery activities of zzso peptides were approximately zzso compared to that of the zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of the fusion proteins with zzso and zzso indicating that the delivery zzso is zzso zzso similar to that of zzso The delivery of zzso fused to zzso was zzso by either zzso or zzso synthetic zzso zzso the entry pathways of the three zzso are zzso Our data has shown a new approach for designing protein delivery systems using zzso derived peptides based on the molecular mechanisms of zzso activities of zzso
