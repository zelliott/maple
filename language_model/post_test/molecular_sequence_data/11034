zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene have been invoked as the structural basis for the currents associated with zzso zzso entry zzso in many cell zzso zzso zzso are members of a large protein family that may associate as channel zzso providing an explanation for the functional diversity of zzso channels observed in these zzso However, there is little information as to which of these genes are zzso at the cellular zzso We have examined the tissue specific expression of five zzso zzso genes and determined which are zzso in five different cell zzso The results show zzso and zzso zzso of multiple zzso zzso This implies that the zzso composition of a particular zzso channel may vary depending on the cell zzso
