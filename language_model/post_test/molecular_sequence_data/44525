zzso are potent zzso of cell migration and zzso and therefore play an essential role in early events of zzso In conjunction with cell zzso zzso zzso help to zzso cells to a specific site and enhance the inflammatory reaction at the zzso zzso elevated levels of zzso have been found in a variety of inflammatory zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by variety of cell types including zzso cells in response to a variety of zzso zzso is a major zzso for zzso T zzso and zzso In the present study, we investigated the factors involved in zzso zzso gene expression in human zzso zzso We present evidence that the nuclear factor zzso zzso binding site and the zzso binding site located 90 and 68 base pairs upstream of the zzso start site, respectively, are required for zzso induction of the human zzso promoter by zzso zzso zzso zzso or deletion of the zzso zzso site decreased the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site also decreased the zzso activity of the zzso We show that the zzso zzso site located zzso in the zzso promoter binds to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family in zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in the zzso of the zzso promoter as zzso The data presented in this study suggest that zzso zzso gene expression in human zzso cells depends on the cooperative action of zzso B and zzso
