The fine structure of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso among zzso zzso are found in eight zzso zzso zzso 3 to 6 and 8 to zzso Thus, it is possible that a single zzso zzso zzso could have two functional zzso binding zzso The zzso region of zzso is in coding zzso 16 while the zzso zzso zzso site is in coding zzso zzso For all zzso forms, the transcript must include 17 zzso zzso and 1 alternatively spliced 3' terminal zzso The transcript zzso the soluble zzso zzso includes 14 coding zzso and an alternatively spliced 3' terminal zzso We have identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso for which there are no intervening sequences between the two final zzso This unusual juxtaposition of zzso requires that zzso donor sites at the zzso end of the respective terminal zzso be ignored in the production of these zzso zzso We suggest that zzso site suppression is responsible for the formation of two of the alternatively spliced forms of the mouse zzso zzso The juxtaposition of two coding zzso separated by a consensus zzso donor sequence is the structural zzso for this mode of alternative zzso We present evidence that the zzso form is expressed in human zzso while the Re form, the soluble zzso is not zzso
