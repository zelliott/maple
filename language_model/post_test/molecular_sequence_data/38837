The human pathogens of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and other key zzso pathways in unique zzso zzso called zzso zzso related to the zzso of zzso and zzso The molecular machinery that carries out the specific targeting of zzso proteins to the zzso has not been zzso although the bulk of zzso proteins contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso similar to the zzso and zzso zzso targeting zzso To characterize the mechanisms of zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso designated zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso Like its zzso in zzso and humans, zzso predicts a protein with seven copies of a zzso repeat in its zzso half proposed to mediate zzso binding and three copies of a zzso motif in its zzso zzso zzso to be essential for protein zzso into the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso for binding experiments and generation of zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso zzso a zzso containing zzso protein with a zzso of zzso zzso but did not bind an zzso in which the zzso had been zzso Moreover, binding studies with the zzso half of the zzso confirmed that this portion of the zzso protein was capable of binding the zzso zzso with an affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was predominantly in the zzso zzso and genetic analysis implied that zzso was an essential zzso
