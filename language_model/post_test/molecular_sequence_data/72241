The sequence of the zzso zzso gene has been widely used to estimate zzso relationships at different zzso levels across zzso We investigated the molecular evolution of the zzso gene and its usefulness for reconstructing zzso relationships within and among four zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene showed the lowest A + T content of all insects so far zzso confirming that the well-known A + T bias in insect zzso genes tends to increase from the zzso to zzso zzso zzso percent of all zzso positions were variable and most of the third zzso positions appeared free to zzso zzso of genetic distance between zzso species and between families were remarkably high; in some cases the latter were higher than divergence values between other orders of zzso The remarkably high divergence levels observed here provide evidence that zzso zzso are quite old; divergence levels among zzso families equaled or exceeded zzso among zzso insect zzso Once the saturated zzso positions (which violated zzso of base zzso were removed, the zzso sequences contained zzso information, but the extent of that information was overestimated by zzso methods relative to likelihood zzso In the zzso analysis, consistent statistical support was obtained for the zzso of all four zzso zzso but relationships among zzso were not well zzso Within the zzso zzso relationships were well resolved and agreed with zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso although three pairs of populations were consistently identified, these appeared to have arisen in a burst of evolution from an earlier zzso zzso zzso always appeared as zzso and zzso zzso appeared to harbor a cryptic species, corroborating zzso zzso
