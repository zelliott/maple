zzso zzso in the zzso zzso sensitive zzso and zzso zzso resistant zzso rats are known to strongly zzso with blood zzso The purpose of this work was to look for structural differences in the S and R zzso zzso that could account for the zzso zzso The zzso sequences determined for the coding region and the zzso regulatory region for the zzso gene of S and R rats were zzso There were some minor zzso changes in selected regions of the 1st and 8th zzso that were zzso but these were unlikely to be of functional zzso The remaining possible reasons for the zzso of blood pressure with zzso zzso in zzso rats are differences in zzso regulatory elements out of the immediate zzso area, or differences in zzso at an unknown closely linked zzso
