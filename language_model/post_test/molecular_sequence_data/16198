A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso domain were constructed, and the ability of the zzso to induce focal transformation of zzso zzso cells was zzso The zzso which spanned zzso 32 to 40, were made by a zzso zzso technique that involved replacing this portion of the zzso zzso domain with a zzso carrying two zzso sites in opposite zzso Since zzso zzso outside its recognition zzso zzso zzso of the zzso completely removed the zzso creating a zzso gap whose missing zzso sequences were reconstructed as an zzso zzso Based upon the ability of the zzso to induce focal transformation of zzso zzso cells, a range of zzso from virtually full activity to none zzso zzso was zzso Three classes of zzso were present in this zzso one which could not be altered, even zzso without a loss of function zzso 32 and zzso one which retained zzso zzso activity with conservative changes but which lost function with more drastic zzso zzso 36 and zzso and one which retained function even with a zzso substitution zzso zzso
