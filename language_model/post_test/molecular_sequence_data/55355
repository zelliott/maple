zzso zzso I zzso an zzso found in zzso zzso species and zzso zzso is implicated in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso used to treat zzso The zzso resolution structure of zzso reveals a unique zzso of zzso each containing two zzso zzso zzso The similarities of individual zzso and comparisons with zzso classes suggest that zzso evolved by gene duplication, diversification, and gene zzso a combination of events previously unknown in the zzso protein zzso and potentially explaining the distinctive zzso properties of zzso The zzso activity of zzso implies that zzso itself has regulatory zzso roles in addition to being a precursor for zzso the major low mass zzso present in zzso We propose that zzso of zzso zzso is a legacy of the zzso activity of zzso and involves processing zzso zzso with zzso reduction of the zzso to active zzso zzso
