The zzso zzso interactive protein zzso is a key member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso that plays critical roles in multiple cellular zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso at several zzso zzso including a key zzso zzso zzso zzso in the active site of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso led to loss of both the zzso activity and the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso still kept a substantial degree of zzso zzso We also investigated the effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso in order to understand the molecular zzso of the zzso at zzso Together, we conclude that the zzso of zzso which is located in the active site of zzso regulates but is not obligatory for the zzso activity of zzso Since zzso at this key zzso appears to be zzso zzso amongst all zzso zzso our findings provide an interesting insight into the regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso
