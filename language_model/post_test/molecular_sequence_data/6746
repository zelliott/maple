An zzso zzso influenza virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to react with the solid phase zzso influenza virus expressing zzso zzso molecules but not to bind to virus particles bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso or zzso either the zzso zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were used to characterize the fine specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso infrared zzso showed that, compared to zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso fragments of the intact zzso region, zzso has relatively low zzso but a tendency to adopt zzso in zzso The zzso and zzso properties of multiple zzso peptides zzso containing four copies of zzso were also zzso Based on the appearance of an infrared component band at zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso arms of zzso also contain repeats of zzso However, it is only the zzso construct zzso also the fusion zzso which binds zzso zzso as strongly as zzso zzso This puts emphasis on the role of the fusion region in zzso zzso and consequently the ability of peptides to elicit an zzso zzso The results obtained for zzso zzso also suggests a zzso zzso motif in the recognition by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso
