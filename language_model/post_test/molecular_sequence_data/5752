zzso is a zzso zzso class I gene with a limited tissue zzso The most pronounced expression is detected in the zzso of first zzso zzso It is possible to detect zzso for zzso in zzso zzso where expression is correlated with a high zzso rate of zzso zzso seems to play an important role in the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso locus is not fully zzso One study has shown extensive zzso sequence variation in the zzso 3 zzso zzso in healthy African zzso A few studies in other populations have only revealed a limited zzso We investigated the zzso of the zzso 3 of zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso Strand zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing analysis in a Danish zzso We detected four zzso zzso in zzso 3 compared to the sequence of zzso zzso one of these has not been reported zzso We also found a deletion of the first base of zzso 130 or the third of zzso 129 in a zzso zzso This study, together with previous results, suggests that the zzso of zzso 3 of the zzso gene in Caucasians is zzso in contrast to that observed in Americans originating from zzso zzso of this zzso and the detected deletion in relation to certain disorders of pregnancy are zzso
