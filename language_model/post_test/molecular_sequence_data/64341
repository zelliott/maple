The zzso zzso zzso genes zzso of 67 zzso zzso representing 57 species, five zzso strains and zzso zzso zzso zzso were partially zzso using a pair of zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso % similarity within the same species and zzso % similarity at the zzso level were observed by analysis of the determined zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso tree based on zzso sequences was similar to that of zzso zzso The five zzso strains formed a stable zzso zzso and a sister group to the zzso zzso all zzso zzso Although there were several discrepancies in the details, considerable agreement was found between the results of zzso analysis and those of zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that analysis of zzso can be used as an alternative genetic method in parallel to conventional zzso methods, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso
