The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso various zzso zzso fatty acids including zzso acid and zzso acid, neither of which is produced by higher zzso Here we report the effects of temperature on zzso zzso fatty acid zzso in the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso fatty acids increased significantly as the growth temperature zzso Specifically, the relative content of zzso acid to total fatty acids at 5 zzso was approximately zzso higher than at 25 zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso zzso fatty acids decreased at low zzso An analysis of gene expression indicated that the zzso of the zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso increased significantly at 5 zzso These results indicate that in the zzso the zzso zzso was enhanced at low temperature, mainly via expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to increased zzso of zzso zzso
