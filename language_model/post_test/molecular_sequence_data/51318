The zzso of the zzso envelope protein principal zzso domain, the zzso loop, represents a major problem in the design of vaccines against zzso We have designed a mixed zzso loop zzso termed zzso obtained in a unique zzso and containing around zzso zzso zzso different sequences of 22 to 25 zzso organized around the zzso zzso zzso Free or coupled to a carrier zzso the zzso induced in rabbits broadly specific zzso which recognized different individual zzso loop zzso and the native zzso zzso The zzso approach may allow researchers to focus vaccine strategy against zzso functional zzso of various zzso
