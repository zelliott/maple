zzso zzso zzso such as DNA, zzso and zzso are routinely analyzed using zzso zzso zzso to obtain zzso mass averages, zzso and architectural zzso It has long been contended that zzso zzso can degrade during SEC zzso if true, the inaccurate zzso mass information obtained can adversely affect decisions regarding processing and zzso properties of the zzso However, most evidence to the effect of degradation has been circumstantial and open to alternative zzso For example, the shift in SEC zzso volume as a function of increased zzso flow rate, observed using only a zzso zzso may be the result of degradation or of zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we provide zzso evidence that the zzso zzso actually degrades during SEC zzso The decrease in zzso mass and size of zzso with increasing flow rate, measured using light zzso allows ruling out an SC mode of zzso and can only be interpreted as due to zzso These findings demonstrate the extreme fragility of zzso zzso and the care that must be taken for accurate zzso
