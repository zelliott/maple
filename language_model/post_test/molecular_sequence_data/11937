Point zzso were introduced at random into zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso This region contains the internal zzso entry site zzso The zzso were identified by sequence analysis and the effect on the activity of the zzso was determined using in zzso translation reactions in rabbit zzso zzso zzso defective zzso each contained multiple point zzso These zzso were constructed into a zzso zzso expression zzso and the activities of the zzso zzso elements were determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso transient expression system in zzso The most severely defective of these zzso displayed about zzso of zzso zzso The activities, relative to wild type, of these zzso zzso elements determined using in zzso and in zzso zzso were zzso Two deletion zzso lacking sequences from the zzso zzso to zzso 411 and zzso were also zzso Each of these deletions zzso the zzso in zzso (to less than zzso of zzso zzso zzso within cells of the zzso zzso zzso either alone or linked to another coding zzso enhanced the activity of each of the defective zzso elements except that deleted to zzso zzso The results are consistent with a model in which different regions of the zzso participate in a zzso transfer of an initiation complex to the 3' end of the zzso element for initiation of protein synthesis to zzso
