The expanded gene was first identified by a spontaneous zzso that causes broad zzso We have identified an zzso zzso within expanded and used it to generate additional zzso including one zzso zzso expanded is an essential zzso necessary for proper growth control of zzso discs and, when zzso causes either zzso or zzso depending on the zzso Wing overgrowth in expanded zzso is limited to specific regions along the zzso and zzso zzso expanded encodes a novel zzso zzso acid protein that is localized to the zzso surface of disc cells and contains three potential zzso zzso Together, these observations suggest that the Expanded protein engages in zzso interactions regulating cell proliferation in zzso
