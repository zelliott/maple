zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is a highly contagious viral disease of fresh and saltwater fish zzso zzso caused several large scale fish kills in the Great Lakes area and has been found in 28 different host zzso The emergence of VHS in the Great Lakes began with the isolation of zzso from a diseased zzso zzso zzso caught from Lake zzso Clair in zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso within the family zzso It has a linear zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately 11 zzso with six zzso zzso replicates in the zzso and produces six zzso zzso The gene order of zzso is zzso This study describes molecular characterization of the Great Lakes zzso strain zzso and its zzso relationships with selected European and North American zzso 

The complete zzso sequences of zzso strain was determined from cloned zzso of six overlapping fragments, obtained by zzso amplification of zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso comprises zzso zzso zzso zzso with the gene order of zzso These genes are separated by zzso gene zzso with zzso gene zzso The first 4 zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso are complementary and identical to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis show that the Great Lakes virus is closely related to the Japanese strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among other zzso zzso shares highest sequence zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso tree obtained by comparing 48 zzso gene sequences of different zzso strains demonstrate that the Great Lakes zzso is closely related to the North American and Japanese zzso zzso but forms a distinct zzso zzso which is clearly different from the three European zzso zzso characterization of the Great Lakes isolate will be helpful in studying the zzso of zzso using a reverse zzso approach and developing efficient control zzso
