This study has investigated the zzso of zzso communities zzso to low dissolved oxygen zzso zzso Under controlled laboratory conditions, two sequencing batch zzso seeded with activated sludge from the same source were operated at high DO (near zzso and low DO zzso zzso zzso zzso for a period of 220 zzso The results demonstrated stable and complete zzso at low DO conditions after an zzso period of approximately 140 zzso zzso brought about increased specific oxygen zzso rates and enhanced expression of a particular zzso protein in the soluble fraction of the cells in the low DO reactor as compared to the high DO zzso The induced protein was determined not to be any of the zzso or electron carriers present in the conventional account of zzso zzso in zzso bacteria zzso Further research is required to determine the specific nature of the zzso protein zzso a preliminary assessment suggests either a type of zzso protein or a lesser-known component of the zzso pathways of zzso The effect of DO on zzso dynamics was evaluated using the zzso zzso gene as the basis for zzso comparisons and zzso zzso zzso consumption by zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria was ruled out by fluorescent in zzso zzso in both zzso Even though zzso zzso was the dominant zzso lineage in both high and low DO sequencing batch zzso at the end of operation, this enrichment could not be linked in the low DO reactor to zzso to zzso zzso
