In the guinea zzso cold zzso induced a conversion of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso fat zzso but not in the zzso zzso fat zzso The conversion was associated with an increase in zzso and the appearance of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were decreased in IS cells, unchanged in zzso cells, and increased in zzso cells, suggesting a zzso regulation of zzso at the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso were not zzso regardless of the depot and the zzso environment of the zzso These agents did not inhibit zzso transport and zzso as was previously reported for zzso Cloning and sequencing of the guinea pig beta zzso gene revealed a slightly higher zzso acid sequence similarity with the human than with the zzso beta zzso beta zzso transcripts were present at a very low level in guinea pig zzso and zzso levels did not increase to a significant extent after cold zzso The guinea pig thus differs from zzso by an absence of beta zzso effects and by low beta zzso expression in brown and white zzso zzso
