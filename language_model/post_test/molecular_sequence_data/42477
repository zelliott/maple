The in zzso zzso action of zzso a zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to be zzso capable of delaying significantly the onset of zzso zzso zzso AS but not a zzso zzso zzso CB challenge zzso The zzso to which this zzso binds has been mapped to the second of two zzso growth zzso zzso located at the zzso of the zzso surface protein 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a region of zzso with AS and CB strain zzso showing only zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso The critical zzso acid substitution which accounts for the strain specificity of the zzso zzso zzso has now been zzso zzso chain reaction directed zzso experiments demonstrate that a single zzso to zzso substitution at position zzso in the primary zzso acid sequence is sufficient to convert zzso zzso zzso zzso CB expression zzso into zzso clones whilst the converse substitution of an zzso for a zzso zzso converts zzso zzso zzso AS expression zzso into zzso zzso
