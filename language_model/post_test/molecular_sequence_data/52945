zzso is thought to be a component of the zzso channel in the zzso zzso motor of zzso zzso We have found that some zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso result in a zzso zzso in which swarming and swimming speeds are reduced even in the presence of high zzso of zzso Most of the zzso showed a sodium zzso dependence similar to that of the wild type but with significantly reduced zzso at all sodium zzso zzso By contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso showed a sharp dependence on zzso zzso with a threshold at 38 zzso The motor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as monitored by laser zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso protein is assembled normally into the motor zzso zzso studies of zzso suggest that, although this zzso is not essential for motor zzso a negative charge at this position contributes to optimal speed and/or efficiency of the zzso
