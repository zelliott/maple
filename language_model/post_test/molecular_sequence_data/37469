We presently report the cloning of zzso sequences zzso the novel rat zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso and the zzso human zzso recently designated as zzso Furthermore, the existence of a novel zzso zzso of the zzso zzso previously assigned to an zzso gene cluster in the zzso region zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso are predicted to give rise to proteins of zzso zzso acids which exhibit the typical domain arrangement of ABC full zzso and share zzso identity within the zzso acid zzso A zzso representing an zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned which would result in a truncated protein equivalent to an ABC half zzso Northern zzso analyses revealed expression of zzso or zzso zzso in several zzso but particularly high zzso zzso expression was observed in rat zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression during culture of primary rat zzso suggests that zzso cultures should provide a basis for investigation of zzso gene regulation and zzso of zzso zzso
