The general zzso factor zzso is a highly zzso and essential component of the zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso It consists of a single zzso with two zzso structural zzso an zzso zinc ribbon structure zzso and a zzso core zzso We have analyzed the role of the zzso region of human zzso in zzso in zzso and in zzso We identified a small zzso surface of the zzso that is required for pol II zzso in zzso and for different types of zzso pol II zzso in zzso zzso with a general role in transcription, this zzso surface is directly involved in the recruitment of pol II to a zzso zzso zzso zzso although the zzso human zzso domain can recruit both human pol II and zzso zzso zzso pol II, the zzso zzso zzso region recruits zzso pol II but not human pol zzso Thus, a critical process in zzso from many different zzso II zzso changed in sequence specificity during zzso zzso
