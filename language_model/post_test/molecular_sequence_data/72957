A system for gene disruption and replacement based on a zzso temperate zzso zzso was developed to introduce DNA in the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso This will be useful in attempts to produce, through genetic zzso novel forms of the zzso important zzso drug zzso zzso zzso were constructed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso or zzso resistance gene along with segments of the zzso zzso zzso Each of the cloned segments also contained the zzso zzso resistance gene to enable gene replacement by loss of the zzso zzso zzso deletion of the entire zzso zzso zzso believed to govern zzso zzso resulted in the loss of zzso zzso In contrast, disruption or deletion of a region predicted to zzso four zzso open reading zzso or another region predicted to zzso another zzso plus a zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on the production of zzso or zzso a zzso zzso also produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may have the capacity to produce zzso additional to zzso and zzso
