zzso zzso mice develop zzso intolerance with age, whereas zzso zzso mice do zzso In this study, we examined whether this differential zzso zzso was associated with differences of zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso showed comparable levels of zzso plasma insulin between the two strains but a significantly lower zzso level in B6 zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso in isolated pancreatic zzso revealed that zzso was less efficiently processed in B6 zzso Because zzso zzso zzso and its zzso helper protein are required for this processing, we zzso zzso zzso levels by zzso and protein levels by zzso The levels of zzso zzso were similar between the two zzso but B6 protein extracts contained less of the mature zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and protein levels were both significantly lower in B6 zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter and zzso in the two strains revealed seven single zzso zzso and one zzso zzso in the zzso as well as a single zzso zzso and two zzso in the zzso zzso expression of zzso may contribute to the difference between B6 and zzso mice not only in zzso production and zzso but also in zzso zzso
