Two zzso clones are zzso which were isolated from human zzso expression library using zzso zzso screening with zzso zzso DNA in the presence of zzso excess of unbalanced zzso zzso In one of the zzso clones zzso an open reading frame zzso is zzso zzso protein with a new potential zzso zzso domain, and zzso activity of the protein is directly confirmed after its expression (as zzso zzso in zzso zzso The other zzso clone zzso is partially zzso to zzso sequences present in zzso zzso zzso and cloned from very different human zzso zzso of these 15 overlapping zzso sequences resulted in a longer sequence covering zzso and having zzso potentially zzso a new 10 zzso zzso without any apparent zzso zzso This connected sequence as well as zzso sequence having only 65 zzso acids zzso are unrecognizable by computer software as the zzso regions, and we suppose that zzso transcripts possess zzso zzso zzso blocks in zzso longer than 12 zzso are known to bind mirror duplex DNA sequences to form zzso whose stability is comparable to that of zzso complexes, and human promoters contain many such zzso
