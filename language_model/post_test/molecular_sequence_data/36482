zzso structures of zzso segment A zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the mixture of zzso zzso zzso M zzso or in zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso in zzso zzso of zzso A were assigned using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exchange rates for zzso zzso were measured in series of zzso zzso 324 and 400 zzso zzso volumes were measured in zzso zzso of zzso in mixture of organic zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure was determined by local structure analysis, distance geometry calculation with program zzso and systematic search for energetically allowed side chain zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso The structures of zzso are similar in both zzso These structures have the right-handed zzso region from zzso to zzso with root mean square zzso zzso of zzso A between back bone heavy atoms and fit well with zzso to zzso zzso region in electron zzso zzso model of zzso zzso The zzso region zzso is zzso in both zzso while zzso region zzso in organic zzso has a fixed structure zzso of zzso zzso stabilized by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso C zzso hydrogen zzso This region of zzso in zzso zzso has zzso structure with zzso of zzso A for back bone heavy zzso zzso angles zzso 1 of zzso were unequivocally determined for zzso of side chains in the zzso region and are identical in both zzso
