zzso DNA clones zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein have been isolated from human small zzso and muscle zzso zzso This zzso acid protein has zzso zzso and zzso identity with the previously described human zzso liver, and fetal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that transcripts zzso this protein are very abundant in adult human skeletal muscle and subcutaneous zzso The adult skeletal muscle zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso by zzso zzso and zzso translation of the synthetic zzso The in zzso protein reacted with a zzso zzso zzso which recognizes the zzso zzso zzso expressed in rat skeletal muscle, heart, and zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso and fetal muscle zzso zzso did not react with zzso The high levels in adult skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat of zzso zzso the adult skeletal muscle zzso zzso and its specific zzso with zzso zzso zzso suggest that this protein is the major zzso zzso zzso expressed in skeletal muscle and other zzso zzso
