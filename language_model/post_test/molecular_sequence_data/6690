We have isolated overlapping zzso zzso the zzso zzso region of mouse alpha zzso collagen and shown that three different zzso of alpha zzso collagen zzso Each of the three zzso shows characteristic zzso expression zzso zzso studies show positive zzso for alpha zzso collagen along the basement membrane zones of vessels in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso skin, liver, and zzso Thus, we conclude that alpha zzso collagen may interact zzso or zzso with components in basement membrane zones or on the zzso surface of zzso zzso
