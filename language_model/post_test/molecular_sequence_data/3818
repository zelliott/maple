On the basis of the recently determined zzso sequence of zzso zzso we performed a global analysis of the zzso zzso Only proteins displaying a signal zzso were taken into zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso including the previously known zzso gene family, were zzso Several genes zzso proteins that, like zzso and Ami, possess zzso zzso that attach them to zzso acids were also zzso Additionally, the completed zzso sequence revealed genes zzso proteins potentially anchored in the cell membrane by a zzso tail as well as genes zzso zzso proteins and zzso We describe these families and discuss their putative implications for zzso zzso
