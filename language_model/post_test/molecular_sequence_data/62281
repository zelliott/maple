A zzso sequence zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso was isolated from zzso zzso using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso analysis indicated that this zzso sequence had an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids of 52 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high similarity to those of zzso zzso acid zzso which comprised the characteristics of zzso zzso including three zzso zzso motifs and zzso zzso A zzso zzso domain was observed at the zzso To zzso the function of this novel putative zzso the coding sequence was expressed zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso The result demonstrated that the coding product of the sequence exhibited zzso acid zzso activity by the zzso of zzso zzso
