zzso from shrimp is the major zzso zzso food zzso Earlier studies have led to the zzso and zzso characterization of the major zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso proteins are known to be specifically targeted to scavenger receptors on zzso Since zzso processed and presented by zzso are known to elicit zzso type of responses and allergic responses are characterized by polarization towards zzso zzso the possibility of zzso of zzso immune responses by targeting of zzso to zzso via scavenger zzso was zzso 

The zzso and zzso binding potential of the native zzso form of zzso was carried out by zzso and zzso The ability of the native and zzso form of zzso to induce in zzso proliferation of zzso from zzso mice zzso with both forms of zzso was zzso The in zzso production of zzso and zzso by zzso from mice zzso with the two forms of zzso was determined from culture zzso The in zzso production of serum zzso and zzso zzso following zzso with native and modified zzso was monitored by zzso 

The zzso form of zzso was found to have reduced zzso and zzso as compared to its native zzso The modified zzso was, however, found to elicit a cellular response similar to native zzso in zzso Analysis of the zzso profiles showed a zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso that could also be correlated to a zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest the possible potential for modulating allergic responses in zzso by selective targeting to zzso
