A potentially powerful approach for in zzso gene delivery is to target zzso to specific cells through interactions between cell surface receptors and appropriately modified viral envelope zzso Previously, relatively large zzso zzso protein zzso to cell surface receptors have been inserted at or near the N zzso of zzso envelope zzso Although viral zzso could be altered, the zzso envelope proteins lacked full activity, and zzso of zzso envelope was required for production of zzso zzso Here we analyze more than 40 derivatives of zzso zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso containing insertions of short zzso zzso which are zzso for zzso zzso In many cases zzso viruses containing only the zzso envelope protein could zzso human zzso The precise location, size, and zzso sequences of the zzso affected zzso specificity and zzso We conclude that zzso zzso can be rationally zzso by zzso of short zzso zzso and without the need to zzso zzso zzso
