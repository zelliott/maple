A novel zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso enrichment culture that was originally obtained from zzso sludge in a zzso zzso zzso sludge blanket zzso reactor used to treat a beer zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso straight zzso zzso zzso long by zzso zzso wide; cells were sometimes up to 7 zzso zzso zzso cell division was observed in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso were also observed in zzso to zzso phase zzso Growth was observed between 10 and 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso and pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The strain zzso zzso and hydrogen for growth and methane zzso Based on comparative sequence analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the alpha zzso of zzso M zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was affiliated with group zzso within the order zzso The closest relative based on both zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso deduced zzso zzso acid sequence zzso The percentage of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity indicates that strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso represent different species within the same zzso This is supported by our findings of shared zzso properties, including cell zzso and growth temperature range, and zzso differences in zzso usage and pH zzso Based on these genetic and zzso properties, we propose that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
