Upon screening for zzso in the human zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso we discovered a novel zzso in the zzso beta signal zzso with functional consequences for signal zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells zzso This zzso point zzso in zzso 2 of the zzso beta zzso detected in zzso form in several normal DNA samples, caused an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells and zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells were assessed by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso as zzso Whereas both zzso forms zzso zzso production and zzso in similar fashion, zzso was more potent in stimulating zzso and zzso was more potent in stimulating zzso zzso Both zzso forms bound to zzso receptors with similar zzso No evidence was found for influence of the signal zzso zzso on efficacy of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso beta protein also revealed that the zzso did not interfere with signal zzso zzso In zzso the present findings indicate that the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso signal zzso has functional consequences, in the form of zzso of zzso potency for different signal zzso pathways in zzso
