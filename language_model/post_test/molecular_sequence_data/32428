Although recent findings suggest that the zzso genes zzso control zzso S specificity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso system, how these genes operate in the system is unknown, and functional variation of zzso S genes in different species has been zzso Here, we analyzed the S locus of two species of zzso apple zzso zzso and Japanese pear zzso zzso The sequencing of a zzso region of the apple zzso zzso revealed two similar zzso zzso zzso sequences were isolated from different zzso of apple and Japanese zzso and they were found to be zzso genes derived from the S zzso Since each S zzso contains two or three related zzso the genes were named zzso for S locus zzso zzso The zzso genes are specifically expressed in zzso and variable regions of the zzso genes are under positive zzso In a zzso zzso S zzso of Japanese zzso the zzso genes are zzso Apart from their zzso zzso genes meet the expected characteristics of zzso zzso The unique zzso of zzso genes as the zzso S candidate is discussed in the context of zzso variation in the zzso zzso zzso
