zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso found in a variety of zzso including the zzso At present, three species have been reported in members of the weasel family, but the presence of weasel zzso in Japan have been quite zzso The identification of zzso species has been performed based on zzso zzso host species, and habitat in the host, but sometimes discriminating among zzso similar species under light zzso is zzso The present study detected for the first time the weasel zzso zzso zzso in a ferret in zzso Since molecular information for zzso zzso has been quite zzso this species was compared zzso with other zzso species, and also the usefulness of sequencing analysis of the small zzso zzso zzso acid gene zzso for discriminating among zzso species was zzso About the zzso sequence of zzso of all species including zzso zzso compared differed from each other, and its differences found in zzso species were also reflected in the zzso constructed using the partial zzso zzso The sequencing analysis of partial zzso examined in the present study thus appears useful for discriminating among zzso similar zzso zzso
