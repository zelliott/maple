zzso zzso function promotes cell zzso and this is consistent with observations of zzso zzso in many human zzso However, the mechanisms underlying elevated zzso expression are still zzso Here we show that the zzso protein zzso zzso but not zzso directly controls zzso stability by a mechanism that involves degradation by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show further that zzso zzso zzso at zzso 72, which is required to disrupt the interaction between zzso and zzso In addition, we show that zzso 72 is localized within a putative nuclear zzso sequence and that zzso of zzso 72 by zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso This finding expands our knowledge of how specific zzso zzso zzso influence zzso governed by zzso complexes, and provides evidence that elevated zzso activity and zzso zzso expression may be zzso for cancer zzso
