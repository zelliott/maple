Two bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from municipal urban waste zzso and characterized by a zzso zzso Both zzso were zzso zzso rods that were zzso zzso and zzso and able to grow at zzso and pH zzso with optimum growth at zzso and pH zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the major respiratory zzso was zzso zzso the cell wall zzso was of type zzso and the DNA zzso content was 49 zzso These zzso as well as data from zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, showed that these strains were affiliated with the zzso zzso the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were among their closest zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso Nevertheless, the hypothesis that strains zzso and zzso could represent a novel species was supported by the low zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values shared with other members of the zzso zzso and by the observation of distinct zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity and showed almost identical zzso mass zzso but could be distinguished at the zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso between strains zzso and zzso resulted in values above zzso indicating that both organisms represent a single species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
