In the history of science, provocative but, at times, controversial ideas have been put forward to explain basic problems that confront and intrigue the scientific zzso These zzso although often not correct in every detail, lead to increased discussion that ultimately guides experimental tests of the principal concepts and produce valuable insights into long-standing zzso Here, we present a hypothesis, the zzso zzso zzso zzso our ideas will evoke critical discussion and new experimental approaches that bear on general topics, such as nuclear architecture, zzso memory, and zzso zzso Our hypothesis rests on the central concept that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although remarkably similar in zzso acid zzso exhibit distinct zzso zzso that create different zzso zzso or territories, which, in turn, influence zzso states during cellular differentiation and zzso Although we restrict our comments to zzso zzso in zzso we expect that the more general concepts presented here will apply to other zzso zzso families in organisms that employ zzso
