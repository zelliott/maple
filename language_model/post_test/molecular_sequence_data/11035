zzso zzso of the two heat zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso were mapped within the conservative zzso element and proved to be identical irrespective of the temperature zzso Finding of an zzso zzso for a potential zzso binding zzso zzso further suggests that both zzso are regulated in a zzso zzso In contrast to the expectations, the zzso twins are zzso expressed under zzso transition during heat zzso Not the light per se, but rather the zzso electron transport appears to be accountable for the regulatory zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that multiple zzso play different zzso roles under stress zzso
