zzso active zzso therapy zzso can reduce human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso to clinically zzso zzso Despite this dramatic reduction, some virus is present in the zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso for zzso exists in resting memory zzso T zzso This zzso is believed to be a source of the residual zzso and is the focus of zzso zzso Here, we use two measures of population zzso of molecular zzso and the zzso zzso demonstrate that the residual zzso is genetically distinct from zzso in resting zzso T cells but that zzso in resting and activated zzso T cells belong to a single zzso zzso zzso is genetically distinct from zzso in activated zzso T cells, zzso and zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso The finding that some of the residual zzso in patients on zzso stems from an unidentified cellular source other than zzso T cells has implications for zzso zzso
