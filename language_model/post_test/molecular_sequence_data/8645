A full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned using library screening and anchored zzso chain zzso The deduced protein sequence contained zzso zzso acids and was zzso identical to rabbit zzso and zzso identical to rat zzso Two potential sites of zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and seven potential sites of zzso by protein zzso C, which were previously identified in the rabbit and rat zzso were zzso zzso in the zzso The expression of zzso in the mouse was examined with Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was kidney specific in both adult and embryonic zzso In the developing zzso zzso was induced at zzso days post coitus and was expressed in zzso limbs of immature zzso of zzso but was absent from the zzso zzso zzso bodies, and earlier zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso of zzso that differed in the sequence of a zzso segment were identified in the zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the zzso exhibited different patterns of expression in the mature thick ascending limb of the loop of zzso as zzso zzso F was most highly expressed in the inner stripe of outer zzso zzso A was most highly expressed in the outer stripe of the outer zzso and zzso B was most highly expressed in the cortical thick ascending zzso To verify that the zzso were generated by alternative zzso of mutually exclusive cassette zzso zzso clones zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were identified that corresponded to each of the three zzso and were flanked by consensus zzso donor and zzso zzso
