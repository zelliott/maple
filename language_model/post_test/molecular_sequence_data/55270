The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of positively charged zzso acid zzso for the zzso virus zzso N protein zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso protein alignments and zzso predictions of zzso N zzso 14 positively charged zzso were chosen as targets for the zzso The impact of zzso to the N protein functionality was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Seven of the zzso affected the functional competence in all three zzso while others had milder impact or no impact at zzso In the zzso of zzso N zzso five of the affected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were located either within or in close proximity to the central cavity that could potentially bind zzso
