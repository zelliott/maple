zzso and zzso patients with zzso were studied for zzso to the peptides from zzso and zzso zzso zzso which share a zzso zzso zzso Of 60 male Norwegian zzso zzso zzso patients zzso showed positive zzso zzso for zzso zzso compared with zzso of Norwegian male controls zzso less than zzso This difference was not observed among patients and controls from New zzso All patients with zzso zzso were zzso zzso to zzso zzso was present in zzso of normal female controls with at least one previous zzso No female control without previous pregnancy showed positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was neither significantly elevated in AS nor correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso migration zzso by these peptides was not observed in AS or normal zzso The possible influence of zzso zzso rather than sequence zzso in potentially zzso zzso shared by bacterial zzso and human Class I molecules requires further zzso
