A zzso and zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso water of a zzso zzso zone of the central Baltic zzso The slightly curved zzso or zzso cells were zzso by one polar zzso or two bipolar zzso Growth was zzso with nitrate or zzso as electron zzso and either a variety of sulfur species of different zzso states or hydrogen as electron zzso Although the zzso was able to zzso organic substances such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso extract for growth, these compounds yielded considerably lower cell numbers than obtained with reduced sulfur or zzso in addition, zzso supplementation was zzso The cells also had an absolute requirement for zzso zzso growth occurred at 15 zzso and at pH zzso The zzso fatty acid of this zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso present in smaller zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso As determined in zzso zzso gene sequence zzso analysis, the isolate belongs to the zzso zzso within the class zzso with zzso to zzso similarity to the other species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the distinct zzso and zzso differences from these previously described zzso support the description of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results also justify an zzso description of the zzso zzso
