A zzso human zzso with a predicted zzso acid sequence zzso to a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by searching the expressed zzso data zzso Northern zzso analysis was performed using this zzso zzso as a probe, which demonstrated ubiquitous expression of messages of zzso and zzso zzso in a number of human zzso and in several human cancer cell zzso Since the human zzso zzso cell line had the highest level of zzso it was used to isolate a full-length zzso zzso The full-length zzso was found to contain an open reading frame that predicted a type II zzso protein composed of zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso in a zzso expression zzso was expressed in zzso insect cells, and cell extracts were then incubated together with zzso zzso and potential zzso zzso This demonstrated substantial zzso activity with zzso zzso a small degree of activity with zzso zzso but no zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso products of zzso ABC, zzso zzso and zzso B zzso treatment demonstrated that the zzso only transferred zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso which were zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but some lesser transfer to zzso zzso of zzso zzso
