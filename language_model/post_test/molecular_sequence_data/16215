DNA zzso are found to recognize a DNA zzso as a high affinity zzso zzso This zzso binding is observed when one strand of a DNA double zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso Our zzso for binding controls for the effects of sequence with a series of zzso duplexes which are identical except for the location of the zzso an extra zzso zzso of the series of zzso by the zzso complex of zzso zzso indicates that zzso binds at the zzso stable zzso site, suggesting that zzso zzso into zzso The zzso of zzso zzso sites over three zzso is consistent with zzso via a zzso zzso The location of the zzso sites, directly on the 3' side of the zzso is consistent with minor groove binding in B zzso
