zzso physical information that describes where zzso factors, zzso modified zzso zzso zzso II and other key proteins interact with the zzso provides an invaluable zzso foundation for understanding complex programs of gene zzso We present a method, joint binding zzso zzso which uses additional easily zzso experimental data about zzso zzso zzso to improve the spatial resolution of the zzso factor binding locations zzso from zzso followed by DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on this zzso model of binding data, we further pursue improved spatial resolution by using sequence zzso We produce zzso zzso that link zzso data to sequence data by guiding motif discovery to zzso zzso binding zzso We present results on the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso to demonstrate zzso spatial resolution capabilities and show that zzso zzso allow zzso discovery of the zzso motif when a standard approach zzso
