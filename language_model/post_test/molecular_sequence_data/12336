zzso of zzso zzso by Q beta zzso can be used to detect a wide range of zzso with a potential sensitivity of a single zzso A system has been developed in which Q beta amplification of zzso zzso is measured in real time by zzso This was accomplished by including a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso in the reactions and monitoring the zzso change using a custom zzso The time at which zzso is zzso above background is referred to as the zzso zzso and is calculated using zzso zzso A response time is zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso of the number of template zzso molecules which initiated the zzso zzso this system permits an unknown amount of input zzso probe to be zzso through 11 orders of magnitude when compared to a standard zzso Under the described conditions with zzso zzso the response time occurs when about 3 zzso zzso zzso molecules are zzso and occurs within the exponential phase of the reaction, before the number of active zzso molecules are saturated with zzso zzso This system has been used to determine the replication properties of zzso zzso reporter molecules bearing specific probe sequences and to develop zzso zzso for the clinical diagnostic zzso
