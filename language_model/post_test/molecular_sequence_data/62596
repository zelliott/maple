Open reading frame 1 of zzso mosaic virus zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso responsible for the formation of the zzso cap structure and replication of the viral zzso zzso The zzso domain of the viral zzso functions as an zzso capping zzso which exhibits both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso each of the four zzso zzso acids among the capping zzso of members within zzso zzso and a dozen of other zzso to gain insight into the zzso relationship of the viral zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and subsequently zzso zzso the zzso zzso bearing a substitution at the zzso zzso zzso has an approximately zzso increase in zzso zzso activity but completely loses the ability to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso analysis confirmed the production of zzso by the zzso zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, the produced zzso sustained the formation of the zzso intermediate for the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that the previously observed zzso zzso of the zzso using zzso results from reactions of zzso zzso and subsequently zzso of the zzso using zzso zzso occurred at the other three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso resulted in abolition of activities for both zzso zzso and formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acids such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased both activities by various degrees, and the zzso of zzso effects follow similar zzso The affinity to zzso of the various zzso capping zzso except zzso was found in good correlations with not only the magnitude of zzso zzso activity but also the capability of forming the zzso zzso Taken together with the zzso dependence of zzso of the zzso using zzso a basic working zzso with the contents of critical roles played by the binding of zzso of the zzso capping zzso is proposed and zzso
