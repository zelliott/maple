zzso are a powerful tool for zzso studies of zzso zzso However, classic zzso frequently elicits zzso responses against zzso of minor functional zzso zzso strategies to generate zzso against defined zzso would be of significant interest in zzso zzso In this study, we report a new strategy using a combination of DNA vaccination and V gene zzso display that allows the rapid generation of domain specific zzso zzso zzso zzso This system was validated using the zzso of zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso which is expressed on many cell types, is the dominant collagen attachment zzso on zzso functioning in close interplay with the collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso A novel set of zzso specific zzso was obtained by a DNA zzso gene repertoire cloning zzso Mice were first zzso with a DNA vaccine in which the zzso zzso is expressed as a fusion protein with zzso C of zzso zzso zzso Then the heavy and zzso light chain variable gene zzso were rescued from immune zzso using zzso zzso zzso A total of four zzso zzso specific zzso were isolated by selection on zzso zzso or native zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso indicated that they zzso distinct zzso that had profound differences in accessibility between native and zzso zzso Our data suggest DNA zzso and zzso display represent versatile alternatives to protein zzso and zzso techniques for the isolation of zzso zzso zzso This approach will be particularly useful for the generation of domain or zzso specific zzso that zzso native zzso
