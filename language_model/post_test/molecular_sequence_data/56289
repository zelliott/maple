Mice zzso with zzso zzso bone zzso are considered a model system for human chronic zzso zzso a zzso that arises in zzso stem zzso These animals develop multiple types of zzso tumors, which could arise either from zzso cells that mature during tumor development or from zzso committed to different zzso To examine the zzso target cells present in the zzso of mice treated with zzso we used a zzso in zzso zzso These experiments revealed that both the zzso and zzso zzso proteins and the related zzso protein induce zzso and zzso zzso colony types that mimic two of the prominent types of tumors found in the zzso zzso The zzso colonies were similar to zzso colonies found following infection of normal bone zzso with respect to differentiation state and zzso The cells in the zzso colonies were differentiated and zzso zzso cell sorting revealed that most of the zzso and zzso colonies arose from distinct precursors and that the zzso colonies arose from zzso zzso These data suggest that most of the zzso observed in the zzso model arise from committed zzso that are distinct from those involved in the zzso zzso
