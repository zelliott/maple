zzso toxin has a zzso site in the zzso loop region of the zzso zzso of this site by zzso is essential for rapid intoxication of cells by zzso zzso We have here investigated whether in addition to the zzso zzso there are other structural requirements in the zzso loop region for zzso zzso A toxin zzso zzso zzso still containing the consensus motif for zzso by zzso but lacking ten zzso acids in the zzso loop, was zzso zzso was able to cleave zzso toxin in zzso demonstrating that the zzso region is zzso However, zzso toxin was not efficiently zzso by zzso either in zzso or in zzso Furthermore, unless it was zzso with zzso zzso toxin was much less toxic than wild type zzso toxin in zzso cells expressing functional zzso In contrast, zzso cells lacking functional zzso were unable to activate both wild type zzso toxin and zzso zzso In conclusion, an extended loop structure is required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
