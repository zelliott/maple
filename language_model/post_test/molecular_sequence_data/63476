A key component in zzso sequence analysis is the identification of regions of the zzso that contain regulatory zzso In higher zzso this information is organized into modular units called zzso zzso Each module contains multiple binding sites for a specific combination of several zzso zzso In this article, we propose a hidden zzso model zzso to identify zzso factor binding sites zzso and zzso zzso zzso For a given zzso zzso we first select potential zzso from a large database zzso zzso then construct an zzso where the zzso are only counted when they occur within a specialized zzso zzso The novel features of the proposed method include that it does not assume a small set of zzso for a given zzso on the other hand, the method zzso information from a large collection of zzso zzso and therefore is zzso more efficient and robust than the de zzso zzso Our approach is applied to three data sets with zzso evaluated zzso The method shows better specificity and sensitivity than other similar zzso tools in identifying zzso and zzso The zzso codes of our programs and module predictions across the fly zzso zzso are available at zzso zzso
