The mechanism of zzso zzso is one of the central issues in sea zzso zzso In this study we have identified a sea zzso zzso of zzso 1 + zzso zzso which is zzso expressed zzso during the zzso stage and which expression becomes restricted to the zzso primary zzso cells zzso after the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso injection into zzso eggs alters the cell fate of zzso to migratory zzso zzso zzso the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but suppresses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of dominant negative delta zzso which lacks the N terminal domain, in contrast, specifically zzso zzso expression and development of the zzso In the upstream region of the zzso gene there exists an zzso binding site that functions as a positive zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso plays a key role in the differentiation of zzso in sea zzso zzso
