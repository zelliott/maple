The aim of this study was to assess whether the zzso agent zzso can inhibit vein graft zzso without the occurrence of serious side zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was performed in the common carotid artery of zzso zzso transgenic zzso Mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and after 28 days, vein graft zzso was zzso 

Treatment with zzso resulted in a significant zzso reduction in zzso area without changes in zzso composition when compared with zzso zzso However, zzso when administered for a prolonged period of time, is known for its potentially serious side zzso To overcome these potential side effects of prolonged zzso treatment, the effect of a short-term zzso zzso treatment was zzso This short zzso treatment resulted in a zzso decrease of vein graft zzso at 28 zzso Furthermore, it was demonstrated that zzso treatment led to reduced local expression of several zzso zzso and factors in the vein zzso 24 hours after zzso Finally, observations in mice were verified in human zzso organ zzso Exposure to zzso for either 7 or 28 days significantly reduced zzso zzso formation on cultured zzso vein zzso 

zzso zzso treatment with zzso leads to a significant reduction in vein graft zzso over an extended period, possibly by the reduction of early expression of zzso zzso This zzso treatment zzso the risk of unwanted side effects of long-term zzso treatment and may be a new approach to prevent graft zzso
