This study was performed to identify bacterial strains isolated simultaneously with zzso species from zzso trees showing symptoms of bacterial blight and zzso in zzso 

Several molecular techniques including zzso zzso and zzso gene sequencing and zzso zzso were used to characterize the zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strains isolated along with zzso species from zzso zzso reactions zzso and zzso tests were performed on tobacco and zzso zzso zzso The zzso clustered closely with the type strain of zzso zzso in both zzso trees zzso The zzso similarity between the zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso A positive zzso was observed on the tobacco zzso but no disease symptoms were visible on the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was isolated from trees with symptoms of bacterial blight although strains of this bacterial species do not appear to be the zzso agent of the zzso 

This study provides the first report of zzso zzso isolated from zzso Its presence in zzso tissue suggests that it is an zzso in trees showing symptoms of zzso
