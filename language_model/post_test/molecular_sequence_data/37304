We have previously shown that the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso act in the proper formation of the zzso zzso Nevertheless, downstream events of the zzso action and their target genes remain to be zzso We show, by analyzing zzso double zzso mice, that expression of zzso in the zzso requires the presence of zzso and zzso in a gene zzso zzso By using a zzso system to zzso zzso in chick zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso can substitute for zzso in inducing zzso expression and in initiating zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso can zzso regulatory sequences in the zzso promoter and that they physically interact with the zzso promoter zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is a direct target of zzso and zzso Together, we conclude that zzso and zzso are required and sufficient for the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
