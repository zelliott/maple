Our previous studies indicated that zzso plays an important role in DNA damage repair, cell migration, and regulation of zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in chemical zzso using conditional zzso knockout zzso mice and zzso model of skin zzso Our results indicated that zzso mice were resistant to the development of skin zzso initiated by 7, zzso zzso followed by promotion with zzso zzso In zzso mice, the induction of zzso was delayed, and the tumor number and size were zzso In primary zzso from zzso mice, zzso exposure induced more intensive DNA damage, while zzso cell proliferation was zzso The further zzso studies showed that zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso factor zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso mice are resistance to zzso induced by zzso probably through zzso of zzso factor zzso via zzso These results highlight the importance of zzso in skin zzso and in the process of skin tumor zzso
