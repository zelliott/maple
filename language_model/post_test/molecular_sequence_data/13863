We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which maps to human zzso zzso zzso This is also the location of the major early onset familial Alzheimer's disease gene zzso zzso encodes a protein that demonstrates zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso Their functions are to zzso specific proteins targeted for zzso The protein also exhibits very strong zzso to a rabbit zzso zzso which mediates zzso degradation driven by zzso virus E6 protein in zzso The zzso of specific proteins that have undergone zzso processing in zzso zzso and zzso plaques is the classic pathological feature in brains of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso has previously been suggested to play a role in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso This gene therefore represents a plausible candidate gene for zzso
