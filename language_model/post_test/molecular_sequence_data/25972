zzso produces a zzso increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso increases when the side of the membrane to which zzso has been added zzso is made zzso This paper reports observations on the effect of zzso two positively charged zzso acid zzso within the zzso region of the zzso zzso at position 7 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We have zzso zzso zzso in which zzso is replaced by zzso zzso zzso is blocked by a zzso group zzso and in which both modifications of the parent compound were introduced zzso zzso The time required to reach peak zzso during a constant zzso pulse was shorter in zzso exposed to the zzso than in zzso modified by zzso The apparent number of zzso producing a conducting unit for zzso and zzso eight, was found to be greater than the one for zzso zzso and for zzso itself, zzso The apparent gating charge per zzso was less for the zzso zzso than for zzso zzso Essentially similar results were obtained with zzso zzso in which the charge on zzso or zzso or both was blocked by an zzso zzso spin zzso These results show that the positive charges in the zzso region of zzso play a major but not exclusive role in the zzso gating of zzso channels in zzso
