zzso zzso are composed of zzso bound zzso zzso whose assembly is zzso via a zzso zzso Major zzso constitute the zzso backbone and are therefore essential for zzso zzso Minor zzso are also incorporated into the zzso but they are considered to be zzso for backbone zzso The zzso cluster is one of the putative zzso gene clusters identified in the major zzso pathogen zzso zzso It consists of one zzso gene zzso and two putative zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso In this study, by constructing zzso for each of the genes in the cluster and by both zzso and zzso electron microscopic analysis with zzso against zzso and zzso we found that the zzso cluster mediates the expression of zzso structures in zzso zzso strain zzso In this zzso zzso forms the zzso whereas zzso is incorporated as the minor zzso In accordance with the current model of zzso assembly by zzso organisms, the major zzso zzso was indispensable for backbone formation and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of both zzso However, unlike other zzso zzso bacterial zzso the minor zzso zzso was required for zzso of the major zzso zzso Because zzso zzso are zzso in several other zzso bacterial zzso gene zzso in some types of zzso minor zzso zzso may contribute to backbone formation by a novel zzso
