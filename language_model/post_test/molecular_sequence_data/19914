The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso is a zzso channel that is defective in zzso zzso The most common zzso zzso zzso is retained in the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso and zzso by the zzso In a zzso screen to identify zzso zzso interacting zzso we found that zzso protein zzso a Type II AAA zzso that is a component of the zzso machinery, binds zzso zzso and this interaction is stabilized by zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be zzso processed during zzso with as much as zzso of the newly zzso protein zzso by the zzso we examined the zzso interaction in zzso zzso and zzso three zzso cell lines that zzso express zzso zzso The results indicate that when zzso zzso processing is efficient, as demonstrated in zzso cells, zzso does not zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells results in inefficient processing and zzso interaction, demonstrating that zzso processing efficiency and the zzso interaction are tightly zzso Furthermore, induction of zzso stress and zzso of the unfolded protein response result in inefficient processing of zzso zzso in zzso cells and promote the zzso zzso zzso The results support the hypothesis that components of the zzso machinery such as zzso do not interact with zzso in zzso cells that zzso express zzso zzso since under normal conditions the processing of the zzso protein is zzso
