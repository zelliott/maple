The promoter of zzso zzso small nuclear zzso genes consists of a zzso box and a zzso zzso sequence element zzso and the combination of these two elements directs zzso zzso III zzso We detected zzso zzso II zzso as well as pol III zzso from the human zzso promoter in a zzso nuclear zzso The pol zzso zzso was independent of the zzso and dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso Both pol zzso and pol zzso zzso were zzso by addition of zzso zzso protein zzso We conclude that both pol III and pol II zzso complexes can assemble on the zzso promoter in zzso and could compete during the bona fide process in the zzso
