zzso gels form within the zzso and zzso compartments of the injured zzso and zzso invade and facilitate organization of these transitional zzso We studied the effects of transforming growth zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso on zzso and zzso activities of human lung zzso zzso to determine their capacity to regulate pulmonary zzso zzso zzso activity of cell zzso and media zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso were zzso depressed by zzso or zzso In dose and zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso whereas zzso induced release of zzso into the zzso zzso and media zzso zzso were depressed by zzso whereas zzso was unchanged or increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso was mainly cell associated and unchanged by zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity was not zzso Plasma zzso times of zzso media were decreased by zzso but unchanged by zzso These studies suggest that zzso and zzso impair the ability of zzso to degrade zzso by disturbing the balance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that these zzso zzso leave unchanged or increase the capacity of zzso to initiate zzso zzso zzso likely to occur in the injured lung induce abnormalities of zzso in zzso from adults; such abnormalities favor zzso zzso deposition, a characteristic feature of zzso
