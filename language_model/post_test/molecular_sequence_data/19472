zzso of zzso DNA replication involves many zzso and zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso proteins bind zzso DNA and associate with zzso and zzso replication origins in a cell cycle dependent zzso 

By expressing the human zzso as the sole member of zzso proteins family in zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso its zzso binding activity, and associates in zzso with the zzso replication origins zzso zzso of the zzso the potential zzso binding domain of zzso decreased the zzso binding activity of the protein as well as its association with the zzso replication origins zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso cells had a reduced ability to zzso maintain plasmids bearing one or multiple zzso 

zzso a zzso DNA binding zzso associates with zzso origins of replication and functions as an zzso of DNA zzso presumably through binding to zzso DNA forming at zzso zzso
