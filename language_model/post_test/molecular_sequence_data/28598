We have described a zzso zzso of zzso termed zzso that binds directly to zzso and mediates zzso virus zzso zzso for zzso independence map to zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso together with a single zzso deletion in the zzso domain which introduces a zzso zzso at position zzso This zzso results in a truncated zzso domain of 27 zzso zzso We demonstrate here that while introduction of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso proteins did not impart zzso independence, it did affect the zzso of the zzso surface zzso exposing highly zzso zzso involved in both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso changes in the zzso zzso were also observed, consistent with the idea that the effects of zzso domain zzso must in some way be transmitted to the external zzso zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in the marked zzso sensitivity of all zzso proteins tested to human zzso zzso human zzso and zzso zzso directed against the zzso or zzso zzso These results demonstrate a structural zzso between the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso They also may help explain why the length of the zzso zzso domain is retained in zzso and may provide a way to genetically trigger the exposure of zzso zzso in zzso zzso proteins that may prove useful for vaccine zzso
