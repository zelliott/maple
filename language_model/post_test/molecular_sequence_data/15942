zzso receptors on most zzso are zzso zzso comprised of an alpha chain and a beta zzso These chains are zzso by zzso variable zzso diversity zzso and joining zzso gene segments that rearrange to produce a zzso and functional alpha or beta chain zzso To investigate the size and diversity of the zzso repertoire of zzso gene zzso we have characterized and zzso 20 alpha chain zzso Among these zzso zzso we have found 4 J alpha and 4 V alpha sequences that have not yet been zzso The relationship of these zzso gene segments to those already characterized is zzso
