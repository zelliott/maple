zzso gene zzso in avian B cell precursors generates surface zzso receptors of limited zzso It has been proposed that zzso zzso by these receptors play a critical role in B lineage development by recognizing zzso zzso within the zzso of zzso To address this issue directly we have introduced a truncated surface zzso lacking variable region zzso into developing B precursors by zzso gene transfer in zzso zzso expressing this truncated zzso lack zzso surface zzso and the low level of zzso zzso zzso that have occurred within this population of cells has not been selected for having a productive reading zzso Such cells zzso rapidly within zzso zzso buds of normal zzso In addition, despite reduced levels of zzso light chain zzso those light chain zzso that have occurred have undergone variable region diversification by gene zzso zzso although surface expression of an zzso zzso is required for zzso colonization and the induction of gene conversion, the specificity zzso by the zzso zzso is irrelevant and, consequently, there is no zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso avian cell surface zzso zzso
