In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of a zzso clone zzso from zzso zzso which contains three members of a zzso zzso zzso This family is composed of 10 to 15 closely related genes which are expressed in early stages of zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the clone zzso and of three zzso zzso clones is zzso One of the genes zzso contained in the zzso clone is believed to be zzso because of sequence zzso in its zzso region and zzso zzso zzso The remaining genes zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso appear to code for small proteins of unique zzso Three different types of proteins can be predicted as a result of the deletion of zzso or zzso terminal portions of a zzso core zzso These proteins all share a common zzso of zzso and zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso clone containing the gene zzso as well as the zzso gene zzso was introduced into tobacco plants via zzso zzso The functional gene zzso is expressed in transgenic tobacco plants and shows spatial and zzso regulation consistent with the expression patterns seen in zzso zzso
