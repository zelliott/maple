zzso growth factor beta 1 zzso beta 1) has been zzso and the zzso cloned from a number of zzso species including human, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using a human zzso beta 1 zzso probe, we have detected two distinct zzso beta zzso in cultured primary chick zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso at about zzso zzso shows similarity to zzso zzso beta zzso The second zzso zzso at about 3 zzso is a novel zzso beta zzso which we have named zzso beta zzso zzso corresponding to each of these zzso were isolated from a cultured primary chick zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso clones for zzso beta 3, zzso and zzso contained a 39 zzso zzso region, a zzso zzso coding region, and a 911 zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein includes a signal zzso of zzso zzso acids as in human zzso beta 1 and 2, and a precursor protein consisting of 412 zzso zzso which can be zzso at a zzso site to produce a 112 zzso acid processed zzso containing nine zzso zzso in the same positions as in human zzso beta 1 and zzso At the zzso level, the processed coding region of zzso beta 3 shows zzso and zzso identity with the processed coding regions of human zzso beta 1 and zzso beta 2, zzso at the zzso acid level, zzso beta 3 shows zzso identity with zzso beta 1 and zzso identity with zzso beta zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
