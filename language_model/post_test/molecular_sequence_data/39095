To screen the zzso gene in three unrelated families with lattice zzso zzso zzso two of which disclosed a particular zzso 

zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral zzso of the affected patients and their family zzso The entire coding sequence of the zzso gene was screened for zzso by means of transcript analysis on total zzso isolated from peripheral zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction performed with zzso designed for this zzso Each zzso was confirmed at the zzso level, by using published zzso 

One family that had a typical form of zzso had the described zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Two families with zzso forms of LCD were negative for the previously known zzso of the zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso in the latter two families allowed us to identify two zzso located in zzso zzso They consist of a zzso zzso at position zzso and one zzso zzso at position zzso of the zzso zzso Three new zzso were also zzso 

Two zzso different from those linked to LCD have been found in clinically distinguishable forms of this disease, intermediate between zzso types I and zzso The DNA segment zzso both zzso normally encodes for a highly zzso region of the fourth internal domain of the zzso zzso suggesting that this region may be of functional and/or structural zzso The identification of new zzso by screening of the complete zzso gene and the comparative analysis of the induced modifications in zzso protein should shed light in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso resulting from zzso in the zzso zzso and may help to explain their zzso zzso
