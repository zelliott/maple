The zzso sector of the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso through the zzso and via interaction with the F1 sector, couples zzso transport to zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of function is being zzso by a combination of zzso analysis and structural zzso and recent progress on the zzso coli zzso sector is reviewed zzso The zzso coli zzso is composed of three types of zzso zzso zzso and c) and current information on their folding and organization in zzso is zzso The structure of zzso zzso c in zzso resembles that in native zzso and progress in determining the structure by zzso methods is zzso zzso experiments suggest that the two zzso of zzso c must interact as a functional unit around an essential zzso group as zzso are zzso In addition, a unique class of zzso zzso identify a zzso zzso of zzso a that is proposed to interact with the zzso unit of zzso c during zzso zzso The role of multiple units of zzso c in zzso zzso zzso to zzso synthesis is zzso The special roles of zzso of zzso c and zzso of zzso a in zzso zzso are also zzso
