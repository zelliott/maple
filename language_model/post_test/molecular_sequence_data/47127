zzso growth zzso zzso is a zzso regulator of cell growth and zzso Three distinct zzso of zzso exist having similar, but not identical zzso zzso 1, but not zzso 2, binds to T beta zzso and also to zzso a cell surface protein abundant on zzso zzso In contrast, the affinity constant of zzso 2 for alpha zzso is zzso greater than that of zzso zzso zzso 2 also binds better than zzso 1 to a zzso zzso zzso binding protein expressed on vascular zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in which selected regions of zzso 1 have been exchanged for the corresponding region of zzso 2, we demonstrate here that zzso acids zzso or zzso of zzso determine zzso specific binding to zzso In contrast, exchange of only zzso acids 95 and 98 did not alter zzso zzso zzso specific binding to a zzso protein on zzso zzso cells was modulated by a region containing zzso acids zzso although exchange of only zzso acids zzso did not zzso zzso specific zzso zzso the zzso region also zzso binding of zzso to the type II zzso whereas zzso specific binding to alpha zzso requires concerted exchange of zzso acids 45 and zzso Taken together, these results show that at least three different functional zzso are important zzso of zzso interaction with binding proteins and zzso
