Since the previous review on the role of zzso in the immune system, numerous investigative teams have contributed to the growing pool of information illustrating the tangible relationship between zzso and immune function, particularly as this association zzso to bacterial and viral zzso In addition, the recent cloning of both zzso and zzso zzso receptors will ultimately facilitate the identification of molecular events that are responsible for the zzso effects that are zzso by zzso zzso Specifically, the administration of zzso in zzso can potentially affect the immune system either through direct interaction with receptors on the zzso cells or zzso through the zzso of receptors found within the central nervous zzso This indirect zzso is hypothesized to involve secondary pathways including the zzso zzso adrenal zzso axis and the sympathetic nervous system ultimately resulting in zzso zzso a portion of this review addresses the recent data on zzso zzso receptors and the potential zzso role relative to zzso receptors found within the central nervous zzso In addition, recent observations on the effects of zzso and zzso is reviewed from both a molecular and cellular zzso Finally, the consequence of zzso exposure on the competence of the host immune system to microbial pathogens is zzso
