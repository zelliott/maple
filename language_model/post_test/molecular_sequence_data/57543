Of the zzso proteins of zzso I zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso have already been zzso and the corresponding genes zzso zzso amplification and cassette zzso were used in this work to delete the zzso zzso zzso particles were isolated from this zzso which lacks zzso zzso and the direct zzso of zzso was investigated by flash zzso zzso The second order rate constant for reduction of zzso by wild type zzso was estimated to be approximately zzso zzso Relative to the wild type, zzso lacking zzso exhibited a rate of zzso reduction decreased by a factor of at least zzso After zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the original rate of electron transfer was zzso When a similar zzso was performed with a zzso zzso from spinach, an intermediate rate of reduction was zzso zzso labeling of the native zzso with zzso zzso allowed the isolation of a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that some zzso following the zzso sequence were labeled and thus probably accessible to the zzso whereas both zzso and zzso ends were probably buried in the zzso I zzso zzso zzso based on these observations confirmed that important changes in either of the two terminal sequences of the zzso impaired its correct integration in zzso leading to zzso identical to the deleted zzso Less drastic modifications in the predicted zzso exposed sequences did not impair zzso integration, and the zzso zzso was not significantly zzso All these results lead us to propose a structural role for zzso in the correct organization of the site involved in zzso zzso
