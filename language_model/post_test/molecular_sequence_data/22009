The crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been zzso revealing features important for the binding of zzso zzso and allowing molecular comparisons with the structure of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a second zzso zzso that displays both common and distinctive zzso Here we report further functional differences between zzso and zzso and have constructed a zzso model of zzso to help explain zzso The model predicts a lack of the zzso sites, and therefore the strong zzso of zzso activity towards zzso peptides by zzso suggests alternative sites for zzso zzso There is a marked difference in the zzso charge of the zzso channel between zzso and zzso which may explain why the zzso zzso zzso is zzso efficiently by zzso with a low zzso but does not bind to zzso zzso zzso peptides are excellent zzso zzso Models of BK zzso in the zzso channel suggest that the zzso adopts an zzso zzso permitting a tight fit of the zzso in the zzso zzso This, together with zzso interactions between the zzso group of zzso of BK and the side chains of zzso and zzso in the zzso pocket, are possible reasons for the zzso binding of zzso The replacement of zzso with a zzso in zzso would explain the higher zzso recorded for the zzso of BK peptides by this zzso Other differences in the zzso site of zzso and zzso also explain the selectivity of zzso a selective inhibitor of human zzso zzso which also zzso zzso zzso These structural and zzso studies provide insight into the molecular basis for the distinctive zzso features of zzso and zzso
