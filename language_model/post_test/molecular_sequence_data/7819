The zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso is located within a cluster with three other zzso Growth conditions of high light intensity and low oxygen tension induce bop gene cluster zzso To identify putative regulatory factor binding sites upstream of the bop zzso we have compared sequences upstream of the bop gene with the corresponding sequences from two other genes in the bop gene zzso zzso sequence motifs were observed which may mediate the effect of high light intensity and/or low oxygen tension on bop gene zzso Based on these zzso a set of zzso was constructed which contained deletions upstream of the bop zzso These zzso were tested in a host strain where bop gene expression is independent of oxygen regulation and in another strain where it is regulated by oxygen and zzso The minimal upstream sequence required for both zzso and zzso bop gene expression was determined to be 54 zzso
