Mice deficient in zzso are well suited for use as an animal model for inflammatory zzso zzso Raised under zzso conditions, zzso mice develop an inflammatory zzso disease resembling zzso colitis in zzso The finding that colitis was attenuated when the mice were kept under zzso conditions implies that the resident zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso The present study addresses the composition of the zzso bacterial zzso in colon samples from zzso mice that developed zzso This was investigated by comparative zzso zzso DNA zzso sequence analysis and zzso in zzso zzso using zzso fluorescent zzso to zzso the bacterial populations of the zzso zzso The investigations revealed distinct differences in the bacterial composition of the zzso zzso between zzso mice and healthy zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso identified up to zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso mice as zzso coli, whereas no zzso coli was detected in the zzso from healthy zzso zzso This finding was consistent with the results from comparative zzso zzso zzso About one-third of the clones analyzed from zzso zzso libraries of zzso mice represented zzso whereas none of the clones analyzed from the healthy controls zzso zzso zzso from zzso The abundance of zzso coli in the zzso zzso of zzso mice strongly suggests a participation in the zzso of colitis in the zzso mouse model for inflammatory zzso zzso
