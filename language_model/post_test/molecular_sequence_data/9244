zzso belongs to the zzso low G + C content group of the zzso division of zzso zzso zzso is an important human and veterinary pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of diseases, and has developed important zzso resistant forms such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from South American zzso monkeys in 2000, and is a zzso zzso closely zzso and possibly the sister group, to zzso zzso Comparative zzso analyses of closely related bacteria with different zzso can provide information relevant to understanding adaptation to host environment and mechanisms of zzso 

We determined a zzso draft zzso sequence for zzso zzso and included it in comparative zzso analyses with 11 other zzso species including zzso zzso A zzso based zzso of the zzso confirms that zzso zzso is the sister group to zzso zzso and indicates that the most zzso zzso lineage is zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso Given the primary niche of these two latter zzso compared to the other species in the zzso this zzso suggests that human adaptation evolved after the split of zzso zzso The two zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso closest but share many zzso factors exclusively, suggesting that these genes were acquired by horizontal zzso zzso in genes related to mobile elements such as zzso in zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso suggests that zzso in the zzso zzso group has developed by gene gain through horizontal transfer, after the split of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from their common zzso 

Comparative zzso analyses across 12 zzso species provide hypotheses about lineages in which human adaptation has taken place and contributions of horizontal transfer in zzso
