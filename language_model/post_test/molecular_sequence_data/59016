zzso of the human zzso gene is regulated in a zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We identified a new zzso zzso zzso 1) existing at about 3 zzso pairs zzso upstream from the first coding zzso zzso 2) of the human zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed the existence of several zzso with different zzso regions resulting from zzso usage of multiple zzso initiation sites of the new zzso 1, zzso usage of alternative zzso zzso sites at the 3' end of the new zzso 1, and zzso alternative zzso out of zzso zzso zzso of alternative zzso zzso sites was only found in zzso expressing zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis and zzso zzso zzso expression studies showed that a strong promoter region exists at zzso zzso positions zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso activities were found upstream of the zzso zzso Several putative zzso elements exist in the regulatory zzso A possible regulatory mechanism for zzso zzso and zzso expression of the human zzso gene is zzso
