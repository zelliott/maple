We have isolated from human liver libraries two zzso zzso zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are highly similar zzso over the coding zzso to mouse testosterone 15 alpha zzso and are therefore part of the zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso was found to be closely linked to the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso location could not be distinguished using zzso cell hybrids containing fragments of zzso 19 between zzso and zzso zzso field gel zzso indicates that both gene zzso are contained within zzso zzso DNA fragments, but were separated using various restriction zzso Northern zzso analysis identified three zzso zzso each showing a wide zzso variation in their levels in the zzso High levels of zzso transcript were associated with high levels of zzso transcript suggesting that common factors may influence the expression of genes within these zzso zzso analysis has suggested previously that a member of the zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso activity in the zzso We discuss the possibility, based on our findings of tight linkage of the human zzso and zzso zzso that a member of the zzso zzso is a better candidate for this zzso zzso
