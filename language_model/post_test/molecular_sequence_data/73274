zzso Y zzso receptors belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and mediate several zzso responses, such as blood pressure, food zzso sedation and memory zzso To understand the interactions between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso computer modeling was applied to the natural zzso zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso zzso An zzso and zzso binding domain was zzso using zzso data for the zzso zzso as well as for other zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which were investigated appear to share common zzso for their interaction within the zzso regions of the zzso zzso structure, including zzso zzso and zzso This is in contrast to findings with zzso receptors where the binding zzso of the zzso zzso have very little in common with the binding zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, a hydrogen bond between the zzso group of zzso of zzso and the side chain of zzso an interaction that is absent in the model complex between zzso and the zzso zzso is proposed as one of the potential interactions necessary for zzso zzso
