A new zzso zzso technique is described that involves zzso the DNA sequence of a short stretch of a gene zzso zzso and determining the percentage of all possible random sequences that produce a functional zzso A low percentage of functional random sequences in a complete library of random zzso indicates that the region zzso is important for the structure and/or function of the zzso Repeating the zzso over many regions throughout a protein gives a global perspective of which zzso acid sequences in a protein are zzso We applied this method to 66 zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso in 19 separate zzso We found that zzso zzso is extremely tolerant of zzso acid zzso on average, zzso of all zzso with random zzso function and zzso of the zzso are zzso zzso and fold well enough to function at levels similar to those for the zzso zzso We also found a few exceptional regions where only a few random sequences zzso zzso of the X-ray structures of zzso zzso indicates that the regions most sensitive to substitution are in the vicinity of the active site pocket or buried in the zzso core of the zzso DNA sequence analysis of functional random sequences has been used to obtain more detailed information about the zzso acid sequence requirements for several regions and this information has been compared to sequence conservation among several related zzso
