zzso genes have been identified in a variety of organisms and are commonly associated with the patterning of anterior zzso In some zzso zzso genes are also expressed in the zzso zzso where they may have a role in cell zzso Here we report the characterization of zzso an zzso gene in zzso thereby providing evidence that zzso genes appeared early in zzso zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in developing buds and zzso where it appears to have a role in the cell movements that are involved in the formation of new zzso Further, the gene is expressed at a low level throughout the body column of zzso This latter pattern may reflect a role for zzso in specifying tissue as competent to be zzso although the gene does not have a direct role in the formation of the zzso
