zzso production of human zzso and zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso cells infected with zzso zzso is zzso The expressed zzso are produced to zzso zzso zzso of cell culture or zzso of the total cellular zzso Two zzso zzso for zzso H alpha and H beta zzso differ in their construction in that the zzso region of the zzso gene is inserted zzso to the zzso zzso coding region in H beta zzso This zzso results in a zzso increase in yield of zzso over that of H zzso zzso with previous observations of the processing of zzso proteins in zzso cells, both zzso and zzso expressed in zzso cells are correctly processed to remove the initiating zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the expressed zzso in zzso cells confirms their identity with zzso zzso from human normal adult zzso
