zzso zzso zzso spores repair zzso DNA damage in part using the zzso spore zzso zzso zzso SP zzso is zzso by zzso the second zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is transcribed during zzso from the zzso promoter, which partially zzso the zzso zzso of the upstream zzso zzso which in turn encodes the zzso protein and zzso I components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to determine the physical and functional boundaries of these zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated in the region by in zzso zzso zzso in which parts of the cloned zzso region were removed and replaced with an zzso zzso resistance zzso then introduced by transformation into zzso zzso A zzso spanning zzso zzso and zzso abolished the ability of the resulting zzso to zzso the zzso sugar zzso zzso removing either zzso alone or both zzso and zzso did not affect zzso zzso thus indicating that zzso gene products are not involved in zzso zzso A zzso system was developed using the zzso zzso lacking zzso which allows placement of zzso of the cloned zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso system was used to explore the role of SP zzso in determining spore zzso zzso
