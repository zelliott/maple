We have developed a simple and efficient procedure for adding an zzso tail to one or more genes of interest in the bacterial zzso The procedure is a modification of the gene replacement method of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 97, zzso A DNA module that begins with the zzso sequence and includes a zzso marker is amplified by zzso with zzso that carry extensions (as short as 36 zzso zzso to the last portion of the targeted gene and to a region downstream from zzso Transformation of a strain expressing zzso zzso red functions yields zzso carrying the targeted gene fused to the zzso zzso The resulting zzso protein can be identified by standard zzso zzso In an initial application of the method, we have added the sequences zzso the zzso and zzso and influenza virus zzso zzso to various genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso including putative and established zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins were detected in bacteria growing in zzso tissue culture cells, and infected mouse zzso This work identified a zzso locus specifically expressed in bacteria growing zzso The procedure described here should be zzso to a wide variety of zzso bacteria and is particularly suited for the study of zzso zzso
