zzso are proteins that accumulate in zzso zzso subjected to various zzso stress conditions such as cold, drought, and zzso and in seeds at later stages of zzso Here, we report on two highly identical zzso zzso zzso and zzso in wild and cultivated grapes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their expression in different zzso and under different environmental zzso The two genes and their transcripts can easily be distinguished by zzso because zzso has an 18 zzso deletion compared to zzso zzso zzso expressed only zzso zzso zzso expressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso were present in low amounts in control leaves, but in high amounts in buds and zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated to high levels in buds and zzso zzso drought, and zzso treatment increased zzso of both zzso and zzso in leaves, whereas zzso treatment increased only zzso The possible relation of these results with the difference in freezing stress tolerance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso
