zzso zzso (AP) have been widely studied within the living world, but so far no plant zzso have been structurally zzso The refined zzso A zzso structure includes two zzso built up by two zzso zzso chains zzso and 15 zzso zzso The fold of zzso A is typical within the zzso zzso The zzso content is described by 19 sugar rings attached to zzso and zzso They are localized on the molecular surface away from the zzso active site and show a new zzso of the plant complex zzso A hydrogen bond between zzso and zzso renders the zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso to accept a zzso zzso therefore explaining the new type of the identified plant zzso The zzso zzso which has been shown to be involved in recognition of a putative zzso A zzso was found in a loop between two zzso on the molecular surface opposite the active site zzso Based on the crystal structure, a possible mechanism zzso zzso A might be zzso at the cell surface of the style to interact with its putative zzso from zzso is zzso The biological implications of these findings are also zzso
