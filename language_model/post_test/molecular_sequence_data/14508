zzso zzso zzso are widely used in numerous zzso Many of these proteins are also important drug zzso Thus, better zzso for the evaluation of their activities are always needed and are continuously being zzso Recently, I reported on a set of zzso for several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on simple, zzso zzso zzso labeled with a single zzso zzso zzso 412 zzso zzso The present paper reports further studies on the mechanism of action of these zzso It was assumed that the single zzso of these zzso is substantially zzso by stacking onto the terminal zzso of the duplex, and that any zzso of that stacking causes an increase in zzso Based on this zzso zzso of the same type for a variety of additional zzso were developed and zzso The new zzso described zzso are for T4 zzso zzso the DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso terminal zzso activity such as zzso zzso All of these molecules are easy to zzso and similar zzso for other zzso can rapidly be designed based on the principles outlined in this zzso
