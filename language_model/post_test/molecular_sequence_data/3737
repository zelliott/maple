The zzso variation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso key zzso in zzso acid zzso were investigated in pigs of different zzso As part of these studies, zzso sequences from a zzso pig liver zzso zzso were zzso The sequences showed a high degree of identity with those of zzso and human zzso zzso activities and zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso were similar in zzso of newborn and zzso zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso increased zzso between infancy and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels increased zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso typical for zzso increased about zzso between infancy and adolescence whereas the activities in kidney zzso decreased at least zzso In conclusion, the results indicate that the expression of zzso and zzso zzso are similar in zzso of newborn and zzso pigs whereas the levels of zzso zzso The finding that the levels of zzso increase with age in the liver but decrease in the kidney suggest a zzso zzso regulation of zzso The zzso variation in the liver and kidney suggests that hormonal factors are involved in the regulation of zzso
