To analyze the zzso between the zzso acid sequences of the proteins of zzso C virus and the functional characteristics of different zzso of this virus, a database of protein functional mapping of zzso C virus was zzso The database contains zzso acid sequences (both full-size and zzso retrieved from accessible databases and experimental data published in zzso The database also contains the results of comparison and treatment of primary data, including alignments and functional zzso On the basis of these data, variable and conservative regions of envelope proteins of zzso C virus were zzso zzso and functional maps of structural and zzso proteins of the virus were zzso The most variable region of the envelope protein zzso zzso was zzso It is assumed that the conservatism of some zzso acid positions of zzso is related to the functions of this zzso
