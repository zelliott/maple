The switch from short-term to long-term zzso of the zzso between sensory and motor zzso zzso zzso and tail withdrawal zzso in zzso requires zzso zzso and new protein zzso We isolated several downstream zzso one of which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso This rapidly induced gene encodes an zzso that associates with the zzso and increases its zzso zzso This regulated zzso is essential for long-term zzso zzso the expression or function of the zzso blocks induction of long-term but not short-term zzso We suggest that the enhanced zzso activity increases degradation of zzso that normally inhibit long-term zzso Thus, through induction of the zzso and the resulting zzso of the zzso pathway, learning recruits a regulated form of zzso that removes zzso constraints on long-term memory zzso
