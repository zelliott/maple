zzso zzso are an important class of zzso gene expression zzso In the course of mapping novel zzso zzso in the zzso of the gray zzso zzso zzso zzso we encountered a cluster of 39 actual and potential zzso spanning 102 zzso of the X zzso Analysis of the cluster revealed that 37 of the 39 zzso are predicted to form zzso stable zzso and at least 3 members have been directly cloned from zzso zzso zzso The sequence characteristics of these zzso suggest that they all descended from a single common zzso Further, 2 distinct families appear to have diversified from the ancestral sequence through different zzso zzso one through a series of simple tandem zzso and the other through a zzso zzso zzso zzso
