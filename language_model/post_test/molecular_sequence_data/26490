Chemical mapping is a widespread technique for structural analysis of zzso acids in which a zzso zzso to different zzso is zzso at single zzso resolution and used to zzso structural zzso This experimental framework has been extensively revisited in the past decade with new strategies for zzso zzso chemical zzso and rapid data zzso Recently, we have coupled the technique to zzso zzso Point zzso of a base paired zzso can lead to exposure of not only that zzso but also its interaction zzso zzso carrying out the zzso and mapping for the entire system gives an experimental approximation of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we give our in-house protocol for this zzso zzso strategy, based on zzso zzso zzso and we provide practical tips on interpreting the data to zzso zzso acid zzso
