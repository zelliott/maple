The zzso gene is specifically expressed in zzso zzso the molecular basis of zzso expression of the zzso gene will greatly explain the mechanisms controlling zzso We report a zzso zzso zzso located zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso start site, that enhances zzso gene expression in mouse melanoma zzso The sequence is referred to as the zzso zzso zzso zzso was protected from zzso I zzso by zzso cell nuclear extracts but was not protected by zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding protein zzso was performed from the zzso mouse melanoma cell nuclear extract using zzso affinity zzso The zzso fraction exhibited binding to the DNA zzso containing zzso and to a synthetic zzso representing zzso zzso indicated that the size of zzso is approximately 49 zzso zzso also directed enhanced zzso activity in the zzso melanoma cells but not in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso may be an zzso element that is responsible for zzso cell specific expression of the zzso zzso
