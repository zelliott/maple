zzso zzso is the major zzso present in the seeds of the common zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the zzso form of this zzso This zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso of storage zzso zzso Based on zzso acid sequence comparisons of zzso zzso and the three-dimensional structure of zzso complexes, zzso can be identified as a likely candidate for zzso zzso to create a zzso zzso that does not bind zzso zzso zzso was obtained and the zzso as well as the zzso gene expressed in tobacco zzso zzso zzso activity was completely abolished in the zzso protein produced in the tobacco zzso The zzso and zzso activities characteristic of zzso were also eliminated by this zzso confirming that zzso binding is essential for the biological activities of this zzso The zzso zzso formed normal zzso and these were transported to the zzso of the plant cells where they zzso This finding indicates that the zzso did not introduce a gross zzso of the structure of zzso
