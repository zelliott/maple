Six zzso representing unique zzso sequences have been cloned from the hardy citrus relative zzso zzso Among these, zzso and zzso were found to belong to the same gene zzso zzso data indicated that zzso and zzso each contained an open reading frame, coding for a zzso zzso protein zzso and a smaller zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed three large repeats in zzso but only one was present in the zzso Two zzso a zzso tract and a zzso motif were identified in each zzso The zzso motifs were similar to those of cotton zzso and Group 2 zzso zzso A zzso a common feature in many Group 2 zzso zzso was also found in these zzso but it was in an unusual position at the zzso A zzso motif of basic zzso similar to known nuclear targeting zzso was also present in zzso and zzso suggesting that members of this protein family may have a nuclear targeting zzso The expression of zzso zzso in response to cold zzso drought, zzso and zzso was zzso zzso expression in leaf tissue was induced in response to cold zzso but zzso during drought and flooding zzso
