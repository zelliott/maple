The change in zzso cover of a Hawaiian soil from forest to pasture led to significant changes in the composition of the soil bacterial zzso zzso were extracted from both soil zzso and compared for the abundance of zzso zzso content, by analysis of abundance of zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso amplified from zzso with 63 and zzso zzso zzso and by zzso analysis of the dominant zzso clones in the zzso zzso content zzso All three methods showed differences between the forest and pasture zzso providing evidence that vegetation had a strong influence on microbial community composition at three levels of zzso zzso The forest soil DNA had a peak in zzso content of zzso while the DNA of the pasture soil had a peak in zzso content of zzso None of the dominant zzso found in the forest soil were detected in the pasture zzso For the zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso sequence analysis of the three most dominant members revealed that their zzso changed from zzso and zzso zzso in the forest soil to zzso and zzso zzso in the pasture zzso
