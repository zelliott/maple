In this study we have characterized a novel human type II zzso zzso which is specifically expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair zzso This zzso represents the zzso of the recently described mouse inner root sheath zzso zzso The two zzso were highly related and migrated at the same height as zzso 6 in two-dimensional gel zzso Both zzso in zzso zzso and indirect zzso studies of human hair zzso demonstrated zzso expression in the zzso and zzso layers as well as in the zzso of the inner root zzso In all three zzso the expression of zzso zzso and protein began simultaneously in adjacent cells of the zzso bulb above the zzso cell zzso Higher up in the zzso the detection limits for both zzso zzso and protein precisely coincided with the zzso onset of abrupt terminal differentiation of the zzso layer, inner root sheath zzso and zzso zzso zzso above the level of terminal zzso cell zzso both indirect zzso and zzso zzso revealed the occurrence of distinct zzso cells that developed zzso zzso extensions passing through the fully zzso zzso zzso These zzso protruding foot processes zzso upon cells of the companion layer, with which they were connected by numerous zzso These specialized zzso cells have previously been termed zzso which means zzso zzso with reference to their characteristic foot zzso We provide evidence that, together with zzso cells, zzso ensure the maintenance of a continuous zzso zzso of the companion layer along the entire inner root zzso This tightly connected companion zzso root sheath unit provides an optimal molding and guidance of the growing hair zzso
