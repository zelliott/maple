zzso elements determine the accurate recognition between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso system from zzso and zzso coli has been studied extensively in the zzso However, information about the zzso from higher zzso is limited and plant zzso zzso have been largely ignored in this zzso We have designed in zzso zzso zzso based on the soybean zzso primary structure, aiming to investigate its specific zzso by two zzso plant zzso zzso and to compare this with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso elements at positions 20 and 35 in plants parallel those previously established for zzso zzso identity elements in the plant system that are not revealed within a zzso consensus sequence compiled from zzso corresponding to nine distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences are located in the zzso zzso Additionally, it has been shown that zzso and zzso are essential for a fully efficient zzso zzso coli zzso zzso for the plant zzso zzso these bases can be replaced by zzso and zzso with full retention of zzso zzso a constituent of the zzso zzso interaction, is essential for both plant and zzso coli zzso zzso acid recognition in terms of discriminating between zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso from both zzso may be manipulated by changes at different sites within the zzso zzso
