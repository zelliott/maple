We have investigated the requirements for zzso nuclear export and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein during productive zzso Our data show that zzso is the major export zzso for zzso in infected zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear export signal zzso or zzso B treatment causes an almost complete zzso of the viral protein from the zzso to the nucleus and its zzso at the periphery of the viral replication zzso Interestingly, however, this nuclear restriction imposed on the wild type and the zzso zzso protein is fully compensated by concurrent zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the same zzso fully reverses defects of the zzso zzso in the zzso transport of zzso and zzso degradation of zzso These results show that nuclear export of zzso in infected cells occurs via zzso and zzso pathways and suggest that zzso zzso and zzso provide a molecular switch that commits zzso to a zzso export zzso
