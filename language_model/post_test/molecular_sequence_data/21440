The members of the zzso Y zzso family are key players in zzso zzso In humans this family consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso which interact with distinct preference for the four receptors showing very low sequence identity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The binding of similar peptides to these divergent receptors makes them highly interesting for zzso zzso We present here a zzso zzso study of four zzso acid positions in the human zzso zzso zzso was selected based on sequence alignments both between zzso and between species and zzso zzso and zzso also on previous binding studies of the corresponding positions in the zzso zzso The zzso receptors were characterized zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the affinity of zzso and zzso increased for the zzso zzso and zzso Increased affinity was also observed for zzso to zzso zzso displayed decreased affinity for zzso and zzso whereas binding of zzso was unaffected by all zzso The zzso zzso showed decreased affinity for zzso zzso and zzso Although all positions investigated were found important for interaction with at least one of the tested zzso the corresponding positions in zzso seem to be of greater importance for zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that binding of the zzso and the zzso differs in their points of zzso The increase in the binding affinity observed may reflect an indirect effect caused by a zzso change of the zzso These findings will help to improve the structural models of the human zzso zzso
