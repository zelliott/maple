It has been hypothesized that in ancient zzso zzso lineages the two zzso of a single copy gene will become highly divergent as a result of the independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso We used a partial sequence of the zzso zzso zzso and the heat shock protein 82 zzso genes to test this hypothesis for putative ancient zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we tested if the zzso gene is fully transcribed by sequencing the zzso and we also tested if there is evidence for zzso and gene conversion in sexual and zzso zzso zzso zzso The average maximum zzso divergence in the zzso was zzso in three zzso species and zzso in three sexual zzso the average maximum zzso genetic divergence was zzso in the zzso and zzso in the sexual zzso In the zzso gene the average maximum zzso genetic divergence in the sexual species zzso zzso and in the zzso species zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso None of the differences were statistically zzso The zzso data indicated that the zzso sequence is transcribed and zzso zzso zzso tests indicate that zzso has undergone zzso in all three studied sexual species and gene conversion in two of the sexual species, but neither process has occurred in any of the zzso zzso No evidence for zzso or gene conversion was found for sexual or zzso zzso zzso species in the zzso 82 zzso There appears to be no zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso zzso Presumably, their low genetic divergence is due to zzso other zzso mechanisms or strong selection to keep both the zzso and the zzso gene zzso
