The efficient propagation of the zzso strain of the B zzso of human zzso 6 zzso was demonstrated in a line of T cells, zzso established from the peripheral blood zzso of a patient with adult zzso zzso zzso Growth of zzso cells depends on the presence of zzso and the cells harbor zzso zzso A severe zzso effect zzso was observed in many zzso zzso cells one week after zzso The release of virus from zzso zzso cells zzso was first detected after three days and increased rapidly for up to seven days after infection, as demonstrated by zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso was comparable to the value of zzso zzso obtained with zzso zzso blood zzso zzso that had been infected with zzso The replication of the virus was shown to depend to a considerable extent on cell zzso zzso zzso revealed many zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso The zzso strain of zzso and the zzso strain of zzso also infected zzso cells zzso as detected by zzso and an zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso T zzso with zzso such as zzso or zzso and the expression of some cellular gene or the zzso gene might be essential for efficient propagation of zzso zzso cells should play an important role in future investigations of zzso interactions and genetic variations or cell zzso of zzso zzso since no cell line that shows propagation of both zzso and zzso has been reported to zzso
