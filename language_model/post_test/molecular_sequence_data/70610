A zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice with inflammatory zzso zzso The zzso was zzso grew at 37 and 42 degrees C, and was zzso and zzso positive but zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso and zzso criteria, the zzso is classified as a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso mice without zzso infection did not have zzso evidence of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice zzso zzso with the novel zzso zzso zzso developed variable degrees of inflammation in the lower zzso and in zzso mice, the experimental infection was accompanied by a corresponding elevated zzso G zzso response to the novel zzso zzso zzso These data support other recent studies which demonstrate that multiple zzso zzso in both naturally and zzso infected mice can induce inflammatory zzso zzso The mouse model of zzso zzso inflammation should prove valuable in understanding how specific microbial zzso influence a complex disease zzso
