Data on nearest neighbors of zzso zzso in zzso DNA were zzso It was found that the zzso sites zzso and zzso may be located in three zzso families: zzso zzso and zzso It was shown that all the zzso sequences in these zzso can appear as a result of zzso zzso proceeding by zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso sites of each of these families: zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cells and their evolutionary origin from zzso type II zzso recognizing analogous sequences in DNA, are zzso
