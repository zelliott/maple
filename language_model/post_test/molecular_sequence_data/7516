The oral zzso zzso zzso persistently zzso human hosts and zzso oral disease despite extreme variations in environmental zzso To begin to investigate the role of the stress zzso zzso zzso in environmental stress responses by zzso zzso zzso experiments were initially used to establish that a functional heat shock response existed in this zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and engineered to be expressed with a zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso protein that had been zzso by zzso affinity zzso an zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso protein was generated to zzso zzso expression under zzso and heat shock zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso zzso specifically recognized a protein zzso mass zzso 68 zzso which was induced in response to zzso zzso zzso the role of zzso in responses by zzso zzso to various environmental zzso will provide a better understanding of how zzso is involved in survival of extreme environments and the contribution of the zzso protein to the zzso of zzso zzso
