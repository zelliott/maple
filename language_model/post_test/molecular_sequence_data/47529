A large fraction of pediatric zzso acute zzso zzso zzso consistently contain a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso results in the production of a zzso zzso factor containing the zzso zzso domain of zzso fused to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here, we show that the zzso fusion protein activates the expression of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso normally is expressed in peripheral zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in bone zzso In contrast, high levels of zzso transcripts are present in bone zzso and cell lines derived from zzso ALL patients carrying the zzso hybrid zzso zzso of zzso expression leads to a significant decrease in zzso zzso levels, suggesting that zzso is a downstream target of zzso Three putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in cells of the B zzso including zzso ALL cells zzso expressing zzso We propose that a zzso zzso growth mechanism contributes to the development of zzso zzso zzso
