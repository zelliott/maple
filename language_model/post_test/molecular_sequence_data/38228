We identified the zzso on the zzso which induce zzso that neutralize both ad and zzso zzso of zzso B virus zzso Previously we generated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that bind specifically to the zzso of zzso In this study we have performed fine zzso of the zzso of the zzso by examining their zzso with zzso fusion zzso which contain a series of deletion zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso specifically recognize zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso neutralized both zzso and zzso zzso of the virus in an in zzso zzso zzso using in zzso infection of adult human zzso primary culture by zzso The zzso showed little sequence divergence and the zzso bound to the zzso of all the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
