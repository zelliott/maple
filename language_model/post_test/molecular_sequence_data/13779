zzso was zzso from the zzso of the whole body of house fly zzso zzso larvae by standard zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and its zzso properties were zzso This zzso was a zzso zzso composed of 122 zzso zzso showing about zzso identity with fruit fly zzso and 38% with human zzso This zzso was inactive towards zzso zzso and under the zzso conditions of zzso zzso and zzso strength zzso but was as active toward zzso zzso as was zzso zzso The zzso profile of zzso activity towards zzso zzso showed that house fly zzso has an zzso pH optimum and shows no zzso activity above Ph zzso These features are analogous with those of zzso stomach zzso which have evolved for the zzso function, suggesting that this zzso does not function as a self-defense zzso like zzso and human zzso but as a zzso zzso probably in the gut of the insect zzso Although a similar functional conversion to zzso zzso was reported in fruit fly, zzso tree analysis indicates that the evolutionary change of zzso to a zzso zzso occurred similarly in fruit fly and house fly, but the events are not related and occurred independently in each zzso This observation is in contrast with the case of zzso stomach zzso which were recruited before the divergence of each species of zzso
