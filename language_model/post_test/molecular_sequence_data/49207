zzso control of carbon source preferences by zzso zzso strain zzso was assessed with a zzso fusion during growth on alternative zzso The zzso zzso zzso the first step in the degradation of zzso a compound consumed rapidly as a sole carbon zzso If additional aromatic carbon sources are available, zzso consumption is inhibited by unknown zzso As reported here, during growth on aromatic zzso zzso was not expressed despite the presence of zzso an zzso that normally causes the zzso regulator to activate zzso zzso Growth on organic acids such as zzso zzso and zzso allowed higher levels of zzso zzso In each case, zzso expression increased at the end of the exponential growth zzso Complex zzso regulation controlled zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additional studies focused on the zzso preference for zzso consumption prior to zzso zzso These compounds are zzso via the zzso and zzso branches of the zzso pathway, zzso Here, zzso were characterized that zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso lacked the zzso and zzso zzso regulators that normally activate genes for zzso zzso A model is presented in which zzso and zzso prevent zzso expression indirectly during growth on zzso These regulators may affect zzso expression by lowering the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with this model, zzso and zzso bound in zzso to an zzso zzso controlling the expression of several zzso zzso including zzso These studies provide the first direct evidence of zzso zzso between the distinct but analogous branches of the zzso zzso
