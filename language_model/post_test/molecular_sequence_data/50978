In order to study sequences involved in the zzso regulated and zzso expression of the class I Major zzso Complex zzso zzso we have constructed several zzso transgenic lines in which the zzso regulatory sequences of the zzso gene are linked to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso In five zzso lines, the pattern of zzso zzso detected zzso varied greatly from line to zzso None of the zzso zzso were transcribed in cells normally expressing a high level of zzso zzso zzso although these zzso regulatory sequences have been shown to be sufficient to drive zzso expression of other reporter zzso Interestingly, when zzso containing zzso beta zzso zzso zzso regulatory sequences linked to zzso were used to derive transgenic lines, similar results were zzso A survey of zzso labeling in zzso and beta zzso transgenic mice strongly suggests that these zzso are very sensitive to position effect, zzso expression being controlled by zzso zzso regulatory elements specific for each zzso zzso Here we describe the complex pattern of zzso expression in the different transgenic lines during zzso we discuss the unusual properties of these zzso and underline their potential use for zzso studies and characterization of zzso sequences involved in zzso gene zzso
