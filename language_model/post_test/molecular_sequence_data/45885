All three zzso of life employ two zzso zzso one for translation initiation and the other for zzso of zzso at internal positions within growing zzso zzso We have used a zzso zzso translation initiation system to explore the interactions of the zzso zzso with the translation initiation zzso Our data indicate that in addition to its previously characterized role in binding of the zzso zzso to zzso initiation factor 2 zzso the zzso zzso base pair at the top of the zzso stem is important for the binding of the zzso zzso complex to the zzso zzso zzso We have also shown that the zzso zzso base pairs in the zzso stem of the zzso zzso are required for the strong zzso zzso between binding of the zzso complex and zzso to the zzso This zzso reflects interactions that occur within the complex upon recognition of the start zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso pairs influence this zzso The effect of these zzso stem identity elements is influenced by bases in the T loop of the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso stem of the zzso zzso may occur during zzso zzso selection in the zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso that occurs in zzso zzso engaged in zzso decoding during the zzso phase of protein zzso
