The zzso zzso zzso is a major constituent of the abnormal zzso zzso plaque that characterizes the brains of victims of Alzheimer's zzso Two zzso with sequences derived from the previously unexplored zzso region of the zzso beta zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso were zzso and zzso and their zzso and zzso properties were zzso zzso beta zzso was found to be freely soluble in zzso however, zzso beta zzso was virtually zzso in zzso media, including 6 M zzso zzso The peptides formed zzso having distinct zzso zzso and different dimensions as observed by electron zzso of zzso stained zzso X-ray zzso revealed that the zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso A correlation between zzso and zzso formation was zzso from zzso zzso beta zzso when dissolved in water, existed as a random zzso whereas the zzso zzso beta zzso possessed zzso zzso structure in the solid zzso zzso of beta zzso in organic media resulted in the disappearance of zzso These data suggest that the sequence zzso by virtue of its ability to form unusually stable zzso is a major contributor to the zzso of the zzso and may zzso the formation of the zzso that constitute zzso zzso
