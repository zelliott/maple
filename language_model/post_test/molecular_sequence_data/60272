A zzso embryonic zzso library was screened for potential zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso using a zzso zzso One zzso that we identified encodes zzso protein zzso a protein with zzso to zzso zzso and members of the insulin zzso zzso family of zzso Analysis of zzso tissue extracts with zzso zzso revealed that zzso protein is expressed at highest levels in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso form of zzso zzso with Lyn in embryonic kidney zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso and consequential physical association with zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso also induced zzso of zzso and promoted its association with zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso revealed an interaction between zzso zzso and a zzso protein that is zzso in zzso zzso zzso The molecular basis of the interactions involving zzso with GAP and zzso was investigated using a novel zzso zzso fusion protein binding zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso sites containing zzso and zzso were shown to mediate binding of zzso to zzso whereas zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in numerous signaling zzso
