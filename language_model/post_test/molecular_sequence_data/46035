As part of a program to decipher the rat zzso zzso we studied zzso and identified numerous proteins including the human zzso of the zzso Maintenance zzso 7 zzso zzso has been implicated in DNA replication in various species, but had not been detected in the zzso Here we describe the cellular distribution of zzso transcripts and zzso and their zzso zzso zzso The full-length coding region of the rat zzso was also zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that zzso transcripts are more abundant in the zzso than other zzso and confirmed the presence of the zzso zzso zzso transcript at all ages zzso Interestingly, two additional transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso were found from 26 days post zzso zzso when zzso and zzso accumulate within the zzso This was confirmed in isolated cell zzso the three zzso transcripts were observed in zzso and zzso germ zzso The zzso zzso zzso has an extended zzso untranslated region zzso and the zzso zzso transcript is the result of alternative zzso of five zzso Western zzso and zzso experiments evidenced abundant zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells in the fetal zzso In the adult zzso an intense signal was observed in zzso and primary zzso We conclude that the zzso is one example of genes that are differently transcribed and translated in zzso and zzso cells in zzso Further work is required to determine the roles of zzso in zzso and germ zzso
