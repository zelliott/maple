zzso of zzso is associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases and abnormal cell growth zzso To study the mechanisms involved in the control of the zzso activity of the gene we have characterized its expression in different chicken zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso isolated from chicken zzso and zzso chick zzso is highly zzso to the duck zzso zzso and differs from the previously reported chicken lens zzso zzso in the zzso untranslated region zzso and in one zzso acid of the coding zzso Four forms of the zzso zzso detected in chicken zzso arise from the use of alternative zzso initiation sites and alternative zzso zzso The two principal zzso bands found in lens and embryonic zzso possess a short zzso and differ in the length of the zzso zzso with longer zzso are present in zzso muscle, and zzso The use of different start sites and zzso signals could zzso zzso activity and the stability of the zzso The expression of the zzso gene decreases from day 6 to day 8 of chick zzso in parallel with the expression of the zzso gene zzso
