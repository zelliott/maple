zzso hormone is a vital component of the regulatory mechanism that maintains the structure and function of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso hormone zzso In this paper we report the first detailed structural characterization of the zzso zzso of zzso human zzso hormone zzso Using a strategy combining mass zzso analysis and sequential zzso zzso we have defined the structures of the zzso released from zzso human zzso by zzso zzso zzso All zzso are zzso zzso and are mainly of the zzso and zzso type with variable degrees of zzso and zzso The major zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is: zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso at the three zzso sites was studied using zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso A affinity zzso and mass zzso techniques, including both zzso laser zzso zzso and zzso zzso was reduced, zzso and then zzso with zzso The mixture of peptides and zzso was subjected to zzso and the structures of the zzso were determined by zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso After zzso F zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso was determined by the presence of the zzso and zzso zzso derived from its zzso acid sequence in the zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso contain mainly zzso and zzso zzso zzso Only zzso site zzso bears zzso zzso Minor zzso complex structures were also observed on both zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso indicates a large zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present at this zzso These data demonstrate zzso of zzso in the alpha zzso but not in the beta zzso of zzso with zzso bearing essentially zzso and zzso zzso with or without core zzso and zzso and zzso zzso with no core zzso being attached to zzso
