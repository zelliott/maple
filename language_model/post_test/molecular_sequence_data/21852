The development of an zzso depends on individual cells receiving and executing their specific zzso although how this process is regulated remains largely zzso Here, we identify a mechanism by which a specific cell fate, zzso is determined through the cooperative efforts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors are critical, zzso regulators of the cell cycle and zzso However, little is known about the two most recently discovered zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso we identify a novel zzso zzso zzso and show that zzso functions zzso with zzso providing the first example in which these two major zzso zzso and zzso able to directly regulate the same target zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso and zzso function in a cell zzso context to regulate zzso of the zzso zzso cell death gene and to determine cell fate during zzso
