The zzso b zzso of the zzso complex contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is the locus of both a zzso zzso site zzso or zzso and a zzso reducing site zzso or zzso The zzso zzso site has been previously characterized as the site of interaction for a set of zzso including zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso In this paper, four highly zzso zzso in the zzso b zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were targeted for zzso zzso These zzso were chosen as being likely to be at or near the zzso zzso site, on the basis of known locations of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that zzso resistance to zzso zzso The zzso zzso all exhibit a normal rate of reduction of zzso zzso suggesting a fully functional zzso zzso zzso However, each of the zzso is impaired, to varying degrees, in the rate of zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso are unable to grow zzso indicating a severe zzso in the zzso zzso In both cases, the cause of the zzso is the lack of zzso of zzso zzso by zzso This is the first report of zzso that selectively impair the rate of electron transfer from zzso zzso to the zzso This set of zzso will be useful not only for modeling the structure of the zzso reducing site but also in zzso the zzso mechanism of this portion of the zzso
