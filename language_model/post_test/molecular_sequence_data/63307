zzso simple sequence repeat zzso information was analyzed together with functional zzso of zzso genes and public gene expression data for zzso and zzso Analysis of more than 15,000 zzso and more than 16,000 rice zzso indicated that zzso may affect the expression of hundreds of zzso Data from experiments on DNA zzso zzso zzso and transcript turnover suggest that zzso may affect gene expression at zzso and zzso zzso Members of some functional groups were shown to be enriched with zzso and often contained similar but zzso repeats within the same gene zzso In addition, the distribution of perfect and imperfect zzso in some zzso zzso and rice genes was used to demonstrate how zzso control of zzso variation may contribute to protein zzso
