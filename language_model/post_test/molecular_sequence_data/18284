The DNA sequences of genes 9, 10, 11, 12, and zzso which zzso the structural proteins in the zzso T4 base plate, were zzso These genes form a single zzso which is transcribed in a zzso direction from a single late promoter in the zzso region located upstream of gene 9 at position zzso A feature of the zzso is an overlap between the termination zzso of each upstream gene and the initiation zzso of its downstream zzso With the exception of gene 10, the open reading frames zzso proteins which have a calculated molecular mass close to that obtained zzso The reading frame of gene 10 encodes a zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso which is at least 22 zzso less than that in the zzso zzso Thus the mature protein zzso by gene 10 is possibly a product of the fusion of two adjacent zzso zzso The hybrid protein may be formed by a zzso during the translation of zzso zzso at the end of gene 9 or gene zzso
