zzso zzso are zzso with good zzso and low zzso attractive to produce by an zzso method to get a zzso zzso In this paper, we report a novel zzso zzso of a family 3 zzso to be an efficient catalyst in zzso forming reactions using zzso with zzso or zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso has an apparent optimum for zzso at 90 degrees C, which zzso with its unfolding zzso The total activity is lower at lower temperature zzso degrees zzso but the ratio of zzso is slightly more zzso This ratio is however more heavily influenced by the water content and the zzso zzso reaction conditions for zzso zzso synthesis from zzso were a zzso zzso system containing zzso zzso water, pH zzso and a temperature of 60 degrees zzso Under these conditions, the total initial reaction rate was 153 zzso zzso and the zzso ratio was zzso Comparing with zzso ratios of other zzso zzso can be considered to be a very promising catalyst for zzso zzso zzso
