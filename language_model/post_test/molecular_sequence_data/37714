Two zzso of the zzso zzso adapted to distinct light niches in the ocean have been described zzso These zzso are characterized by their different zzso zzso zzso a to zzso b ratios and zzso zzso gene signatures, as well as by their significantly distinct zzso zzso for growth and photosynthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Chisholm, zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular basis of their zzso differences zzso so far, zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso zzso strain zzso possesses a gene family of seven transcribed genes zzso different zzso zzso proteins zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso possesses a single zzso zzso The presence of multiple antenna genes in another zzso zzso zzso but not in another zzso zzso zzso is zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso genes appears as a key factor in the capacity of deep zzso populations to survive at extremely low zzso zzso
