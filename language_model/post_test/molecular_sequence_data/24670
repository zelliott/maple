The evolution of the zzso from zzso is one of the major milestones in life's zzso The genetic and zzso events involved in this evolutionary transition are unknown but may have involved the evolution of genes required for signaling and gene regulation in zzso The zzso of animal ancestors may be reconstructed by identification of animal genes that are shared with related zzso particularly those that share a more recent ancestry and cell biology with zzso The zzso have long been suspected to be closer relatives of animals than are zzso the closest zzso of animals for which comparative zzso information is zzso zzso analyses of zzso and animal relationships based on small zzso zzso zzso however, have yielded ambiguous and conflicting zzso We find that analyses of four zzso proteins from a zzso zzso zzso zzso provide robust support for a close relationship between zzso and zzso suggesting that comparison of the complement of expressed genes from zzso and animals may be zzso concerning the early evolution of zzso zzso We have discovered in zzso zzso the first zzso zzso zzso zzso to our knowledge, identified outside of the zzso zzso The architecture of zzso which includes multiple zzso zzso zzso resembles that of zzso in sponges and humans and suggests the ability to receive and zzso zzso Thus, zzso express genes involved in animal development that are not found in other zzso and that may be linked to the origin of the zzso
