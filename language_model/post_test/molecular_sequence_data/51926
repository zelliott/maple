zzso is one of the zzso zzso class I gene and its expression has been identified in zzso and in some zzso cell zzso It encodes apparently zzso zzso and is considered to play an important role in the zzso immune zzso However, the zzso of the zzso gene has not been established zzso In order to examine the zzso of the zzso zzso a clone zzso was isolated from a zzso library using a probe derived from 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso analysis of the zzso 3' untranslated region was carried on 35 DNA samples of unrelated individuals taking advantage of the fact that zzso zzso and zzso differed in zzso length in the amplified zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was zzso to zzso zzso but the sequence was more closely related to a zzso sequence of zzso which has been cloned from zzso of zzso zzso Among these 3 clones no zzso acid substitution was found in the coding region, Thus, zzso should represent a zzso clone of zzso zzso analysis showed that 33 out of 35 samples zzso contained zzso zzso 29 contained zzso zzso gene zzso Two samples zzso contained only zzso zzso and 6 samples contained only zzso zzso Among 29 DNA samples containing zzso zzso 3 samples showed the shift in zzso mobility in zzso zzso suggesting minor sequence differences in zzso zzso From these results it is concluded that zzso zzso is zzso but there are several zzso recognizable by DNA sequence and/or zzso zzso
