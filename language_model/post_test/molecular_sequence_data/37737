zzso sequence variation in a portion of the gene coding for zzso b in the zzso grouper zzso zzso zzso zzso an endangered fish species in various regions of the Mediterranean sea, was examined in 29 individuals from the western Mediterranean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positions were present in a zzso pair zzso b zzso amplified using the zzso chain zzso zzso analysis of the sequence data using a variety of zzso zzso separated the zzso into one group of zzso groupers corresponding to some of the Algerian individuals and another zzso set of zzso originating in France, zzso and the remaining Algerian zzso zzso on the basis of their zzso zzso zzso are now considered as a single species, our results suggest that a zzso of the Algerian zzso grouper constitutes a cryptic zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and genetic evolution may be zzso in zzso zzso resulting in zzso similarity between species despite extensive genetic zzso In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility of gene zzso with other species of zzso A more in depth zzso analysis zzso between and within the different zzso zzso would likely affect many conservation management decisions about this zzso of zzso
