Fast atom zzso zzso activated zzso tandem mass zzso zzso combined with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to confirm the sequence and linkage pattern of zzso amounts of the previously characterized three major zzso zzso zzso accumulated in zzso zzso Positive zzso zzso of both the zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso produced product zzso derived from zzso of the zzso bonds which allowed the sequences to be zzso Several fragments resulting from zzso across the sugar ring permitted the assignment, in some cases, of the linkage positions between the sugar zzso The zzso zzso yielded several fragments of this type which were not observed when the zzso zzso was selected as the precursor zzso Use of these techniques gave the complete sequence and linkage characterization of the zzso and complete sequence and partial linkage information for the two higher zzso
