During invasion, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into its host cell a variety of zzso zzso several of which have been implicated in zzso variation in zzso The largest family of these zzso defined by the zzso member zzso quickly associates with the nascent zzso zzso membrane zzso after zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso domain of the zzso family contains a series of zzso zzso that are necessary and sufficient for membrane zzso While each of the zzso zzso is individually competent to bind cellular zzso together they act to bind the zzso zzso possibly through sensing its strong negative zzso This previously zzso zzso domain is an zzso robust and energetically efficient design for membrane zzso
