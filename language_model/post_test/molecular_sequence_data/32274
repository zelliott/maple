zzso is a zzso protein that zzso in zzso cell death by means of zzso several members of the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso This action allows zzso zzso zzso of key cellular zzso and zzso zzso from zzso is considered the main regulatory step of zzso zzso Nevertheless, the fact that at least one zzso zzso does not reside in this zzso implies that zzso regulation could also be zzso zzso is a well known second zzso with important zzso zzso To analyze if zzso could be involved in zzso gene regulation, we analyzed zzso base pairs upstream of the coding sequence and characterized the minimal promoter, which contains a consensus zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso is indeed an important regulator of zzso transcription, since exposure to the zzso analog zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the inhibitor of zzso zzso or by hindering zzso zzso with zzso regulated the promoter activity, as shown by gene reporter and zzso zzso Additionally, the results of zzso zzso revealed that the consensus zzso site was biologically functional and required for zzso promoter activity in human zzso zzso Supporting these results, a negative dominant version of the protein zzso A responsive factor, zzso reduced zzso zzso expression and rendered the promoter unresponsive to zzso zzso zzso expression using an zzso approach blocked the zzso effects of zzso in cervical cancer zzso These results show that zzso is an important zzso of the zzso threshold in cancer cell by means of regulating zzso zzso
