The in zzso folding zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso has been described previously in terms of the zzso zzso that accumulate during folding of the zzso zzso is slow, occurring in hours at pH zzso 25 degrees zzso In addition, approximately half of the zzso molecules become trapped as a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor protein that includes a 13 zzso zzso pro zzso This pro region contains a zzso zzso We find that, in zzso both the rate of formation and the yield of properly folded zzso are increased substantially in a zzso model of zzso The zzso zzso is necessary for this zzso Moreover, a single zzso zzso zzso to the zzso end of zzso with a flexible zzso of repeating zzso zzso is sufficient to assist in zzso zzso Thus, the pro region appears to facilitate folding by providing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
