zzso zzso zzso II zzso gamma zzso on human zzso is zzso with respect to its appearance on gels after zzso focusing and with respect to its ability to mediate T zzso proliferation induced by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso its ability to bind zzso zzso To determine the molecular basis for this zzso we isolated total cellular zzso from zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso gamma zzso were then amplified using the zzso zzso chain zzso zzso DNA fragments were cloned into zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of clones from two zzso revealed a single base change zzso for zzso at position zzso which would result in the substitution of a zzso for an zzso at zzso 133 in the mature zzso gamma zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso involving human zzso zzso gamma zzso results from zzso variation of a single zzso
