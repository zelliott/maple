zzso zzso genes have been found to be conspicuously absent from primary tumors of the zzso although high expression of zzso zzso zzso in some zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso cell lines have been zzso In this study, we found amplification of the zzso gene in four of 10 zzso zzso zzso No such amplification was observed among 61 zzso cell zzso one zzso zzso and eight zzso cell lines, nor in six zzso of the zzso In two samples on which zzso analysis could be performed, we found zzso of zzso proteins when compared with normal zzso This zzso amplification in zzso tumors did not correlate with any pathological feature of the tumors, with the survival of the patients, or with the presence of other genetic zzso These findings provide the first evidence for amplification of the zzso gene in human zzso cancer, which is restricted to zzso We also found that six of eight zzso had point zzso in the zzso zzso this is a considerably higher prevalence than that reported for zzso zzso cell zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso differ from zzso cell zzso in their molecular genetic zzso
