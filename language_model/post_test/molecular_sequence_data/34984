Class switch DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically binds to the zzso repeats in the zzso locus switch zzso zzso By interacting directly with the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targets this zzso to S regions to mediate zzso In this study, we showed that zzso was expressed in zzso center B cells in zzso and induced in B cells by zzso and zzso primary zzso stimuli in zzso in humans and zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso within 3 h of stimulation by zzso and sustained over the course of AID and zzso zzso It was dependent on recruitment of zzso to the zzso gene zzso The zzso recruitment enhanced the occupancy of the zzso island within the zzso promoter by zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso complex, and zzso enrichment of zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso zzso which is indicative of open zzso state and marks zzso zzso zzso also zzso the binding of B cell zzso factor zzso to an zzso motif located immediately downstream of the two zzso zzso start sites for sustained zzso expression and zzso zzso Thus, zzso induction in zzso is enabled by the zzso zzso enrichment in the promoter, dependent on zzso and sustained by zzso
