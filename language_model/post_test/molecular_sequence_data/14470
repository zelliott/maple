zzso bacteria that were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso of up to 10 zzso zzso in zzso were isolated from the gut contents of adult bark zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were collected from the bark of Norway spruce zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso feed on zzso which produce zzso among many other defensive zzso It has been suggested that the zzso present within the zzso guts could be involved in their resistance towards this plant defensive zzso The most resistant bacterial strains were isolated and characterized by zzso zzso as well as fatty acid analysis, zzso zzso gene sequencing, zzso sequence analyses zzso based on the zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso characterization indicated that the bacteria belonged to the family zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene sequences and zzso of the novel strains revealed that they belonged to the zzso zzso but represented a novel zzso The dominant cellular fatty acids were zzso and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The results obtained in this study indicated that these bacteria from the bark zzso gut represented a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
