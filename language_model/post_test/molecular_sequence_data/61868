zzso zzso are thought to be distinguishable from the rest of the protein surface by their greater degree of zzso zzso We test the zzso of this approach on an expanded set of 64 zzso zzso using conservation scores derived from two multiple sequence alignment types, one of close zzso and one of diverse zzso Overall, we find that the interface is slightly more zzso than the rest of the protein surface when using either alignment type, with alignments of diverse zzso showing marginally better zzso However, using a novel zzso definition, we find that the interface is rarely significantly more zzso than other surface patches when using either alignment zzso When an interface is among the most zzso surface patches, it tends to be part of an zzso active zzso The most zzso surface patch zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the actual interface for diverse and close zzso zzso zzso to results obtained from smaller data sets, this work indicates that zzso conservation is rarely sufficient for complete and accurate prediction of protein zzso Finally, we find that zzso zzso differ from transient zzso in that the former have significantly fewer alignment gaps at the interface than the rest of the protein surface, as well as having buried interface zzso that are more zzso than partially buried interface zzso
