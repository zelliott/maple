The zzso of a zzso zzso analog of a repeat sequence of zzso has been determined in the zzso state using X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso were grown from a solution of the zzso in zzso space group zzso a zzso zzso & c zzso zzso A, with four formula units zzso per unit zzso The zzso zzso in the crystal exhibits exact twofold zzso The zzso unit contains one zzso and two water molecules for a total of 32 zzso zzso The structure has been determined by the application of direct methods and refined by zzso least squares to an R index of zzso for zzso reflections with zzso greater than 2 zzso The backbone zzso of the zzso zzso can be described as consisting of a double beta bend of Type zzso The Type III turn has Pro zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ala zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso at the corners while Type I turn has Ala zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Val zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso as the corner zzso The zzso zzso has two such double zzso linked together by zzso zzso
