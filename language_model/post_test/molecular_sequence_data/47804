zzso is an zzso zzso regulatory protein involved in B cell development and zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in avian B zzso we have cloned and characterized the first zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In sharp contrast to the avian zzso expressed already at the zzso stage and prior to the colonization of the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were not expressed in early zzso and were first detected in cells isolated from the embryonic zzso of zzso and zzso In accordance with zzso the avian zzso is also highly related to the zzso zzso thus suggesting an zzso zzso function in zzso zzso Interestingly, in contrast to the zzso zzso at least one alternatively spliced form of avian zzso is detected in addition to the primary full-length zzso Both of these alternate transcripts are expressed in zzso zzso and peripheral zzso cells, and no major differences in the expression were detected during zzso zzso Furthermore, avian zzso is clearly expressed at various stages of B cell development, thus supporting recent evidence for the importance of zzso in B cell development and zzso
