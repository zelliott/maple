In the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the regulation of programmed cell zzso To identify proteins with essential or zzso activities that might also regulate cell death, we used the zzso zzso system to screen for zzso zzso We identified zzso a member of the AAA family of zzso that is similar to zzso of zzso zzso studies confirm that zzso interacts with zzso and also with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso can form a zzso complex that also includes zzso or zzso A zzso zzso under the control of a heat shock promoter prevents some natural cell deaths in zzso zzso and this protection is enhanced in a zzso genetic zzso We observe a similar effect in zzso cells, where expression of zzso can prevent zzso and zzso from inducing zzso Finally, zzso is an essential zzso since zzso by zzso interference causes worms to arrest early in zzso zzso This arrest is similar to that observed in zzso zzso but is not related to the ability of zzso to bind zzso since it still occurs in zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso identifies a new class of proteins that are essential for development, and which might regulate cell death in specific zzso
