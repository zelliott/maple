zzso zzso factor zzso is the generally recognized nomenclature for a zzso zzso that exerts multiple biological effects in different zzso However, its role in the neuroendocrine system is relatively zzso with the exception of one report indicating that zzso may act to determine the unique vascular organization of the zzso zzso In the present study the expression of zzso zzso has been demonstrated for the first time in the zzso zzso of the zzso in all three zzso zzso However, zzso gene expression is restricted to zzso in zzso culture where zzso transcripts are readily zzso by Northern zzso Similar studies using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso technique also failed to detect zzso transcripts in fresh tissue from adult zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso acts to mediate the response to zzso a response that may include the induction of zzso expression in the anterior zzso In further studies it has also been shown that anterior zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the presence of protein synthesis zzso a response that indicates a role for a zzso protein in the zzso of zzso zzso Both the zzso response, and the response to protein synthesis zzso drugs are decreased in the presence of zzso indicating that a zzso zzso mechanism acts as a general zzso influence on zzso zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the presence of multiple regulatory controls on the expression of zzso that serve to restrict its expression to pathological conditions, and indicate that zzso does not participate in normal zzso zzso
