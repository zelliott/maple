zzso 200 zzso of zzso zzso exist, with only two, zzso and zzso responsible for epidemic and pandemic zzso zzso from these zzso have evolved from a common zzso with lateral gene transfer largely driving their zzso These strains are so closely related that separation using zzso or zzso zzso has proven zzso zzso zzso strains contain a genetic system called the zzso that is located in the zzso and that can integrate and zzso DNA elements called mobile gene zzso zzso by zzso zzso Large zzso of zzso are found in zzso zzso zzso For instance, the zzso El zzso strain zzso contains 179 zzso Since zzso zzso are dynamic through zzso and zzso of zzso it was hypothesized that the zzso composition in a given zzso zzso pandemic strain would be useful as a zzso typing zzso To address this, a zzso method was used to rapidly characterize the zzso composition of zzso zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso composition of pandemic zzso zzso cassette zzso is relatively zzso providing further evidence that these strains have evolved from a common zzso zzso of zzso composition between the zzso zzso pandemic strains was also able to resolve the evolution of zzso from a zzso of zzso El zzso This level of differentiation of closely related zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive than conventional zzso zzso or zzso sequence zzso Using this method, novel zzso from an zzso classical strain and an zzso zzso isolate were also identified, and a major deletion in the zzso array in all pandemic zzso strains and a subset of zzso El zzso strains was zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that their evolution can proceed by zzso and zzso of large portions of zzso in addition to the zzso or zzso of single zzso
