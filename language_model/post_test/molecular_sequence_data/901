The closely related zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in central and peripheral zzso zzso zzso in an overlapping but distinct manner, and critically regulate the differentiation and neurotransmitter identity of zzso zzso The structure and function of the human zzso zzso promoter has recently been zzso zzso the long-term goal of zzso the regulatory cascade of zzso zzso zzso we isolated a human zzso zzso zzso clone encompassing approximately zzso zzso of the zzso upstream promoter region, the entire zzso structure and zzso zzso of the 3' zzso zzso Two zzso start sites are identified to reside 115 and 110 zzso upstream of the start zzso based on both primer extension and zzso amplification of the zzso ends zzso In addition, transient zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso or longer upstream sequences of the zzso gene may zzso cell zzso gene expression in certain, but not all cell zzso The promoter activity of the zzso gene is modestly zzso by forced zzso of zzso and the zzso gene promoter contains a zzso binding site at zzso to zzso zzso This study provides a frame to further zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso and zzso gene expression and its relation to zzso zzso
