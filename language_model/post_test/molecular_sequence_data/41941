zzso an zzso zzso has been detected and localized in samples of the zzso zzso from eight zzso and 30 zzso human eyes of various ages by means of the indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration in the zzso zzso tissue was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were shown to be spread in the zzso drainage zzso system from patients along with progressive primary zzso glaucoma zzso The zzso level zzso evaluated in serial zzso of zzso zzso appeared to be increased during zzso and more rapidly in the event of zzso zzso The active zzso acid sequence in zzso is an zzso acid zzso zzso and it was shown that the synthetic zzso zzso specifically inhibited the adhesive function of zzso in zzso zzso samples when incubated for 30 zzso at a concentration of 1-2 zzso The zzso concentration necessary for a 50% decrease of the zzso zzso level in the zzso zzso zzso derived from patients with moderately advanced zzso stage, was about 1 zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso including the external zzso layers and zzso region of zzso canal, in samples incubated with the synthetic zzso compared with the same tissue zzso before zzso zzso It may be concluded that the zzso control system is likely to play an important role in development and maintenance of tissue architecture and specialization of the normal human zzso zzso
