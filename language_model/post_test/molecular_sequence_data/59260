We have characterized three zzso zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso by sequencing zzso chain reaction products of this gene generated with template DNA isolated from lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the amplification product from line zzso revealed a zzso deletion in the zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso differs from the zzso sequence by a zzso substitution and zzso zzso As both of these lines were isolated from the zzso populations generated by zzso zzso zzso and his zzso we suggest that these small zzso may be caused by unsuccessful zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis of the sequence of line zzso and the wild type revealed a single zzso substitution located 360 zzso downstream from the zzso junction that changes a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso In accordance with these zzso the zzso zzso of line zzso was zzso by transformation with a fusion construct of the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso structural zzso Comparative analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences zzso by the zzso gene from zzso and by the zzso gene from zzso zzso revealed a significant similarity between zzso This suggests that these gene products may have a similar zzso zzso
