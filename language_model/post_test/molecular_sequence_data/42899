The zzso are zzso binding proteins which, like zzso contain zzso zzso The zzso belong to group III of the family of zzso containing zzso zzso recognition zzso zzso The structural similarity between the zzso and zzso is clearly demonstrated by electron zzso in that they all contain multiple zzso which are zzso into zzso containing zzso stalks throughout their zzso regions and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or six, of these structures are associated via zzso short, zzso regions to form the zzso molecules seen in the electron zzso The overall structural similarity between zzso and the zzso however, does not extend to similarity in zzso acid sequences over the zzso zzso The zzso regions of zzso unlike those of the zzso do not contain the zzso zzso found in the zzso present in the zzso zzso Instead, zzso has a high degree of zzso to collagen sequences zzso VIII and zzso and this is consistent with the fact that, unlike the zzso zzso binds to protein motifs in zzso or zzso rather than to zzso zzso Also, despite sometimes showing interruptions in their zzso regions, the zzso do not always display a zzso in their zzso zzso similar to that which is seen in zzso zzso zzso may be more closely related to zzso than to the zzso The zzso can be zzso into two distinct group, with zzso and zzso being zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso being zzso with proteins in the latter group also having significantly larger dimensions with respect to the length of their zzso zzso
