We have previously reported that the cabbage zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso named zzso that zzso zzso in a variety of human cancer cell zzso In the present study, sequencing and cloning of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso sequencing showed that the gene encodes an zzso acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of zzso An intact clone at the zzso acid level encompassing the entire coding region was obtained by zzso of two independent zzso and the molecular mass of its in zzso expressed protein was about 100 zzso on zzso the same as that of zzso native zzso The expressed protein induced zzso in human gastric zzso zzso and cervical zzso zzso cells, like the native zzso indicating functional zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed zzso zzso with a zzso zzso toxin from zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso showed regional sequence similarities with zzso zzso such as the A zzso of zzso zzso A zzso acid zzso at the putative zzso site, zzso in all zzso zzso was also found in zzso zzso of another zzso acid for zzso acid 165 resulted in a great decrease in zzso and induction of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein zzso might possess zzso activity that leads to zzso of the zzso
