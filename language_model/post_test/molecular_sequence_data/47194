zzso zzso zzso the penultimate zzso in zzso zzso is typically found only at significant levels in the zzso zzso and zzso Large changes in the activity of this zzso drive the zzso rhythm in circulating zzso seen in all zzso In this study, we examined the utility of using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a marker to monitor the very early development of zzso zzso and zzso clock function in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and used for in zzso zzso In the adult, zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso cells and retinal zzso zzso analysis, using whole mount in zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso expression is first detected at 22 h post zzso zzso zzso zzso was first detected on day 3 post zzso and appears to be associated with development of the retinal zzso zzso analysis of zzso to zzso zzso larvae indicated that zzso zzso abundance exhibits a dramatic zzso rhythm in a zzso light, zzso dark cycle, with high levels at zzso This rhythm persists in constant darkness, indicating that the zzso zzso rhythm is driven by a zzso clock at this zzso The techniques described in this report were also used to determine that zzso expression is altered in two well characterized genetic zzso zzso and floating zzso The observations described here suggest that zzso zzso may be a useful marker to study development of the zzso zzso and of zzso clock mechanisms in zzso
