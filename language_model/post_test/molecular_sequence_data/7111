zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify transcripts zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso from zzso isolated from developing seeds of tobacco zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the amplified products indicated that the clones zzso a second form of tobacco zzso zzso different from that previously zzso zzso et zzso 1994, Plant zzso zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso was used to amplify the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso Northern zzso and zzso protection zzso of zzso samples isolated from different tobacco zzso indicated that this second zzso zzso form was expressed only in developing zzso zzso it seems likely that this message is the product of a tobacco zzso zzso gene specifically expressed in zzso
