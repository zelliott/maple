Although the zzso zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso with human zzso is very rapidly inhibited by alpha zzso zzso is a potent zzso agent in a human plasma milieu which contains 1 zzso alpha zzso In the present study, it was found that the complex of zzso with zzso zzso zzso after zzso with alpha zzso retained the full zzso zzso potential of zzso when added to a zzso solution zzso zzso zzso residual zzso When added to human plasma containing a zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso 50% zzso in 2 zzso were 17 zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso for STAR, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso neutralized by alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso revealed zzso as zzso complex (Mr approximately zzso whereas after addition of alpha zzso zzso zzso with an apparent Mr of zzso When zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso whereas it was nearly zzso recovered in the zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso after addition of alpha zzso to the zzso zzso analysis of the binding of zzso to zzso yielded a zzso constant of 55 zzso whereas no specific binding of zzso to zzso zzso could be zzso These findings indicate that, both in zzso systems and in a human plasma milieu containing a zzso plasma zzso zzso of the zzso complex by alpha zzso results in zzso of functionally active zzso from the complex and recycling of zzso to other zzso zzso This zzso process may explain the high zzso potency of zzso in a plasma milieu in the presence of high zzso of alpha zzso
