In conjunction with other general initiation factors, the zzso zzso protein zzso can direct zzso zzso by zzso zzso II from zzso zzso but its stable interaction with zzso factors zzso in the zzso complex is required both for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso directed by an zzso zzso We have generated a zzso zzso complex containing an zzso acid substitution in the zzso surface of its zzso zzso This zzso zzso is defective in both zzso and activated zzso from core promoters containing only a zzso box but supports zzso from zzso promoters independently of the presence or absence of a zzso zzso Our results show that a functional zzso element is needed to bypass the requirement for an active zzso zzso surface in zzso and imply that zzso zzso can be achieved by modulating distinct core zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso
