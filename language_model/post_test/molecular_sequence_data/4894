The hairpin zzso is an example of a small zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in a highly zzso zzso The hairpin zzso in common with all other small zzso such as the zzso requires the presence of a zzso metal zzso zzso (typically zzso for the reaction to take zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso in the hairpin zzso reaction we have zzso two zzso modified zzso in which a zzso replaces the zzso zzso zzso Previously, Burke and co-workers have reported that no zzso is observed with the zzso zzso We observe the absence of a zzso with both zzso zzso hairpin zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso zzso complexes are capable of supporting the hairpin zzso reaction, with a similar efficiency to zzso in the presence of zzso Variation of the net charge on the zzso zzso complex does not change the observed rate of zzso These results suggest that metal zzso play a passive role in the hairpin zzso zzso reaction and are probably required for structural purposes zzso This places the hairpin zzso in a different zzso class to other small zzso such as the zzso
