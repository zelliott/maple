So far, the role of zzso in inflammatory processes has been zzso We have previously shown that stimulation of zzso with viruses or bacteria results in a simultaneous production of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso 6 and zzso zzso We here report that zzso infected zzso produce also a zzso factor for zzso The activity is zzso not only by zzso virus but also by zzso 1 beta and the zzso zzso zzso This factor, when zzso to zzso occurs as a zzso protein zzso upon sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The pure protein is zzso related to a fully characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso designated zzso Furthermore, the zzso factor from zzso has an zzso sequence identical to that of zzso small differences in zzso processing being zzso Finally, in addition to zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell line is also a producer of zzso It can thus be concluded that zzso can be produced by several cell types in response to infection and that zzso can contribute to zzso in zzso
