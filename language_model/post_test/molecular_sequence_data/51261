zzso zzso has two closely linked zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso these zzso are located upstream of and in divergent orientation to the zzso gene zzso We report here the zzso sequence and zzso analyses of both zzso zzso The predicted zzso and zzso proteins shared zzso identical zzso acid zzso at corresponding positions and exhibited different degrees of zzso with zzso proteins of other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as measured by expression of a zzso zzso fusion, required the zzso zzso but not zzso A zzso zzso zzso deleted for both zzso copies zzso delta zzso still showed residual zzso zzso however, zzso of soybean was significantly delayed, and zzso of zzso bean and zzso resulted in strongly reduced zzso zzso zzso efficient zzso of zzso bean and zzso by strain delta zzso was restored by genetic zzso with the zzso zzso but not with zzso We conclude from these data that zzso is the critical gene that contributes to zzso zzso efficiency, whereas the zzso gene does not play any obvious role in zzso of the host plants zzso
