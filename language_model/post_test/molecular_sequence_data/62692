To study proteins zzso into the zzso we used zzso from primary human airway zzso cells, zzso at the zzso zzso and from patients zzso during zzso A major protein of the cultured cell zzso was ethanol zzso This protein was zzso analyzed by zzso degradation, zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso of zzso zzso and Western blots of two-dimensional zzso gels using zzso against the zzso zzso The protein was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso clone protein zzso The protein had multiple truncated zzso a pattern also seen in zzso zzso zzso was poorly soluble in water zzso zzso or in 50 zzso zzso but was more soluble in zzso ethanol zzso 380 zzso zzso zzso dramatically increased during the second week in zzso interface culture and continued to increase over zzso zzso showed that zzso was expressed in human airway zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso is in the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein family of zzso host defense zzso zzso zzso failed to compete with zzso for the binding of zzso whereas zzso B, a known inhibitor of zzso zzso did interfere with zzso This study showed that zzso gene product is expressed both in zzso and in zzso detailed a method for its zzso and provided basic information on its zzso properties in zzso
