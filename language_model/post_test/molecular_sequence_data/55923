The gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso is composed of zzso zzso zzso and its molecular mass is zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso was found to be more similar to the sequence of zzso zzso zzso from various sources than to the sequence of other zzso The structural gene was cloned in the zzso coli expression zzso zzso and large amounts of a soluble but inactive form of the zzso were produced upon its zzso zzso of the zzso was obtained by increasing the salt concentration to 3 M zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso and shown to be indistinguishable from the native zzso isolated from zzso These findings present the first example of the successful expression of a zzso gene coding for a soluble protein in zzso coli and its recovery as a functional zzso zzso zzso was employed to modify zzso on the zzso to zzso This modification produced an zzso that has considerably higher specificity for zzso (the zzso of zzso than for zzso (the zzso of zzso The zzso also caused a modification in the relative activities of the zzso at different salt zzso The greater similarity of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso to that of zzso than to that of zzso sheds light on the molecular evolution of these zzso
