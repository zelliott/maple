Using an zzso zzso method, we processed the human zzso and zzso regions and zzso all zzso patterns with zzso zzso copies and zzso above what is expected by zzso Among the millions of discovered patterns, we found a subset of zzso patterns, termed zzso which have additional zzso instances in the untranslated and zzso regions of zzso transcripts from zzso human zzso The zzso arrange zzso in the untranslated and coding regions of numerous human genes where they form zzso zzso instances of zzso in these regions show a strong bias in their relative placement, favoring distances of approximately 22 zzso We also found zzso to be enriched in a statistically significant manner in genes involved in specific zzso zzso cell communication, transcription, regulation of transcription, zzso zzso zzso For approximately 1/3 of the zzso the zzso instances of their reverse complement lie within zzso zzso regions, typically zzso zzso long, which are predicted to form zzso energetically stable, zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso the zzso zzso approximately zzso of the known zzso zzso thus suggesting a possible link with zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparisons reveal that many of the zzso have instances in the 3' zzso of genes from other zzso and zzso where they are overrepresented in similar biological zzso as in the human zzso These unexpected findings suggest potential unique functional connections between the coding and zzso parts of the human zzso
