zzso zzso factors are important regulators of zzso differentiation and zzso We have previously shown that zzso mice develop zzso zzso features, similar to systemic lupus zzso zzso T zzso exhibit enhanced T cell zzso zzso zzso which is presumably responsible for causing zzso in zzso zzso The comparison of zzso and zzso T zzso expression profiles by zzso followed by zzso identification has revealed a set of zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso cell survival and stress zzso The deregulation of these proteins may account for the zzso zzso that characterizes zzso T zzso Our work shows that zzso analysis of zzso strains can be a useful methodology to study the functional role of specific zzso
