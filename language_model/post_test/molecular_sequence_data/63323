zzso inflammation involving constant generation of zzso oxide zzso by zzso has been recognized as a factor related to zzso At the site of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are primarily formed by zzso and may be associated with the development of zzso In this study, we explored the zzso properties of the zzso zzso generated by zzso DNA zzso zzso using a new fluorescent method for analyzing zzso zzso An zzso containing a single zzso zzso was used as a template in primer extension reaction zzso by human DNA zzso to explore the zzso potential of the zzso zzso zzso extension reaction zzso by pol alpha was slightly retarded prior to the zzso zzso zzso most of the zzso were extended past the zzso Pol zzso and pol zzso (a truncated form of pol zzso readily zzso the zzso zzso The fully extended products were analyzed by using zzso PAGE to zzso the zzso frequency and specificity occurring at the zzso zzso All zzso that is, pol zzso pol zzso and pol zzso promoted preferential incorporation of zzso zzso zzso the wrong base, opposite the zzso zzso Surprisingly, no incorporation of zzso zzso the correct base, was observed opposite the zzso zzso kinetic studies with pol zzso pol zzso and pol zzso indicated that zzso was zzso incorporated opposite the zzso zzso These zzso zzso the zzso by incorporating zzso opposite the zzso and extended past the zzso These relative bypass zzso past the zzso pair were at least 3 orders of magnitude higher than those for the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso capable of generating zzso zzso This zzso zzso may play an important role in initiating zzso zzso
