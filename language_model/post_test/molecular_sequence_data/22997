The zzso is critical to the innate immune response and contributes to human diseases, including inflammatory arthritis and plaque formation in zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is an zzso zzso that is produced by zzso To study the regulation of zzso production in zzso we show that stimulation of zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso increases expression of zzso zzso and zzso Three alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso are produced, and the stability of zzso zzso increases following cellular zzso To study zzso regulation of the zzso gene the zzso region zzso zzso was introduced into the 3' zzso of the zzso gene in a reporter zzso In both zzso cells and zzso zzso the 3' zzso sequence dramatically reduces reporter zzso Treatment with zzso of zzso including zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso stimulates expression of 3' zzso zzso Finally, mapping studies of the 3' zzso of zzso zzso show that deletion of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso binding site affects zzso reporter expression in zzso cells, but does not affect reporter zzso with zzso Together these results demonstrate that a zzso mechanism contributes to zzso gene expression in activated zzso zzso
