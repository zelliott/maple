We have developed a novel expression zzso zzso to detect a zzso zzso zzso a zzso signal sequence zzso This zzso carries a zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso as a reporter gene under the zzso early zzso We inserted zzso fragments zzso various zzso between the promoter and the reporter gene of zzso These plasmids were introduced into monkey zzso cells to produce zzso zzso Only when the zzso was intact, was zzso activity detected in the culture medium of the zzso zzso Thus, this system may be useful for detecting the zzso zzso zzso proteins or zzso membrane zzso
