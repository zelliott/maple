zzso zzso zzso are mostly zzso by genes at the zzso locus in zzso zzso We have zzso 11 zzso zzso genes from zzso coli strains that belong to seven O zzso These zzso together with those of nine other zzso zzso genes (from strains of three different O zzso zzso recently zzso zzso Reid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso include 10 different zzso The differences between these 10 sequences range from zzso to zzso By comparison with other zzso coli zzso zzso we have identified primer length sequences specific for zzso genes in general and others specific for zzso genes of zzso and zzso zzso the specificity was confirmed by zzso testing the type strains for all 53 zzso coli H zzso We have previously identified genes specific for the zzso coli zzso zzso and use of the combination of zzso and zzso zzso allows the sensitive and rapid detection of zzso zzso coli zzso which cause the majority of zzso colitis zzso
