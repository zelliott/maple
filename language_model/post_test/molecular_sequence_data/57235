Studies of the immune response to the human zzso virus zzso have been hampered by the zzso diversity of the zzso envelope zzso In an effort to predict the efficacy of vaccination we have compared the systemic zzso zzso response in zzso volunteers zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso or as soluble protein produced in zzso derived from the zzso strain of zzso and in two laboratory workers accidentally infected with the same zzso 11 of 14 zzso responded to zzso by producing zzso of similar zzso and the same zzso as that seen in the laboratory zzso Four zzso also had zzso to the principal zzso domain zzso zzso that was comparable in zzso with that seen in the laboratory workers, but the fine specificity of zzso zzso was zzso different in the two zzso zzso that can block the interaction between zzso and zzso was present at comparable levels in three vaccines and the lab zzso zzso zzso zzso were markedly lower in the zzso than in the laboratory zzso In seven of the zzso an zzso zzso was at zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso to this region indicate that they do not zzso bind to infected cells, nor function as zzso Although the zzso zzso response was of similar magnitude in both infected and vaccinated individuals, there were important qualitative zzso
