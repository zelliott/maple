zzso zzso are responsible for the zzso of zzso juvenile zzso zzso On initial screening of Japanese patients with zzso we had found that approximately half of the zzso zzso are deletions occurring between zzso 2 and 5, forming a deletion hot zzso In this study, we investigated the deletion zzso of the zzso zzso in 22 families with zzso and examined the possible association between these deletion events and zzso zzso We identified 18 deletion zzso at the DNA zzso sequence zzso Almost all these deletions were different, indicating that the deletion hot spot was generated by zzso but independent zzso We found no association between the deletions and specific DNA zzso Recent copy number variation zzso data from various ethnic groups showed that the deletion hot spot is overlapped by a highly zzso zzso region, indicating that the zzso deletion zzso or zzso is zzso zzso By comparing zzso and zzso linkage zzso we found that the zzso deletion hot spot may be associated with a zzso zzso hot spot, although such association was not found on comparison with recent high-resolution genetic maps generated from the International zzso zzso Here, we discuss the possible mechanisms for deletion hot spot formation and its effects on human zzso
