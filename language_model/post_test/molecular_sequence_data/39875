The zzso zzso of zzso zzso including the narcotic analgesics zzso and zzso accumulate in the zzso zzso of specialized zzso that accompany vascular zzso throughout the zzso In mature zzso zzso plants, zzso labeling using specific zzso showed that four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were restricted to sieve elements of the zzso adjacent or zzso to zzso The identity of sieve elements was confirmed by zzso the specific zzso labeling of the characteristic zzso of this cell type, zzso the zzso of a sieve zzso zzso with all zzso zzso and zzso the strict association of sieve plates with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was demonstrated zzso specific to major latex protein zzso which is characteristic of this cell zzso In zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and SAT showed that the corresponding gene transcripts were found in the companion cell paired with each sieve zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bridge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and SAT were localized by zzso labeling to the sieve elements in the root and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The abundance of these zzso increased rapidly between 1 and 3 days after seed zzso The zzso of seven zzso zzso to the sieve elements provides strong support for the unique, cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
