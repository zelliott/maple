The history of colonization and zzso in zzso distributed among zzso zzso zzso remains enigmatic and poorly understood because of an inability to mark and track zzso A combination of zzso zzso and environmental data improves understanding of spatial and zzso scales at which zzso disruption of gene flow or even zzso may zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are important components of deep zzso cold zzso zzso as they provide long-term habitat for many other zzso Three species of zzso zzso zzso zzso of California zzso zzso zzso zzso of Mexico zzso and zzso zzso (West African Cold zzso have been described based on zzso but are not zzso through the use of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso 1; large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we also zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso B2 zzso and zzso 28 zzso to zzso determine the level of genetic zzso if any, among the three geographically separated entities and zzso identify possible population structure at the regional scale within the zzso and West zzso zzso at the global scale support the occurrence of three genetically distinct zzso At the regional scale among eight sampling sites of zzso zzso and among three sampling sites of zzso zzso no population structure was zzso These findings suggest that despite the zzso and isolation of zzso zzso connectivity is high on regional zzso
