zzso deafness type 3 zzso the most prevalent zzso form of zzso deafness, is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso Despite numerous reports on clinical evaluations and genetic analyses describing novel zzso zzso little is known about how such zzso affect normal functions of the zzso protein and cause inner ear zzso and zzso Here we describe three novel zzso of the zzso gene and their clinical zzso in three Korean families carrying deafness segregating at the zzso zzso The three zzso cause a substitution zzso or a deletion zzso of highly zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso or a zzso that eliminates both zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying their inner ear zzso we examined the behavior of the normal and zzso forms of the zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling as well as in zzso zzso demonstrated that these zzso are zzso to the zzso structure of the zzso protein and severely affect its ability to bind zzso All three zzso zzso proteins failed to zzso expression of a reporter zzso In addition, all three failed to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso proteins when both zzso and zzso proteins were zzso Since most of the zzso reported for zzso thus far are associated with regions that zzso the DNA binding zzso of zzso our results strongly suggest that the deafness in zzso patients is largely due to the zzso function of zzso
