A zzso zzso isolated from the marine zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso The zzso sequence analysis, performed until zzso number 56, shows a high similarity with the zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identify the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso studies on zzso clusters show that a fast zzso electron transfer, promoted by zzso takes place between the zzso and the glassy carbon zzso Square wave zzso studies gave access to the zzso of a zzso center formed within the zzso zzso The zzso cluster exhibited two reduction zzso at zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso and the zzso cluster was characterized by an unusually low reduction potential of zzso zzso 10 zzso at pH zzso
