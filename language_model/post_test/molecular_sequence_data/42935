We have zzso the function of sequences in the zzso region of the promoter of zzso a class II gene of the Major zzso zzso We find that the zzso promoter contains an zzso element with a strong influence on zzso We also find that the zzso promoter does contain a bona fide zzso box, which can be recognized by the zzso binding protein zzso and that zzso is required for zzso zzso For activity, zzso must be included within a larger zzso complex, as zzso zzso in a heat-treated extract can be restored by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso motif can be eliminated without significantly affecting either the efficiency or the zzso of zzso This suggests that zzso even in this zzso promoter, is held in place by other components of the initiation complex, regardless of its affinity for the underlying zzso
