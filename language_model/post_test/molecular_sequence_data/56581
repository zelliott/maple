The zzso and the zzso fusion genes result from the zzso and the zzso respectively, and zzso zzso which are thought to play an important role in the development of acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso associated with adverse zzso The use of the zzso chain reaction zzso for the detection of these genetic zzso may offer advantages over zzso techniques which are often unsatisfactory in patients with ALL and, zzso provide a useful tool for monitoring of residual zzso However, it has not yet been evaluated whether the employment of zzso at the time of diagnosis improves the detection rate of these clinically relevant genetic zzso We have developed a zzso protocol which zzso the detection of each of the four zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a single zzso This protocol was used for the evaluation of bone-marrow or blood samples from 251 children with ALL in whom zzso analyses had been zzso Of the 251 patients, 221 had a zzso precursor zzso In this group, 21 patients zzso carrying the zzso zzso and three patients zzso with zzso transcripts were detected by zzso Twelve of these cases had escaped the detection by conventional zzso zzso In two of 12 patients with a typical zzso no zzso transcripts were identified by zzso thus suggesting the presence of different molecular zzso zzso zzso cells were detected by zzso in five of eight patients who were followed during complete clinical zzso The frontline use of zzso has an important impact on the timely diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, and monitoring of high-risk patients with zzso precursor leukemia who carry the zzso or zzso fusion zzso
