The major zzso activity in extracts of zzso zzso from the southern corn zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso that prefers zzso containing an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso indicated that the artificial zzso zzso corn zzso zzso and zzso western corn zzso zzso zzso zzso possess a single major zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso and several minor zzso Similar zzso activity pH profiles were exhibited by zzso and zzso zzso with the optimal activity being slightly zzso zzso larvae reared on corn roots exhibited significantly less zzso activity than those reared on the artificial zzso zzso zzso activity from zzso was most sensitive to zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activity was particularly sensitive to zzso by a commercial protein preparation from potato zzso zzso One of the zzso potato zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso by zzso zzso was the major source of zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were of comparable potency as zzso of southern corn zzso zzso activity zzso zzso and zzso zzso and substantially more effective than chicken egg white zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into the diet of zzso larvae in feeding trials resulted in a significant increase in mortality and growth zzso We suggest that expression of zzso such as zzso by transgenic corn plants in the field is a potentially attractive method of host plant resistance to these zzso zzso
