The zzso zzso Vaillant, 1863 includes zzso of uncertain zzso affinities and with poorly defined life zzso We previously documented 11 cases of zzso zzso in dogs zzso zzso zzso in western North America caused by zzso of zzso zzso In the current study, DNA sequences were obtained from zzso collected from these dogs zzso zzso 10), as well as zzso from dogs zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso representing laboratory zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and these data were analyzed zzso Two nuclear genetic zzso zzso zzso DNA and the second zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso data recovered a zzso group composed of all samples of zzso zzso distinct from closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso 1941 and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the ITS 2 data resolved 3 zzso within zzso Two zzso from dogs formed a zzso zzso a second zzso was represented by zzso zzso and a third zzso included all other zzso zzso of these data from an zzso perspective identified 6 evolutionary zzso We also assessed whether zzso from dogs zzso zzso 4) are capable of asexual proliferation in laboratory zzso One zzso and 2 zzso zzso from dogs proliferated zzso Further investigation is warranted to determine which of the lineages represent distinct species and to determine the life history strategies of zzso zzso
