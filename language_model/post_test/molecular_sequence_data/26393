The major zzso complex zzso class II zzso consists of zzso associated alpha and beta zzso In zzso studied so far, the class II zzso can be divided into a number of regions, each containing one or more zzso genes (A zzso and zzso genes (B zzso and it has been known for some time that zzso relationships exist between genes in corresponding regions from different zzso zzso A zzso analysis of DNA sequences of class II A and B genes confirmed these zzso but no such zzso relationship was observed between the B genes of zzso and those of zzso Thus, the class II regions have zzso since the separation of birds and zzso zzso 300 zzso but before the radiation of the zzso zzso orders zzso zzso zzso of the zzso trees for A and B genes revealed an unexpected characteristic of zzso zzso zzso genes are most closely related to zzso zzso whereas zzso chain genes are most closely related to zzso zzso Thus, the zzso region seems to have originated through a zzso event which brought together a zzso gene and a zzso gene (perhaps approximately 120 zzso The zzso untranslated region of all class II genes includes sequences which are believed to be important in regulating class II gene expression but which are not zzso in known zzso These sequences are zzso to an extraordinary degree in the human zzso gene and its mouse zzso A beta 1, suggesting that regulation of expression of this locus may play a key role in expression of the entire class II zzso
