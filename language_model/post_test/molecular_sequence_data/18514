The detection of zzso zzso is difficult when in a sample in which a specific zzso represents an overwhelming majority using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso A modified zzso at Lower zzso temperature zzso zzso method was developed to detect zzso zzso using a zzso zzso probe to inhibit the amplification of the sequence of a major zzso Combining the zzso and downstream application zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and next-generation sequencing zzso zzso zzso were detected more zzso even when a specific zzso represents an overwhelming majority of the zzso We demonstrated that zzso enabled us to detect zzso zzso in a model sample zzso with 10,000 times as many zzso zzso When zzso was applied in the zzso analysis of a zzso white wine, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were not detected by conventional zzso were zzso According to the zzso analysis after zzso of a zzso red wine, the detection ratio of zzso was decreased dramatically, and the detection ratios of other zzso and the numbers of zzso detected were increased compared with the conventional zzso Thus, the application of zzso will reveal comprehensive zzso of fermented foods, zzso and so zzso
