Several members of the zzso gene family have been shown to cause zzso tumors in zzso Using zzso primer zzso chain reaction zzso on human zzso DNA, and specific zzso of zzso libraries, we have isolated a zzso gene which has not previously been described in zzso The gene is the human zzso of mouse zzso recently shown to be one of the zzso cooperating with zzso in the development of mouse zzso zzso virus zzso induced mouse zzso zzso The human zzso sequence was zzso and zzso identical to the zzso gene at zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso zzso FISH mapping zzso the gene to zzso a zzso region frequently rearranged in human zzso and also containing the zzso zzso In normal and benign zzso of human breast zzso zzso expression was not detected by zzso protection zzso but was found at low levels in zzso zzso In contrast, using both methods, zzso expression was found to be elevated in 3 of 50 primary breast zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso expressing the highest levels of zzso showed no amplification or zzso of the zzso The zzso gene was also expressed in some cancer and non zzso breast cell zzso These findings suggest that the zzso gene may be involved in human breast cancer, and show that there is differential expression of the zzso gene in benign and zzso zzso
