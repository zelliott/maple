zzso groups of isolated zzso proteins from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complexes were partially zzso with zzso zzso zzso fragments protected by the proteins were separated by gel zzso and subjected to sequence zzso zzso containing proteins zzso and zzso protected an zzso region zzso zzso 29 to 32, part of zzso 41, and zzso 42 and 43 of the zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso of protein zzso had no zzso When compared with previous data for proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso these results suggest that zzso interacts with zzso 33, and that zzso and zzso together interact with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing proteins zzso zzso and zzso protected zzso 7 to 10 as well as the zzso binding zzso zzso 20, 22 and parts of zzso 21 and zzso When protein zzso was zzso zzso and zzso showed protection of part of zzso 44 in addition to the latter zzso The results are discussed in terms of our model for the detailed arrangement of proteins and zzso in the zzso zzso
