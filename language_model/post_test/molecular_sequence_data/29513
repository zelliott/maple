A new human zzso zzso family zzso has recently been identified from human zzso zzso that was identical to the zzso zzso clone isolated from a human zzso zzso library with an zzso zzso zzso We investigated pol fragments of the zzso family from the Old World monkeys zzso zzso African green zzso and zzso and analyzed these with the zzso zzso Fifteen pol fragments of the zzso family were detected from the Old World zzso They showed a high degree of sequence similarity zzso with that of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of pol fragments with those of the human zzso zzso showed five groups, indicating that zzso family could be amplified at least five times after the original integration into the monkey zzso or represent integration events independently during zzso zzso
