The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso which is subject to oxygen zzso Evidence is presented here, that the repression of zzso expression is dependent upon zzso and the zzso zzso The promoter region of the zzso gene was isolated, zzso and deletion analysis was performed using zzso as a reporter gene to determine the zzso regions responsible for the regulation of zzso zzso The results of the deletion analysis show that the negative control of the zzso gene by oxygen and zzso factor is zzso by an upstream repression sequence consisting of a zzso segment adjacent to the consensus elements that are present in the zzso zzso regions of several other zzso zzso An additional upstream zzso site was located within the zzso promoter which, however, is not related either to oxygen or to zzso zzso The data presented here delineate the main cellular factors and DNA sequences involved in the regulatory mechanism by which an essential function for zzso cells growth, zzso zzso is zzso In addition, they show that the zzso gene belongs to the family of zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso regulated by oxygen and zzso
