In the search for novel zzso in zzso zzso fluid zzso using smooth muscle zzso activity as a response zzso a substance with a marked activity was isolated in a pure zzso By zzso acid analysis and sequential study, this substance has been chemically revealed to be zzso zzso A much smaller amount of additional activity was isolated and found to be zzso II, as determined by zzso zzso for zzso I and II confirmed that the amount of zzso I determined was much greater than that of zzso zzso A comparative study of the zzso however, indicated a large amount of zzso I had been generated from zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso fluid which could be activated during extraction and zzso at a low zzso These findings are consistent with the previous reports that described a high concentration of zzso in the zzso fluid, acid zzso of zzso to zzso and the subsequent generation of zzso I from zzso zzso
