A new zzso fluorescent zzso analog has been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso is zzso by 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, with an initial loss of zzso activity followed by a slow total zzso The rate zzso for both zzso exhibit zzso dependence on zzso zzso consistent with zzso formation of an zzso complex zzso zzso 133 zzso prior to irreversible zzso Loss of activity is prevented by zzso The best protection against zzso is provided by zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the reaction occurs in the region of the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanies zzso zzso by 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso in 80 zzso However, in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is incorporated when the zzso is only zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso with two groups on the zzso one of which is at or near the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso with related zzso zzso lacking a zzso or a zzso group suggests that the zzso group, but not the zzso is essential for zzso The zzso form of the zzso group resembles zzso and probably directs the zzso to the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso prepared by zzso zzso zzso with 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso zzso and zzso was reduced with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso peptides were isolated by zzso on zzso followed by reverse phase high pressure liquid zzso Two radioactive peptides were zzso zzso and zzso Only the zzso was modified in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso when the zzso retained most of its zzso zzso is thus designated the zzso modified zzso while modification of zzso near the active site of zzso zzso is responsible for loss of zzso zzso The observed zzso zzso of zzso are due to the zzso cooperative reaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso The new compound, zzso zzso zzso may have general application as an affinity label of zzso and zzso sites in other zzso
