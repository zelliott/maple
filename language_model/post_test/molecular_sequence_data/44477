zzso zzso P zzso zzso an zzso involved in zzso zzso is a zzso containing a zzso zzso The secondary structure of this zzso is zzso and a zzso model of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso complex has been proposed based on zzso zzso and zzso comparative data zzso ME et zzso 1994 zzso J zzso However, several zzso of that model were poorly constrained by the available zzso In the present analysis, additional constraints between elements within the zzso coli zzso P zzso complex were determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were used to position an zzso zzso zzso agent specifically at strategic sites within the zzso zzso zzso sites were mapped by primer extension and confirmed by analysis of the mobility of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso gels relative to circular and linear zzso zzso zzso species generally retained significant zzso activity, indicating that the results reflect the native zzso zzso The zzso results support the general zzso of the structure model and zzso new positions and zzso for zzso that were previously poorly constrained by the data zzso The expanded library of zzso constraints was used, together with secondary and zzso structure identified by zzso sequence zzso to refine significantly the model of zzso P zzso with bound zzso zzso The zzso results and data from zzso and zzso studies are discussed in the context of the current structural perspective on this zzso
