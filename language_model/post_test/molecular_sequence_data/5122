The zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso antibiotics such as zzso but zzso third generation zzso antibiotics zzso zzso zzso that zzso elevated levels of resistance to the zzso zzso were identified in a set of zzso derivatives previously generated by zzso scanning zzso in which a variable zzso acid cassette was introduced randomly in the target zzso This zzso procedure was also modified to allow the direct selection of zzso zzso with zzso insertions that zzso extended zzso zzso All insertions associated with enhanced resistance to zzso were zzso to the zzso acid zzso region, which forms part of the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso However, zzso insertions in the zzso and zzso halves of this region had different effects on the ability of the zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso insertions that increased the length of the zzso by up to zzso also retained zzso activity toward zzso and/or zzso in zzso In zzso with previous substitution zzso studies, these results emphasize the extreme flexibility of the zzso with regards the primary structure requirements for zzso zzso by zzso The potential of zzso scanning zzso in mimicking evolution events that result from the zzso and zzso of zzso in nature is zzso
