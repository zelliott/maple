zzso zzso is an important human zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been implicated as a zzso zzso To better understand the assembly of LOS in zzso zzso zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso which zzso the zzso and zzso II zzso zzso This cloning was accomplished by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These deep rough zzso are zzso susceptible until zzso with the appropriate zzso In this manner, we are able to use zzso resistance to select for specific zzso LOS inner core zzso zzso Such a screening system yielded a zzso with a zzso zzso This zzso was able to complement both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso strains appeared identical to the zzso zzso zzso The genes zzso the zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso were zzso and found to be similar to the analogous genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso of 35 zzso and the zzso encodes a protein of 39 zzso as demonstrated by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which demonstrated truncated LOS consistent with inner core zzso zzso were constructed in the zzso strain zzso zzso extension analysis demonstrated the presence of a strong promoter upstream of zzso but suggested only a very weak promoter upstream of zzso zzso studies, however, suggest that the zzso gene does have an independent zzso Mass zzso analysis shows that the LOS molecules expressed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains have identical molecular zzso Additional studies verified that in the zzso zzso strain, zzso is added to the LOS zzso in place of the usual zzso Finally, the genetic organizations of the inner core zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso coli, and several strains of zzso zzso were zzso and substantial differences were zzso
