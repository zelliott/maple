zzso studies of zzso class II molecules have been focused almost exclusively on the highly zzso zzso zzso In this study the complete zzso sequence of four zzso of the zzso lineage zzso zzso are reported for the first zzso The zzso and zzso sequences were shown to be identical to the previously determined zzso zzso also of the zzso group, in zzso 1, 3, 4, 5 and zzso zzso and zzso were identical to zzso in zzso 1, 4, 5 and 6 sequences while they showed specific features within their zzso 3 zzso Both zzso showed a synonymous substitution at the third base of zzso zzso However, zzso also has a zzso substitution at the first base of zzso 112 which results in a zzso to zzso zzso This is a novel substitution as zzso 112 is zzso in all known zzso class II B zzso
