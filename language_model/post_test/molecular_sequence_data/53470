Thor has been identified as a new type of gene involved in zzso host immune zzso Thor is a member of the zzso protein zzso family, which in zzso has been defined as critical regulators in a zzso that controls initiation of translation through binding zzso initiation factor zzso zzso Without an infection, Thor is expressed during all zzso stages and transcripts zzso to a wide variety of zzso including the zzso zzso In response to bacterial infection and, to a lesser extent, by zzso Thor is zzso The Thor promoter has the zzso zzso and associated zzso recognition sequences that have been shown to be essential for immune zzso as well as other sequences commonly found for zzso immune response zzso including zzso regulatory zzso In survival tests, Thor zzso show symptoms of being immune compromised, indicating that Thor may be critical in host zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso is not induced by bacterial zzso These findings for Thor provide the first evidence that a zzso family member has a role in immune induction in any zzso Further, no gene in the translation initiation zzso that includes zzso has been previously found to be immune zzso Our results suggest either a role for zzso regulation in zzso immunity or a new, zzso function for zzso type zzso
