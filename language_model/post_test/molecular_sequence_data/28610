zzso and zzso usage has been studied extensively with a variety of zzso B human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso function are remarkably consistent, with a region critical for fusion and entry located in the zzso zzso domain zzso In particular, zzso charged zzso acids and zzso zzso in the zzso are essential for zzso binding to zzso The same types of zzso are important for zzso viral fusion and entry, but they are dispersed throughout the zzso zzso of zzso and their usage is isolate zzso Here, we report on the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso function for a panel of zzso B zzso that are responsible for the majority of new zzso infections zzso zzso with zzso B zzso zzso usage remains isolate dependent and is determined by the overall content of zzso charged and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso that are important for fusion and entry of zzso B zzso are also important for the entry of all zzso B zzso zzso that we zzso Surprisingly, we found that in contrast to zzso B zzso a cluster of zzso in the second zzso loop of zzso significantly affects fusion and entry of all zzso B zzso zzso This points to a different mechanism of zzso usage by these viruses and may have important implications for the development of zzso zzso that target zzso zzso zzso
