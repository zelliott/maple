The zzso family of zzso and avian zzso type I membrane zzso features short, zzso zzso tails that possess zzso targeting zzso The sequences of the adjacent zzso zzso are also highly zzso with six zzso acids identical in all zzso known zzso zzso These six zzso are found along one side of a hypothetical zzso that may comprise this zzso We zzso or deleted some of the zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso and zzso expressed the proteins in Chinese zzso zzso zzso We examined various properties and transport characteristics of the normal and modified proteins and concluded that the zzso domain serves as more than just a membrane anchor, as it subtly influences the cellular distribution of the protein as zzso
