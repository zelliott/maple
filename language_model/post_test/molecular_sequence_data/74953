The zzso zzso gene has been cloned zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso The gene is located about 8 zzso pairs from zzso and is present as a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso result in a requirement for zzso and zzso (or zzso for growth and a lack of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso predicts an zzso zzso zzso acids long that shows zzso to the three zzso coli zzso indicating that it is the structural gene for zzso zzso An approximately zzso pair zzso is transcribed from the zzso zzso initiating at several start sites, 80 and 70 base pairs zzso respectively, from two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso boxes is a single zzso zzso This sequence has been shown to be essential for regulation of several genes that zzso zzso acid zzso zzso by the general control zzso However, no increase in zzso zzso is observed under general control zzso zzso
