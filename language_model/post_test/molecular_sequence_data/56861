zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso involved in the control of iron supply to the cell through the binding of zzso the major zzso zzso This zzso plays a key role in the control of cell proliferation because iron is essential for sustaining zzso zzso activity, and is the only zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso Furthermore, zzso is zzso in several zzso The synthesis of the zzso is controlled through an zzso negative feedback in cells where the zzso is involved in the control of cell zzso but through a positive feedback in cell types involved in iron storage zzso Recent studies have shed light on the molecular basis by which iron regulates zzso zzso Thus, the 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso element, termed the zzso element zzso that interacts with an zzso protein zzso The zzso interaction between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso leads to repression of zzso degradation and thus to higher synthesis of zzso zzso the study of zzso activity will zzso the mechanisms that zzso zzso expression in normal and zzso zzso
