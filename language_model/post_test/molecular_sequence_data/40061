The zzso zzso proteins mediate a variety of interactions between the zzso zzso zzso and its human zzso These interactions are thought to be of central importance in both the zzso colonization of the zzso and the sporadic occurrence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of a limited number of zzso protein zzso have been zzso but the high level of zzso acid sequence diversity among zzso has complicated the assignment of specific roles to individual zzso zzso or combinations of zzso In addition, the distribution of zzso protein zzso among diverse zzso information that is potentially zzso for studies of zzso function, is poorly zzso A systematic survey of the genetic diversity in the four zzso gene zzso in each of 77 zzso zzso was zzso These zzso were representative of the seven zzso zzso zzso complexes that caused the majority of zzso disease over the last 50 zzso zzso with previous studies, a high level of sequence diversity was observed among the zzso genes and the proteins that they zzso however, particular sets of zzso protein zzso were consistently associated with each of the zzso complexes over time periods often spanning decades and during global zzso These observations were consistent with the zzso that particular combinations of zzso proteins zzso fitness advantages to individual zzso complexes and have implications for studies of zzso function and the inclusion of zzso proteins in novel zzso zzso
