We have isolated and characterized in zzso zzso of the zzso disease agent zzso zzso that are resistant to zzso zzso zzso or zzso antibiotics that target the small zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance to zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso resistance to zzso Two zzso were identified in the gene for zzso protein zzso at a site zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso in zzso selected in zzso zzso at zzso 88, zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance and zzso resistance, respectively, to zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso resistance, appeared in a population of zzso zzso parental strain zzso at a high frequency of 6 zzso zzso These zzso zzso successfully zzso with the zzso strain during 100 generations of zzso in zzso The zzso zzso appeared at a frequency of 3 zzso zzso to 1 zzso in a population and were unable to compete with zzso strain zzso after 100 zzso This is the first description of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that zzso resistance to zzso These results have implications for the evolution of zzso resistance, because the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance have no significant fitness cost in zzso and for the development of new zzso zzso
