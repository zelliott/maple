zzso is a major zzso that plays an important role in the degradation, processing, and zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso This zzso zzso zzso uses zzso zzso and zzso zzso for degradation and zzso activities, zzso Its structure and activities are similar to the zzso zzso zzso The human zzso was recently localized to the zzso space zzso of the zzso and is, therefore, most likely not directly involved in zzso zzso unlike in bacteria and other zzso In this work, the degradation, zzso and zzso properties of the human zzso were analyzed and compared to its bacterial and zzso zzso zzso activity was displayed at lower optimum zzso of zzso zzso Also, the zzso properties to zzso varied significantly from those of its bacterial and zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not zzso bind zzso harboring a zzso tail at the 3' end, compared to a zzso lacking this zzso Several zzso zzso at zzso zzso acid positions either eliminated or modified zzso activity in different manners than observed for the zzso coli zzso and the zzso and human zzso In light of these results, a possible function of the human zzso in the zzso IMS is zzso
