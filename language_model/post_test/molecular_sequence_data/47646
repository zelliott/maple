zzso zzso zzso in soybean are hypothesized to function in nitrogen storage and zzso zzso zzso for four of the five known zzso zzso were used to investigate the influence of zzso status on protein levels, as well as to analyze the tissue and zzso zzso of the different zzso zzso responded most strongly to sink zzso although the levels of zzso B and C increased as zzso After sink zzso zzso and the zzso storage zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso of bundle sheath and zzso zzso cells, while zzso B and C localized to the zzso of these zzso All five known zzso zzso were active with both zzso and zzso acid zzso after expression in zzso zzso The strong zzso of zzso levels after sink limitation as well as the zzso of this zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso and bundle sheath cells (where zzso are zzso strongly suggest that zzso should be considered as a major storage protein in soybean zzso Furthermore, since zzso B and C also accumulate in zzso soybean leaves, are located in the zzso of zzso zzso cells and are active at pH values typically found in this zzso their activities may well contribute to zzso metabolism in this zzso This zzso family is thus zzso poised to play a pivotal role in the balance of N deposition relative to zzso storage, defense or zzso by modulating contributions to these processes in the transient storage cells of the zzso zzso
