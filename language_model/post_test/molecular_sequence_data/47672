We identified an zzso acid zzso that is associated with the zzso type II membrane zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 1) from rat kidney was found to be structurally related to recently identified zzso acid zzso for system zzso system zzso and system zzso which are linked, via a zzso bond, to the other type II membrane zzso zzso zzso heavy zzso In the zzso condition, a zzso band, which seems to zzso to the zzso complex of zzso and zzso was detected in rat kidney with zzso zzso The band was shifted to 41 zzso in the reducing condition, confirming that zzso and zzso are linked via a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins were shown to be zzso in the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso zzso where massive zzso transport had been zzso When expressed in zzso cells with zzso but not with zzso zzso exhibited a zzso transport of zzso as well as basic and neutral zzso acids with the properties of system zzso The results from the present investigation were used to establish a family of zzso acid zzso associated with type II membrane zzso
