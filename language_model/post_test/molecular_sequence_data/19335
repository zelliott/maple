Two bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from biological soil zzso zzso collected in the Colorado zzso zzso Both strains were zzso zzso zzso rods and produced abundant zzso They contained zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso as the zzso cellular fatty zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso Based on the above zzso the zzso were assigned to the family zzso 16 zzso gene signature zzso placed them within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had a zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso % with each other and zzso % sequence similarity with other species in the zzso indicating that they represent two separate, and possibly novel, zzso The closest species to strains zzso and zzso were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso % gene sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, strain zzso exhibited a zzso zzso of only zzso % with the type strain of zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso between strain zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso was only 18 zzso zzso characterization supported this low zzso On the basis of this evidence, we propose that the new strains represent two novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso (with type strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (with type strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
