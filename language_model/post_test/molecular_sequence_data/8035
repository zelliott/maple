zzso zzso is known to act in peripheral zzso to produce pain and zzso yet the mechanisms underlying zzso inflammation have not been well zzso The present study uses a rat knee joint model of inflammation zzso plasma zzso and molecular biological techniques to determine the site of action of zzso and the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso (1 zzso stimulates zzso plasma zzso zzso above zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso depletion by zzso zzso dramatically reduces zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that sympathetic zzso mediate this zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso are present in zzso sympathetic zzso With selective zzso for these zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso plasma zzso is zzso via the zzso zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso zzso in various zzso inflammatory pain zzso
