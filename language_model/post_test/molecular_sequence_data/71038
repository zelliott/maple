zzso zzso zzso I was zzso in zzso coli zzso using a gene zzso from zzso associated with high-level expression in zzso zzso The synthetic gene has extensive changes in zzso usage zzso of 77 total zzso relative to that of the originally zzso plant gene zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1987, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After expression of the new synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained in yields of up to 70 zzso zzso of culture zzso compared to approximately zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso obtained from the gene composed of predicted spinach zzso In either shaken flask or zzso culture, approximately zzso conversion to zzso or zzso was obtained regardless of the level of protein zzso However, zzso of zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso during zzso and dissolved zzso zzso routinely yielded greater than zzso conversion to zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso terminal Met was efficiently removed, but only if the bacterial cell zzso were prepared in the absence of zzso This observation is consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso by removal of zzso essential zzso and introduces the importance of considering the zzso properties of host zzso providing ad hoc zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso was shown to be indistinguishable from zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso and zzso In zzso these studies provide a coordinated scheme to produce and characterize quantities of zzso sufficient to support expanded zzso and structural zzso
