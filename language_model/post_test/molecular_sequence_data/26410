zzso rapid measurement of zzso zzso zzso binding to DNA was accomplished in zzso zzso treated so that zzso complexes or DNA bound in preference to free zzso zzso of zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso incubated to equilibrium in zzso tubes, were transferred to zzso zzso previously treated with zzso followed by zzso After binding of the DNA or zzso complex to the treated wells, free zzso was removed by zzso zzso retained in each well was measured by placing individual zzso from zzso zzso plates directly in zzso zzso zzso of DNA was zzso and zzso complex binding was complete within 2 h at 4 zzso The use of zzso DNA and zzso allowed zzso determination of zzso bound to zzso The amount of zzso specifically bound to a consensus zzso element zzso containing the zzso repeat zzso was determined by comparing zzso bound to zzso containing or lacking the zzso At zzso zzso of zzso plasmids bearing one, two, and four zzso in tandem bound approximately one, two, and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso binding data revealed a zzso of zzso zzso for specific zzso binding to a single zzso zzso Thus, the zzso detects zzso retaining both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with DNA in the well was also detected using a zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso modifications of this method would allow study of other zzso zzso
