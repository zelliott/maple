Human zzso zzso initially cloned as an zzso factor, has a key role in many inflammatory zzso We have previously developed a high production system for correctly folded active zzso zzso leading to the revelation of the zzso and the zzso binding zzso These findings can strongly indicate the experimental and medical applications of zzso however, the zzso protein is prone to be zzso forming zzso Recently, therapeutic approaches using zzso zzso have shown the effectiveness for treatment of zzso indicating the necessity of a more stable protein for therapy with zzso zzso Here we have generated a highly stable zzso with replacement of zzso by zzso based on the zzso structure and the binding zzso retaining the biological zzso Similar rational designs can be applied to develop new therapeutic molecules of other zzso
