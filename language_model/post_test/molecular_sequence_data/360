The human Sex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located at zzso zzso at least, two different zzso units regulated by two different zzso The first zzso unit begins with the zzso 1 sequence and is responsible for the production of plasma zzso by the zzso while the second begins with an alternative zzso 1 zzso which replaces the zzso 1 present in liver zzso Alternative zzso 1 zzso and translation has only been demonstrated in the zzso of transgenic mice containing an zzso human zzso zzso and in the human zzso Our goal has been to further characterize the zzso end of the zzso gene and analyze the presence of the zzso alternative transcripts in human prostate tissue and derived cell zzso 

Using a combination of in zzso and in zzso studies, we have demonstrated that the zzso zzso along with zzso 1 and alternative zzso 1 zzso here zzso zzso contains four additional alternative first zzso the novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a previously identified zzso zzso which has been further characterized and renamed as zzso zzso We have shown that these four alternative first zzso are all spliced to the same 3' zzso site of zzso zzso 2, and that zzso zzso and the novel zzso zzso can be spliced to zzso zzso We have also demonstrated the presence of zzso transcripts beginning with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in prostate zzso and cell lines, as well as in several zzso cell zzso Finally, the alignment of the zzso zzso sequences revealed that, while zzso zzso zzso and zzso are very well zzso zzso through zzso zzso species, zzso zzso probably aroused in apes due to a single zzso change that generated a new zzso zzso site in zzso zzso 

The identification of multiple zzso start sites zzso upstream of the zzso first zzso of human zzso and the detection of the alternative transcripts in human zzso zzso with the prediction of the zzso zzso of DNA zzso project, and suggest that the regulation of zzso is much more complex than previously zzso
