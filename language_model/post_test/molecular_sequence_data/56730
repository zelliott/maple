The zzso zzso rat zzso tumor cell line, zzso expresses high affinity receptors for both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells, an action which is antagonized by zzso This in zzso model was used to examine the mechanism of action of two synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to the zzso zzso zzso with lower affinity than does zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso 29; 211 zzso 107 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were equally effective as zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso and zzso also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso production, zzso P zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso and zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso cells with zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso affects the apparent affinity of zzso for its specific receptors on zzso zzso thus, the zzso action of zzso and zzso appears to be zzso at the locus of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso slightly, but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin did not zzso zzso affects on zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso cells with zzso decreased the apparent affinity of receptors for zzso suggesting that effects of zzso are attributable to interference with zzso binding rather than zzso at the zzso zzso zzso
