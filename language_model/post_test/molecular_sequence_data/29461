zzso zzso with activated zzso zzso most often are associated exclusively with only one zzso zzso For example, only zzso zzso is associated with rat zzso zzso The mechanism underlying this specificity is mostly zzso We have shown previously that this tissue specificity of Ras zzso is defined by the Ras protein itself and not by differential gene expression among Ras family zzso Here we show that elements in the known zzso in the zzso region of Ras zzso acids zzso interact in part to control this zzso zzso In addition, these in zzso zzso studies for the first time identify zzso in the mostly zzso region of Ras zzso acids zzso that strongly influence the zzso zzso of zzso
