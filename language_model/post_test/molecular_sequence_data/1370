We have demonstrated previously that new blood vessel formation induced by zzso growth factors in zzso placed on the zzso membrane zzso of the chick zzso is critically dependent on the zzso of zzso collagen by a previously unidentified zzso zzso In the present study we have used a quantitative zzso zzso system to search for and functionally characterize host avian zzso responsible for the collagen zzso associated with zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso identified in the zzso zzso zzso the chicken zzso zzso was the only zzso whose induction and expression coincided with the onset of zzso and blood vessel zzso The zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso The zzso protein has been zzso characterized in zzso and examined in zzso in the zzso zzso cells appear in the zzso shortly after zzso stimulation and then accumulate in the collagen zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells appear as zzso cells of zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso is rapidly and efficiently activated through the zzso zzso zzso cascade into a zzso capable of zzso native but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso levels of zzso zzso elicit an zzso response in the zzso zzso comparable with that induced by the zzso growth zzso The zzso response was efficiently blocked by select zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso can function as an zzso factor in zzso Altogether, the results of this study extend the zzso role of zzso previously associated with zzso zzso to the collagen zzso involved in the zzso zzso
