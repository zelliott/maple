zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso process in which four zzso spores are generated inside a zzso zzso zzso a zzso targeting zzso of protein zzso type 1, together with its zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso along the extending zzso membrane and is required for zzso organization and spore wall zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso promotes these events is zzso We show here that zzso a zzso zzso zzso has a functional relationship to zzso zzso zzso of zzso partially suppresses the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso interacts with zzso in a zzso zzso and this interaction is required for zzso zzso zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso with zzso and zzso along the extending zzso membrane during spore zzso zzso is partially defective in zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso structures are zzso and zzso membrane extension is zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso functions with the zzso zzso to promote proper zzso organization and zzso membrane zzso
