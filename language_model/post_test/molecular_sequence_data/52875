We describe the disruption and basic zzso analysis of six open reading frames zzso of unknown function located in the left arm of zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were made using the short zzso zzso zzso replacement strategy in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso was performed, as well as zzso analysis of the corresponding deleted zzso zzso No obvious zzso could be attributed to the strains deleted in any of the genes zzso zzso and zzso under the conditions zzso zzso was shown to be an essential zzso zzso bearing a deletion in zzso grew slowly in complete zzso medium at 37 degrees zzso zzso deleted in zzso showed abnormal zzso and reduced mating efficiency, but these zzso were observed only when the zzso disruption was in a zzso zzso zzso protein was found to zzso to the zzso
