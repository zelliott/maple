The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso from rabbit liver was zzso The sequence was obtained from analysis of peptides isolated from zzso zzso zzso and limited acid zzso of the zzso The zzso consists of four identical zzso each of 475 zzso zzso 8 zzso shorter than the zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso The sequences of the two rabbit proteins are easily zzso provided a gap of 5 zzso near the zzso zzso and a gap of 3 zzso near the zzso zzso are included in the zzso zzso The overall degree of identity between the two zzso is zzso whereas the structural identity of each zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso coli zzso is about zzso The rabbit zzso are about 70 zzso longer than the zzso coli zzso with one-half of these zzso accounted for by insertions in both zzso near their zzso zzso zzso of secondary structure and calculations of zzso profiles are also zzso suggesting an even more extensive degree of identity in the three-dimensional folding of the three zzso in zzso with the known similarity of their zzso zzso Evidence was obtained for the existence of additional molecular forms of the zzso zzso differing in the absence of some zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
