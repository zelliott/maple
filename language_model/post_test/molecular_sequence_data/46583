zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso and 33 sequences of zzso zzso zzso representing the three zzso of life were multiply aligned and a zzso tree was zzso from this multiple zzso The global zzso of the composite rooted tree (each zzso family being used as an zzso to root the other one) suggests that zzso genes are derived from zzso ancestral genes which were already of the same size and argues against a mechanism of fusion of independent zzso A closer observation of the detailed zzso shows that this tree could not be used to assess the actual order of zzso zzso Indeed, this tree displays a complex zzso for many zzso zzso with zzso for zzso in both zzso trees and for the zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, representatives of the two zzso zzso are found to be zzso in various combinations in both zzso zzso This complexity may be explained by assuming the occurrence of two zzso in the zzso tree zzso alpha and zzso zzso and two other ones in the zzso tree zzso I and zzso zzso These zzso could have arisen from zzso and selective losses of some differentiated copies during the successive zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso share a common zzso in which the ancestral copies giving the zzso zzso zzso beta combinations were present, whereas zzso comprise two zzso one containing the zzso zzso alpha combination and the other harboring the zzso zzso beta zzso Moreover, multiple horizontal gene transfers could have occurred rather recently amongst zzso zzso the actual history of zzso our data suggest that the last common zzso to all extant life possessed differentiated copies of genes coding for both zzso indicating it as a rather sophisticated zzso
