The sixth complement protein zzso is an essential component of the membrane attack complex zzso the end product of the zzso zzso of complement zzso The MAC complex constitutes a zzso assembly containing the five precursor proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Once assembled on the target surface it forms zzso channels that cause membrane damage and zzso of zzso zzso Besides zzso direct pathogen zzso exposure of cells to zzso doses of MAC can trigger diverse cellular responses such as, cell zzso induction of zzso cell cycle re-entry and proliferation in various biological zzso The terminal complement components zzso are structurally related zzso differing in size and zzso In order to study their evolution, we report here the cloning and molecular characterization of zzso component in rainbow zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of trout zzso exhibits 55 and zzso identity with zebra fish and human zzso zzso The zzso architecture of trout zzso resembles that of zzso counterparts, and the zzso backbone is also zzso Finally, trout zzso gene appears to exist as a single copy in the trout zzso and is expressed in a wide range of trout zzso
