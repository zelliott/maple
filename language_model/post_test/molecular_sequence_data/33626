zzso disease virus zzso encodes a potent regulatory protein zzso that strongly stimulates viral expression by zzso the long terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes the zzso from its own zzso as well as zzso zzso by recruiting host zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso Here, we compared the sequence requirements of zzso for zzso of zzso bovine zzso virus zzso and human zzso virus zzso zzso 

In this study, we identified the minimal protein sequence for zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso were indispensable for zzso the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso depended largely on an zzso motif and some zzso zzso Competitive zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso revealed the robust interaction of zzso with zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was largely affected by fusion protein at the zzso zzso despite the fact that the zzso zzso affinity was not zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso sequence enabled zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the flexibility at the zzso zzso 

This study showed the distinct sequence requirements of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responsible for interaction with zzso zzso and zzso response element are the key zzso for zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso may compensate for zzso of the zzso zzso based on the zzso
