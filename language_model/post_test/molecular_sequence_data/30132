The zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso are zzso assigned by a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the latter performed on zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso data show zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Within the latter two zzso there are three single zzso turns, zzso zzso and zzso In addition alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso Compared to horse or tuna zzso c and zzso zzso of zzso zzso there is a zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso data show that this zzso forms a loop, probably an omega zzso zzso zzso multiple quantum correlation experiments are used to follow zzso exchange over a period of 40 zzso As the zzso zzso are acquired in short time periods (30 zzso rates for intermediate exchanging zzso can be zzso zzso of the zzso exchange data for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the highly zzso horse heart zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25, zzso shows that this zzso is less stable in zzso zzso
