zzso zzso coli zzso with zzso of the zzso family are one of the major causes of zzso and death among zzso and young zzso zzso use the zzso zzso to adhere to specific receptors expressed on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso exist in three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of which zzso is the most zzso Resistance to zzso zzso zzso in pigs has been shown to be inherited as an zzso zzso zzso In previous studies the zzso zzso zzso locus zzso was mapped to the zzso region on pig zzso zzso A zzso within an zzso of the zzso 4 zzso zzso which is one of the possible candidate genes located in this region, was shown earlier to zzso with the zzso zzso Recently, we discovered a Large White zzso from a Swiss experimental zzso with a zzso between zzso and zzso A zzso pedigree including 45 offspring was generated with the aim to use this zzso event to refine the zzso of the zzso zzso All pigs were zzso using the microscopic zzso test and zzso for a total of 59 zzso The zzso event was mapped to a zzso region between a newly detected zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study the six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were in complete linkage zzso with zzso Based on this finding and earlier zzso we suggest that the locus for zzso is located between the zzso locus and zzso zzso
