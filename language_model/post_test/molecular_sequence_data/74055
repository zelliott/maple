Human cancer tissue zzso models may provide a more accurate reflection of tumor biology than cell zzso This study evaluates the genetic and zzso stability of primary human zzso tumors grown as serially transplanted zzso The response to conventional chemotherapy and novel molecular targeted chemotherapy is assessed in one of the zzso zzso zzso 

Fresh tumor was transplanted beneath the zzso capsule of zzso zzso zzso tumor lines were derived from 5 tumors (4 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso and serially transplanted for 2-6 zzso Comparisons were made between primary tumor and corresponding zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso created from known zzso zzso zzso carriers were analyzed for zzso response zzso volume, zzso and zzso zzso to combination zzso and to zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso zzso cluster analysis applied to a zzso feature zzso array demonstrated a low degree of zzso genetic variation in zzso cases, with greater degree of variation in the fifth case zzso cell zzso zzso derived from an zzso zzso Assessment of proliferation using zzso zzso was zzso between primary tumor and zzso zzso in all zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso zzso for further testing and this zzso showed a significant response to zzso chemotherapy, including a decrease in tumor volume and proliferation but did not demonstrate a response to the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso derived from zzso tumors can be serially transplanted and grown under zzso capsule of zzso mice with minimal genetic zzso This model may be used to study progression of tumors, identify therapeutic targets, and test treatment zzso in tumors with zzso abnormalities in genes of fundamental importance in zzso zzso such as loss of zzso
