The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a mating response induced by exposure to an zzso sex zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso in zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was found to zzso a zzso zzso precursor with the last 8 zzso of its zzso acid signal sequence representing the zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained two zzso repeats zzso zzso separated by 45 zzso The zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso encodes a zzso precursor zzso but it differs at two zzso acid positions, both of which are located within the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso Construction of a zzso of strain zzso containing the differences present in zzso resulted in cells that did not produce zzso zzso The zzso appeared normal under laboratory growth conditions, and while significantly reduced in recipient potential, when carrying zzso it exhibited a normal mating zzso A zzso of zzso with a truncated zzso zzso appeared normal with respect to recipient potential and, when carrying zzso DNA, donor zzso A gene zzso a protein designated zzso believed to be a zinc zzso had been previously identified as required for zzso zzso and was believed to be involved in the processing of a zzso zzso Our new observation that the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso whose precursor is itself a signal zzso is also dependent on zzso is consistent with the likelihood that such processing occurs at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
