zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso is controlled by a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso are controlled by separate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso is determined by the zzso zzso factors located outside the zzso are also required for expression of zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso identified in zzso and zzso and encodes a small zzso zzso protein with unknown zzso zzso Here, zzso was cloned from zzso and zzso The structural features and expression pattern of zzso zzso were very similar to those of zzso and zzso Unlike other zzso species, expression of zzso was also observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso interference zzso suppression of zzso zzso resulted in partial breakdown of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso showed that a zzso reduction is not sufficient and a zzso reduction is required to achieve partial breakdown of zzso
