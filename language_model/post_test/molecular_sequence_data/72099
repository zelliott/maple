The zzso zzso is required for the zzso transition during the cell cycle and plays a direct role in the zzso of individual origins of replication in zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of a mouse zzso zzso whose product is closely related in sequence to zzso zzso zzso as well as their human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains the zzso zzso common to all zzso zzso and three zzso zzso that are characteristic of members of the zzso protein zzso We have mapped the locus of the zzso gene to zzso 5, band zzso Conservation of structures among members of the zzso proteins suggests that these proteins play a key role in the regulation of DNA replication during the cell cycle in all zzso
