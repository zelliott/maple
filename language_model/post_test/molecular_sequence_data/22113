zzso of zzso is widespread in nature and either changes the decoding properties or restores the folding of a zzso Unlike the zzso disperse zzso zzso to zzso zzso editing, zzso zzso to zzso zzso editing has only been previously described in zzso zzso We have shown that zzso zzso zzso two distinct editing events in the zzso zzso C to U and A to zzso In zzso every zzso zzso is also C to U edited at position zzso In zzso C to U editing stimulates conversion of A to I at the zzso zzso Although the in zzso and in zzso requirements zzso in both cases, the C to U change plays a key role in A to I zzso Due to an unusual abundance of zzso zzso our results also suggest that the zzso and edited zzso are functional, each dedicated to decoding a specific zzso zzso C to U editing of zzso zzso expands the editing repertoire in zzso cells, and when coupled to A to I changes, leads to an zzso between editing zzso
