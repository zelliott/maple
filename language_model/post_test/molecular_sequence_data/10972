zzso zzso zzso protein is a zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso signal recognition particle zzso It contains three highly zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso Two of the zzso regions, zzso and zzso are essential for small zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso Honda, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso we identified a region required for zzso protein binding in zzso zzso zzso zzso of this region, which consisted of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso including a zzso sequence zzso reduced precursor binding zzso In contrast, deletions of zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso did zzso We also analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso having zzso zzso zzso zzso replaced with zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound to both zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso prevented binding to zzso binding to the precursor was not zzso zzso restored the growth of zzso zzso zzso strain in which zzso gene expression is regulated by an zzso promoter in the absence of an zzso whereas zzso did zzso These results indicate that the region including zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso to bind to zzso zzso The results also suggest that zzso is required for the complete function of the zzso zzso zzso particle in zzso although this protein is zzso capable of binding a signal zzso free from zzso
