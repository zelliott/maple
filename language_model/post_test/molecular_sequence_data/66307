zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the insect juvenile hormone and is believed to regulate growth and reproduction in zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso acid zzso to zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of two forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the shrimp zzso zzso zzso transcript has a wide tissue distribution pattern in zzso zzso and is also expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso stages and zzso Unlike zzso reported in other zzso transcripts of two different sizes were detected in zzso zzso We zzso that the wide distribution of zzso expression may be related to its role in growth and regulation of zzso To study the functions of zzso in zzso the zzso interference zzso technique was zzso zzso of double stranded zzso zzso for zzso knocked down the expression of zzso in shrimp for at least 3 days and the shrimp did not advance to the final stage of zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso and the zzso gene was zzso zzso zzso mortality of the shrimp was observed in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, control shrimp completed their zzso and proceeded to the next zzso zzso We zzso that, as an important zzso for the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso injection knocked down the expression of zzso which could potentially result in a decrease in the production of zzso and zzso could affect the zzso zzso The newly identified zzso may be involved in the control of zzso in zzso The results of this study demonstrate the potential use of the zzso interference technique to study other putative genes identified in zzso
