The zzso hormone gene zzso is responsible for zzso in males of the zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of regulation of chicken zzso expression is poorly zzso To investigate the regulation of chicken zzso zzso we have cloned zzso zzso from quail and duck as well as the promoter regions of the gene from chicken, zzso and zzso The expression patterns of zzso during embryonic development in these three species were found to be similar, suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms of zzso expression are zzso The sequence of the zzso promoter of zzso contains a putative binding site for zzso factor 1 zzso the protein product of which can zzso zzso in zzso We showed here that zzso is able to activate the chicken zzso promoter and binds to its putative zzso binding zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in regulation of zzso expression in avian zzso
