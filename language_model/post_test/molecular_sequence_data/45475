Recent progress in the analysis of protein components of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso opens a unique opportunity for understanding the molecular principles of zzso zzso In this work we identified zzso of proteins involved in the zzso DNA packaging and replication in the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of their counterparts from zzso diverse zzso species revealed zzso as well as zzso features of the zzso zzso structure and its replication zzso Moreover, it provides a basis for subsequent functional studies of the structure and dynamics of the zzso zzso
