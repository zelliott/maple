The complement system, which provides many of the zzso functions of zzso immunity and zzso is tightly regulated by various complement regulatory zzso The most common structural feature of these proteins is a motif called short consensus repeat zzso In order to identify a new human complement regulatory zzso we performed a similarity search using zzso on the expressed sequence tag zzso database and found a partial sequence of a new human zzso Using a probe containing this partial zzso we obtained a full-length zzso of this gene from a human zzso vein zzso cell zzso zzso The sequencing reaction demonstrated an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for a 461 zzso acid zzso with a deduced relative molecular mass of 51 zzso zzso analysis showed that the protein has three zzso with one zzso zzso A characteristic feature of these zzso was that they have six zzso zzso per repeat instead of the usual zzso zzso we named this zzso zzso (three zzso zzso A six zzso motif is a characteristic feature of zzso We used northern zzso analysis to show that a zzso zzso zzso transcript was zzso present in most zzso zzso and the zzso was most abundant in the zzso In conclusion, we discovered a member of a new class of zzso zzso molecules using the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso database may be useful in the search for other new zzso zzso The function of this gene remains to be zzso
