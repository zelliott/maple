Human saliva contains at least three molecular species of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have similar but distinct zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso 1 gene for zzso zzso and the zzso 2 gene for zzso zzso are highly zzso to each other and to the corresponding regions of the zzso for zzso C and the zzso zzso from the zzso C zzso Three zzso zzso in the zzso gene and the zzso zzso genes share the same gene zzso These data demonstrate that family II zzso genes are zzso related to family III zzso zzso
