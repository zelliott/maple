The crystal structure of zzso has been known for several decades, yet various features of the zzso remain unexplained or zzso Several animal zzso have properties that cannot be readily explained in terms of their zzso acid sequence and known atomic models of zzso Among these, fish zzso are well known for their widely varying interactions with zzso zzso molecules and pH zzso Some fish zzso are almost completely insensitive to pH zzso zzso zzso whereas others show extremely low oxygen affinity under acid conditions, a phenomenon called the Root zzso X-ray crystal structures of Root effect zzso have not, to date, provided convincing explanations of this zzso zzso alignments have zzso failed to pinpoint the zzso involved, and zzso zzso has not yielded a human zzso zzso with this zzso We have solved the crystal structure of tuna zzso in the zzso form at low and moderate pH and in the presence of carbon monoxide at high zzso A comparison of these models shows clear evidence for novel mechanisms of zzso control of zzso zzso
