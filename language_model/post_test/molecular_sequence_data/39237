zzso competitive zzso zzso is a method for differential zzso of zzso zzso DNA fragments between two DNA samples of interest without zzso or specific sequence zzso Here, we applied the zzso procedure to two cloned mice derived from an F1 hybrid of the zzso and zzso zzso in order to investigate the possibility of zzso zzso in the cloned mouse zzso Each of the five of the zzso zzso we detected between the two cloned mice corresponded to the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso mouse zzso Our result suggests that no severe aberration of zzso sequences occurs due to zzso cell nuclear zzso
