zzso zzso comprise an important zzso system in zzso that is involved in zzso of a variety of small zzso compounds of both zzso and zzso zzso Some evidence suggests that these zzso may function as zzso however, little is known about the domain of interaction or the mechanism of zzso In this work, evidence for a functional zzso between zzso is provided by studies on zzso forms of zzso When two inactive forms of zzso were zzso in cell culture, zzso activity was zzso indicating that zzso forms functional zzso To delineate the zzso domain, inactive fusion proteins containing the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso were generated and expressed with active zzso zzso of a fusion protein containing only the zzso half of zzso with active zzso caused a reduction in zzso zzso zzso This reduction in activity was not observed when zzso was zzso with a fusion protein containing only the zzso half of zzso strongly suggesting that the zzso domain is involved in zzso zzso of the immediate zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso was also abolished by an zzso substitution in this region of the mature zzso which is highly zzso in the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can interact through their zzso zzso to form zzso active zzso zzso mechanisms resulting in the formation and stabilization of the zzso zzso are zzso
