zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli is composed of two zzso the alpha and the beta zzso each of which contains a zzso domain, domain I and III, respectively, as well as several zzso zzso collectively zzso domain zzso The interactions between domain I from zzso zzso zzso and the intact or the zzso zzso from zzso coli was investigated using the separately expressed and zzso domain I from zzso zzso and zzso intact and zzso zzso coli zzso Despite harsh treatments with, zzso zzso and zzso agents, the alpha and beta zzso remained tightly zzso A zzso zzso directed towards the alpha zzso was strongly zzso an effect that was relieved by added zzso In addition, zzso also zzso the zzso zzso coli zzso in which domain I had been partly zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso I and III are not in permanent contact but are mobile during zzso while being anchored to domain zzso Replacement of domain I of intact, as well as zzso zzso coli zzso with zzso resulted in a markedly different pH dependence of the zzso reduction of zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso suggesting that the zzso of one or more zzso groups in domain I is controlling this zzso The reverse reaction and zzso pumping showed a less pronounced change in pH zzso demonstrating the regulatory role of domain II in these zzso
