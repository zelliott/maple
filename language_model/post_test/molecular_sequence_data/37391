The zzso life of zzso zzso starts by a complex process of entry involving several bacterial zzso and zzso zzso In this work, we identified in zzso from the sequence of the zzso of zzso zzso a previously unknown gene designated zzso (for zzso promoting zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso to zzso a zzso belonging to the zzso family and implicated in the cell adherence of zzso zzso and related zzso By constructing a zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso is deleted zzso zzso we show that the zzso protein zzso is not involved in bacterial adherence but is required for entry of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso bacteria, zzso bacteria failed to invade the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, as confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso bacteria rapidly penetrated in mouse bone zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso bacteria survive better in zzso than do zzso zzso This was correlated with a weak zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is therefore a novel zzso favoring the entry of zzso zzso into zzso zzso but not its invasion of zzso This is the first report of a zzso promoting cell invasion of an zzso zzso
