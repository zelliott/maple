The zzso of zzso leukemia virus zzso was cloned into zzso zzso expressed in fusion with zzso protein zzso and zzso to zzso after Factor zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso degradation of the fusion protein was observed during zzso which severely diminished the zzso The degree of degradation of the fusion protein was even more pronounced when a zzso form of the zzso zzso was cloned after the gene coding for zzso To increase the yield, a zzso tag with an additional Factor zzso zzso site was cloned after the zzso and zzso zzso affinity zzso was used as the first zzso zzso The modified procedure resulted in substantially higher yield as compared to the original zzso The degradation of zzso active site zzso zzso zzso was very low and comparable to that obtained with zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso alone was not able to degrade zzso zzso suggesting that during expression the active zzso zzso may activate bacterial zzso which appear to be responsible for the degradation of the fusion zzso
