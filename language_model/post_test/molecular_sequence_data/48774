zzso virus zzso a zzso zzso causes serious diseases and threatens public health in tropical and zzso areas zzso zzso interference zzso is a prevailing strategy for zzso zzso In this paper, 6 single artificial zzso zzso targeting the highly zzso regions of the zzso zzso were identified and inhibited virus replication zzso Then, effective tandem zzso targeting 2 different zzso zzso regions were constructed and expressed simultaneously from a single zzso zzso to avoid virus variation or zzso zzso Finally, the most zzso tandem zzso was embedded in a zzso zzso and inhibited zzso virus replication zzso and zzso Overall, these results indicated that zzso based on multiple zzso targeting viral zzso regions was an effective approach for improvements of zzso acid zzso of zzso and provided a new therapeutic strategy for zzso infection in zzso
