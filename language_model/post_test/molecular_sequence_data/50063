The zzso zzso activity has arisen several times from zzso We have been able to replicate the evolutionary process of zzso activity emergence on a zzso zzso Some of the most interesting changes, like zzso the zzso properties of an zzso may require several zzso in concert; therefore it is essential to explore efficiently sequence space by generating the right zzso We designed a biased zzso library in which zzso and structural information were incorporated by site directed zzso on relevant zzso and then subjected to random zzso to allow for zzso in unforeseen zzso We isolated zzso from this library zzso zzso higher zzso resistance levels than the background zzso through zzso exclusively in the coding zzso We demonstrate that only three zzso in the zzso active site, two produced by the directed and one by the random zzso are sufficient to acquire this zzso The zzso product of one zzso zzso had a zzso increase in zzso zzso rate allowing it to zzso zzso yet it has apparently zzso zzso zzso This work is the first to show a possible evolutionary intermediate between a zzso and a zzso necessary for the development of zzso zzso
