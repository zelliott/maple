The complete sequence of the zzso zzso of the giant tiger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The gene content and gene order are identical to those observed in zzso zzso The overall AT composition is lower than that observed in the known insect zzso zzso but higher than that observed in the other two crustaceans for which complete zzso sequence is zzso Analysis of the effect of zzso bias on zzso composition across the zzso reveals a trend with the crustaceans represented showing the lowest proportion of zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso zzso analysis among zzso using zzso zzso sequences provides further support for the possibility that zzso are zzso Furthermore, in contrast to data from the nuclear gene zzso the first complete sequence of a zzso zzso zzso supports the possibility that zzso are more closely related to zzso than to zzso
