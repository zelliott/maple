Aided by sensitive sequence profile searches we identify a novel zzso domain in the zzso regions of the zzso proteins typified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso domain is found as a zzso protein in several bacteria and zzso or fused to other zzso zzso such as a zzso of the restriction zzso fold and zzso DNA zzso in the zzso Based on a network of contextual connections in the form of domain zzso zzso gene neighborhoods and functional interactions we predict that the zzso domain is likely to function as a zzso domain that probably recognizes features associated with damaged DNA or stalled replication zzso It might thus act as a sensor to initiate a damaged DNA checkpoint and engage different DNA repair and zzso zzso or zzso activities to these zzso In evolutionary terms, the fusion of the zzso domain, and the functionally analogous zzso zzso and the zzso zzso to zzso zzso appears to have been a notable factor for recruiting these zzso for zzso modification and zzso in the context of DNA zzso
