The production of zzso zzso zzso is of vital importance in the formation of zzso proteins in zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso As part of studies to allow manipulation of this pathway, the gene coding for the production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step in the assembly of zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso was used to amplify a zzso zzso of the zzso which was zzso as a probe to obtain a full-length clone from a zzso library of zzso zzso This contained a zzso open reading frame zzso a highly zzso protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The gene contained two zzso sequences and putative zzso recognition sites zzso were present in the deduced zzso acid zzso zzso with other zzso zzso revealed the zzso zzso zzso to share zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso library was used to confirm the position of an zzso A complete zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso was obtained by employing a zzso zzso zzso This was used to rescue a conditional lethal zzso of zzso zzso carrying a dysfunctional zzso gene by zzso zzso confirming that the zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso are functionally zzso
