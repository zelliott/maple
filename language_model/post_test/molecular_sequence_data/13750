A bacterial artificial zzso zzso library has been constructed for use in bovine zzso mapping using constructed for use in bovine zzso mapping using the zzso zzso Currently, the library consists of zzso zzso which achieves a zzso probability zzso of the library containing a specific unique DNA zzso Sixty thousand zzso or about three zzso bovine zzso will be required to achieve a zzso probability zzso of containing a unique zzso An average insert size of 146 zzso was estimated from the analysis of 77 randomly selected zzso clones produced by one or two rounds of size zzso The bovine DNA zzso proved to be very stable for at least 100 cell zzso No zzso clones were detected among 11 large, zzso zzso clones using zzso in zzso zzso zzso on zzso bovine zzso zzso of 46 zzso sequences were present in the library in at least one zzso which is consistent with the estimated zzso probability of this library containing a unique DNA zzso A zzso clone as zzso sites for genetic zzso These markers zzso and no zzso were detected in 193 zzso zzso zzso end rescue and the inverse zzso chain reaction methods were used to rescue both ends of this zzso zzso and zzso walking was performed using zzso zzso designed within the end region zzso Based on our experimental results, the zzso system provides a very useful tool for complex zzso zzso
