zzso (formerly zzso zzso produces the industrially important zzso zzso when grown in media containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of central carbon metabolism were zzso in crude extracts of zzso cultures of this zzso Based on these analyses it was concluded that zzso is converted to either zzso or zzso zzso and that both of these products are converted to zzso a precursor for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso but the lack of zzso activity indicated that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso for zzso zzso Thus, this zzso zzso zzso mainly via the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses suggested the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and CO2 zzso The zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso and partially zzso and a zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso exhibited no zzso activity in in zzso zzso grew normally on zzso minimal medium and accumulated biomass zzso plus zzso and produced CO2 at the same rates as the parental zzso Potential explanations for this finding are zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene were isolated zzso
