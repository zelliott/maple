The zzso gene is the zzso for a new family of genes zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso which are selectively induced in different cell lineages in response to zzso zzso The zzso gene is rapidly and zzso induced by zzso zzso in cells of the B zzso lineage and in zzso cells and zzso Here we report features controlling the zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso The minimal zzso zzso gene promoter is 96 zzso long and contains a zzso box and an zzso motif with an internal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif zzso zzso induction by the minimal zzso zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso factors specifically bind to the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso An upstream region containing two zzso repeated zzso motifs zzso the expression of the zzso promoter in zzso cells and determines the magnitude of zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso The zzso minimal promoter has the same functional features and organization as the zzso promoters of the unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
