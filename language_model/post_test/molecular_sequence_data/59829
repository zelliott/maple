The zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso B10 zzso was isolated and zzso under zzso zzso The zzso unit of the isolated zzso has a molecular mass of about 28 zzso as judged by zzso whereas the native protein zzso at 75 zzso This suggests that the native zzso from zzso zzso B10 exists in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was used to design an zzso which was zzso to screen a zzso library containing zzso fragments of zzso zzso B10 zzso A zzso DNA fragment, which included the entire structural zzso gene (named zzso and its zzso regions, was zzso A zzso open reading frame, coding for a mature protein of 295 zzso acid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso plus a zzso of 20 zzso zzso was zzso The directly determined sequence of the zzso and of four zzso peptides of the zzso zzso matched perfectly with the deduced zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene encodes an zzso transcript of zzso zzso In addition, there is no differential response in terms of either the size or abundance of the zzso under different environmental zzso zzso extension experiments confirmed a putative promoter upstream of the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso start site 73 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso which is close to the putative promoter zzso As shown using a zzso zzso gene fusion, zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene under the control of the zzso promoter is not regulated under the two different environmental conditions zzso The promoter of the zzso gene was zzso within zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso A model of the 3-D structure of zzso B10 was deduced by comparative zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso structures using the zzso program on the zzso protein zzso e-mail zzso Analysis of the B10 sequence and comparison of a model of the B10 zzso structure with the zzso structure of zzso from the zzso strain zzso has revealed some important differences at the level of the protein surface, the pore and the putative zzso binding zzso
