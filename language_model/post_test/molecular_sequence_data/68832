From the zzso profiles of their zzso acid sequences many transport proteins are conceived to comprise zzso zzso In only a few examples, however, is there zzso and/or zzso evidence to support the zzso structure or illuminate the molecular mechanism of the transport zzso A number of these transport proteins occur in zzso related families, and sometimes zzso indicating divergent evolution of the zzso zzso Other individual members or families of transport proteins are sufficiently different in zzso acid sequence for their evolution to have taken place by convergence from independent ancestral zzso
