The zzso region zzso has important biological functions in zzso male fertility and early zzso Even though pig zzso zzso zzso is an zzso and zzso important species, and its zzso is zzso current knowledge about the zzso zzso is zzso Here we defined the zzso in zzso by zzso the sequence of the zzso boundary at zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and showed that zzso is truncated in zzso zzso mapping of 20 zzso clones containing 15 zzso and zzso genes revealed that the pig zzso is largely zzso with other zzso zzso or zzso terminal zzso The results improved the current zzso sequence assembly and facilitated distinction between the zzso and zzso genes to study their expression in adult and embryonic zzso A pilot analysis showed that the zzso genes are expressed at higher levels than zzso genes during early development, whereas the expression of zzso genes was higher at day 60 compared to day 26, and higher in embryonic zzso compared to zzso The findings advance the knowledge about the comparative organization of the zzso in zzso and suggest that the region might have important functions in early development in zzso
