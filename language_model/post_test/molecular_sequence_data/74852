In this study we report the isolation and characterization of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso from outbreaks of zzso zzso in zzso zzso examinations of 59 chickens revealed orange deposits in the knee zzso typical for zzso zzso zzso cultures from 102 zzso and 43 zzso exhibited pure zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso zzso cultures of normal zzso zzso zzso and pinpoint zzso zzso zzso colonies of zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of 62 zzso demonstrated seven different band patterns with at most two band size variations, and zzso sequence typing demonstrated two different sequence types, sharing six out of seven zzso suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between zzso obtained from four zzso In addition, all zzso were zzso related to an zzso zzso reference strain from The Netherlands, previously shown to be globally zzso zzso investigation of the isolated zzso zzso zzso revealed no difference in zzso protein profiling between normal and pinpoint zzso However, the pinpoint colony zzso appeared to be more virulent in an in zzso challenge model in chickens than their zzso zzso In addition, pinpoint zzso and associated slow growth were expressed without zzso after in zzso and in zzso passage, suggesting a genuine altered zzso and in some instances normal colonies converted to pinpoint zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso of zzso zzso are described for the first time from veterinary clinical sources and in relation to zzso zzso in zzso
