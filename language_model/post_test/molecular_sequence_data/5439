We previously isolated a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso gene zzso using a zzso selection procedure with zzso derived from the short arm of human zzso zzso A zzso zzso cloning strategy was applied to obtain the coding sequence of the human zzso zzso and to generate a partial mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a coiled zzso zzso characterized by five zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that forms part of the zzso and mediates the correct sorting of zzso for zzso and zzso factors during zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso clones indicates that the sequence similarity is essentially limited to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso but the zzso order of these zzso suggests a similar function of the protein in zzso A database search further indicates the existence of a second human zzso on zzso arm zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that both the human and the zzso zzso produce an zzso species of zzso zzso zzso expressed in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle and during mouse embryonic zzso The zzso structural characteristics of the zzso protein and its expression in muscle and especially brain suggest that zzso is a component of a zzso zzso sorting mechanism zzso during zzso
