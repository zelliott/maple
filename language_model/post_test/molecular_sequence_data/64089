It has been demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso steps of zzso membrane fusion by zzso zzso zzso exchange on small zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here the identification and characterization of a novel protein in zzso zzso zzso that exhibits similarity to zzso and plays a critical role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is comprised of zzso zzso acids with zzso zzso zzso zzso and central zzso zzso zzso zzso as observed for other zzso family zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the fragmentation of zzso and reduced growth rate under various growth conditions, zzso its importance in maintaining zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the interaction of zzso with zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso as well as the zzso formation of zzso suggesting that zzso performs its function through zzso or zzso zzso zzso
