zzso expression of human zzso leukemia virus zzso and human zzso virus structural proteins requires zzso and Rev zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso appears to be due, in part, to zzso zzso zzso termed zzso repressive sequences zzso and may be zzso by binding of specific cellular zzso We demonstrated previously that two cellular zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso type zzso long terminal repeat zzso zzso and that the interaction of both proteins with zzso zzso zzso with function zzso zzso Black, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fraser, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso of zzso nuclear proteins zzso zzso to zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso we now show that zzso is zzso nuclear zzso zzso A1 and zzso is zzso zzso protein or zzso zzso These zzso results were confirmed by an zzso zzso with zzso I and zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso mobility shift zzso In addition, we mapped a putative zzso A1 binding site in zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso binding to that site zzso with zzso zzso Since both zzso I and zzso A1 have been shown to influence zzso and potentially other steps in zzso processing, the binding of both zzso I and zzso A1 to zzso zzso regulatory elements may alter zzso zzso processing and may be involved in regulation by zzso
