zzso generation of zzso zzso is uniquely dependent on the exact nature of the binding interactions in the zzso zzso Current methods for generation of zzso zzso do not efficiently survey the zzso repertoire and, therefore, they limit the number of zzso that can be zzso We are exploring methods to clone and express the zzso repertoire in zzso zzso As the essential first step, we present here a method for the establishment of a highly diverse heavy chain variable region zzso zzso it should now be possible to express and recombine the heavy and light chain variable region fragments to generate a large array of functional combining portions of the zzso zzso This technology may provide an alternative to the zzso methodology for zzso the zzso zzso specificity of the immune zzso
