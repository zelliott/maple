How the zzso zzso complex zzso interacts with zzso regulators at zzso genes in zzso cells is not well zzso By exploiting a zzso island zzso point zzso causing a zzso disease, we show that DNA binding of zzso zzso factor zzso determines zzso zzso and zzso depletion commensurate with zzso exclusion from the target zzso Lack of zzso binding leads to zzso zzso repression imposed by zzso zzso and consolidated by zzso recruitment and establishment of zzso zzso zzso Thus, within a functional hierarchy of zzso regulators, zzso binding is the main zzso of zzso recruitment to the CGI of a zzso gene in zzso zzso
