zzso and zzso channel toxins constitute a large set of zzso which interact with their zzso channel zzso These zzso are classified in two different structural zzso Recently a new structural group called zzso appeared to contain both types of toxins has been zzso We hypothesized that peptides of this group may contain two zzso structural motifs in zzso and/or zzso channels scorpion zzso allowing these zzso peptides to be active on zzso and/or zzso zzso 

Four zzso zzso overrepresented and specific to each group of zzso and/or zzso zzso channel toxins have been identified, using zzso and zzso and based on a training zzso of 79 sequences judged as representative of zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides appeared to present a new structural motif distinct from those present in zzso and zzso channels zzso This result, supported by previous experimental data, suggests that zzso peptides may exert their activity on different sites than those targeted by classic zzso or zzso zzso the zzso database with these newly identified motifs using zzso retrieved several sequences zzso with zzso zzso 1) from various scorpion species zzso zzso The filtering process left 30 new and highly likely zzso channel zzso analysis was used to zzso the newly found zzso zzso zzso tree analysis, using zzso zzso adjusted with the training zzso using the motifs and their zzso structure as explanatory zzso provided a model for prediction of the activity of the new zzso 

The zzso results were in perfect agreement with those obtained by the zzso zzso results may be used as criteria for a new zzso of scorpion toxins based on functional zzso
