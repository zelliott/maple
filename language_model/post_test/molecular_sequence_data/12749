A general approach for the synthesis of zzso zzso and the synthesis of four such blocks are zzso A strategy was devised to minimize the number of zzso precursors needed for synthesis of a complete set of zzso blocks zzso all 20 zzso zzso Whereas synthesis of 20 zzso blocks consisting of zzso sequences requires 16 zzso blocks, just seven zzso blocks are required to zzso all required zzso zzso The zzso sequences are then converted to zzso in template zzso zzso Using a mixture of four zzso and conventional automated zzso DNA zzso short zzso and medium length zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The latter was zzso in zzso and used as a zzso cassette to produce four zzso of zzso 221 in the zzso zzso zzso The method establishes the direction and utility for the production and use of zzso blocks in DNA zzso
