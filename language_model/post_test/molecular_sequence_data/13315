The solution structures of zzso zzso from the zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso have been determined using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso of solution zzso for the trans forms of these zzso zzso peptides have been generated using a simulated zzso procedure in conjunction with distance and zzso angle restraints derived from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso solution structures of the zzso and zzso zzso with that previously determined zzso et zzso 1993) and zzso refined for the zzso zzso reveals a common structural zzso All three zzso structures contain a type I zzso in the zzso sequence zzso and a type II zzso in the zzso sequence zzso However, the overall folds of the three peptides differ as well as the disposition of the side chains zzso the zzso zzso The similarities and differences between the structures of the three strains which bind to a common cell surface zzso are discussed in light of their contributions to synthetic vaccine zzso
