The New World zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso flies in South zzso It is responsible for severe economic losses to livestock producers, mainly because it causes mortality in newborn calves and reductions in the quality of leather and in the production of milk and zzso The economic losses caused by zzso along with those caused by other internal and external zzso are the main factors limiting meat zzso In Brazil, zzso zzso has been controlled by applying zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso However, the improper and continuous use of these chemicals can lead to the selection of zzso zzso This, associated with the fast development of zzso resistance in other zzso flies, shows the importance of investigating resistance in zzso zzso Based on the findings of previous studies, the objective of the current work was to isolate and sequence the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso at the positions zzso and zzso responsible for zzso zzso resistance in Lucilia zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso region in zzso zzso contained motifs that are highly zzso among zzso and contribute to the zzso mechanism of the active zzso The characterization of this gene in natural populations of New World zzso can be an important tool for monitoring resistance to zzso throughout its current geographic zzso This will provide information for the selection and zzso of more effective zzso management zzso
