Here we describe the high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance zzso structure of a transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso domain, which comes from human zzso the protein defective in the zzso syndrome zzso This domain is found in zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso which are localized to zzso structures in the zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso a novel fold which is zzso and comprises six zzso zzso and two zzso An unusual zzso zzso zzso in the sequences of zzso zzso is localized to the zzso core, at the zzso of an zzso The structure is stabilized by four zzso bonds which pair in a zzso 2-6, zzso 5-8 pattern, two of which are zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso site provide the first clues to the surface specificity of zzso domain zzso zzso of a zzso zzso domain from zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso contacts may play a role in its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso
