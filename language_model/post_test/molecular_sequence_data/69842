zzso obtained from zzso cell extracts were used to study zzso zzso zzso zzso from the human zzso and mouse zzso zzso promoters in zzso Although both genes depend on two almost identical core promoter elements zzso box and zzso different zzso were zzso The zzso promoter revealed full activity with the zzso B fraction zzso In contrast, efficient zzso from the zzso promoter depended on the additional presence of the C or D zzso The analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso revealed that for both promoters the zzso and the zzso D fraction were mutually zzso However, while both zzso were fully equivalent for the zzso promoter, the zzso promoter revealed an additional requirement for the C fraction in the presence of the zzso zzso Since the zzso and the D zzso zzso two different complexes of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso our results indicate that functionally these two complexes are responsible for the observed differences in zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso
