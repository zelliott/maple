The function of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is to regulate zzso pH values for the purpose of maintaining delta zzso Previous studies have shown that as part of its zzso ability, zzso zzso is able to increase zzso levels in response to zzso As part of the study of zzso regulation in zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso and determined its genetic zzso The structural genes from zzso zzso were found to be in the order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso where c and a were reversed from the more typical bacterial zzso The zzso contained no I gene zzso but was preceded by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences from open reading frames indicated that genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso flank the zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso analysis indicated the presence of three zzso zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso prepared from zzso or zzso cultures demonstrated that the zzso start site did not change as a function of culture pH zzso The data suggest that potential zzso structures in the promoter region of the zzso do not function to alter the starting position of zzso zzso zzso
