To generate different cell types, some cells can segregate protein zzso into one of their two daughter cells during zzso In zzso zzso the Par protein complex zzso zzso and directs zzso of the cell fate zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso proteins Miranda and zzso to the zzso cell cortex, to ensure their segregation into the zzso daughter zzso The Par protein complex has a zzso function in establishing cell polarity but how it directs proteins to the opposite side is zzso We show here that a principal function of this complex is to zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso giant larvae zzso also known as zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso a member of the Par protein complex, releases zzso from its association with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments show that zzso zzso prevents the zzso of cell fate zzso to the zzso cell zzso zzso promotes cortical zzso of Miranda, and we propose that zzso of zzso by zzso at the zzso zzso zzso restricts zzso activity and Miranda zzso to the opposite, zzso side of the zzso
