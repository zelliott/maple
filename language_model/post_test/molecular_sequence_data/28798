The zzso zzso zzso includes a family of outer membrane proteins zzso with substantial N and zzso zzso To better understand their evolution, the zzso sequences for two members, zzso and zzso were determined from a worldwide group of 23 zzso The geographic origin of each strain was found to be the major zzso of zzso structure, with strains of Eastern and Western origin showing greatest zzso For strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso regions of zzso are replaced with zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso occurs between the two zzso zzso and zzso have nearly equivalent variation in zzso and zzso acid identity, and zzso of synonymous and zzso zzso Both genes have zzso conservation but within the 3' segment, substitution patterns are nearly zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso and zzso segment zzso show strong zzso zzso the 3' segments show strong zzso zzso indicative of concerted zzso Within these 3' zzso the lower zzso than zzso zzso of zzso zzso which are below mean background zzso zzso substitution zzso indicate selection against zzso zzso Since zzso gene zzso likely zzso the concerted evolution of the 3' zzso in an experimental system, we demonstrate that gene zzso can frequently zzso occur in zzso zzso That these events are zzso and zzso indicates their likely cause is zzso zzso
