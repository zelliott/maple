The zzso zzso protein zzso is required for the development of cell polarity in cultured zzso Using zzso cells that zzso express zzso and zzso zzso fragments, we report that zzso interacts with the neural plasma membrane through its zzso projection zzso In differentiated zzso zzso zzso is found in growth zzso structures in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso extracted by zzso and enriched in the growth cone and the zzso zzso when membrane is left zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso fragment, but not of full-length zzso suppresses zzso process zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso projection domain has an important role in zzso development and establishes zzso as a zzso of zzso membrane zzso
