Type I zzso zzso systems zzso zzso zzso Two genes zzso and zzso are required to form the zzso zzso that zzso a specific base within the recognition sequence and protects DNA from zzso by the zzso The DNA zzso zzso is a 170 zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and has properties typical of a type I zzso The zzso zzso has been prepared with zzso S zzso to allow contrast variation using zzso zzso scattering zzso zzso The zzso data were collected in a number of zzso zzso contrasts to allow matching of one or other of the zzso in the zzso zzso The radius of zzso zzso and maximum dimensions zzso of the M zzso in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A and 190 A, zzso are close of those of the entire zzso zzso A and 190 zzso In contrast, the S zzso in zzso have zzso determined values of zzso A and zzso A, indicating their more central location in the zzso zzso zzso reconstruction methods yield a zzso structural model of the shape and zzso organization of zzso in which the zzso structure of the S zzso zzso can be zzso In contrast, the M zzso form a much more zzso and extended zzso The core of the zzso comprises the two S zzso and the zzso regions of the two M zzso with the extended portion of the M zzso most probably forming highly mobile regions at the outer zzso which collapse around the DNA when the zzso zzso
