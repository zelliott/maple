The rat zzso zzso II gene was characterized and found to be approximately zzso zzso in length and to contain 7 zzso and 6 zzso All zzso junction and branch point sequences conform to consensus zzso and the overall rat CA II zzso structure appears to be zzso upon comparison with zzso human, and chicken CA II zzso The putative zzso elements within the analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso region include: zzso box, 4 zzso binding sites, 2 zzso sites and putative zzso zzso repeat zzso A zzso island of approximately 800 zzso was identified that begins about 600 zzso upstream of zzso 1 and extends about 200 zzso into zzso zzso In the 3' zzso two zzso signals zzso are present, the second of which is believed to be zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals that the zzso zzso rat CA II zzso is abundantly expressed in adult male brain and zzso while negligible amounts are detected in heart and zzso
