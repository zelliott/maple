zzso in the zzso zzso protein zzso family show remarkably high structural conservation despite their zzso zzso A zzso alignment using 52 sequences of zzso family members revealed 15 fully zzso positions, with a disproportionately high number of these zzso located in the relatively small zzso zzso The zzso positions displayed high structural conservation based on comparisons of known zzso crystal zzso It is striking that the zzso domain had few zzso positions, despite its high structural zzso This observation prompted us to analyze zzso interactions within the zzso region to ask whether structural information was zzso in interacting zzso acid zzso We conducted this analysis on the zzso family member, cellular zzso zzso protein I zzso zzso whose folding mechanism is under study in our zzso Indeed, an analysis based on a simple zzso of zzso and polar zzso acids revealed a network of zzso interactions in zzso I that cluster zzso suggesting a possible nucleation site for zzso zzso a small number of zzso participated in multiple zzso zzso suggesting a key role for these sites in the structure and folding of zzso zzso The results presented here correlate well with available experimental evidence on folding of zzso and their family members and suggest future zzso The analysis also shows the usefulness of considering zzso conservation based on a simple zzso of zzso zzso in analyzing sequences and structures to find common core regions among zzso
