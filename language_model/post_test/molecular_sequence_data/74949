We have previously described a novel zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso signal sequence zzso zzso was functionally zzso to 20 zzso acids in length zzso 20 zzso We have used this zzso as a model zzso to probe the zzso specificity of zzso signal zzso zzso zzso was performed resulting in the substitution of 13 different zzso acids zzso zzso aromatic, zzso and zzso for zzso (or position zzso The effects of these zzso were assessed using an in zzso zzso membrane processing zzso zzso sequence analysis of the 13 zzso proteins demonstrated that zzso acids which occupy position zzso in a signal zzso are critical in establishing a good context for signal zzso zzso and that two or more potential sites of zzso may compete for recognition by signal zzso
