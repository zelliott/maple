Members of the zzso family zzso a variety of different strategies to increase coding capacity within their P zzso zzso initiation at alternative zzso zzso zzso is used by zzso virus zzso to express the zzso P and C proteins from overlapping reading frames on their zzso Additional species of zzso are transcribed from the zzso P zzso by the zzso of extra zzso G zzso at a specific site within the P zzso zzso of only a single zzso G zzso results in the expression of the V zzso which contains a unique zzso zzso We have used an zzso coli system to express zzso P zzso zzso and zzso We have found that zzso zzso on the zzso P protein zzso is capable of generating a previously zzso P zzso protein that we have designated zzso Some zzso which have initiated translation of the P protein zzso use the sequence zzso zzso AG (24 zzso upstream of the V protein stop zzso to slip into the zzso reading frame, thus translating the sequence as zzso CCC zzso The resulting R protein zzso five zzso downstream of the zzso site at the V protein stop zzso We have gone on to use a zzso zzso reporter system to demonstrate that this zzso sequence is capable of directing zzso during in zzso translation in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso proteins from zzso cells by two-dimensional gel zzso allowed detection of a protein species consistent with R protein in zzso zzso zzso of this protein species allowed a rough zzso of zzso frequency of approximately zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso frequency at this locus of the zzso P zzso was zzso by a downstream zzso element which, although not yet fully zzso appeared to be neither a conventional zzso nor an zzso zzso zzso
