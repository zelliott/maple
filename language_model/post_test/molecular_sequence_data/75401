We describe the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso 70 DNA coding region which was found to be formed by zzso copies organized in a tandem array in a zzso zzso The restriction pattern of one of the repetition units within the largest clone obtained from the zzso library, clone zzso shows that the zzso coding region should be formed by at least seven identical copies of zzso zzso We have found, however, the presence of restriction zzso zzso zzso within these zzso zzso analysis of the time course of nuclear DNA zzso has revealed that the copy number per zzso zzso could be as greater as zzso The analysis of the DNA and zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso of one of the repetition units has shown the existence of a high zzso with all the zzso genes of other zzso The protein sequence zzso of the zzso analyzed is as high as zzso when compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, there are significant restriction site variations between zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains at the zzso end a zzso repeat of the structure zzso
