The zzso zzso complex targets the zzso degradation of proteins in multiple dynamic cellular zzso A key zzso component is the zzso protein that functions within the complex to link the zzso zzso to a zzso that in turn binds the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and humans, zzso zzso contains multiple expressed zzso zzso zzso 

The 21 zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso form one zzso zzso suggesting that a single ancestral zzso gene underwent independent expansion in zzso zzso The cellular and zzso functions of the 21 zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso by zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso genes fall into two zzso First, the highly similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are required for zzso body zzso embryonic and zzso development, and cell zzso Second, the related zzso and zzso genes are required for the restraint of cell zzso progression through the zzso stage of zzso and the formation of zzso zzso at zzso zzso was found to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso could interact with both zzso and its close zzso zzso 

Members of the expanded zzso gene family in zzso zzso perform critical functions in regulating cell zzso zzso and zzso The finding that multiple zzso are able to bind zzso suggests an extensive set of zzso zzso zzso
