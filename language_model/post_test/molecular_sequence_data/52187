An alternative method for amplification of DNA with unknown sequences was zzso This involves the direct zzso of a primer zzso itself to restricted DNA fragments with unknown sequences to be amplified by zzso The zzso need not be zzso and need not be zzso with its complementary zzso in advance for zzso The zzso reaction seems to be independent of the concentration of unknown DNA, proceeds in short time, and is zzso The zzso efficiency was more than zzso at a low zzso 10 zzso of zzso This method was applied to a zzso of the short arm of human zzso zzso Of 65 clones screened for the highly repetitive sequences with total human zzso DNA, zzso zzso were zzso Their zzso ranged in size from 150 to 1,200 zzso zzso 460 zzso In Southern zzso analysis, thirty consecutive clones all detected signals common to both total human zzso DNA and zzso hybrid cell DNA containing only zzso 2 of human zzso Among them, 24 zzso were unique zzso and 6 zzso were zzso (or zzso zzso Thus, this method is simple and efficient, and provides an alternative way to amplify unknown zzso
