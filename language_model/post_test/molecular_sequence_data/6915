zzso zzso of the zzso gene has been recently shown to occur in a zzso precursor cell line and to result in weak expression of an zzso zzso zzso zzso beta chain on the cell zzso An investigation into the expression of a similar zzso structure in normal zzso sites has involved zzso zzso and sorting to identify a minor subset of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso and zzso These cells have been analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction for the presence of transcripts zzso by zzso genes in rearranged vs zzso zzso in zzso of cells sorted on the basis of zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso transcripts were found in the zzso zzso subset of cells in bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso They were also found to be present in the zzso zzso subset of cells in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso subset of zzso zzso zzso contained zzso but no rearranged zzso zzso The same zzso subset expressed high levels of both rearranged and zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso transcripts in zzso cells in bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso gene zzso is unrelated to the differentiation of mature T zzso The possible function and significance of the expression of a truncated zzso beta chain is zzso
