zzso T cells recognize fragments of zzso bound to the class II molecules on the surface of zzso zzso zzso processed zzso fragments have been isolated from the class II molecules and shown to be zzso in zzso ranging from 13 to 25 zzso and to vary at both the N and C zzso A zzso zzso in an extended zzso is predicted to fit in an open zzso zzso of the class II zzso Thus, the longer peptides observed bound to class II presumably have regions which reside outside the zzso It is not known if the additional length contributes significantly to T cell zzso We have carried out a systematic analysis of the zzso of peptides of increasing length beyond the minimally defined T cell zzso zzso Here we show that the full functional activities of peptides representing the major zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso minimally require that the peptides be 23 zzso acids zzso The long peptides do not require processing and are presented by zzso class II molecules incorporated into synthetic zzso indicating that such peptides associate directly with class II and require no additional cellular machinery for zzso We also show that a hybrid zzso 51 zzso in zzso containing a zzso zzso c zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso is more zzso than the zzso zzso alone and significantly, does not require zzso Thus, the additional zzso zzso although not predicted to bind in the zzso groove of the zzso class II zzso has a significant impact on the ability of the peptides to stimulate T cell responses zzso
