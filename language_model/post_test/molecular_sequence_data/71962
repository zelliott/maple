zzso E virus zzso is the zzso agent for viral zzso type zzso which is a major problem in the developing zzso Because zzso cannot be cultured in zzso very little information exists on the mechanisms of zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso virus with three potential open reading frames zzso one of which zzso is zzso to zzso the major viral zzso protein zzso We earlier showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be a approximately zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso and a potential zzso zzso zzso signal at its N zzso Treatment with the drugs zzso A and zzso suggest that the protein may accumulate within the zzso Based on zzso analysis, we demonstrate zzso to be the major site of zzso zzso In zzso cell expression and in zzso translation experiments, we confirm the zzso nature of the zzso zzso zzso sequence and show that the protein is zzso but not zzso zzso across the zzso zzso Earlier, we had also demonstrated cell surface zzso of a fraction of the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso of zzso we now show that while transit of zzso into the zzso is necessary for its cell surface zzso zzso of the protein is not required for such zzso These results may offer clues to the mechanisms of gene expression and zzso assembly in zzso
