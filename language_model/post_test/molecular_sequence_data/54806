A mouse zzso zzso directed against a member of the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso was isolated from stored mouse zzso and zzso to zzso After more than a decade of storage the genetic material was not available for zzso however, zzso zzso with the zzso showed this zzso against zzso zzso to be a zzso candidate for the treatment of several inflammatory zzso We have successfully rescued the zzso zzso by performing zzso analysis, primary zzso acid sequence determination by template zzso and synthesis of the corresponding zzso DNA by reverse zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso and shown to demonstrate the desired specificity and binding properties in a panel of zzso zzso The work described zzso demonstrates the powerful combination of zzso zzso zzso de zzso sequencing with reverse engineering to zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso protein sample, zzso the development of novel zzso from cryptic protein zzso
