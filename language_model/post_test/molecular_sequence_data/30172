zzso of the zzso activity of extracts from seeds of zzso zzso at various maturation stages revealed that the level of zzso increases markedly past zzso zzso at this stage of maturation served as a source of zzso for the construction of an expression zzso library in the zzso zzso Zap, which generates fusion proteins with an zzso portion of zzso The library was screened with rabbit zzso zzso zzso Four zzso clones were zzso Western zzso analysis of cell extracts from one of the clones zzso showed a 36 zzso protein that reacted with the zzso as well as with a mouse zzso zzso raised against the zzso DNA sequence analysis by the chain termination method revealed that clone zzso has an insert of zzso zzso with the entire coding sequence of zzso beginning with an initiation zzso zzso at position 26 and ending with stop zzso zzso at position zzso This zzso encodes a zzso of 281 zzso acids consisting of a signal leader sequence of 25 zzso acids and a mature protein of 256 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from this zzso is identical to the sequence of the first zzso zzso acids of zzso as determined at the protein level, except at 7 zzso
