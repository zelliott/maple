The detection of abnormal DNA base pairing arrangements and zzso is chemically zzso in synthetic zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso The DNA targets studied are zzso zzso DNA, zzso zzso DNA, zzso DNA with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA with a single zzso G and zzso DNA with two zzso zzso The effect of the zzso structures on the formation of zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso of G by zzso is reported along with the zzso and circular zzso zzso of the different duplex zzso The results for zzso and zzso show that the qualitative and quantitative character of the zzso patterns at a zzso run change with the nature of the abnormal base pairing zzso Based on the DNA zzso zzso the results indicate that a combination of zzso which report electronic and zzso zzso can be a useful approach to monitor DNA zzso and zzso
