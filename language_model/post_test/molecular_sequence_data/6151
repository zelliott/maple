zzso cells play an essential role during development of inflammation after chemical and zzso insults and have been implicated in tissue zzso and zzso The exact contribution of mast cells to these conditions is largely zzso In this study, we found that a potent zzso and zzso zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso is localized to the majority of mast cells from normal skin and lung and in tissue samples characterized by fibrosis, zzso and zzso Using specific zzso to mast cell zzso tissue zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is localized to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in human zzso lung tissue zzso zzso 10), zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in skin zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso cells comprise a major portion zzso to zzso of zzso cells exhibiting zzso zzso zzso in these zzso In contrast, zzso cells contribute less than zzso of the zzso cells in the same zzso The specificity of the zzso results was supported by the finding that cultured human mast cells zzso express both zzso zzso and zzso Our data indicate that mast cells, a primary source of zzso also serve as a significant source of a zzso growth factor, zzso in these disease zzso These observations suggest that mast cells may contribute to these pathological conditions by releasing this zzso
