Two major zzso regulated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso differ by an extra zinc finger within the DNA binding zzso The preferred DNA binding sites were determined and are distinguished by an internal zzso of zzso in the site recognized by the zzso with the extra zzso The results are consistent with modular interactions between zinc fingers and zzso and also suggest rules for recognition of zzso DNA sites by zinc finger zzso The results show how modular finger interactions with zzso can be used, in conjunction with alternative zzso to alter the binding specificity and increase the spectrum of sites recognized by a DNA binding zzso Thus, zzso may potentially regulate distinct sets of target genes during zzso
