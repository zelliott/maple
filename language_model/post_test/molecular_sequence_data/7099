The zzso genes from zzso zzso types 5 and 12 share the capacity to cooperate with a second zzso to transform primary zzso cells in zzso However, only zzso cells are zzso in zzso zzso an event that requires zzso region 3 zzso of zzso to be zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso class I transcription, contributing to escape from zzso immune zzso zzso of zzso class I zzso is also lacking in zzso zzso zzso zzso In these cells, zzso class I expression increases during differentiation in a process possibly involving zzso zzso We found that both zzso and zzso zzso cells contained the zzso expressed factor zzso In contrast, only zzso zzso cells that are derived from primary cell cultures expressed an additional zzso factor, which we identified as zzso The induction of zzso expression was at the zzso level and was found to require an intact zzso domain in zzso zzso Like zzso class I zzso zzso expression was not affected in already established cell lines expressing zzso zzso The presence of zzso in zzso cells correlated with an increase in zzso zzso of a reporter zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
