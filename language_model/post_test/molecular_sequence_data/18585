zzso is a nuclear zzso protein involved in primary zzso zzso and a risk factor in chronic zzso zzso The presence of several zzso related zzso such as plant zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain suggests a role in zzso regulation of gene zzso however, its real function is still zzso zzso we present the solution structure of zzso finger and investigate its role as zzso reader in zzso zzso presents an zzso zzso finger fold which does not bind to zzso zzso tails but is recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically binds to a zzso corresponding to the zzso loop of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate zzso interaction with zzso zzso in zzso zzso these data include zzso in the list of the increasing number of zzso zzso and expand the regulatory potential of zzso fingers as versatile structural platforms for diversified zzso
