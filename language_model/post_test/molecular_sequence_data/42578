zzso activated the zzso actions of zzso with neutral or positively charged zzso for zzso zzso zzso acids increased the rate of zzso of zzso zzso if the zzso values of the zzso groups were zzso approximately zzso zzso compounds activated if their zzso values were zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso also zzso zzso with high zzso values were able to activate the zzso if the pH was high, and this showed that the lack of zzso at pH zzso was because of zzso zzso analysis showed that most of the zzso that activated were bound to the active site, since the zzso followed zzso type zzso zzso The binding seemed to be dependent upon the zzso the longer the zzso chain, the stronger the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of some type were formed during the reactions in the presence of many of the zzso Three of these zzso were zzso and the zzso were found zzso to zzso This indicates that if an intermediate zzso bond is formed in the mechanism of zzso action and if the zzso zzso to zzso it, the intermediate zzso bond must have the alpha zzso and involve a group other than zzso
