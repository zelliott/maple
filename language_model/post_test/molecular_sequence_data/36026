Changes in the number of zzso repeat zzso have been examined during zzso of two mouse tumor cell zzso zzso were detected as bands and a zzso by zzso gel zzso and zzso using zzso as a zzso Very long size zzso of zzso were frequently observed in zzso zzso This suggests that at least some of the tumor cells have an ability to zzso zzso This zzso may compensate for the continuous loss of zzso repeats due to cell zzso which would eventually lead to cell zzso
