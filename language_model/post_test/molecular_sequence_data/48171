zzso zzso zzso zzso to make a rapid zzso change from the zzso cell form to zzso zzso to the previous reports, we found that serum zzso does not play a critical role in this zzso zzso Instead, a zzso zzso mass, zzso zzso devoid of serum zzso zzso zzso To study genes controlling this response, we have isolated the zzso gene from zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso like zzso and zzso of zzso zzso has a long zzso zzso Although zzso appears to be the only zzso gene present in the zzso zzso zzso strains zzso for a deletion of zzso zzso are zzso The zzso zzso zzso fails to form germ tubes and zzso in response to serum or to a serum zzso but does form zzso Moreover, strains expressing the dominant active zzso zzso manifest enhanced zzso growth, whereas those expressing a dominant negative zzso zzso show reduced zzso zzso These data show that zzso molecules in serum induce zzso differentiation in zzso zzso through a zzso signal zzso zzso
