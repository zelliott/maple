In a number of zzso heat shock proteins zzso stimulate zzso and cellular immune responses despite significant sequence identity with host zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso which shares zzso identity with human zzso at the protein level, zzso a T cell response in most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and tuberculosis patients and their zzso In order to locate T cell zzso DNA fragments zzso portions of the zzso zzso were expressed in the zzso zzso and tested for T cell zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from zzso zzso indicated that the zzso half of the zzso contained multiple T cell zzso as the T cells from a majority of zzso zzso zzso individuals responded to zzso Lower proportions of patients with zzso zzso zzso and tuberculosis patients zzso responded to zzso The smaller zzso zzso which includes the terminal 70 zzso unique to zzso zzso and is the target for the human zzso response zzso a cellular response in few patients and no zzso In order to map T cell zzso two series of synthetic peptides encompassing the region zzso were zzso Using overlapping zzso and zzso zzso this region of the zzso was found to contain several potential T cell zzso The longer peptides gave a clearer indication of zzso sequences including regions of the zzso which were not identified with the zzso zzso Fine mapping of zzso zzso pools using the zzso peptides identified two T cell zzso Although both were located in regions of the zzso shared with zzso zzso one appeared to be zzso with the equivalent human zzso and thus has the potential to initiate zzso zzso
