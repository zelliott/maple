We have determined the high resolution crystal structure of the I domain from the zzso of the zzso zzso a cell surface zzso zzso for collagen and the human pathogen zzso The domain, as expected, adopts the zzso fold, and contains a metal zzso zzso site motif with bound zzso at the top of the zzso zzso with the crystal structures of the zzso zzso I zzso reveals a new zzso (the zzso protruding from the metal zzso zzso site face of the domain which creates a groove centered on the zzso zzso Modeling of a collagen triple zzso into the groove suggests that a zzso acid side chain from collagen can coordinate the metal zzso and that the zzso insert is a major zzso of binding zzso The binding site for zzso maps to a distinct surface of the zzso domain (one edge of the zzso consistent with data showing that virus and collagen binding occur by different zzso zzso with the zzso von zzso factor A3 domain, which also binds zzso suggests that the two zzso bind collagen in different zzso
