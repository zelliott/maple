zzso and zzso proteins zzso are zzso motor proteins that play important roles in zzso zzso Based on the zzso to these zzso a zzso zzso has now been isolated from a library prepared from flowers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso clones revealed the presence of 18 zzso 17 of which conform to the zzso zzso The central region of the zzso zzso exhibits substantial zzso acid sequence zzso to the motor domain of zzso heavy zzso although the motor domain of zzso appears to be zzso distant from those of other zzso in zzso The zzso region of zzso shares marked sequence similarity with the zzso zzso domain, whereas the approximately zzso zzso region shows no significant zzso to other known zzso The predicted secondary structure of zzso revealed the lack of an zzso coiled zzso structure typical of zzso heavy zzso suggesting that zzso may function as a zzso zzso A zzso truncated zzso protein containing the putative motor domain was shown both to bind to zzso zzso in a manner dependent on a zzso zzso zzso and to possess zzso zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso analyses showed that both zzso protein and zzso are expressed specifically in floral zzso These results suggest that the structurally distinct zzso protein functions as a floral zzso motor zzso
