An approach designed to map and generate zzso in the region of the short arm of the mouse Y zzso known to be involved in sex determination and zzso is zzso This relies on zzso zzso pairing and zzso exchange which can occur at zzso in zzso males carrying zzso on their X zzso Such exchange potentially generates deficiencies and zzso of zzso or zzso Three fertile zzso females were found out of about 450 zzso offspring from zzso zzso zzso zzso In all three, despite evidence for deletion of Y zzso material, the zzso locus was zzso Each deletion involved a repeat zzso zzso located at a distance from zzso Since expression of zzso was affected these results suggest that long range position effects have disrupted zzso zzso
