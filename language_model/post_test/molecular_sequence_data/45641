zzso constitute a group of zzso capable of zzso the zzso zzso bond of a variety of biological zzso To date, thirteen members of this family have been cloned and characterized as part of the human zzso In this work, the zzso molecular cloning and initial characterization of three new members of this human gene family is zzso Two map in zzso 5 zzso and zzso whereas the third one maps in zzso 4 zzso Two of them are closely related and are coded in only two zzso what is a unique zzso feature among the known zzso The three new members were cloned from different DNA sources, and the predicted protein sizes range from 536 zzso to zzso zzso Interestingly, initial characterization of two of them showed that their expression pattern was mainly restricted to embryonic zzso and some cancer cell zzso
