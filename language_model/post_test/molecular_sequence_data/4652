zzso zzso basic zzso acid zzso zzso is a member of a family of the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso Previously we reported seven zzso zzso of zzso that vary in size and zzso sequence zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the origin of these zzso the entire human zzso gene has been isolated as a set of overlapping zzso DNA fragments, and analyzed by restriction zzso zzso and zzso sequence zzso The human zzso gene spans at least 250 zzso and is distributed over 25 zzso that range in size from 39 to zzso base zzso Human zzso gene is the largest zzso zzso zzso gene reported to zzso The most striking feature of its zzso structure is the size of the zzso and the number of zzso although the general organization of signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso in this family, is very similar to that reported for other zzso zzso zzso The structural analysis of zzso zzso DNA indicates that multiple zzso transcripts are produced as a consequence of alternative zzso zzso events, including zzso zzso and differences in the usage of the inner zzso donor and zzso zzso A major zzso start site was detected 314 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso start site by primer extension zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region revealed that zzso gene lacks zzso and zzso boxes in the zzso upstream region of the start site, although potential binding sites for several zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso response element binding zzso and basic zzso zzso were zzso An unusual sequence of six tandem repeats of a zzso zzso containing an E box is found in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is not a zzso gene product and its expression is regulated by various zzso zzso
