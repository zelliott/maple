Several zzso binding sites within the zzso zzso virus zzso long terminal repeat zzso and gag enhancers were zzso and the effect of these zzso on viral gene expression was zzso zzso zzso zzso in each of three adjacent zzso binding sites in the zzso reduced zzso viral zzso zzso Double zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso binding sites resulted in production of zzso of zzso levels of zzso zzso I zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso blocked zzso binding at the affected zzso Additional zzso binding sites were identified upstream of the 3' zzso and within the zzso end of the zzso Point zzso in the zzso gag zzso zzso region, which blocked binding of zzso at two of three adjacent zzso sites, also reduced virus production zzso Nuclear extracts prepared from both chicken zzso zzso zzso and chicken muscle contained proteins binding to the same zzso DNA sites as did zzso and zzso that prevented zzso binding also blocked binding of these chicken zzso It appears that zzso and chicken muscle contain distinct proteins binding to these zzso DNA zzso the zzso binding protein was heat stable, as is zzso while the chicken muscle protein was heat zzso
