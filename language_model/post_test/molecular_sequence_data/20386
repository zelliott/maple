zzso choice is of central importance to most animals, influencing population structure, zzso and ultimately the survival of a zzso zzso behavior of male zzso zzso is triggered by the product of a zzso zzso a zzso on the body surface of females called the mate recognition zzso The mate recognition zzso has been zzso zzso but little was known about the zzso We describe the isolation and characterization of the mate recognition zzso gene through protein zzso zzso zzso acid sequence determination, identification of the mate recognition zzso gene from a zzso library, sequencing, and zzso zzso to confirm the functional role of the mate recognition zzso gene in zzso zzso 

A 29 zzso protein capable of zzso zzso male circling was isolated by zzso liquid zzso Two transcript types containing the zzso sequence were identified in a zzso zzso further characterization by screening a zzso library and by zzso chain reaction revealed two genes belonging to each zzso Each gene begins with a signal zzso region followed by nearly perfect repeats of an 87 to 92 zzso motif with no zzso between repeats and the final motif prematurely terminated by the stop zzso The two Type A genes contain four and seven repeats and the two Type B genes contain three and five repeats, zzso Only the Type B gene with three repeats encodes a zzso with a molecular weight of 29 zzso Each repeat of the Type B gene products contains three zzso as potential sites for zzso there are no zzso in the Type A zzso zzso with Type A zzso zzso did not result in less circling than in the zzso saline control, but zzso with Type B zzso zzso significantly reduced male circling by zzso The very low divergence between repeat units, even at synonymous positions, suggests that the repeats are kept nearly identical through a process of concerted zzso zzso molecules like surface zzso are well adapted for chemical communication and aquatic animals may have evolved signaling systems based on these compounds, whereas insects use zzso zzso 

zzso to its critical role in zzso the mate recognition zzso gene will be a useful molecular marker for exploring the mechanisms and rates of selection and the evolution of zzso isolation and zzso using zzso as a model zzso The zzso variation in the mate recognition zzso gene can now be studied in conjunction with the large amount of ecological and population genetic data being gathered for the zzso zzso species complex to understand better the evolutionary drivers of cryptic zzso
