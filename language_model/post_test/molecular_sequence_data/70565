zzso protein and zzso protein are zzso zzso zzso molecules that normally regulate hair zzso and body weight, respectively, by zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso of zzso is normally limited to the skin, but rare zzso from which zzso is expressed zzso such as lethal yellow, have zzso effects that include a yellow coat, zzso increased linear growth, and immune zzso The mahogany zzso zzso suppresses the effects of lethal yellow on pigmentation and body weight, and results of our previous genetic studies place zzso downstream of zzso of zzso but upstream of zzso zzso Here we use zzso cloning to identify a candidate gene for zzso zzso The predicted protein zzso by zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is expressed in many zzso including zzso cells and the zzso The zzso domain of the zzso protein is the zzso of human zzso a circulating zzso produced by activated T cells that has been implicated in zzso zzso These observations provide new insight into the regulation of energy metabolism and indicate a molecular basis for zzso between zzso zzso and immune zzso
