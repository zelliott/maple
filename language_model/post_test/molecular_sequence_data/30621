zzso gene factor 2 zzso was zzso from zzso cells treated with alpha zzso The factor, a single zzso of 56 zzso zzso bound both to the central 9 base pairs of the zzso zzso response element zzso that is required for zzso zzso of zzso genes and to the zzso regulatory element of the beta zzso zzso zzso was a zzso and zzso in zzso reduced its zzso zzso However, conditions that changed the amount of zzso did not change the zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso cells existed in trace amounts and was induced by both alpha zzso and gamma zzso as well as by virus zzso zzso zzso coli clones zzso zzso were selected with zzso against zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso protein was the same as that zzso by the zzso clone zzso which has been claimed to activate zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso of the zzso gene was induced by alpha zzso gamma zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso was neither necessary nor sufficient for induced zzso of the beta zzso zzso while the factor zzso zzso B was clearly zzso
