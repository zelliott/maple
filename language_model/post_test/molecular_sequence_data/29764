zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries from zzso zzso zzso strain were constructed and screened for zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A screen of zzso million zzso yielded a single zzso clone that zzso a protein fusion capable of specifically interacting with zzso zzso revealed the zzso insert zzso had zzso to the zzso class of zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used to probe a conventional zzso zzso zzso library and a zzso zzso zzso coding for a predicted protein of 582 zzso acids was zzso Based on comparison with a zzso product from zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso for zzso appeared to be zzso zzso had the highest similarity to zzso zzso zzso and displayed sequence characteristics that place it in the zzso H class of zzso zzso In zzso zzso populations the level of zzso zzso was unchanged indicating it is not cell cycle regulated at the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell cycle zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso demonstrating that this zzso zzso can function in an established zzso model zzso
