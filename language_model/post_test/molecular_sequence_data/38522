A zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso virus zzso was constructed such that the viral zzso is rapidly excised from the zzso zzso backbone on delivery into zzso zzso The zzso is zzso by zzso sites in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso A synthetic zzso inserted in the middle of the zzso zzso completely zzso zzso in zzso coli, but is spliced out after delivery of the zzso into zzso zzso zzso is efficient, and pure virus lacking the zzso zzso backbone is immediately isolated from zzso zzso cells without the need of serial passage or plaque zzso
