The hybrid zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso has potent zzso and zzso zzso Because the zzso sequence zzso of zzso 2 is similar to zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and their zzso were designed and zzso zzso activities of these peptides were evaluated using three small cell lung cancer cell zzso Greater zzso activity was observed when the zzso 16, 18 and 19 of the zzso were zzso zzso or zzso basic zzso and basic zzso zzso The zzso values of the peptides with the zzso were 2 to 4 zzso zzso 12 was related to zzso activity rather than zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso enhanced zzso activity without significant change in zzso zzso The zzso of the peptides in a 30 zzso sodium zzso zzso solution was more closely correlated to zzso activity than zzso zzso
