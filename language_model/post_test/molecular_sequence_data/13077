The zzso zzso zzso and structurally related peptides are present both in zzso and zzso nervous zzso Although they constitute a major class of zzso zzso zzso the molecular structure of their receptors has not yet been zzso In zzso of the snail zzso zzso as well as in zzso bursting and motor zzso zzso zzso a fast zzso zzso response due to direct zzso of an zzso zzso zzso We have now isolated a complementary DNA from zzso nervous zzso when expressed in zzso zzso it encodes an zzso zzso channel zzso that can be blocked by zzso The corresponding protein shares a very low sequence identity with the previously cloned zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso zzso zzso but it displays the same overall structural zzso To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a zzso zzso zzso
