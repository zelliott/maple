We report the zzso molecular zzso and expression of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from Chinese zzso zzso cells, which lacks extended zzso to other zzso zzso is an zzso protein that exists as a zzso complex of zzso zzso with a specific activity of 1 zzso The full-length zzso clone encodes a zzso acid zzso protein with one zzso motif zzso and eight zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cells generates an active zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso and the zzso repeats are required for zzso We demonstrate that zzso selectively zzso the zzso over zzso fatty acid by zzso for zzso zzso in a mixed zzso Moreover, we found the fatty acid preference at the zzso position to be highly dependent upon zzso zzso However, zzso does have a marked preference for zzso zzso acid presented in a zzso generating the zzso second zzso zzso zzso Finally the zzso is able to zzso the zzso zzso at the zzso position of zzso zzso
