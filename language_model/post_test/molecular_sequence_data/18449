The mechanism of specific expression of zzso zzso P gene during zzso of the rat has been investigated by cloning the gene and determining the upstream regulatory zzso Two enhancers and a zzso are located within 3 zzso upstream of the zzso The stronger zzso designated zzso has two zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso sequences arranged in a zzso at a 3 base pairs zzso This special combination was found to form a very strong zzso which could act efficiently even in zzso cells where the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso cannot work due to the low zzso zzso Whether this structure is operating with a very low concentration of zzso zzso or with any other proteins remains to be zzso These findings suggest that new and more efficient enhancers evolve by a combination of basic zzso zzso The zzso region consists of several sequences that can bind specific zzso and works zzso
