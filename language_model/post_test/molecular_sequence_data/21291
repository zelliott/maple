zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso invade the zzso zzso and its arteries to ensure successful zzso We previously identified two zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso as negative regulators of zzso zzso migration, and zzso and reported that zzso acts via multiple zzso zzso receptors zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso Because binding of zzso to zzso has never been reported earlier, present study explored this zzso the approximate location of zzso site in zzso and its functional role in our human first zzso zzso cell line zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso studies, we report that zzso binds both native zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that this binding is zzso with a zzso blocking zzso indicating an overlap between the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso We determined that zzso zzso (a zzso specific zzso binds zzso with a zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso displaced this binding with an zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso indicating a 7- to zzso lower affinity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso fragments derived from the zzso rich repeat 5 domain that blocked zzso interactions or zzso binding in zzso cells also blocked zzso and zzso zzso cell proliferation and migration, indicative of functional zzso sites of zzso Finally, zzso inhibited zzso zzso migration by interfering with zzso zzso Our findings reveal a novel role of zzso as an zzso zzso for zzso having implications for zzso of zzso a zzso zzso disorder in pregnancy, and explain its zzso zzso
