A synthetic gene zzso the zzso commune zzso zzso was constructed by a novel zzso zzso Three long zzso were zzso and used in combination with zzso zzso zzso to generate a 607 base pair gene which contained 31 unique locations for restriction zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence was tailored for expression in zzso coli by using only those zzso found in highly expressed zzso coli zzso The availability of the gene will facilitate analysis of the structure and function of this and other zzso zzso
