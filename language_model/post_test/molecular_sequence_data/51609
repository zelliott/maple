zzso promote the development of many organ systems vital for zzso survival, and fetal cortisol provides the trigger for birth in zzso The activity of zzso may be influenced at a cellular level by 11 zzso zzso (11 zzso which is responsible for the zzso of cortisol and zzso To examine 11 zzso gene expression during fetal development, two overlapping clones which yield a zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso sheep 11 zzso from a liver library were isolated by using a rat 11 zzso zzso as the zzso This zzso contains a zzso base pair open reading frame for a protein of zzso zzso acids that has more than zzso sequence identity to rat and human 11 zzso To define the tissue distribution of 11 zzso zzso zzso in zzso selected zzso were collected from one fetus at day 130 and term zzso 145 zzso and from a zzso zzso Cellular zzso was extracted and subjected to Northern zzso analysis, and a single zzso zzso transcript was detected in the fetal and adult liver, zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso This was zzso in zzso and zzso but a smaller zzso zzso transcript was present in fetal and adult kidney zzso The relative abundance of 11 zzso zzso was greatest in fetal and adult zzso and it was much higher in adult liver, zzso and kidney than in the corresponding fetal zzso To examine whether 11 zzso gene expression is zzso regulated in the fetal zzso liver, zzso and kidney zzso were taken from fetuses at day zzso day zzso day zzso at term, and from newborn zzso zzso h zzso In the lung and zzso the relative abundance of 11 zzso zzso did not change from day 60 to term but increased in the lungs of newborn zzso In contrast, 11 zzso zzso levels in the liver increased between day 125 and term and rose further in the zzso zzso these results demonstrate that 11 zzso gene expression in sheep is regulated in a zzso and zzso programmed zzso
