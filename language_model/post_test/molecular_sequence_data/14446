A novel bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a saliva sample taken from a student during a teaching experiment in zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the novel strain was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence similarities, respectively, demonstrating that the novel strain belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso formed pale yellow colonies that turned to brown on zzso zzso zzso and that gave off a characteristic fruity zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The new isolate contained zzso 6 zzso as the major respiratory zzso and zzso iso zzso zzso iso zzso zzso and zzso iso zzso as the dominant fatty zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso On the basis of this study, based on a zzso zzso approach, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso descriptions of the zzso zzso and of the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso
