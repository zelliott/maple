A novel zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from the root of the medicinal plant zzso zzso collected from zzso Province, zzso zzso The strain produced extensively zzso zzso and aerial zzso that carried straight to zzso spore zzso zzso properties of this strain were consistent with those of members of the zzso zzso The cell wall of strain zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the characteristic zzso zzso The major zzso was zzso with minor amounts of zzso zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso iso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso zzso and other members of this zzso were lower than zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of strain zzso zzso with the three closest species showed zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso it is evident that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
