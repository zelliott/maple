To determine future possibilities for gene transfer, we evaluated whether zzso zzso cells from human zzso zzso blood zzso could be frozen, thawed in viable form and zzso with a zzso resistance zzso gene using zzso zzso and if fresh zzso cells zzso with a zzso gene could be zzso and zzso Fresh and thawed zzso zzso zzso zzso depleted zzso CB cells were zzso before and after gene zzso for colony formation in the presence of multiple growth factors in the absence and presence of zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso gene could be introduced into thawed zzso zzso zzso cells at an efficiency similar to that of fresh cells and that fresh cells zzso with the zzso gene could be frozen in a zzso state and recovered after zzso zzso integration, as assessed by zzso zzso confirmed the zzso colony zzso zzso integration was detected not only in primary zzso but also in zzso colonies in secondary dishes derived from zzso zzso cells zzso suggesting stable integration of the zzso gene into early zzso of zzso zzso This information may be of use zzso
