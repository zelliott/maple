Analysis of nuclear zzso enhancements in two-dimensional zzso zzso of the complex of zzso zzso zzso with a 14 base pair zzso operator zzso shows that the second zzso of the zzso binds in the major groove of DNA, as has been zzso The orientation of this zzso is approximately 180 degrees different from the proposed models and from that found in the X-ray structure of the 434 zzso zzso The model of the zzso zzso complex provides a good explanation for a large amount of zzso genetic and physical zzso
