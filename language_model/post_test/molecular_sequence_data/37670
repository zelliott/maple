zzso genetic studies have proposed that the zzso zzso zzso is one of a few animal groups with asexual lineages that has persisted for an zzso significant zzso This proposal is based on the exceptional zzso genetic divergence between studied sexual and asexual zzso Nevertheless, a conclusion of zzso zzso awaits a more comprehensive sampling of the collective global range of this zzso We assessed the breeding system and zzso of geographically divergent zzso populations using nuclear and zzso genetic zzso The zzso genetic structure of five populations (from Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, Florida and zzso showed marked zzso from expected random mating patterns zzso and among zzso frequent fixed zzso and reduced zzso zzso This pattern and the finding of multiple zzso zzso zzso indicated a zzso structure consistent with zzso origins for each zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso markers revealed strong geographical structure and yielded no cosmopolitan zzso zzso Australian sexual species formed sister zzso to a minority of the zzso zzso but pronounced zzso genetic divergence levels and zzso differences precluded their identification as convincing parental species to any of the zzso A majority of asexual lineages may have originated in areas where no sexual zzso are presently zzso The observed nuclear and zzso genetic structure is consistent with zzso zzso diversity being enriched by local zzso derivatives but zzso zzso cannot be ruled zzso
