Recent progress is summarized on the structure, function, and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso transport protein zzso from the rat liver zzso inner zzso The zzso has been zzso and its zzso function zzso A zzso clone zzso the zzso has been isolated and zzso thus enabling a deduction of the complete zzso acid sequence of this zzso zzso transport zzso zzso zzso analysis and sequence alignment indicate that based on structural considerations the zzso can be assigned to the zzso carrier zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence indicates six putative zzso zzso and has permitted the development of an initial model for the topography of the zzso within the inner zzso The questions as to whether more than one gene encodes the zzso and whether more than one zzso is expressed remain unanswered at this zzso Studies documenting a zzso zzso in the function of several zzso zzso zzso which can be reversed by treatment with insulin, provide a zzso relevant experimental system for studying the molecular zzso by which zzso zzso are zzso Potential future research directions are zzso
