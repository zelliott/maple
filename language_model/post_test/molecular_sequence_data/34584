zzso species are defined primarily on the basis of host preference and zzso of the zzso in zzso and in zzso However the zzso contains several species complexes that zzso such a broad range of zzso and pathological variation that the species name is of relatively little use either to the zzso or plant zzso zzso zzso primarily based on variable regions of the zzso DNA zzso zzso have indicated that these species complexes comprise a variable number of identifiable zzso zzso However zzso sequences often are insufficiently diverse to fully resolve such closely related zzso A group of zzso representing three species complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by using the high mobility group zzso sequence of the zzso mating type zzso which has been shown in other zzso to be especially suitable for distinguishing relationships among closely related zzso zzso were compared with those obtained from analysis of variable regions of the zzso as well as from standard zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved through analysis of zzso sequences correlated well with those obtained by analysis of zzso sequences but provided significantly better resolution among the various zzso zzso traits, including zzso size, colony appearance, spore size, zzso shape and size and host zzso frequently were unreliable as indicators of zzso zzso zzso shape and zzso shape more often were useful for this zzso
