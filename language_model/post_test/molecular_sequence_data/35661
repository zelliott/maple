The present experiments describe the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso in conscious zzso zzso rats, and we also examined the effect blockade of ETA receptors had on blood pressure in four experimental models of zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso zzso administered 5 or 60 zzso prior to zzso inhibited both the magnitude and duration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso response evoked by administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso response evoked by zzso zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso reversed the hypertension produced by an infusion of zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso produced a mild zzso effect in zzso to zzso models of hypertension, but no blood pressure lowering was observed in zzso models of zzso These studies demonstrated the selectivity of the ETA zzso zzso zzso for zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso does not appear to be a major contributing factor to the maintenance of elevated levels of blood pressure in four experimental models of zzso
