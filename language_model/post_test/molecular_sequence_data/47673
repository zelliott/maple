The chemical mechanism by which zzso zzso catalyze the synthesis of zzso remains unknown despite the recent zzso of the three-dimensional structures of two forms of the zzso zzso sector zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical information about the chemical events taking place at the zzso site of each zzso in the transition zzso In an earlier report zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Pedersen, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we provided evidence for transition state formation in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso analog with a zzso zzso geometry resembling that of the zzso of zzso in the transition state of zzso like zzso In the presence of ultraviolet light and zzso the zzso complex was zzso within the zzso zzso of a single zzso at zzso zzso implicating this zzso as within contact distance of the zzso of zzso in the transition zzso Here, we report that zzso although zzso transition state formation, is not zzso In the presence of zzso and zzso alone the zzso activity of the zzso zzso complex is inhibited to nearly the same extent as that observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not observed with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the presence of ultraviolet light and zzso the zzso complex is zzso also within the zzso of a single zzso at zzso 158 as confirmed by Western zzso analyses with two different zzso by zzso sequence zzso and by zzso of the amount of zzso zzso These novel findings indicate that zzso plays a pivotal role in transition state formation during zzso synthesis zzso by zzso zzso a role that involves both its preferential coordination with zzso and the repositioning of the zzso to bring the zzso zzso 158 into the zzso zzso A reaction scheme for zzso zzso depicting a role for zzso in transition state formation is proposed here for the first zzso
