zzso affinity maps of long zzso binding zzso in barley zzso obtained using a series of zzso of degree of zzso of zzso revealed zzso binding energies at the internal zzso zzso and -5 and at zzso zzso and zzso defining these zzso as binding zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso resulted in release or zzso of bound zzso thus zzso the affinities of other zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso The double zzso zzso displayed a hybrid zzso affinity profile, converting barriers to binding zzso These findings highlight the dynamic binding energy distribution and the versatility of long zzso derivatives in mapping extended binding zzso in zzso
