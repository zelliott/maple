zzso of zzso B and zzso in Southeast Asia has led to the establishment of new zzso zzso In our previous study, we found five samples suspected of being zzso between zzso B and zzso and here, we analyzed near full-length sequences of two samples and compared them to known zzso zzso B, and zzso Five overlapped segments were amplified with zzso zzso from zzso DNA, zzso and analyzed for zzso zzso The two Indonesian samples, zzso and zzso showed zzso patterns similar to zzso references from zzso with one short segment in the 3' end of the zzso zzso region, which was rather more similar to zzso B than zzso consisting of zzso zzso These results suggest zzso continuous diversification and spread of the zzso zzso in Southeast zzso
