zzso control in zzso results from the interplay between DNA sequences in zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso Selective control of gene expression can thus be achieved by zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of DNA binding zzso factors can be inhibited by competition with zzso zzso zzso that contain their specific recognition zzso The immediate early protein zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso is a zzso DNA binding protein that is essential for viral zzso We zzso zzso hairpin zzso zzso carrying zzso sites and demonstrated their ability to specifically zzso zzso Upon addition to zzso cells, zzso hairpin zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas a control hairpin zzso had no zzso zzso activity of zzso hairpin zzso was correlated to their relative binding zzso These results show that zzso zzso can compete for binding of specific zzso factors within cells, thus providing a potential therapeutic tool to control zzso zzso
