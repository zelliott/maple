A zzso zzso zzso zzso was adapted to screen for the ability of 20 zzso peptides to zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 and type zzso The procedure required minimal amounts of material, was zzso and was confirmed with standard zzso testing zzso In screening tests, with the exception of zzso a highly zzso and zzso zzso found in bee zzso the zzso peptides in our test panel zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused little viral zzso Several zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso zzso one or both zzso sometimes with remarkable zzso Two peptides were identified as having zzso activity against both zzso zzso (a zzso zzso from bovine zzso and zzso (a zzso found in zzso zzso The zzso activity of these two peptides was confirmed with standard zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso activity of zzso was maintained after reduction and zzso procedures that abolished its otherwise prominent zzso and zzso zzso
