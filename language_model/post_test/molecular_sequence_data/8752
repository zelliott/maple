zzso zzso is a low molecular weight protein zzso that stimulates the zzso conversion of zzso into zzso by human zzso A and also the conversion of zzso into zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso and Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the five known zzso proteins for the zzso zzso of zzso only zzso zzso is effective in stimulating the zzso of zzso However, the mechanism of action of zzso zzso is still not well zzso Using a unique zzso zzso as the zzso we were able to show that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso was specifically converted into zzso by zzso zzso while in the presence of zzso B, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was converted into both zzso and zzso Individual products generated from zzso by zzso zzso were identified by thin layer zzso negative secondary zzso mass zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso that recognizes the zzso zzso Our results clearly show that zzso zzso recognizes the zzso zzso in zzso Thus, zzso zzso may interact with the zzso structure of the zzso zzso and render the zzso and zzso zzso accessible to zzso A and zzso zzso
