A panel of zzso zzso were generated against the surface zzso zzso of the cell envelope of zzso zzso Four clones zzso were specific for the zzso zzso zzso and one clone zzso reacted selectively with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso pattern and binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were selected for further characterization of their zzso zzso In an zzso zzso zzso with rabbit zzso zzso zzso as the competing agents, the zzso of zzso and zzso were significantly inhibited by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were shown to be useful zzso agents by correct identification in slide zzso tests of 32 clinical zzso of all the zzso zzso and other zzso D zzso among a total of 140 bacterial zzso representing eight different zzso zzso zzso
