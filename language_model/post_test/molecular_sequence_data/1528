zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the regulatory factor X zzso complex is an zzso zzso factor required for the expression of zzso class II zzso zzso functions by binding to the zzso zzso box sequence located upstream of all zzso class II zzso Using a zzso scheme and a zzso zzso reporter system, the mechanism by which the zzso complex is transported into the nucleus was zzso The results have identified specific nuclear zzso signals zzso in both zzso and zzso that direct the nuclear zzso and expression of zzso class II zzso Additionally, a nuclear export signal was identified in the N zzso of zzso zzso was poorly localized to the nucleus, and no specific zzso was zzso Whereas zzso could import an zzso zzso zzso into the nucleus, it had no effect on the import of zzso The results suggest that although zzso and zzso could assemble before nuclear import, zzso association with the complex does not take place until after the zzso enter the zzso The identification of nuclear import and export sites on zzso molecules provides potential targets to zzso zzso class II zzso
