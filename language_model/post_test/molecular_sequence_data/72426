We have dissected the steps in zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation using zzso zzso DNA templates containing zzso at either zzso zzso or zzso were zzso These zzso are within the zzso region in the initiation zzso A zzso at zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso binding zzso whereas a zzso at zzso reduced binding affinity by less than zzso zzso initiation was completely blocked by zzso at zzso or at zzso A zzso at zzso inhibited neither binding nor the first zzso zzso bond but greatly inhibited further zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that DNA melting in the zzso zzso was greatly zzso indicating that zzso of zzso chain extension was a melting zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso may be due to zzso of zzso changes in the zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso is immediately upstream of the start site zzso open complex formation may have been completely inhibited by this zzso accounting for the zzso of zzso Thus, depending on their location, zzso zzso affected different steps in the initiation zzso We propose that promoter melting is progressive and that melting of one or two zzso upstream of the zzso site is sufficient for formation of the first zzso bond while further zzso chain extension within the promoter depends on greater upstream melting of the promoter, which may be required for stabilization of the initiation zzso
