The zzso zzso zzso an zzso of the human malaria zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The open reading frame carried by the zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso protein zzso zzso from various zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed functional characteristics of zzso such as zzso ability to undergo zzso zzso ability to zzso zzso basic zzso a classical zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso activity by a zzso zzso and zzso ability to be activated by zzso present in cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein allowed the identification of zzso that are important for zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso indicated that zzso is expressed specifically in zzso the form that is responsible for transmission of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso extracts activated zzso zzso more efficiently than extracts from asexual zzso which is consistent with this stage zzso Despite its overall high level of zzso to zzso zzso presents the zzso of not possessing the zzso zzso zzso motif usually found in zzso of this family; instead, it has a zzso at the same zzso This zzso feature formed the basis for a detailed analysis of the primary structure of zzso allowing us to define an operational zzso signature, which is shared by zzso The fact that no zzso from zzso diverge in the zzso motif suggests that the fine mechanisms of zzso regulation may offer an opportunity for zzso drug zzso
