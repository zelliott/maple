zzso III zzso zzso zzso is a pivotal zzso which zzso in branch formation by zzso of the synthesis of a zzso zzso structure in zzso These structures are thought to be one of the unique features of the zzso of neural zzso To examine the zzso role of zzso expression and its product in neural cells, its gene was zzso in rat zzso zzso cells which normally express a low level of zzso In the zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso analysis showed that some zzso showed increased levels of zzso zzso zzso Following treatment with nerve growth factor zzso the control cells showed zzso outgrowth for differentiation whereas the zzso showed no zzso response or change in the rate of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was detected at zzso zzso after zzso treatment in control cells, but not detected in the zzso zzso cells despite the intact binding of zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso with zzso treatment was not induced in the zzso zzso as compared with the zzso seen in control zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso gene in zzso cells affects some functions of zzso receptors such as zzso by zzso of zzso structures, and results in changes in the zzso signaling zzso of zzso zzso modified by zzso
