In order to monitor the influence of zzso compounds on the zzso physiology of fish, molecular markers for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso For this purpose, sequence information about the zzso zzso zzso and zzso had to be zzso By means of zzso a sequence zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alpha was cloned and zzso Continuous zzso of two zzso zzso gene products zzso and zzso were constructed by the help of expressed sequence tags of zzso and completely zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso and of the zzso showed significant similarities to corresponding zzso of other fish zzso zzso of these gene products was measured following exposure to zzso and compared with zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso technique to record gene expression in adult male zzso which were exposed to zzso in zzso zzso zzso As for zzso zzso all zzso genes investigated were expressed at considerable amounts from 24 h after onset of exposure to 50 zzso zzso to the end of experiment (17 zzso In zzso expression of the zzso zzso as well as zzso remained unchanged for the entire experiment, except for the individuals exposed for 17 days, which displayed elevated expression levels of zzso In the zzso experiment, male zzso were exposed to zzso in zzso from zzso zzso for 4 and 21 zzso zzso for zzso as well as zzso zzso alpha expression were found to be zzso zzso already after 4 d of zzso Extension of the exposure time to 21 days resulted in enhanced zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso whereas the detection limit could not be zzso In contrast, in zzso no induction of both zzso as well as zzso zzso expression was detected at any concentration zzso To examine zzso zzso at the zzso level, liver and zzso of males exposed to 25 zzso zzso were zzso Male zzso responded with a zzso reflected by the proliferation of rough zzso zzso and zzso apparatus typical of female zzso during zzso However, in zzso no signs of zzso were zzso rather, destructive phenomena like zzso of zzso cells by zzso cells were zzso Thus, in sexually differentiated males no zzso of the zzso tissue towards an zzso could be definitely detected at any level zzso
