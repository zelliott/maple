zzso is a small zzso zzso from sunflower seeds that is one of the most potent zzso zzso of any naturally occurring zzso and is related to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso are involved in the defense mechanisms of plants and also have potential as cancer zzso zzso At only 14 zzso acids in size, zzso is thought to be a highly zzso scaffold of the zzso active site region, and thus it is of interest to examine its important structural and functional zzso In this study, a suite of 12 zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso and their structures and activities have been zzso zzso incorporates a binding loop that is zzso together with a zzso bond and a secondary zzso loop making up the circular zzso We show here that the secondary loop zzso the binding loop to the consequences of sequence zzso In particular, full-length zzso have a zzso zzso that has been shown previously to be required for well defined structure and potent activity, but we show here that the zzso scaffold can accommodate zzso of this zzso and still have a well defined zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso Among the Ala zzso the most significant structural zzso occurred when zzso was zzso and it appears that this zzso is important in stabilizing the trans zzso bond preceding zzso and is thus a key zzso in maintaining the highly constrained structure of zzso This zzso acid zzso is thought to be involved in the zzso mechanism associated with zzso of zzso from its zzso acid zzso Overall, this zzso analysis of zzso clearly defines the zzso nature of the zzso scaffold and demonstrates the importance of the secondary loop in maintaining the active zzso of the binding zzso
