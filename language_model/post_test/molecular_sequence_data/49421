zzso is a dual specificity zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression is rapidly induced by zzso zzso stimulation in zzso and is involved in the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso To reveal the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso we isolated the mouse zzso gene and mapped its zzso start zzso zzso reporter plasmids containing zzso regions of the zzso gene were zzso zzso into zzso zzso The zzso using these cells revealed that the promoter region between zzso and zzso is required for zzso promoter zzso zzso analysis revealed E box and zzso elements in this region, and zzso shift zzso and zzso confirmed that both of these elements are essential for zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso We also zzso zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso stimulation caused zzso of zzso zzso and zzso at zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso with this, a zzso zzso zzso zzso A, increased zzso zzso gene zzso Finally, zzso I hypersensitivity site mapping revealed the zzso hypersensitivity site after zzso stimulation around the location of the E box and zzso zzso Altogether, our data indicated that the zzso of zzso gene zzso in zzso by zzso is associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
