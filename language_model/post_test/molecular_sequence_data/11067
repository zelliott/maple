Recently, we developed a simple method for detecting a zzso signal sequence zzso by a zzso zzso In this study, we used this method to select zzso clones zzso zzso proteins from a human full-length zzso zzso zzso analysis of the candidate clones revealed that one clone zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso The clone encodes a protein of 308 zzso acids of which the zzso region shows a characteristic feature of zzso zzso zzso seven zzso zzso zzso at the zzso preceded by a putative processing site composed of a basic zzso acid zzso The corresponding transcripts are highly expressed in the zzso so the novel protein may play an important role in zzso
