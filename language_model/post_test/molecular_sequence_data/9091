The zzso process of zzso formation is essential for the folding of most zzso and membrane proteins in the zzso zzso zzso It is driven by electron relay pathways that transfer two electrons derived from the fusion of two adjacent zzso side chains onto various types of chemical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso that reduce molecular oxygen to generate an zzso zzso represent one of these zzso In zzso two family members exist, zzso and zzso 

The two zzso zzso zzso differ in zzso and zzso regulation, tissue distribution, and zzso zzso A specific zzso interaction between either zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso the propagation of zzso from zzso via zzso to nascent zzso and zzso zzso shutdown mechanisms in zzso and zzso prevent excessive zzso of zzso 

Besides zzso generation, zzso also regulates calcium release from the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso through its zzso association with the zzso zzso This review explores the functional repertoire and possible zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso analyses of different knockout mouse models will be the most promising strategy to shed new light on unique and zzso roles of zzso and zzso Moreover, in-depth characterization of the known physical interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso family members will help broaden our functional and zzso understanding of zzso zzso
