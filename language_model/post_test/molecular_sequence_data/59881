The zzso wolf was thought to have been zzso in the zzso peninsula when the sudden appearance of a few animals in southern Sweden was reported in zzso These wolves founded a new Swedish population which currently numbers at least 25 individuals, one of the world's smallest populations of the zzso The sudden occurrence of the founder animals caused speculation that these had not appeared by zzso means but rather were Swedish zoo animals deliberately released by zzso To zzso if this was the case and to zzso the genetic status of this small and isolated population, we assessed nuclear and zzso zzso genetic zzso in wild and captive zzso zzso using zzso typing and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso The new population was found to be zzso for a zzso zzso which also was present in the Swedish zoo zzso A total of four different zzso zzso were found among all captive and wild wolves (including two animals from an occasional establishment of a few wolves in northern Sweden in the late zzso with a maximum sequence divergence of zzso Despite the zzso zzso animals from the zoo population could most likely be excluded as founders for the wild population since the latter group of animals displayed several unique zzso zzso zzso zzso not found in the zoo zzso Moreover, a zzso analysis of individual zzso using zzso zzso sharing as distance measure, placed all wild animals on a branch separated from that of the captive zzso The average degree of nuclear zzso as well as zzso diversity was similar in the wild and the captive zzso respectively, but was lower than that reported for zzso populations of zzso zzso zzso has declined in wild wolves born in recent years suggesting that this small population is currently suffering from a loss of genetic zzso due to zzso zzso depression is documented in captive wolves and the long-term survival of the wild Swedish population may therefore depend on immigration of animals from zzso This study illustrates the usefulness of zzso for zzso close genetic relationships and for addressing the genetic status of zzso
