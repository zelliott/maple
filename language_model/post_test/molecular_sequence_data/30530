The environments of the binding zzso in zzso zzso zzso in which zzso or zzso is zzso bound to the zzso group of zzso 101, were investigated by chemical modification and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso 62 in each of the native and the modified zzso was zzso The yield of the zzso zzso from the zzso modified with zzso at zzso 101 zzso was considerably lower than those from native zzso and from the zzso modified with zzso at zzso 101 zzso These results suggest that zzso 62 in zzso is less susceptible to zzso zzso analyses of the zzso 62 and zzso zzso modified zzso indicated that the zzso of zzso 62 in the native zzso zzso or zzso decreased the sugar zzso affinity at zzso C while increasing the binding free energy change by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although the profile of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso spectrum for zzso was not different from that for the native zzso the zzso zzso resonance of zzso 62 in zzso was apparently zzso in comparison with that of native zzso These results suggest that the environment of zzso C in zzso is considerably different from those in native zzso and zzso The zzso zzso attached to zzso 101 may contact the sugar zzso binding site of the zzso affecting the environment of zzso zzso
