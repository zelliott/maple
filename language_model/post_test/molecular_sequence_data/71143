A function for zzso zzso growth factors has been implied for early zzso patterning events in zzso zzso zzso zzso operates via the zzso zzso cascade that can directly activate the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso We have recently provided evidence for a critical role of zzso zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report on the identification of the zzso zzso protein zzso that is expressed in a pattern overlapping with the ones of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in the induction of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso results in disturbed eye zzso In the animal cap zzso zzso expression of zzso is found to interfere with zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso but not with the zzso response to zzso
