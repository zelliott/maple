To further zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso hormonal regulation of the promoter activity of this gene was zzso An approximately zzso zzso zzso spanning the promoter region of the gene was zzso and the zzso start site was determined by zzso and zzso protection zzso A major start site was localized at zzso zzso to the translation initiation zzso zzso and a zzso binding sequence characteristic of zzso specific genes was found at zzso to zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated this site to be zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso promoter (from zzso to zzso directed zzso expression in zzso cells, a zzso cell line, but not in the zzso cells that normally do not express zzso While zzso all zzso and zzso alone zzso enhanced the reporter gene zzso each of these substances was found to act as a synergistic zzso in the presence of zzso Additional deletion and zzso analyses demonstrated a functional zzso response element at zzso to zzso Two functional zzso response elements and a zzso response element were found in an zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso Interestingly, it is suggested that the zzso zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso functions as a zzso of zzso response element as well as a zzso of one of the zzso response zzso
