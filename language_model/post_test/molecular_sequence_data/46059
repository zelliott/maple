zzso migration zzso factor zzso is an zzso ancient and highly zzso zzso with multiple zzso In the present study, a zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso based on expressed sequence tag zzso analysis and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was of zzso consisting of a zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso a 3' zzso of zzso with a zzso tail and an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso 111 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso and a theoretical zzso point of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shared zzso similarity with those of other known zzso A zzso zzso domain was identified in the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were also found to be present in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is one of zzso zzso The tissue distribution and zzso expression of zzso in zzso of zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulation were detected by real-time zzso zzso gene was zzso expressed in six selected zzso of healthy zzso with the higher expression levels in zzso mantle and zzso In comparison with the control group, the expression of zzso zzso in zzso was zzso significantly at zzso zzso and zzso after zzso treatment, and at all time points after zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso mature zzso of zzso was zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso promoted sheep zzso migration into scraped spaces in zzso These results generated from the present study encourage us to suggest that zzso was a novel member of zzso family, and it was involved in immune response and wound healing by promoting zzso zzso
