In this study, a method for zzso directed in zzso zzso was zzso It includes the following steps: clone of the gene to be zzso into the zzso zzso preparation of single strand zzso design and synthesis of zzso zzso synthesis of double strand zzso Using this method, a new zzso site was originated at the N terminal of zzso and zzso site at the C terminal of zzso It is ready to fuse the zzso gene to zzso This method is a very useful tool for genetic zzso
