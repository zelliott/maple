The zzso proteins are defined as markers of zzso zzso zzso They zzso to a set of proteins specifically located in the zzso organizer regions zzso but have not yet been clearly zzso We adapted the specific detection method of the zzso proteins to Western blots in order to identify these zzso Using a zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso the present study brings the first direct evidence leading to the identity of one zzso zzso We found that zzso is specifically revealed by zzso zzso Using different zzso fragments generated by zzso zzso and by zzso in zzso coli, we demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso and not the zzso of the protein is involved in silver zzso Moreover, as the pattern of zzso does not vary using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso we conclude that the reduction of the silver zzso is not linked to the zzso state of the zzso We propose that the concentration of zzso zzso acids in the zzso domain of zzso is responsible for zzso zzso This hypothesis is also supported by the finding that zzso zzso acid peptides are silver zzso These results provide data that can be used to explain the specificity of zzso zzso Furthermore, we clearly establish that zzso of the zzso zzso part of zzso occurs in zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso part of the zzso We argue that this zzso occurs in zzso as already proposed, bearing in mind that zzso is present in the zzso and in the zzso component of the zzso whereas no zzso zzso is observed in the latter zzso zzso
