The zzso protein has been identified as the prominent component of the zzso zzso of the zzso plaques found in Alzheimer's disease zzso In this paper, the DNA zzso pattern of the promoter region of the Alzheimer's disease zzso precursor gene zzso was assessed using the recently developed zzso sequencing technique with zzso zzso We analyzed seven potential zzso sites between position zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Three of the zzso zzso we analyzed are located in the zzso regions of the zzso binding site and zzso response element consensus zzso Of the seven zzso zzso present in this region, we found none to be zzso This finding indicates that, in healthy brain zzso zzso zzso of this binding motif seems not to affect zzso zzso However, it remains to be determined whether zzso of these sites is significant in zzso zzso
