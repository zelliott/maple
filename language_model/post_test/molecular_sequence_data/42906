We report the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso Four zzso repeats are located within this upstream zzso zzso and dating of these four zzso zzso as well as of the four zzso elements present within the human zzso structural zzso were zzso zzso of the eight zzso repeats found in the human zzso locus has apparently occurred at four different times during the zzso zzso zzso Considering that zzso repeats are zzso throughout human DNA with an average spacing of 4 zzso the presence of eight such repeats within the zzso zzso gene region and, in particular, of four of them in the zzso region upstream of the structural zzso appears quite zzso
