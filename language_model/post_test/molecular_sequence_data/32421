zzso zzso an zzso zzso that is the zzso agent of zzso is exposed to elevated amounts of highly toxic zzso oxygen species during tissue zzso In this work, we report the molecular zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA, of the genes zzso and zzso respectively coding for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The genes were expressed in zzso coli cells, and the corresponding zzso proteins were zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso as a functional zzso pair that, together with zzso mediate the zzso reduction of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed that this detoxifying system could be operative in zzso zzso add value to the zzso project information and advise reconsideration of key zzso pathways operating in zzso zzso
