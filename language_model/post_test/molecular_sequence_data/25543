A novel neural surface zzso Bravo, shows a pattern of zzso restriction in the embryonic chick zzso zzso Bravo is present on the developing zzso fibers in the zzso however, retinal zzso in the zzso do not display zzso The appearance of Bravo in zzso is modulated by environmental zzso zzso growing out from retinal zzso on retinal zzso zzso their natural zzso express Bravo, whereas such zzso growing on collagen do zzso zzso zzso provide a valuable system to characterize the mechanism of Bravo zzso as well as the cellular signals controlling zzso Bravo was identified with zzso zzso from a collection generated against exposed molecules isolated by using a selective cell surface zzso zzso The zzso sequence of Bravo shows similarity with zzso a neural surface zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso This possible relationship to zzso together with its restricted appearance, suggests an involvement of Bravo in zzso growth and zzso
