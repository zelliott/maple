zzso zzso channels zzso are members of the zzso channel family, which includes channels that are opened directly by the neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso or zzso Although there is general agreement that the second zzso domain zzso lines the zzso the position of the gate in the zzso is less zzso Here, we used zzso zzso accessibility method zzso to provide new evidence for a centrally located gate that moves during channel zzso In the closed state, three zzso zzso located on the zzso side of zzso were modified by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, 13 zzso zzso were modified in the open state with zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso three to four zzso was consistent with an alpha zzso structure for the middle and zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modification of two zzso acids in the center of zzso with three different zzso zzso prevented channels from fully closing in the absence of zzso Our results are consistent with a model in which the central region of the zzso zzso domain is zzso in the closed state and moves during channel zzso
