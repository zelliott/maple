A zzso zzso protein has been found in large amount in human seminal plasma and identified as a zzso zzso Its zzso by a modification of a three-step zzso procedure developed in an attempt to purify a zzso from the same fluid, provided about 15-18 zzso of pure protein from 100 zzso of seminal zzso Despite its ability to bind a zzso zzso during the affinity step, the zzso protein did not display any zzso zzso activity in a standard zzso with zzso zzso as zzso It showed an apparent molecular weight of 76 zzso and resulted to be quite similar, if not zzso to human milk zzso in many zzso Its zzso sequence zzso zzso acid zzso starting with zzso was identical to that of one of the zzso truncated zzso zzso isolated from human zzso Moreover, the zzso acid sequence of a number of zzso which represented about zzso of the entire zzso has been also shown to be identical to that of the corresponding peptides of human milk zzso Double diffusion analysis revealed full recognition by zzso zzso milk zzso of the human seminal plasma zzso Using zzso analysis, both human milk zzso and human seminal protein were recognized by zzso zzso zzso When tested for its iron binding capacity, with zzso as iron zzso the protein zzso was able to bind iron up to zzso zzso as judged by zzso at 465 zzso
