The zzso form of zzso zzso displays on its surface the zzso zzso zzso The central domain of this protein possesses a reiterated zzso sequence zzso zzso and greater than zzso of the zzso zzso obtained from individuals living in malaria endemic areas recognize zzso within this repeat zzso Considering the highly repetitive structure of this naturally occurring zzso and its zzso we were interested in analyzing the structural diversity of zzso that bind to the zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso heavy and light chain zzso was performed for five zzso that produce zzso with binding specificity for the zzso zzso These zzso were produced in zzso mice by zzso with whole zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and Northern zzso showed that for heavy chain, three zzso used zzso elements that belong to the zzso family and two to the zzso zzso Four different V zzso zzso were represented among the light zzso Different D and J zzso segments are also zzso while four heavy chain gene zzso involved the zzso zzso These results indicated that multiple zzso gene combinations can code for zzso to the zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso response to this zzso region is structurally zzso
