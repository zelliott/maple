zzso interactions between the zzso acid zzso protein zzso of the human zzso virus, type 1 and the zzso zzso are essential for virus zzso Studies on the mechanism of action of zzso require a direct zzso of its complexes with zzso acids and the determination of binding zzso To facilitate these zzso fluorescent zzso derivatives were developed by introduction in the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso obtained by a zzso synthetic zzso Three fluorescent zzso derivatives were obtained by introducing this zzso acid at different zzso As shown by zzso the three-dimensional structure of zzso is not altered by introduction of zzso The fluorescent peptides were found to be as potent as their precursors in interacting with zzso acids and in promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, because of their fluorescent properties, these zzso can be used at zzso zzso to directly zzso and zzso zzso acid interactions in solution or after gel zzso This could facilitate the development of new zzso agents aimed at zzso the functions of zzso and studies on the zzso traffic of zzso within the zzso zzso
