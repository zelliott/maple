zzso I zzso zzso zzso in DNA by forming transient zzso zzso zzso These zzso complexes can accumulate in the presence of damaged DNA or zzso drugs that either zzso or lie in the minor zzso Recently we reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso group of zzso block zzso at a preferred zzso site ( approximately zzso approximately ) and cause zzso of zzso products at remote zzso In the present study, we have found that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which lies toward the zzso bond in the minor groove, blocks normal zzso whereas the zzso zzso which zzso away from this bond, allows normal zzso but blocks zzso In contrast to zzso the pair of zzso zzso zzso DE zzso at zzso which zzso from the minor groove either between zzso or between zzso allow normal zzso but block zzso Both zzso zzso DE zzso at zzso suppress normal zzso as do both groove bound zzso DE zzso at this zzso These studies demonstrate that these DE zzso provide a novel set of tools to study DNA zzso and emphasize the importance of contacts between the minor groove and zzso zzso zzso
