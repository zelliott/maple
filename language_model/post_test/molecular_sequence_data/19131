zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a marine solar zzso of zzso The cells of the strain were zzso and zzso in distilled water, stain zzso and formed zzso zzso It was zzso and required at least zzso zzso and zzso zzso for growth under the optimum growth temperature of zzso The major polar lipids of the strain were zzso zzso PG zzso zzso zzso PG zzso and two major zzso zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Trace amounts of two unidentified lipids were also zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strain zzso was closely related to the members of zzso of the family zzso with similarities of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of the zzso gene similarity to the members of zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso showed low zzso zzso with two most related members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso properties suggest that strain zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
