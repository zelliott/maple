The zzso protein is one of several zzso shell proteins which are responsible for zzso zzso formation and stabilization within the zzso layer of the Pacific red zzso zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso as zzso exists as an unfolded sequence and possesses the capability of zzso calcium zzso crystal growth in zzso via growth step frustration or zzso However, very little is known with regard to the interactive capabilities of this sequence with zzso and with calcium zzso Using multidisciplinary techniques, we determine that the zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso at the zzso sequence zzso yet retains its zzso zzso zzso structure in the presence of zzso zzso Further, zzso experiments reveal that the extended structured sequence blocks, zzso zzso and zzso exhibit zzso chemical exchange, and/or backbone geometry zzso in response to zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso magic angle spinning studies verify that during the course of in zzso calcium zzso crystal growth, zzso becomes bound to zzso fragments and cannot be entirely displaced from the mineral fragments using competitive zzso zzso Finally, using a scrambled sequence version of the zzso zzso we observe that sequence scrambling does not adversely affect the crystal growth zzso activity of zzso suggesting that the zzso acid composition of zzso may be more critical to growth step zzso than the linear ordering of zzso zzso
