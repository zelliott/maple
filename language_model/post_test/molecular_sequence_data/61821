zzso of the factors involved in host defense against human zzso viral infection remains pivotal if viral control may be zzso Toward these ends, we investigated the function of a putative zzso factor, zzso isolated by differential display of zzso from zzso type zzso primary human zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso sequence contains 13 adjacent zzso zinc finger zzso a zzso box, and is localized to both zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that both the zzso box and zinc finger regions of zzso are responsible for the zzso zzso activities of this zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso following zzso type I infection and diminished progeny zzso zzso A mechanism for this zzso activity was by suppression of zzso type 1 zzso viral long terminal repeat promoter zzso Our findings suggest that one possible function of zzso is as a zzso type zzso zzso zzso
