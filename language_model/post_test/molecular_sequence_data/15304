zzso and nitrate reduction regulatory zzso proteins are bacterial zzso factors that coordinate the switch between zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso binds a zzso cluster zzso by zzso 23, 29, zzso promoting the formation of a zzso active zzso In the presence of zzso zzso is converted into a zzso zzso form containing a zzso zzso The reaction of the zzso cluster with zzso has been shown to proceed via a zzso process, an zzso zzso zzso to yield a zzso intermediate with release of 1 zzso zzso followed by spontaneous zzso to the zzso form with release of 1 zzso and 2 zzso zzso Here, we show that replacement of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso enhances zzso activity of zzso in zzso The zzso protein incorporates a zzso cluster with zzso properties similar to those of zzso However, the substitution enhances the stability of the zzso cluster in the presence of zzso zzso analysis shows that both steps 1 and 2 are slower for zzso than for zzso A molecular model suggests that step 1 of the zzso zzso cluster reaction with zzso is inhibited by shielding of the iron zzso zzso suggesting that zzso or the cluster iron bound to it is a primary site of zzso zzso These data lead to a simple model of the zzso switch with zzso implications for the ability of zzso proteins to operate over different ranges of in zzso zzso zzso
