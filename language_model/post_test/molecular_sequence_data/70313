The attempts at identifying precise replication origins zzso in zzso DNA have been pursued mainly through zzso and zzso approaches, in view of the essential failure of the search for autonomously replicating sequences in cultured zzso These approaches involve the mapping of short stretches of nascent DNA, the identification of the regions where either leading or lagging strands switch zzso or the zzso of replication zzso by two-dimensional gel zzso Due to the complexity of animal cell zzso most of these studies have been performed on amplified zzso and with the use of synchronization zzso The results obtained have been zzso In order to avoid the use of experimental procedures potentially affecting the zzso mechanism of DNA zzso we have developed a method for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso growing zzso This method zzso the absolute zzso of the abundance of selected DNA fragments along a zzso region within samples of newly zzso DNA by competitive zzso chain reaction zzso the latter is immune to all the zzso variables which severely affect the zzso of conventional zzso The application of this method to zzso zzso zzso replication precisely identifies the known zzso zzso Using the same approach, we have mapped an zzso for zzso DNA replication in a zzso locus of human zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso
