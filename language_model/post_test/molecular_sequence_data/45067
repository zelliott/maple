zzso selection is a long-standing problem in protein zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso It is well known that many zzso carry multiple zzso that can be zzso However, it has seldom been addressed whether one zzso is preferred for zzso zzso when all other zzso zzso Here we studied the mechanism underlying zzso degradation of zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso degradation of zzso can be zzso by six different zzso Interestingly, we showed through in zzso and in zzso zzso that zzso zzso is selected for zzso when all other zzso are zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a preferential zzso site chosen from a group of zzso susceptible for zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain constitute a portable degradation zzso The implications of our data are zzso
