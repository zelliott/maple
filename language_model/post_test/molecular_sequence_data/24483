The secondary structures in zzso often cause early termination during the synthesis of zzso In an attempt to determine the zzso region zzso of the gene zzso using the zzso zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso we found that reverse zzso skipped over the zzso zzso secondary structures and continued the DNA synthesis through zzso adapter sequences without early zzso A zzso of only three zzso upstream of the zzso translation initiation zzso was obtained from the initial zzso which was much shorter than the zzso zzso obtained from the zzso library zzso Analysis of the zzso end sequence indicates the presence of high zzso content and zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso of the reaction with high temperature zzso degrees zzso and a zzso reverse zzso were performed to zzso the zzso zzso which was determined to have 73 zzso in the zzso These results suggest that, under zzso synthesis conditions at 42 degrees C and 60 degrees C, the reverse zzso skipped over the zzso structures of zzso zzso and continued the zzso synthesis until they reached the zzso adapter zzso zzso draws attention to adopting zzso conditions for zzso synthesis on zzso zzso zzso
