Juvenile zzso zzso is an X linked zzso zzso disorder for which the basic molecular zzso is zzso The gene for zzso has been previously zzso by linkage analysis to zzso and the locus order zzso zzso zzso To improve the resolution of the genetic map in the zzso region, we have isolated a highly zzso zzso at zzso which displays at least nine zzso with a zzso of zzso Using this zzso and four other zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we performed zzso and zzso linkage analysis in 14 zzso with zzso The zzso was also typed in the zzso zzso zzso du zzso zzso reference zzso Tight linkage was found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso Our linkage results combined with data previously reported suggest that the zzso cluster is located less than 2 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso reported here will be a very useful marker for further linkage studies with zzso as well as with other diseases in this region of the X zzso
