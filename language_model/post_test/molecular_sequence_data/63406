zzso encodes a zinc finger protein that is involved in zzso gene zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso where it recruits its target zzso resulting in their zzso or repression via zzso zzso The function of zzso is controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso at its C zzso affecting cell cycle zzso Using in zzso labeling of zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso we identified four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that the zzso of individual zzso acids determines the affinity of zzso toward zzso derived from zzso In zzso experiments demonstrated that targeting of zzso to zzso is regulated by zzso The ability of zzso to bind the upstream regulatory elements of its known target gene terminal zzso zzso was decreased by zzso of two zzso zzso In zzso zzso acts as a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of differentiation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso plus zzso results in zzso repression of zzso zzso This process has been associated with increased binding of zzso to the upstream regulatory element of zzso zzso analysis of in zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso during induction of zzso differentiation and that zzso is responsible for increased DNA binding affinity of zzso toward the zzso zzso We propose a model zzso zzso zzso of zzso at specific zzso acids controls the zzso zzso of zzso as well as its ability to regulate zzso expression during zzso zzso
