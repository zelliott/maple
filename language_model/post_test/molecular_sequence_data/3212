The ability to gain access to iron is pivotal for bacterial pathogens during zzso Although much is known about iron acquisition systems in zzso bacteria, comparatively little is known about how zzso pathogens access iron from host iron zzso A previous study showed that, in the zzso human pathogen zzso zzso a cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is capable of binding human zzso representing a potential means by which this zzso is able to access iron in zzso We have investigated this property of zzso zzso further and shown that, in zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed on the zzso zzso cell surface independent of zzso iron zzso and that zzso and zzso Gap, although retaining zzso activity, has no affinity for human zzso Moreover, although a zzso zzso gap zzso was devoid of zzso and zzso zzso activity, it retained the ability to bind human zzso equivalent to wild zzso We concluded from these results that the Gap protein is not involved in zzso zzso binding to human zzso We identified the zzso protein as a novel cell zzso zzso designated zzso for zzso zzso protein A, which shared no significant similarities with any other bacterial zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso cell zzso motif zzso and expression of zzso in the cell wall was strictly controlled by zzso iron zzso The zzso gene is found within a 7 zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso that contains a total of six zzso zzso Immediately downstream from zzso is an zzso gene whose product was predicted to be another cell zzso protein with no significant similarity to proteins with characterized zzso zzso in the opposite direction from zzso is a zzso zzso whose expression is also regulated by zzso While the deduced products of the first two genes lack similarity to known zzso the last two genes zzso respectively, putative zzso and zzso components of an ABC zzso that shares significant similarities with several zzso ABC zzso in a variety of zzso
