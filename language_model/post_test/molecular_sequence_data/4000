To evaluate the importance in anterior segment zzso of genetic variation in zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso factor specifically expressed in the zzso 

The zzso of mice zzso for a zzso in the zzso domain of zzso was examined from zzso zzso and DNA binding by the zzso protein was investigated by zzso zzso zzso from human patients with zzso anomaly was zzso amplified and zzso 

The zzso lens zzso zzso of zzso was found to zzso a protein unable to bind zzso zzso zzso of mice zzso for zzso have zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is variable but typically consists of the equivalent of zzso anomaly in humans, with central zzso zzso zzso zzso and, in some cases, anterior polar zzso In a small cohort zzso zzso zzso of patients with zzso anomaly, shown to be normal in the zzso zzso one individual was found to be zzso for a zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso which does not occur in 116 zzso from a control population, zzso zzso for zzso 90 at a highly zzso position in the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in a mouse model causes anterior segment zzso similar to zzso zzso Although causality could not be shown in the human case, the presence of a rare, zzso substitution in zzso of a patient with zzso anomaly is interesting, in light of the zzso similarities with the zzso zzso
