zzso zzso zzso plants expressing the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for the biological activity of the zzso zzso from one resistant and three susceptible transgenic lines were zzso with in zzso zzso defective interfering zzso zzso a small zzso zzso which requires only the virus zzso for zzso Only zzso of susceptible transgenic lines were able to sustain the replication of zzso zzso whereas zzso of the resistant line were zzso The zzso of the resistant line was recovered from transgenic cells, zzso and shown to be intact and functional, which suggests that this is not a case of dysfunctional zzso zzso resistance to transgenic plants as a zzso negative zzso Plants of the transgenic line resistant to zzso were shown to be susceptible to two other zzso artichoke zzso zzso and zzso Italian zzso zzso Since the resistance is specific and zzso correlated to the level of expression of the zzso it appears to be a form of zzso zzso
