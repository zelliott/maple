zzso are organized into distinct zzso termed protein zzso that are often associated with diverse zzso These modular units can act as binding sites, areas of zzso zzso and sites of complex zzso The human zzso zzso gene product is organized into discrete zzso that together catalyze the zzso degradation of class I major zzso complex heavy zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso quality control zzso in order to dispose of class zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso region is the class I binding domain, whereas the zzso zzso can be referred to as the degradation zzso In the present study, we examined the role of the zzso zzso domain in zzso class I zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso domain with that of the zzso zzso completely blocked the ability of zzso to induce class I zzso A more precise zzso revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso domain differ in their ability to trigger class I zzso zzso the data support a model in which zzso class I degradation occurs as a highly regulated process where the zzso zzso domain and zzso tail work in concert to eliminate class I zzso Host factors, including a signal zzso complex, probably associate with the zzso zzso in a coordinated fashion to create a zzso complex to promote the extraction of class I out of the zzso The results imply that the zzso quality control machinery may recognize and eliminate zzso proteins using a similar zzso regulated zzso
