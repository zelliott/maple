We present an analysis of the evolutionary rates of the zzso c zzso zzso I genes of primates and other zzso Five zzso genes were zzso and this information was combined with published data from other zzso The sequences from zzso primates show approximately twofold increases in their zzso substitution rate compared to those from other primates and other zzso The species range and the overall magnitude of this rate increase are similar to those previously identified for the zzso c zzso zzso II and zzso b zzso
