zzso of diseased cells is the basic event leading to death in individuals with zzso zzso of zzso requires that zzso cells migrate from the site of the primary zzso into the circulation system, escape from the zzso and form secondary zzso at novel zzso These processes depend to a large degree on zzso zzso We show here that multiple copies of the short zzso module zzso from human or zzso zzso zzso proteins effectively inhibit cell zzso on two zzso zzso and suppress soft zzso colony formation of zzso melanoma and zzso cells of zzso and human zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso for 30 days results in the formation of zzso zzso The repeat displays true modular zzso resulting in increased zzso effects in direct correlation with the increase in number of zzso Our results demonstrate that the role of zzso in the signature profile of zzso cells is that of a mechanical zzso of the zzso zzso which interferes with zzso turnover by binding at a unique interface along the zzso zzso
