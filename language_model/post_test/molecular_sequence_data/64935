A spot zzso zzso method to detect and identify all members of the zzso zzso is zzso It involves a zzso zzso in which the combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified part of the zzso region of zzso followed by a zzso zzso amplification that increased specificity and sensitivity of zzso zzso species differentiation was achieved by subsequent restriction zzso zzso The sensitivity of the method was increased further when along with one primer containing many zzso another zzso primer in which zzso were zzso by zzso was zzso The zzso primer was shorter than the zzso primer and with lower zzso resulting in higher overall amplification efficiency due to the increased stability of the zzso zzso With this strategy, highly zzso zzso containing many zzso can be used effectively to improve detection sensitivity, alleviating problems of zzso duplex zzso that can occur due to many zzso zzso This method can be useful on the diagnosis, zzso investigation, and zzso of known and unidentified zzso zzso
