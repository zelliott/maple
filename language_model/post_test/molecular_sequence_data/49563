The zzso role of zzso protein zzso zzso has been controversial, because it is considered to be a protein required for zzso zzso zzso transport from zzso to zzso as well as a neutral zzso zzso zzso The similarity between the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and between their gene structures indicate that zzso as well as other alternatively spliced zzso zzso belong to the zzso storage zzso protein family, containing also some differentiation zzso Using a specific zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso with neutral zzso droplets stained by Nile red, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso was also detected in milk, associated to milk zzso zzso zzso zzso agents induced zzso and zzso synthesis in zzso cells, which was significantly inhibited by protein zzso C zzso zzso indicating the involvement of zzso B and zzso zzso factors in this process, while protein zzso A zzso inhibitor had only a modest zzso zzso Cell differentiation induced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso demonstrating its strong involvement in cell zzso zzso synthesis was higher in M than in zzso zzso in control, zzso and differentiated zzso This data shows that zzso is a neutral zzso zzso zzso and its expression is regulated by zzso and zzso zzso
