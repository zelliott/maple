zzso are zzso proteins that are critical for regulating neurotransmitter release in zzso In the present study, two crystal structures of the C domain of rat zzso I zzso in complex with zzso and zzso reveal that this protein can form a zzso and that a flexible loop (the zzso zzso contacts bound zzso Further experiments were carried out on a protein zzso the A, B, and C zzso of rat zzso I zzso An zzso zzso of zzso is observed during zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso results also indicate that the A and B zzso exist in an extended zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding to zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso loop and a zzso contact are important for zzso zzso The evidence supports a view of zzso I as an zzso zzso protein made up of zzso that have a flexible, extended N zzso
