The zzso locus zzso the zzso zzso zzso is defective in zzso forms of zzso zzso This locus has been mapped to zzso zzso We report cloning and characterization of this locus which comprises 13 zzso spanning greater than 35 zzso of the zzso The zzso locus exhibits consensus sequences for transcription, zzso and zzso The putative promoter region was localized in a zzso island zzso to zzso I and was shown to direct expression of a zzso reporter gene in cultured zzso Of interest is the observation that the first zzso occurs within the zzso untranslated region, and no zzso separate the zzso targeting sequences and the mature zzso An zzso zzso zzso was localized within the coding sequence and can be zzso using the zzso chain zzso These studies describe the structure of the zzso and provide a foundation for characterization of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
