The exact role of a zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the underlying mechanism of its involvement in tumor zzso have not been zzso We have now demonstrated that zzso of zzso promotes pulmonary zzso of zzso zzso zzso and Lewis lung zzso cells and that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso their zzso indicating that the zzso activity of zzso requires its zzso zzso zzso of zzso in these cells promoted tumor zzso and invasion, shedding of the zzso precursors of zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso while zzso of zzso inhibited these zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate the zzso and zzso zzso fragments containing at least one zzso motif and that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso can inhibit pulmonary tumor zzso These fragments also inhibited zzso zzso zzso induced by soluble zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso status of zzso determines its effect on tumor zzso and that the zzso and the zzso fragments likely inhibit tumor zzso by zzso regulating the availability and activity of soluble zzso zzso and zzso
