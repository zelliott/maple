The results of experiments aimed at detecting zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter region as well as comparisons of two published DNA sequences indicated that two similar but distinct copies of this region exist in the human zzso zzso zzso specific for amplification of each of the related sequences were developed and new zzso clones corresponding to each of the two promoter regions were isolated from zzso zzso zzso analysis of the clones and specific zzso products reveals two similar zzso arrangements of head-to-head zzso The zzso gene is closely zzso to a gene structure that is similar but not identical to zzso and the zzso gene is zzso to a gene structure that has strong similarity to zzso but also significant zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso clones located in the vicinity of zzso indicates that these similar promoter regions are elements of a direct zzso New hypotheses for genetic mechanisms that may be involved in breast and zzso cancer zzso are raised by the identification of this duplicated genetic structure on zzso zzso
