We describe zzso a patient presenting with bilateral zzso zzso breast tumors who was enrolled in a clinical trial exploring molecular aberrations associated with zzso tumor cell zzso zzso zzso week) hormonal therapy with the zzso inhibitor zzso substantially reduced proliferation as measured by zzso zzso in one zzso whereas the second was essentially zzso zzso molecular and genetic zzso of the two tumors yielded divergent zzso in the two zzso an zzso zzso zzso in the responsive tumor and an amplification of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso locus in the zzso zzso These findings provide an insight to possible mechanisms of resistance to zzso therapy in zzso breast zzso First, they illustrate the necessity of clinically approved zzso to identify zzso gene amplification, which occur in approximately zzso of breast tumors and have been linked to zzso zzso It is quite possible that the addition of zzso zzso to zzso therapy will yield a superior zzso effect and improved patient zzso Second, they suggest that the role of zzso zzso in zzso although rare in breast cancer, may need to be explored in the context of zzso breast zzso
