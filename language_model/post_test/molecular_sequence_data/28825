The presence of the zzso zzso entry mechanism was investigated in zzso zzso In zzso zzso were treated with zzso in zzso medium for 3 h to zzso zzso calcium zzso After restoring zzso zzso a large calcium influx was measured by using the calcium indicator dye zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso A similar zzso zzso influx could also be detected with the zzso technique after zzso zzso zzso zzso In both cases, zzso the zzso permeable channel zzso completely blocked the influx caused by store zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction cloning using zzso that were designed based on mouse and human zzso sequences revealed that zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso As in other cell types, the zzso zzso entry mechanism might help in zzso the zzso stores after the release of zzso from the zzso Further investigation is needed to determine whether the zzso channel serves as the zzso zzso entry zzso in zzso zzso or is simply activated by the zzso zzso zzso entry mechanism and thus contributes to zzso zzso
