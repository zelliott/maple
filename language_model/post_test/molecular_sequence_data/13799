West African populations are infected with divergent strains of human zzso virus type 2 zzso some of which are closely related to zzso zzso virus zzso and it has been zzso that the zzso epidemic might have arisen by zzso spread of zzso into the human population in West zzso To gain some insight into the possible basis for cross protection between these two closely related zzso the zzso responses to 15 synthetic peptides from zzso gag synthetic peptides were investigated in seven zzso subjects and in seven healthy zzso zzso zzso to at least one of the synthetic peptides tested was found in all patients and a statistically significant correlation between zzso zzso absolute numbers and the number of reacting peptides was zzso A marginal zzso zzso was found in two of the healthy controls zzso In conclusion, this preliminary evidence that zzso patients exhibit zzso responses to zzso gag peptides suggests that both viruses share zzso zzso in the gag viral region and raises the possibility of cross protection between zzso and zzso which may be relevant for zzso vaccine research based on closely related zzso
