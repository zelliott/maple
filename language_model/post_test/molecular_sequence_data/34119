zzso zzso zzso zzso adults and zzso were collected during June and July 2009, at five sites on zzso Island and two sites on zzso Island, Georgia, to assess genetic diversity within and between zzso All but three specimens were found in a zzso zzso The entire length zzso zzso of the zzso zzso II zzso gene was zzso for each zzso Twelve zzso were identified, nine from zzso Island and three from zzso zzso No zzso were shared between the two islands, indicating there is limited or no movement of gene flow between the zzso zzso relationships among the zzso were determined using both zzso and maximum zzso zzso The zzso trees from both analyses were similar, with no distinct zzso on either tree devoted to zzso from a single zzso A zzso network structure was determined using zzso zzso analysis, which produced two zzso networks, one containing only specimens found on zzso zzso The second network included specimens from both islands, with the ancestral zzso from zzso zzso This pilot study is the first to highlight zzso populations in the zzso United States using the zzso zzso II zzso zzso and indicates strong population structuring along the Georgia zzso
