zzso cells provide the zzso support and zzso necessary for the process of zzso and have a central role in male sex zzso zzso of zzso cell specific gene products provides insight into the unique functions of this zzso cell zzso The current study reports the identification of a novel zzso cell gene product that is termed zzso cell specific gene zzso The zzso zzso sequence shows no zzso to any of the known gene sequences in the zzso zzso Some zzso was found with short sequences in the expressed sequence tag zzso zzso A motif analysis demonstrates a signature to an zzso binding protein sex lethal zzso involved in zzso sex zzso The expression pattern of zzso was examined with reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Northern zzso zzso zzso expression was found to be specific to the zzso and absent in other zzso zzso In the zzso the approximate zzso zzso transcript was localized to the zzso zzso A zzso spliced form of zzso was also identified by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso structure analysis demonstrates the presence of at least three zzso with zzso sequence zzso between mouse and rat zzso Treatment of cultured zzso cells with zzso stimulating hormone zzso significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso The potential role of zzso in zzso cell function was investigated with the use of a zzso promoter reporter zzso zzso expression is a marker of zzso cell differentiated zzso An zzso zzso to zzso significantly inhibited zzso and zzso induced zzso promoter zzso while control zzso had no zzso In zzso a novel gene product expressed primarily by zzso cells, zzso was identified with a potential zzso binding protein motif similar to sex lethal that appears to have a role in maintaining hormone zzso zzso actions in zzso zzso
