zzso between zzso zzso pathways is a functionally important and widespread phenomenon in cell physiology across zzso In the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso via parallel zzso of both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which interact on multiple zzso We have determined the molecular identity of a link between both pathways that mediates a zzso rise of zzso zzso Whereas zzso of zzso via zzso is largely independent of zzso zzso synthesis by zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The existence of a zzso zzso is supported by zzso data and a molecular zzso We have cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso the first blowfly zzso and confirmed its expression in the zzso zzso via reverse zzso followed by zzso chain zzso The putative gene product of zzso zzso is a zzso type I zzso and shows highest zzso to zzso from zzso Thus, a zzso zzso serves as a link between the zzso and the zzso zzso pathways in the zzso zzso of the blowfly and might be important for the amplification and zzso of the zzso zzso
