Many zzso zzso crystal zzso particularly those active against zzso insects, have zzso extensions that mediate zzso crystal zzso These zzso are only soluble at high zzso pH in reducing conditions such as generally found in the zzso zzso Most of the Colorado potato zzso zzso toxins lack such an extension, yet some toxins with a zzso extension have cryptic activity against this zzso revealed only after in zzso zzso Crystal formation, zzso protein content, and activity against zzso were compared for two sets of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso both with and without a zzso zzso zzso with or without extension, formed flat square or zzso zzso zzso (with zzso and its zzso without extension formed irregular inclusion zzso All zzso and zzso zzso and inclusion bodies were almost equally active before and after in zzso zzso and could be zzso in diluted zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso were zzso under these zzso Our results suggest that zzso crystal formation typical for proteins with a zzso extension may zzso activity against zzso but that interfering with this crystal formation can increase the zzso
