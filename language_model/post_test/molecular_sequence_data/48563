The zzso translation initiation factor 2 zzso is central to the onset of protein synthesis and its zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso exchange to deliver the zzso zzso to the zzso Here we report that assembly of the zzso complex in zzso depends on zzso a cell proliferation protein zzso among zzso zzso of zzso in budding zzso reduced the association of zzso zzso diminished zzso levels, and increased zzso expression indicating that zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso complex, and the zzso domain III region of zzso was both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso of the binding site revealed a strict correlation between zzso zzso the biological function of zzso and its ability to assemble with zzso and zzso Interestingly, high levels of zzso neutralized the assembly zzso and restored the biological function of an zzso zzso Moreover, the combined zzso of zzso zzso rescued an otherwise zzso zzso deletion zzso Thus, zzso is a specific zzso assembly factor indispensable for the onset of protein zzso Human zzso is zzso by a disease risk zzso and, therefore, zzso zzso control by zzso may prove relevant for normal cell physiology and human zzso This work identifies a novel step in the zzso translation initiation zzso and assigns a zzso function to a protein that is essential for growth and viability of zzso zzso
