The gene for zzso is located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with in zzso capped primary transcripts indicates a zzso initiation site in the zzso region of the gene for zzso zzso extension experiments show the presence of precursor transcripts covering zzso and adjacent sequences up to a zzso initiation site 181 or 180 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence at this zzso initiation site contains the consensus motif derived for putative promoters of zzso protein and zzso coding genes in zzso zzso This sequence similarity suggests that zzso zzso and zzso can be transcribed from zzso promoters in plant zzso
