The zzso skeleton of zzso derives from the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso analysis has demonstrated that the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all required for zzso zzso Their zzso relationship is, however, poorly zzso Because zzso expression in the zzso starts slightly later than that of the zzso zzso we asked whether zzso is one of their downstream zzso Our analysis of zzso zzso zzso mice supports this hypothesis, as zzso expression in the zzso is lost in the absence of both zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso activates the zzso promoter in a zzso manner and that this activity is enhanced in the presence of zzso and/or zzso Furthermore, by zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso experiments, we demonstrate that zzso can bind the zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso present in the zzso promoter, binds the zzso protein in zzso and is necessary for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso genes are required for zzso expression in the zzso and suggest that the mechanism by which the zzso proteins exert this function is through direct zzso of the zzso zzso
