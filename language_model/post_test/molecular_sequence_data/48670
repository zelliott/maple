zzso zzso zzso the first zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and many other zzso In this study, we cloned a zzso zzso full-length zzso gene from zzso zzso by using zzso zzso primer zzso zzso and the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The zzso contains a zzso zzso coding region zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso shares about zzso % zzso acid identity and 83 % zzso acid identity with zzso Furthermore, zzso sequence analysis demonstrated that zzso gene contains one zzso and two zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso was also cloned by zzso zzso zzso zzso and a group of putative zzso elements such as zzso box, zzso box, G box, zzso repeats, zzso motif and zzso were zzso The zzso was detected in all zzso zzso with high abundance in bulbs at leaf zzso stage and in petals at blooming zzso Besides, zzso drastically responded to zzso zzso and zzso moderately responded to zzso and zzso and a little increased under zzso zzso of zzso expression and zzso expression demonstrated that zzso can be more significantly induced than zzso under the above treatments, and zzso transcripts accumulated prominently at blooming stage, especially in zzso while zzso transcripts did not accumulated significantly at blooming zzso All these results suggested that zzso might play distinct roles in different branches of the zzso zzso
