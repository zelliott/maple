zzso proteins play major regulatory roles in the organization and integrity of the zzso zzso In zzso a specific zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso However, recent studies demonstrate that zzso displays a widespread distribution in a variety of zzso cell zzso These proteins have been found in human zzso and in several transformed cell zzso The zzso family of zzso is formed by a set of molecular species that share common zzso zzso There is a single gene that contains several zzso zzso for the six different zzso zzso in zzso zzso Alternative zzso of a common zzso transcript as well as zzso modifications contribute to its zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso differ from one another by having either three or four repeats in their zzso half, and a variable number of zzso in their zzso zzso These repeats have been shown to constitute zzso zzso In this review some relevant aspects of zzso function and its regulation are zzso Three major topics are zzso The first one focuses on the zzso roles in regulating the interactions between zzso with zzso filaments and with intermediate filament zzso Another problem deals with the question of whether zzso zzso segregate into functionally different zzso of zzso in zzso zzso or zzso associates with these zzso in a random zzso The third question that emerges is the involvement of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso The regulation of the interactions of zzso a recently discovered zzso zzso with the zzso during development of zzso zzso is zzso
