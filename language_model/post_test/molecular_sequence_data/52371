zzso expression of zzso zzso toward zzso zzso was studied using human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso were challenged with human zzso for varying zzso up to 120 zzso after which the cells were fixed with zzso zzso and zzso human zzso were added to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso increased within 15 zzso after zzso exposure, and the response persisted up to 120 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso surface was zzso by increase in the specific binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso expression was zzso at zzso zzso zzso exposure and decayed to zzso levels within 90 zzso In contrast, zzso activity increased at 30 zzso and remained elevated for 120 zzso after zzso zzso The initial zzso zzso was dependent on zzso expression since zzso zzso occurring within the first 30 zzso after zzso challenge was inhibited by zzso zzso The later prolonged zzso zzso was zzso dependent since this response was inhibited by zzso zzso and to the same degree by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso The initial zzso expression and zzso zzso responses were reproduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso which comprised the zzso zzso created by zzso zzso action on its zzso However, zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso did not cause zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was protein synthesis independent since zzso expression and zzso zzso were not inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, Northern zzso analysis indicated absence of zzso zzso signal up to 180 zzso after zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso involves zzso and zzso zzso The initial zzso zzso zzso is zzso by rapid zzso expression via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is stabilized by a protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity which enables the interaction of zzso with the zzso beta 2 zzso on zzso
