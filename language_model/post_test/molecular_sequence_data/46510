zzso zzso an invasive zzso that causes crop damage worldwide, is a highly differentiated species complex, divided into zzso that have mainly been defined based on zzso DNA zzso Although zzso can potentially induce population zzso specialization and indirect selection on zzso studies have largely ignored these influential passengers in zzso despite as many as seven bacterial zzso have been zzso Here, we investigate the composition of the whole bacterial community in worldwide populations of zzso together with host genetic zzso focusing on the invasive B and Q zzso Among zzso individuals zzso more than zzso of them zzso at least one secondary zzso and multiple infections are very zzso In addition, sequence analyses reveal a very high diversity of zzso zzso in zzso with some bacterial zzso being represented by more than one zzso In the B and Q zzso nine different strains of bacteria have been zzso The zzso zzso of zzso also reveals a very high zzso diversity that partitions the two ITS zzso (B and zzso into six zzso genetic zzso Each genetic group is in linkage zzso with a specific combination of zzso All together, our results demonstrate the rapid dynamics of the bacterial zzso associations at a small evolutionary scale, questioning the role of zzso communities in the evolution of the zzso zzso species complex and strengthening the need to develop a zzso theory of inherited zzso
