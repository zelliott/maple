The comparison of the rat zzso zero gene promoter sequence with that of known zzso zero genes showed a high evolutionary conservation of regulatory elements involved in the control of the zzso zzso of the zzso This finding suggests that the regulation of zzso zero gene expression is also controlled by a very zzso mechanism within zzso In order to confirm this hypothesis, we destroyed three major zzso elements in the zzso zero gene promoter by zzso zzso and showed that these zzso affect significantly the activity of this promoter in cell lines representative of different zzso classes zzso zzso zzso birds, and zzso We concluded that zzso zero gene activity, which is a zzso regulated process, has been under a great selective pressure during evolution to ensure the expression of the protein at crucial periods of zzso zzso One of these zzso the zzso box, helps to define within zzso zzso genes those zzso zzso zzso Indeed, it is only present in the zzso promoter region of zzso zero and zzso zzso zzso Regarding this feature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso they appear closer to the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes than to those zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This observation suggests that zzso zzso zero and zzso are members that zzso from the main group of zzso zzso before the zzso zzso zzso and that the regulation of zzso zzso zzso genes has probably evolved toward a coordinate regulation with that of core zzso zzso
