A zzso zzso zzso probe, based on partial zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso was used to screen a zzso library prepared from zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso was isolated that proved to contain the coding sequence for the zzso zzso The gene is zzso bases long and codes for a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence obtained showed zzso zzso and zzso identity of sequence with those of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It showed zzso identity with one of the gene products tentatively identified as zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither the zzso acid compositions nor the aligned zzso acid sequences provides any obvious clue as to the origin of zzso stability in this group of zzso
