zzso zzso zzso de zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with a broad host zzso The fungus produces zzso long-term survival and dissemination structures that serve as the primary source of zzso during seasonal crop infection zzso zzso we report the first zzso analysis of zzso zzso A total of 88 protein spots were observed by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso to exhibit significant zzso differences in abundance at three representative stages of zzso development, and the identities of these proteins were established using zzso The proteins were classified into several functional categories including zzso energy, zzso and protein fate, cell defense, zzso and proteins with as of yet unknown zzso In addition, proteins involved in the process of zzso were found to be zzso abundant during zzso development, as was the zzso zzso zzso This study provides a starting point towards achieving a comprehensive understanding of the proteins and molecular events associated with zzso zzso
