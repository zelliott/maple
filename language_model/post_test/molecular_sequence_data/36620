Using zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as towards the zzso and zzso regions of their shared zzso zzso peptides representing various portions of the precursor were isolated from extracts of canine zzso In total, seven peptides were isolated, two of which had not been previously zzso One was the zzso tail of the precursor zzso and the other was the tail zzso extended zzso to include zzso zzso zzso zzso By comparing the measured zzso for each of the identified zzso it was established that processing at the three zzso zzso sites within the precursor did not occur to the same zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso N was approximately zzso complete, that between zzso and the tail was approximately zzso complete, and that between zzso N and zzso was approximately zzso zzso Three zzso proteins were also identified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso extended zzso N zzso zzso zzso extended zzso zzso zzso and the entire zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso tail and large molecular zzso N were the primary products of processing for this precursor in canine zzso while minor products included zzso zzso zzso tail, and large molecular zzso
