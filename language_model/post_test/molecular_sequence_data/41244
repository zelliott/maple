Although various kinds of metal binding proteins have been constructed by de zzso design, the creation of a zzso metal binding site remains especially zzso The purple copper site in zzso II of zzso referred to as the zzso site, has two copper zzso bridged by two zzso zzso We constructed the zzso site consisting of two zzso and two His zzso in a de zzso designed zzso zzso zzso The protein bound two copper zzso and exhibited a purple color, with relatively intense zzso bands at zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso spectrum displayed unresolved zzso zzso in the zzso region, which was similar to the native or engineered zzso site with an zzso zzso zzso The extended X-ray zzso structure analyses of the protein revealed the presence of the zzso core structure, with two typical zzso bonds per core at zzso zzso two S zzso bonds at zzso zzso and the zzso bond at zzso zzso which are also characteristic structures of a purple copper zzso
