I have investigated the effect on bovine zzso zzso spectrum of charged zzso acid changes in the putative zzso zzso A total of 14 zzso zzso were constructed at 6 zzso acid zzso 83, 86, zzso 134, zzso and zzso Two of these positions are occupied by charged zzso acids that are zzso in all four human visual zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the four variable positions, single and double zzso were constructed to reproduce the zzso distribution of charged zzso acids predicted for each human cone zzso Following zzso in zzso and zzso with zzso the zzso difference spectrum of each zzso was determined in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are all surprisingly close to that of native bovine zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso ruling out a significant role for these zzso in spectral zzso
