A new zzso zzso zzso primer set was designed for detection of zzso zzso zzso of methane zzso bacteria from four different zzso namely rice zzso soil, freshwater zzso zzso bed, and sludge from wastewater treatment zzso This primer set showed high specificity and efficiency in recovering zzso bacteria from these diverse zzso The obtained sequences showed zzso and zzso similarity to zzso and zzso acid zzso respectively, with the known zzso zzso zzso According to the zzso principal coordinates analysis zzso DNA sequences retrieved by the new zzso primer set in this study formed a separate group from the reported zzso indicating higher diversity of zzso in the zzso This newly designed zzso primer is capable of amplifying not only the currently known zzso bacteria but also those that have not been reported, providing new information on the ecological diversity and distribution of this group of zzso in the zzso
