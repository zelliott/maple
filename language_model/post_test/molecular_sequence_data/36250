zzso pancreatic zzso cells and zzso cells, an zzso derived cell line, have at their cell surface an zzso zzso similar to that found at the surface of chick neural zzso cells and at the rat zzso zzso On zzso cells and zzso cells the zzso is zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso directed against the zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by measuring their effect on zzso of zzso and zzso cells to an immobilized zzso zzso In this experimental paradigm zzso zzso completely inhibit zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that pancreatic zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and under the control of a tightly zzso cell surface zzso
