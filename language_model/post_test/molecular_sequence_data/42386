The physical ends of zzso zzso form a specialized zzso complex composed of DNA and DNA binding zzso This zzso complex, termed the zzso is essential for zzso zzso In most organisms, the DNA portion of the zzso complex consists of simple tandem DNA repeats with one strand zzso zzso The protein portion of the complex is less well zzso The experiments presented in two recent papers represent different stages in the characterization of the zzso DNA binding zzso The first paper presents a zzso study of the zzso zzso DNA binding proteins and the second paper shows the identification and initial characterization of a zzso DNA binding activity from zzso zzso These two reports provided valuable information in understanding the structure and function of zzso
