zzso zzso which promote zzso by zzso cells zzso by means of targeted delivery of zzso to particular DC subsets, represent a powerful vaccination zzso To ensure immunity rather than tolerance induction the zzso of a suitable zzso is zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso cannot ensure that all cells targeted by the zzso zzso are appropriately zzso Furthermore, zzso cells zzso that do not present the desired zzso are equally strongly activated and could prime zzso responses against zzso zzso therefore, were interested in exploring targeted zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso in form of zzso zzso for the induction of zzso zzso In this study, we report on the assembly and characterization of zzso consisting of zzso zzso the model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that such zzso are more potent at inducing zzso T zzso zzso responses than control zzso mixed with soluble zzso However, our study also reveals that the zzso acid zzso of such zzso zzso alters their binding and zzso and allows delivery of the zzso and the zzso to cells partially independently of zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso are superior to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso responses and efficiently induce zzso immunity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A better understanding of the role of the zzso zzso is required to inform future zzso vaccination strategies for efficient induction of zzso zzso
