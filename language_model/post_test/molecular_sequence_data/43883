The zzso growth factor zzso is vital for normal development and plays a role in zzso The level of zzso of this zzso by transforming growth zzso zzso is controlled, in part, by the rate of zzso of the zzso zzso In the characterization of the zzso zzso promoter by zzso I zzso a zzso pair element zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso designated zzso I, was found that was specifically protected by nuclear proteins from human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I was essential for the zzso expression of the zzso gene as indicated by deletion and zzso zzso zzso I consists of two zzso zzso a zzso regulatory element zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso regulatory element zzso zzso to zzso Both elements were able to form specific complexes with protein from zzso cell nuclear extracts and are necessary for the full activity of the entire zzso pair zzso zzso Competition and zzso studies determined that the zzso contains a binding site for the zzso factor zzso while the protein that binds to the zzso has yet to be zzso When linked upstream to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter, the zzso I enhanced zzso up to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of an zzso expression zzso was able to activate zzso from the zzso construct in a zzso zzso These results further our understanding of how zzso zzso is zzso
