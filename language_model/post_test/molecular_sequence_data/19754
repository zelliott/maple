zzso zzso T cells contribute to effective virus control through a zzso of mechanisms including direct zzso functions as well as zzso for B cell and zzso T cell zzso Here, we have used the zzso zzso virus zzso system to assess the minimal constraints of a dominant zzso zzso T cell zzso We report that the core zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso is 11 zzso acids in length and provides optimal recognition by zzso zzso T zzso Surprisingly, this zzso is also recognized by zzso zzso T cells and thus constitutes a unique viral zzso with dual zzso class zzso and zzso
