zzso clones zzso the precursor of the zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso membrane have been isolated from a pea leaf zzso library in zzso zzso 11, following screening with zzso to zzso pea zzso zzso zzso zzso The longest zzso insert of 880 zzso encodes a zzso of 230 zzso acid zzso of which 50 zzso constitute an zzso zzso zzso and 180 zzso make up the mature zzso zzso and translation of the zzso in zzso produced a zzso of 26 zzso which was efficiently imported by isolated pea zzso and processed to the mature 20 zzso zzso Southern zzso to pea zzso DNA indicated the presence of a single gene zzso the zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso
