The zzso zzso zzso of 21 zzso were zzso and aligned with five published zzso zzso When the zzso was used as an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be statistically significant zzso zzso Although little resolution was obtained among the zzso zzso the zzso sequences support a zzso relationship between birds and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 11 zzso also were zzso although the zzso results were zzso In contrast to previous studies, deletion or zzso of zzso sites were found to have little effect on zzso zzso zzso evidence for zzso relationships is zzso showing that three genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso support a zzso relationship, compared with one gene zzso zzso that favors a zzso zzso Separate analyses of four other genes zzso A, zzso insulin, and zzso zzso and a combined analysis of all sequence data are inconclusive, in that different groups are defined in different analyses and none are strongly zzso It is suggested that until sequences become available from a broader array of zzso the molecular evidence is best evaluated at the level of individual zzso with emphasis placed on those studies with the greatest number of zzso and zzso When this is done, a zzso relationship is most strongly zzso When regarded in combination with the zzso evidence for this association, it must be considered at least as plausible as a zzso zzso
