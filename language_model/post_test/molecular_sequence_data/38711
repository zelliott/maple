zzso of particular zzso zzso to have a role in active site architecture can alter the overall zzso of DNA zzso by zzso The effects of this kind of substitution were determined in a zzso zzso using zzso reverse zzso with specifically zzso zzso We found that the reported higher zzso of zzso incorporation by the zzso and zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso was not reflected in a substantial increase in the overall zzso for these zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso an almost zzso level of overall zzso frequency was observed, while the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed only a twofold decrease in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed a slightly lower zzso than zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso showed a zzso higher zzso compared to the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso substitution rendered the zzso substantially more zzso for DNA zzso These results correlate with three-dimensional structural studies of the zzso active site and confirm the zzso impact of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the overall zzso of DNA zzso by zzso zzso
