zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen of humans that encodes two genes that resemble the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso and three genes that resemble the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Of these, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso is an zzso zzso zzso In the current study we developed a strategy to identify genes that are directly regulated by zzso We systematically altered a zzso binding site zzso zzso upstream of a target promoter to identify zzso that are essential for zzso activity in zzso and for zzso binding in zzso We constructed 34 zzso zzso containing altered zzso boxes, and measured binding affinity for zzso These experiments allowed us to identify a consensus zzso binding zzso Several hundred similar sequences were identified, some of which were adjacent to probable zzso Several such promoters were fused to a reporter gene with and without intact zzso zzso This allowed us to identify four new regulated promoters that were induced by zzso and that required a zzso box for zzso zzso zzso expression of all four promoters was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to each of these sites in zzso mobility shift zzso
