zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso family which has been detected from human to zzso In contrast to the conventional zzso and zzso which are expressed zzso expression of zzso zzso in skeletal muscle, and the zzso for zzso is at least zzso more abundant than zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso The unique feature of zzso is that it zzso rapid and exhaustive zzso with a zzso of less than half an zzso To zzso the nature of specific and abundant expression in skeletal muscle, and to proceed toward gene targeting zzso we have cloned and characterized mouse and rat genes for zzso and compared them with that of the human zzso The sequence comparison among three zzso species revealed several zzso regions including possible zzso factor binding zzso Furthermore, mouse and rat upstream regions of zzso are zzso over 3 zzso suggesting that expression of zzso in skeletal muscle of both zzso is similarly zzso
