The zzso acid sequences of the regions zzso the structural proteins of zzso zzso and five zzso two zzso of the family zzso have been zzso The properties predicted by computer analysis zzso zzso are also correlated along this zzso and aligned to the zzso determined zzso structure of two zzso It can thus be assumed that the zzso structure of the unique zzso coat protein matches that of the zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso In this model, the spatial locations of two zzso motifs characteristic of zzso are in close vicinity, at the external surface of the zzso The coat proteins of zzso and zzso may thus share a common evolutionary zzso A zzso analysis was made using the multiple zzso allowing a better understanding of the molecular relationships between these two groups of zzso
