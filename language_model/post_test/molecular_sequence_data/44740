zzso zzso is an important cause of AIDS-related opportunistic infection, manifest as zzso zzso The clinical treatment of choice is the synergistic combination of zzso agents, zzso and zzso of which the latter targets the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the isolation of the gene zzso this activity in zzso zzso The zzso sequence contains an open reading frame interrupted by five zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with an zzso of zzso zzso analysis revealed that, in addition to zzso the predicted protein contains a second zzso function, zzso zzso zzso This zzso immediately precedes zzso in the folate zzso zzso The zzso arrangement of the zzso zzso zzso gene is the same as that observed in the related zzso zzso zzso zzso and confirms previous zzso data that these activities were zzso Recently, specific zzso within zzso motifs of the zzso gene of zzso zzso have been identified which give rise to zzso drug zzso Analysis of seven clinical zzso of zzso zzso did not reveal any similar zzso in this limited sample of organisms that had been subjected to drug zzso
