The structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso at high and low zzso zzso have been solved at zzso and zzso zzso Both structures are very similar and the active site contains both zzso and zzso at equal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the product zzso yields the same zzso Two zzso are coordinated within the active site with different zzso and zzso The zzso at the zzso site has a distorted zzso geometry and is present at zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds with distorted zzso zzso with only partial occupancy, and coordinates with zzso the zzso involved in zzso When the zzso site is occupied, the side chain of zzso adopts a position that is zzso for zzso indicating that this site may not be occupied under zzso conditions and that zzso may occur via a zzso zzso The geometry of the zzso site suggests that it is possible for zzso to be activated for zzso by zzso to nearby zzso rather than by metal zzso The 16 zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso overall sequence zzso However, zzso zzso has an inserted zzso zzso that causes the zzso site to diminish in size, consistent with its reduced metal zzso zzso is present in zzso and plant zzso but not in the zzso from other organisms, indicating that there are two zzso of zzso
