We have isolated and zzso a novel zzso human fetal brain zzso zzso a fatty zzso protein zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed small amounts of a zzso transcript in adult human brain and a shorter transcript in skeletal muscle, but no message was detected in other zzso zzso On the other hand, it was abundantly expressed in fetal brain but not in fetal zzso liver or kidney zzso The elevated level of transcript at immature stages and its subsequent decline In adult brain indicate that the zzso protein may be essential for development of the human zzso
