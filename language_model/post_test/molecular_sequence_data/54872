Nerve growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso type A zzso are a well studied zzso duo involved in zzso survival and zzso The only previously reported zzso sensory zzso caused by an zzso zzso zzso zzso and the pathology caused by zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso share only some clinical zzso A zzso Arab family, where five of the six children were completely unable to perceive pain, were mentally zzso did not zzso could not discriminate temperature, and had a chronic zzso is reported zzso The condition is linked to a new zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso linkage and standard sequencing techniques were used to identify the zzso zzso Using zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cells, the cellular and molecular consequences of the zzso were zzso 

The zzso gene produced a precursor protein zzso that was unable to differentiate zzso zzso zzso was not zzso from cells as mature zzso 

Both the clinical and cellular data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is a functional zzso The zzso zzso is extended to zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso and zzso zzso are parts of a zzso spectrum caused by changes in the zzso zzso zzso
