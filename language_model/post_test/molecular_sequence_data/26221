The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein implicated in the regulation of neural development in zzso and zzso pattern in zzso Using a zzso strategy, we isolated zzso zzso six novel, related proteins that are expressed in fetal zzso zzso proteins are of similar molecular masses zzso zzso and share between 50% and zzso of zzso zzso All contain a putative zzso signal zzso and comparative analysis reveals 83 absolutely zzso zzso acid zzso including 21 zzso zzso were detected throughout fetal development by Northern zzso zzso zzso examination of the expression of two of these genes by in zzso zzso revealed complex zzso and spatial patterns of zzso All new zzso family members are expressed in adult zzso particularly in brain and zzso These data support the view that the zzso family constitutes a large family of signaling peptides with diverse roles in mouse zzso
