It is often assumed that zzso acid zzso outside a protein zzso site have no effect on the zzso of a protein zzso with zzso especially zzso zzso zzso zzso that exert an effect on the zzso of a protein zzso with zzso are frequently considered to be within the zzso site of the zzso To test this zzso two zzso zzso and zzso were prepared by zzso with a synthetic zzso corresponding to region zzso of the alpha chain of human zzso zzso The zzso was used as an zzso in its free form zzso without zzso to a zzso so that the results will not be made ambiguous by zzso modification nor by an immune response to sites spanning zzso and protein zzso In addition to their reaction with human zzso the zzso were also studied with four zzso zzso which had no zzso within region alpha zzso and only a limited number of zzso which occurred outside of, and at considerable distances in three-dimensional zzso structure from, this zzso zzso studies revealed substantial differences in the binding affinities of some of the zzso zzso relative to human zzso Some of the zzso caused major decreases in zzso although they were at considerable distances in the zzso structure from the indicated site zzso It is concluded that zzso in a zzso even when distant from an zzso site, can exert major influences on the zzso zzso with zzso zzso
