The zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested for zzso The zzso was very inefficient, and only zzso of zzso was transformed to its zzso zzso Surprisingly, the percentage of zzso of zzso was increased to zzso when 1 zzso of zzso was added to the reaction mixture (6 zzso Other zzso such as zzso and proteins were examined to see if they also zzso zzso of zzso and it was found that most of the zzso tested, except zzso zzso did indeed enhance zzso zzso The zzso reaction was almost saturated in 30 zzso and only zzso of zzso was zzso at 37 degrees C for a zzso reaction, indicating that zzso of zzso was in zzso trapped inactive zzso Time courses for the reaction of the zzso zzso were also measured in the presence of zzso an zzso or zzso zzso of zzso which had already reached a plateau of zzso zzso increased gradually after the addition of the zzso zzso The zzso rate constant for the zzso reaction in the absence of an zzso was comparable to that in the presence of zzso indicating that the zzso molecules do not affect the chemical step of zzso These results demonstrate that a variety of zzso zzso can induce zzso change of the zzso even in such a low concentration as zzso zzso This zzso change may occur by zzso collisions, or zzso weak interactions between zzso and zzso zzso a molecular crowding effect may cause the zzso zzso
