zzso acid bacteria zzso are considered fastidious zzso because they are difficult to isolate and zzso Different molecular approaches were taken to detect zzso diversity, independently of their capacity to grow in culture zzso Those methods were tested in samples that originated during traditional vinegar zzso zzso diversity was assessed by analysis of zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso of DNA extracted directly from the zzso zzso zzso composition was analyzed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso separation of zzso containing region zzso of zzso zzso gene and cloning of those zzso zzso bands and clones were grouped based on their zzso pattern similarity and zzso to be compared with reference zzso The main zzso identified in vinegar was zzso zzso which at the end of the zzso process was considered to be the only zzso zzso The diversity was the highest at zzso zzso acid, where indefinite species of zzso zzso were also zzso
