All living species require protection against the damaging effects of the zzso oxygen species that are a natural zzso of zzso zzso In most organisms, zzso is a critical component of these zzso maintaining a reducing environment inside zzso Some bacteria, however, including zzso zzso use an alternative low molecular mass zzso compound called zzso zzso for this zzso zzso that zzso zzso are attractive candidates for the design of novel zzso drugs because of the importance of zzso for zzso life and the absence of such zzso in zzso We have determined the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso a zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis that zzso the second step in zzso zzso The structure, determined at zzso resolution by X-ray zzso zzso zzso reveals an zzso fold in which zzso pack against a zzso mostly parallel zzso Large zzso emanating from the C zzso of the zzso zzso a deep zzso which is the location of the putative active zzso At the bottom of this cavity is a zzso site associated with a sequence motif zzso that is zzso in all zzso An zzso bound zzso zzso used in zzso enables us to model the binding of the true zzso and propose a zzso zzso model for zzso zzso comparisons indicate that zzso is representative of a wider family of zzso that act on zzso zzso zzso including a zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso anchors in zzso
