The zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results from zzso in the type zzso collagen gene zzso on zzso zzso Typically, there are zzso zzso site, or nonsense zzso on both zzso In this report, we describe a patient with zzso who was zzso for a new zzso zzso zzso in zzso 3 of zzso However, sequencing of parental DNA showed that although the patient's mother was a zzso carrier of this zzso the father's DNA contained only zzso zzso zzso marker analysis confirmed zzso and zzso of 28 zzso spanning zzso 3 revealed that the affected child was zzso for every marker tested with all zzso originating from a single maternal zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso in this patient is due to complete maternal zzso of zzso 3 and reduction to zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso To our knowledge, there are no published reports of zzso zzso zzso in zzso moreover, this case represents only the third example of zzso of zzso 3 to be zzso The severity of the zzso in this case was similar to other affected individuals and no additional zzso abnormalities were observed, suggesting an absence of zzso imprinted genes on zzso zzso
