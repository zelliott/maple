zzso zzso in the diet not only zzso oral zzso producing an zzso sensation, but also interact with dietary proteins and zzso zzso in the gut, resulting in a variety of zzso and toxic zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso which are zzso into the oral zzso form complexes with and zzso dietary zzso and thus, they constitute the primary zzso defense directed against zzso zzso In order to characterize the interaction, zzso studies were performed which involved zzso a series of zzso into a synthetic zzso zzso zzso The results show that the zzso mode of association is a zzso stacking of the zzso ring against the zzso face of zzso and that the first zzso zzso of a zzso sequence is a particularly favored binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicates that the larger and more complex zzso interact more strongly with the zzso zzso the order of binding affinity was determined as zzso zzso B-2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso Smaller zzso can bind with one zzso ring stacked against each zzso zzso whereas larger zzso occupy two or three consecutive zzso The more complex zzso interact with the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso moreover, they zzso or stack when zzso Thus, a model is proposed in which multiple zzso and zzso interactions act zzso to achieve zzso
