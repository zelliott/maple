We describe a modified zzso sequence analysis method which we used to determine the zzso relationships among 58 species belonging to the zzso zzso We combined the sensitivity of the reverse zzso zzso for amplifying zzso amounts of template zzso material with the elevated extension temperatures used for the zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso A 70 degrees C reverse zzso extension step permitted improved zzso of highly structured zzso templates from members of the zzso zzso which have zzso contents of 66 to 71 zzso The zzso acid sequences of the amplified material were then determined by performing zzso cycle sequencing with zzso zzso again with extension at 70 degrees zzso zzso terminated bands were chased by using terminal zzso zzso Our method had a template requirement of zzso amounts or less of zzso zzso or 2,000 zzso of intact cells and had sufficient sensitivity so that zzso obtained from the American Type Culture Collection could be used as source zzso zzso from a zzso stretch of the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso trees were evaluated by using the De zzso distance zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso Our zzso zzso trees were compared with previously published zzso zzso trees, including the comprehensive trees developed by the University of Illinois zzso Database Project, and included 15 species not evaluated zzso Most of the groups were in general agreement and were consistent with relationships determined on the basis of zzso zzso but some new relationships were also zzso
