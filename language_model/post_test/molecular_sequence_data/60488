zzso zzso C are known to act on zzso since they can cleave the zzso linkage between the polar head and the zzso zzso of each zzso in these zzso These zzso have been classified into three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso properties and zzso of these zzso C are zzso in relation to author's zzso Studies on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso zzso such as PC and zzso was responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso by these zzso in the presence of zzso and/or zzso Also, the studies on a zzso correlation of zzso zzso C from zzso zzso disclosed the similarity of active sites between this zzso and bovine pancreatic zzso zzso By action of zzso zzso C, several membrane proteins such as alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso were shown to be released from the plasma zzso of zzso zzso From structural analysis, these proteins have been revealed to be zzso zzso proteins bound to the plasma zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular biology of zzso zzso including the structures and zzso routes of zzso zzso as well as the process of zzso attachment to zzso requirements of zzso signal zzso for the protein modification by zzso and distribution of zzso proteins in living world, are described in relation to our zzso
