zzso disease zzso is a zzso progressive zzso primarily of horses and zzso The zzso of two zzso strains of zzso disease virus zzso the zzso agent of zzso have been cloned and zzso According to the structural characterization achieved so far, zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper we report the zzso zzso and zzso tracing of a novel zzso zzso protein with a molecular mass of approximately 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso The successful isolation of the corresponding zzso from infected cells, amplification of the genetic region by zzso and its efficient expression as a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein demonstrated that zzso specific for the zzso zzso protein are induced in infected zzso In addition, we have produced zzso zzso against the zzso fusion protein in zzso This zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso protein in brain cells of naturally and zzso infected animals as well as in persistently zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso serum could successfully be applied to purify a zzso 10 zzso zzso from infected animal cells to such an extent that zzso of this component could be ruled zzso
