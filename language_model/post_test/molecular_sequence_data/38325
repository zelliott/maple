zzso avoid degradation in the zzso of their zzso zzso by interacting with a zzso zzso from the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso from the primary zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso acids zzso binding of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso are located within zzso 9 to 19 and zzso to zzso of the zzso and zzso regions, respectively, of the zzso equatorial zzso zzso overlay zzso with a series of overlapping synthetic zzso peptides and their derivatives demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso region and zzso and zzso of the zzso region of the equatorial domain of zzso are critical for zzso zzso Replacement of zzso and zzso by zzso in full-length zzso zzso and in zzso zzso deletion zzso reduced but did not abolish zzso zzso zzso substitution of either zzso or zzso eliminated the zzso capacity of the other and those of zzso and zzso In the predicted zzso structure of zzso the zzso zzso virus binding are juxtaposed in the equatorial zzso
