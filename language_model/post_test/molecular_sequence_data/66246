Natural zzso of oil spills is zzso by complex microbial zzso Here we took a zzso approach to investigate bacterial incorporation of petroleum zzso from a simulated oil zzso We zzso the natural difference in carbon zzso abundance between a salt zzso zzso supported by the zzso C4 grass zzso zzso and zzso petroleum to monitor changes in the zzso content of zzso zzso zzso capture methods for selective recovery of bacterial zzso were used to monitor the zzso content of bacterial biomass during a zzso zzso The data show that by the end of the experiment, up to zzso of bacterial biomass was derived from consumption of the freshly spilled zzso The results contrast with the zzso of a nearby zzso spill, which occurred in 1969 in West zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes from our experimental samples also were consistent with previous reports suggesting the importance of zzso and zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso The magnetic zzso capture approach makes it possible to zzso zzso of petroleum zzso by microbes in zzso Although employed here at the domain level, zzso capture procedures can be highly zzso The same strategy could be used with zzso zzso something which is not currently possible using the zzso content of zzso zzso
