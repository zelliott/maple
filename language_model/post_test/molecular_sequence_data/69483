Strand displacement amplification, a new zzso in zzso DNA amplification technique, was used to amplify target DNA contained within the zzso zzso element of the species within the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The target zzso acid sequence is present in approximately ten, two, one, five and five copies in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso products were detected using a zzso zzso plate zzso employing a zzso zzso probe and an alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso for alkaline zzso The combination of the strand displacement amplification method with this sensitive and rapid (less than 2 zzso detection system resulted in the specific detection of as few as zzso initial zzso targets in the five zzso complex species based on zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with eight other zzso species as well as with 32 zzso zzso
