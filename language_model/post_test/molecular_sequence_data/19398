The malaria zzso zzso stage develops in the zzso zzso and is transmitted to the zzso host by zzso zzso engage in multiple interactions with zzso and host tissue on the journey from their zzso origin to their final destination inside zzso Several malaria proteins have been identified that mediate zzso interactions with target zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which contain a zzso type 1 repeat zzso Recently, we identified zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso which exhibits a single zzso in its putative zzso zzso region and is highly zzso among zzso zzso Here, we show using targeted gene disruption in the zzso malaria model zzso zzso that lack of zzso has no effect on the asexual blood stage cycle, zzso transmission to the zzso zzso development and infection of zzso zzso zzso However, analysis of zzso knockout zzso in zzso and in zzso indicates that this protein has a significant role in zzso entry and therefore liver zzso Thus, zzso is an additional zzso malaria zzso protein that is mainly involved in initial infection of the zzso zzso
