In flowering plants, floral zzso zzso zzso which constitute a large zzso family, play important roles in the zzso of floral zzso as defined by the zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso was isolated and characterized from the marine zzso zzso zzso The predicted length of the zzso protein was 246 zzso acids zzso and the AA sequence was most similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested the presence of two zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were extremely high in the zzso regardless of the zzso stage, compared to other zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene may be involved in zzso development in zzso and act as an zzso gene in floral organ development in marine zzso
