The zzso high mobility group proteins zzso and zzso are thought to play an architectural role in assembly of zzso zzso zzso to these proteins have recently been found in the cells of the zzso insect zzso In this report we investigate the distribution of three abundant zzso proteins in zzso giant zzso of the zzso zzso By means of the indirect zzso technique the zzso and zzso proteins were localized in zzso zzso suggesting their involvement in the organization of zzso active zzso In contrast, the highly abundant protein zzso was rather zzso distributed in the zzso The zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso was detected in zzso which may indicate a role in the zzso of zzso zzso The regions of the zzso zzso containing zzso DNA did not contain higher levels of the zzso and zzso zzso A correlation between the specific location of these proteins in zzso and their synthesis and turnover rates was zzso
