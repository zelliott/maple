Six zzso of the highly delta zzso zzso selective, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and evaluated for zzso activity in rat brain zzso binding and mouse zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso All zzso were single zzso acid modifications of zzso and employed zzso acid zzso of known effects in linear zzso zzso The effect on binding affinity and zzso potency of each modification within the zzso structural framework was consistent with the previous reports on similarly zzso linear zzso zzso features of four of the modified zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso zzso and compared with zzso From these studies it was concluded that the observed pharmacological differences with zzso displayed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso are due to structural and/or zzso differences localized near the zzso zzso zzso The observed enhanced zzso zzso binding affinity of the zzso terminal zzso appears to be founded solely upon electronic differences, the zzso data suggesting indistinguishable zzso The observation that the zzso acid zzso analog zzso displays similar in zzso zzso behavior as zzso while apparently assuming a significantly different solution zzso suggests that further detailed zzso analysis of this analog will aid the zzso of the key structural and zzso features required for action at the delta zzso zzso
