zzso is an original zzso zzso discovered on zzso consisting in side chains composed of several zzso units and leading to a very unusual protein zzso A zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso was found to react with other proteins present in zzso zzso After zzso on a zzso affinity column, two prominent proteins of approximately 50 zzso were zzso They were identified by zzso and mass zzso as zzso and zzso two members of the zzso assembly protein family that are implicated in the deposition of core zzso complexes onto zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso on the same zzso We took advantage of this property to specifically label and purify the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are modified in their zzso domain by the addition of up to 9 and 10 zzso units, zzso Two putative zzso sites were localized for zzso at zzso and zzso and, for zzso at zzso and zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that proteins other than zzso are zzso and open new perspectives for studying zzso zzso
