zzso of salt and salty food is known as a risk factor for gastric zzso To examine the zzso and the mechanisms underlying enhancing effects, Mongolian zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and food containing various zzso of salt, and were sacrificed after 50 zzso Among zzso treated with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso stomach zzso were zzso in the normal diet group and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso diet groups, showing zzso increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of saturated zzso solution, in contrast, did not promote gastric zzso In zzso infected with zzso zzso a high salt diet was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso levels and inflammatory cell zzso in a zzso zzso Ten percent zzso diet zzso the amount of surface zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso suitable for zzso zzso zzso despite no zzso of zzso zzso while zzso zzso infection itself had an opposing effect, stimulating zzso of zzso and increasing the amount of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso High salt diet, in turn, decreased the amount of zzso which acts against zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study demonstrated zzso enhancing effects of salt in gastric chemical zzso in zzso zzso Mongolian zzso associated with zzso of the zzso zzso Reduction of salt intake could thus be one of the most important zzso methods for human gastric zzso
