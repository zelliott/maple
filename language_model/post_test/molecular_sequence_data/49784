The use of artificial neural networks zzso is described for predicting the zzso liquid zzso retention times of peptides zzso zzso from zzso zzso To enable the accurate comparison of the numerous zzso data sets, a genetic zzso was developed to zzso the zzso retention data into a range (from 0 to 1), improving the zzso zzso time zzso to approximately zzso The network developed in this study was based on zzso acid zzso composition and consists of 20 input zzso 2 hidden zzso and 1 output zzso A data set of approximately zzso confidently identified peptides from the zzso zzso zzso was used for the training of the zzso The ANN was then used to predict the zzso times for another set of zzso peptides tentatively identified by zzso from a different zzso zzso zzso The model was found to predict the zzso times of peptides with up to 54 zzso acid zzso (the longest zzso identified after zzso zzso of zzso zzso with an average accuracy of approximately zzso This zzso capability was then used to distinguish with high confidence zzso peptides otherwise indistinguishable by accurate mass zzso as well as to uncover zzso zzso Thus, integration of ANN zzso zzso time prediction in the zzso research will increase both the number of protein identifications and their zzso
