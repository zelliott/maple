In one of the most common zzso causing zzso zzso the zzso of zzso A zzso the zzso of zzso results from its instability in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protects the zzso and restores the zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso but not wild type zzso was zzso by zzso zzso L at zzso zzso yielding zzso and zzso zzso X-ray zzso at zzso resolution showed that zzso is not due to a difference in the protein fold that would expose the zzso bond following zzso zzso to zzso zzso which depends on zzso of zzso was impaired for zzso The zzso lowers the pH for the zzso equilibrium by zzso pH units from pH zzso to zzso A second zzso zzso zzso was generated that failed to zzso even at pH zzso zzso was zzso in zzso to zzso active zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso was reduced, while further degradation was zzso This indicates that defective zzso of zzso allows degradation of zzso to a zzso active zzso intermediate by zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso Further degradation of the zzso intermediate critically depends on zzso L and is modified by the structure of the zzso zzso zzso
