A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain zzso was isolated from marine zzso sampled in Okinawa Island, zzso Based on analysis of the almost complete sequence of its zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was found to belong to the family zzso zzso zzso showed highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso In a zzso tree based on the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso formed a deep branch distinct from all other organisms in the family zzso The major zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 1, zzso : 0 zzso and summed feature 3 (16 : zzso and/or zzso : 0 zzso The DNA zzso content was 37 zzso The zzso distance to the type strains of all recognized species in the family zzso and the zzso properties of strain zzso supported its zzso as representing a novel species in a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
