In zzso zzso zzso is expressed in most zzso but the regulation of zzso expression is largely zzso zzso as an essential step towards studying the regulation of zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso gene has been zzso zzso zzso sequences were isolated using the zzso walking zzso Analysis and comparison of these sequences with two zzso zzso clones and the Human Genome Project database, allowed the determination of the zzso organization of the zzso zzso The gene has 18 zzso and is zzso 18 zzso zzso All zzso junction sequences conform to the zzso zzso Progressive deletion analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicated that the core promoter is located between zzso zzso and zzso with several potential regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element binding protein and specificity protein 1 zzso zzso The minimal promoter was mapped within zzso and zzso where only an zzso binding site is zzso zzso experiments suggested that two zzso recognition elements near the zzso site zzso and zzso play a crucial role for optimal promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the importance of zzso and zzso boxes to enhance zzso transcription, and demonstrated that zzso motif is a significant zzso element for zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
