The conversion of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso DNA by zzso reverse zzso zzso is an essential step of the zzso life zzso In human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso uses the cellular zzso to initiate the zzso strand DNA zzso Placement of the primer zzso involves binding of its zzso 18 zzso to a complementary region of zzso zzso termed zzso However, the PBS sequence is not the unique zzso of primer usage and additional contacts are zzso This placement is believed to be achieved in zzso by the zzso domain of zzso or by the mature protein zzso Up to now, structural information essentially arose from zzso zzso complexes zzso et zzso J zzso zzso 1995, zzso zzso et zzso zzso J, 1999, zzso Here, we investigated the formation of the zzso complex zzso by zzso and compared structural and functional properties of zzso and zzso zzso We showed that both zzso and zzso procedures allow comparable high yields of zzso Then, we investigated structural features of both kinds of complexes by zzso zzso and we compared their relative efficiency in zzso strong stop DNA zzso We did not find any significant differences between these complexes, suggesting that information derived from the zzso complex can be zzso to the zzso complex and most likely to complexes formed in zzso
