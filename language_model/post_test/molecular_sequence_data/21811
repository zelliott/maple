The current model of zzso membrane fusion is based on atomic structures of truncated forms of the viral fusion protein E in its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These structures lack the two zzso zzso zzso of E as well as the so-called zzso believed to be involved in an zzso and zzso zzso reaction within the E zzso during the fusion zzso In order to gain experimental evidence for the functional role of the stem in zzso membrane fusion, we performed a zzso study with zzso zzso particles zzso of zzso encephalitis virus, which have fusion properties similar to those of whole infectious zzso and are an established model for viral zzso zzso were introduced into the stem as well as that part of E predicted to interact with the stem during zzso and the effect of these zzso was analyzed with respect to fusion zzso interactions with target cells, E protein zzso zzso stability, and membrane fusion in an in zzso zzso fusion zzso Our data provide evidence for a molecular interaction between a zzso zzso at the zzso end of the stem and a pocket in domain II of zzso which appears to be essential for the positioning of the stem in an orientation that allows zzso and the formation of a structure in which the zzso can interact as required for efficient zzso
