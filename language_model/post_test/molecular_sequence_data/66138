The zzso protein zzso recognizes an zzso derived from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in a shallow groove and molecular zzso successfully identifies this binding region on the protein zzso Analysis by zzso zzso and transferred zzso zzso experiments indicate that the bound zzso zzso has a zzso similar to that observed in zzso The results from a zzso transfer difference zzso experiment show that a large number of zzso in the zzso are in close contact with the protein as a result of zzso A comparison of the crystal structure of the complex and a molecular dynamics simulation of the zzso with explicit water molecules suggest that only minor zzso changes are needed upon binding to the zzso zzso
