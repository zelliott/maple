The naturally occurring zzso B antibiotic, zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso can produce two modifications in zzso zzso when bound to the zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso at 365 zzso Both drug-induced effects map to highly zzso zzso within the functionally important zzso zzso loop of zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso The modification yields are influenced zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and strongly by some of the zzso zzso antibiotics tested, with zzso producing a shift in the latter modification to zzso zzso zzso can also produce a modification on binding to zzso mature zzso zzso at position zzso The same modification occurs on an approximately zzso fragment, encompassing positions approximately zzso of the zzso zzso loop that was excised from the mature zzso using zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso effects were observed on in zzso zzso transcripts of full-length zzso zzso domain zzso or on a zzso extending from positions approximately zzso which indicates that one or more zzso modifications within the sequence zzso are important for zzso zzso binding and/or the zzso modification of zzso zzso
