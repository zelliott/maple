A full-length transcript zzso a functional zzso zzso hormone zzso I zzso I, zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso of the sea zzso zzso zzso using the zzso protein fingerprint zzso from the zzso zzso The present study is the first to identify a zzso transcript in an zzso which is one of the only two representatives of the oldest lineage of zzso The zzso acid full-length zzso zzso zzso I is highly similar and is likely a zzso of the zzso zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso The key zzso sequence zzso and characteristics of the identified zzso reveal a mosaic of features common to all other classes of zzso in zzso The zzso I was shown to activate the zzso signaling system using human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The highest expression of the zzso transcript was demonstrated in the zzso using reverse zzso Lower levels of the zzso transcript were also detected in brain, heart, zzso zzso liver, muscle, and zzso The high expression of zzso I in the zzso and the high similarity with zzso zzso hormone receptors suggest that zzso I functions as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso We zzso from these data that there is lower specificity of zzso and its zzso in zzso and that during zzso of the zzso and its zzso in zzso there were increased zzso of interactions between each zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its zzso
