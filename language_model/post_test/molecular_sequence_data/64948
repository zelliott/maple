The molecular analysis of insect hormone zzso has long been hampered by the minute size of the zzso zzso producing zzso zzso sequence tags from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso yielded a new zzso zzso zzso Its full-length zzso zzso a zzso protein that has only zzso zzso acid identity with zzso a zzso zzso previously cloned from this zzso zzso expression of the zzso in zzso coli produced zzso zzso of zzso per liter of zzso After zzso its zzso activity was zzso by using zzso and house fly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso hormone III, zzso zzso with a turnover of 3-5 zzso zzso The zzso produces zzso III with a ratio of approximately zzso in favor of the natural zzso zzso This result is in contrast to other insect zzso such as zzso that zzso zzso zzso with lower zzso and zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso gene is expressed selectively in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the time of zzso zzso production by the zzso We thus report the cloning and functional expression of a gene involved in an zzso step of juvenile hormone zzso zzso expressed zzso from zzso zzso or its zzso from economically important species may be useful in the design and screening of selective insect control zzso
