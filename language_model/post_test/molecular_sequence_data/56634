In the present study we describe the full length zzso sequence for rabbit zzso type I as well as the sequence for a zzso zzso promoter zzso of the zzso zzso type I zzso expression was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso in a zzso zzso zzso 1-2 zzso and zzso zzso In human zzso zzso zzso type I zzso was induced by zzso zzso treatment, and this induction could be inhibited by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 but not zzso could prevent this decrease in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso type I zzso expression was associated with differentiation and not growth zzso An zzso element was found within 50 base pairs zzso of the zzso initiation zzso A zzso element zzso was found but was not capable of zzso zzso In addition, putative response elements for zzso zzso 2 zzso sites, a zzso and an zzso site were present in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso more zzso expression in differentiated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was induced zzso in human zzso zzso induced to differentiate with zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by both zzso 1 and zzso No known zzso response elements were identified in the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
