A zzso zzso a new zzso zzso zzso in chick skeletal muscle was cloned using an zzso zzso in zzso screening zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso containing an open reading frame of zzso base pairs revealed that the zzso consists of zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and is related to members of the zzso family containing highly zzso zzso and His zzso Chick zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso from the cells to apparent zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso behaved as an approximately zzso protein under both zzso and zzso conditions, suggesting that it consists of a single zzso zzso Like other zzso zzso it was sensitive to zzso by zzso and zzso blocking agents, such as zzso The zzso zzso zzso at the C zzso of the zzso zzso in natural and engineered zzso irrespective of their zzso thus, it is active against zzso as well as zzso zzso extension protein of 80 zzso zzso zzso also released free zzso from zzso zzso Moreover, it converted zzso zzso zzso to zzso forms of about 24 zzso although the latter molecules were not further zzso to free zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in the recycling of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso chains generated by the action of 26 S zzso on zzso protein zzso as well as in the production of free zzso from linear zzso chains and of certain zzso proteins from zzso fusion zzso
