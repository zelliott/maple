In most animals, the rate of zzso B synthesis increases after nuclear envelope breakdown during the first zzso cell zzso We have found that zzso zzso zzso activity drops earlier in zzso than in control zzso zzso although the protein synthesis inhibitor does not activate the zzso degradation zzso zzso Moreover, protein synthesis is required to prevent zzso zzso to occur zzso sometimes before zzso have zzso on the zzso zzso In normal conditions, increased synthesis of zzso B after zzso zzso breakdown zzso balances zzso degradation and increases the time required for zzso zzso zzso to drop below the level that zzso zzso Taken together, these results point to zzso B as a possible candidate that could explain the need for increased protein synthesis during zzso zzso Although direct experimental evidence was not provided in the present work, zzso B synthesis after zzso may be important for correct segregation of zzso zzso at the end of first zzso zzso as shown by a variety of zzso disorders that accompany premature zzso Although the overall stimulation of protein synthesis because of zzso zzso zzso is still observed in zzso from which the zzso zzso has been removed before hormonal zzso the main increase of zzso B synthesis normally observed after zzso zzso breakdown is zzso The nuclear factor required for specific translation of zzso B after zzso is not zzso B zzso as shown by using a highly sensitive reverse zzso followed by zzso chain reaction procedure that failed to detect any zzso B zzso in isolated zzso zzso
