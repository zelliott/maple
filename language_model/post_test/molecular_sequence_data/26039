Previous genetic mosaic studies established that expression of the zzso bride of zzso zzso gene is required in zzso zzso zzso for the development of zzso zzso zzso This led to the proposal that boss encodes or regulates an zzso zzso zzso We have identified the boss gene based on small deletions in zzso zzso and zzso both zzso and corresponding zzso zzso One P element and three zzso boss zzso show different deletions in the gene ranging in size from 2 to 23 zzso each causing zzso leading to premature termination of zzso The boss gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a putative zzso signal zzso a large zzso region of zzso zzso zzso and seven potential zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso tail of 115 zzso zzso The putative membrane zzso of the boss protein is consistent with a model in which direct interaction between the boss and zzso proteins specifies zzso cell zzso Another model in which the boss protein functions as a zzso is proposed based on its similarity to the G zzso family of membrane zzso
