We report the identification of an open reading frame in a zzso B isolate of zzso zzso that exhibits high zzso and predicted zzso acid identity with the zzso gene of zzso coli, and its product, zzso zzso zzso zzso a DNA repair zzso We further show that the zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso and suggest that the DNA repair zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso or its gene zzso
