Seven zzso proteins associate with zzso U2, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and influence zzso zzso Here we describe a novel set of zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso that interact with each other and with zzso zzso Seven zzso proteins zzso with the previously characterized zzso zzso and interact with each other in zzso zzso Free zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with seven of the zzso proteins that are essential for the stable zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso strains suggest that zzso proteins may play a role in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso cycle of zzso zzso Thus, zzso proteins form a complex that differs from the zzso zzso complex in its zzso zzso and zzso We discuss the possible existence and functions of alternative zzso complexes, including the likelihood that they are involved in processes other than zzso zzso
