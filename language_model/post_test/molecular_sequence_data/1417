This study is zzso upon an important biological problem concerning the structural organization of zzso zzso that cannot be studied by X-ray analysis because zzso zzso zzso are still zzso Here, positioning of the zzso on zzso zzso was studied using zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso on either the zzso or an zzso zzso The modified zzso were directed to positions from -9 to zzso with respect to the first zzso of the P site bound zzso by a zzso zzso to the zzso targeted to the P zzso Upon mild zzso the modified zzso at positions zzso to zzso zzso to protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, modified zzso in positions zzso and zzso also zzso to zzso and in position zzso to zzso zzso from the upstream positions was mainly to protein zzso that has no zzso zzso These findings indicate that the tail of zzso zzso comes closer to the decoding site than that of its zzso zzso zzso and that the environments of the upstream part of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the results confirm the widely accepted idea regarding the zzso nature of the decoding site of the small zzso zzso
