zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene was studied by use of the zzso chain reaction in zzso normal subjects living in Moscow region and in 70 zzso 38 with essential hypertension zzso 9 of which survived zzso zzso at young age, 13 with zzso zzso zzso and 19 with zzso zzso zzso Left zzso zzso zzso was detected in 24 of 38 zzso zzso There was a highly significant increase in the frequency of the ID zzso in zzso patients compared to the controls zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso There was a relevant decrease in the frequency of the zzso zzso in zzso patients in comparison with the control zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso gene is associated with zzso No significant differences in both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene were revealed in two groups of patients with zzso and with zzso compared to the zzso Thus, no relations between the zzso gene and these disorders were zzso In zzso with zzso the II zzso was not detected and the frequency of both D zzso and zzso zzso was sufficiently increased compared to zzso patients with zzso Thus, the zzso zzso in zzso may be a risk factor for zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso patients with zzso compared to the uncomplicated hypertension zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso this zzso is associated with zzso in zzso zzso
