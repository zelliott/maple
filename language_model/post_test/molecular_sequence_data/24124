To identify a new zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and to establish a new screening model targeted on zzso 

A new zzso gene was identified by zzso analysis and zzso and was subsequently zzso in the zzso expression host zzso coli zzso zzso protein was zzso for zzso zzso by metal affinity zzso and a new screening model was established for novel zzso 

A new zzso gene of zzso zzso was identified zzso Ten positive samples were picked up from 8000 compound library and the microbial zzso broth zzso 

A new zzso of gene zzso zzso was first identified and the model had a high zzso Positive samples screened may be zzso agents of broad zzso
