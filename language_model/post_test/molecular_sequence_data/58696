Two zzso zzso of zzso zzso leukemia cells zzso and zzso zzso the cell surface folate zzso zzso The membrane bound zzso in zzso cells exhibited significantly (up to zzso greater relative affinities for zzso zzso and zzso compared to the zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso transport of zzso was much more efficient in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso When zzso with zzso zzso the zzso binding characteristics of zzso from both zzso resembled those of the zzso associated with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis as well as zzso analysis of the entire coding region revealed a single species of zzso in both cells, identical to zzso zzso The zzso in zzso cells was sensitive to zzso specific zzso C zzso indicating the presence of a zzso zzso membrane anchor while the zzso in zzso cells was resistant to zzso however, the zzso in zzso cells was released from plasma zzso by nitrous acid, as expected for zzso and its zzso resistant structural zzso Treatment of zzso cell zzso with mild base rendered the protein zzso sensitive as expected for zzso anchors zzso in the zzso ring and also decreased the affinities of the membrane associated zzso for reduced zzso When the zzso for zzso zzso was expressed in parental zzso cells the protein was zzso resistant but was sensitive to zzso when the zzso was expressed in human zzso zzso In zzso zzso and parental zzso cells, several cell surface zzso including zzso incorporated zzso a component of the zzso membrane anchor; however, the labeled proteins were released by zzso only in zzso zzso The above results zzso any zzso of the zzso zzso in either zzso zzso as the basis for the observed differences in zzso sensitivity and zzso functions of zzso zzso zzso of membrane associated zzso from either cell with zzso did not influence its zzso binding zzso The results of this study lead to the hypothesis that zzso zzso structures may zzso the function of a protein by influencing its zzso in the zzso Such effects may be identified by their zzso upon zzso zzso or mild base treatment of the zzso
