The cop zzso of zzso zzso effects copper zzso in this zzso It encodes a zzso zzso an zzso zzso and two zzso copper zzso zzso and zzso zzso of all four genes is regulated by the ambient zzso In this regulation, zzso apparently acts as a zzso zzso By zzso I zzso it was shown that zzso zzso protected two discrete sites in the region encompassing zzso zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site and containing zzso zzso zzso zzso is initiated between these repeats at zzso zzso in a domain that remained accessible to zzso I in the zzso zzso Chemical zzso revealed that zzso exists as a zzso in zzso In DNA zzso zzso it was apparent that the zzso interaction occurred in two discrete zzso zzso binding of zzso to the two operator sites was observed at 2 zzso zzso M and 5 zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso released zzso from the zzso with an apparent zzso constant for zzso of 20 zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso essentially abolished the binding of zzso to the respective binding sites, and the double zzso zzso zzso both binding zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso zzso of the cop zzso of zzso zzso exhibiting highly specific zzso interactions with two sites on the cop zzso and playing a key role in copper zzso in zzso zzso
