To explore whether zzso release presents a major barrier to zzso gene delivery, zzso zzso peptides derived from influenza virus or artificial sequences were incorporated into zzso zzso zzso zzso Depending on the cell line used, gene expression levels are approximately zzso higher than those obtained by applying DNA zzso to optimal amounts of zzso zzso In addition, gene transfer efficiency of DNA complexes with lower amounts of zzso zzso charge zzso is increased by a factor of up to 1000 by peptides zzso zzso virus derived zzso and zzso zzso zzso The helper lipids zzso egg zzso and zzso also can enhance the gene zzso Thus, zzso escape seems to be only a moderate barrier for zzso positively charged zzso complexes, but a substantial bottleneck for less positively charged zzso
