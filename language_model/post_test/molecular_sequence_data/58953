A zzso zzso DNA sequence containing the genetic zzso of the zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso by zzso zzso High levels of similarity were observed between this zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso and the 42 zzso zzso genes known from zzso zzso zzso zzso of five potential zzso species of zzso were separated by zzso gel zzso The total number of zzso was six in all the species, with sizes ranging from zzso to zzso zzso estimated zzso sizes were between zzso and zzso zzso When zzso zzso of the five species were zzso with zzso zzso strong zzso signals developed in all cases, but the physical position of these signals varied among species indicating a zzso zzso location of the highly zzso 42 zzso zzso gene within the zzso zzso
