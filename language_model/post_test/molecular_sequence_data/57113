Two forms of DNA zzso activity, zzso and zzso III, were previously zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we have identified and zzso an additional DNA zzso activity from zzso zzso to near zzso This zzso differs from those described previously in its zzso behavior, molecular weight, zzso properties, and genetic zzso Thus, we named it DNA zzso zzso Its apparent molecular mass is about 120 zzso as determined by zzso gel zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso DNA zzso III requires a zzso zzso zzso or zzso either zzso or zzso and a zzso portion on the duplex zzso zzso III moves in the zzso direction on zzso portions of the zzso and zzso the strand of DNA in the zzso zzso It also has an intrinsic zzso zzso zzso activity that zzso either zzso or zzso to zzso or zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso DNA zzso III activity was not affected by either zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that it is zzso by a gene different from zzso and zzso
