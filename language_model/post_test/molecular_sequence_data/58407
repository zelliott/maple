A stretch of DNA approximately 27 zzso in zzso adjacent to the zzso gene of zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso carries a total of 23 zzso Of these, 15 could be assigned probable functions based on zzso to characterized genes either in zzso zzso or in other zzso The sequencing of this region has also allowed us to assign to this area zzso and zzso previously located on the other side of zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso
