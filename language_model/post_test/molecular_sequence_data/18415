Human zzso zzso 16 is highly associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The transforming function resides within the viral zzso open reading frame zzso We have defined three zzso linear zzso in the zzso zzso In the present study, we determine the contribution of individual zzso acid zzso to zzso binding of these three zzso using replacement set zzso In this approach, each zzso zzso is zzso in turn by each of the other 19 genetically zzso zzso acids to produce zzso which are tested for specific zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the specificity of the zzso zzso for zzso of zzso 16 zzso in binding studies using synthetic zzso zzso of other zzso zzso zzso between zzso 16 and other zzso zzso suggests that zzso in zzso acid composition at the zzso zzso sites does not appear to be zzso zzso
