We have reported that basic zzso growth factor zzso prevents retrograde zzso of zzso zzso after middle cerebral artery zzso zzso To identify the protective mechanism of zzso we examined zzso zzso expression in a model of transient focal zzso with in zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso and zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expression was delayed until 6 h after zzso By 12 zzso zzso zzso was markedly induced in the zzso cortex, zzso cortex, and zzso white zzso At 24 h and 2 days the induction of zzso zzso in these regions persisted, and disappeared by 5 zzso The quantitative assessment of zzso zzso expression revealed that optical density ratios of the zzso zzso and the zzso were significantly higher at 12 zzso 24 zzso and 2 d after zzso than those in sham zzso zzso observation indicated zzso zzso signals were present in several types of cortical cells, including zzso and zzso zzso Since intrinsic zzso released from the damaged zzso can influence the healing response through receptors zzso by injury, it is reasonable that this pattern of zzso zzso expression parallels the zzso zzso expression previously zzso
