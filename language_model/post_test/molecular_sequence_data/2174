The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso segment of DNA containing the zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso class I zzso zzso of zzso coli, was zzso The structural gene was found to comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the initiation and termination zzso and the gene product had a predicted Mr of zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso contained the same number of zzso as did that of the zzso class I zzso zzso and there were identical zzso acids at all but 56 positions zzso zzso There was no significant similarity between the class I zzso and the class II zzso zzso except in one region containing the following zzso zzso Some of the 56 zzso acid zzso must be responsible for the functional preferences of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso similarities between the zzso sequence of the class I zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso and this finding further supports the view that these zzso are all members of a family of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso sequence of an unidentified gene zzso located upstream of zzso was also defined and found to zzso a product that is zzso to the product of another unidentified gene zzso located downstream of the neighboring zzso gene zzso
