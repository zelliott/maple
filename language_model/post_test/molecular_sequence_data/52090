During the zzso synthesis of over 100 zzso we have observed that the zzso group is useful for the side chain protection of zzso in peptides containing a single zzso zzso The zzso group is stable to the conditions of zzso zzso zzso and long term zzso zzso treatment of peptides containing an zzso zzso with zzso sodium hydroxide gives the zzso zzso zzso that can be coupled to carrier molecules such as proteins to give zzso zzso
