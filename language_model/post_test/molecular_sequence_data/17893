We have undertaken the study of zzso specifically or predominantly expressed in zzso cells, as they may be involved in establishing and maintaining properties peculiar to zzso such as polarization and zzso zzso We describe here recent results regarding two such zzso One of these contains the novel beta chain, beta 6, whose structure was deduced from zzso zzso Some initial results on distribution and possible alpha chain associated to beta 6 are zzso zzso data are then summarized on another zzso zzso alpha 6 beta zzso The alpha 6 zzso and a zzso form of the beta 4 zzso were recently cloned in our zzso zzso zzso results indicate that alpha 6 beta 4 may mediate attachment of zzso cells to basement zzso
