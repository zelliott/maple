Two bacterial strains were isolated from greenhouse zzso of zzso and zzso regions in zzso The zzso designated zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Their DNA zzso contents were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : zzso and zzso : 0 zzso and the major components of strain zzso were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : zzso alcohol, zzso : zzso and zzso : 0 zzso None of the species of the zzso zzso with zzso published names showed zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of more than 97 % with respect to the novel zzso The closest sequence similarity of strain zzso was with zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas strain zzso showed the highest sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the two strains should be classified as representing novel members of the zzso zzso The names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed, with strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, as the type zzso
