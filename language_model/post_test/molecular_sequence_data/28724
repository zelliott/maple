We describe the preparation and characterization of zzso zzso made with highly zzso semiconductor zzso zzso quantum dots zzso and zzso for use in zzso The zzso strategy employs an engineered molecular zzso zzso attached to the zzso via zzso zzso to link the zzso zzso with zzso In this method, the number of zzso zzso to a single zzso can be zzso In addition, we have developed a simple zzso strategy based on zzso zzso of the molecular zzso and a second zzso protein that allows the use of affinity zzso zzso zzso were successfully used in zzso for detection of both a protein toxin zzso zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso
