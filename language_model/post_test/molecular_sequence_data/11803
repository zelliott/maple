A zzso gene was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso by means of zzso using zzso designed on the basis of previously reported zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso termed zzso was investigated by comparing the primary structure of the zzso DNA with that of the corresponding zzso The open reading frame, which was split into 15 zzso was established to have the capacity for zzso a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the putative product of zzso showed a high degree of similarity to that of zzso in the zzso plant zzso including a zzso identity, and to those of other zzso genes in zzso and zzso with identities of zzso zzso analysis indicated zzso to be much closer to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso than to zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso on an evolutionary zzso
