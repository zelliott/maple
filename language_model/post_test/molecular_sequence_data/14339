Studies focusing on the targeting of zzso that zzso rice storage zzso zzso and zzso to specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso studies of other storage protein zzso indicate a close relationship between the zzso site of zzso translation and the final site of protein deposition in the zzso system in developing rice zzso In addition to zzso and zzso rice accumulates smaller amounts of zzso which are deposited together with zzso in the protein storage zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso are not distributed to the zzso zzso as expected for a zzso zzso but instead are targeted to the protein zzso zzso by a regulated process requiring zzso zzso zzso alignments with putative zzso zzso zzso elements identified several candidate regulatory sequences that may be responsible for zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the presence of zzso on the periphery of the zzso protein bodies and packaging in zzso dense zzso as well as deposition and storage within peripheral regions of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso dramatically alters the spatial arrangement of zzso and zzso within the zzso with the accompanying presence of numerous small zzso particles in the zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso targeting to the zzso zzso is essential for efficient transport of zzso to the zzso and its spatial arrangement in the zzso Such zzso zzso prevents potential deleterious zzso zzso in addition to performing a role in protein zzso
