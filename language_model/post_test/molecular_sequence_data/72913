Several lines of evidence indicate a crucial role for unconventional zzso in the function of the sensory hair cells of the inner zzso We report here the characterization of the zzso zzso two unconventional type I zzso from a mouse cochlear zzso zzso The first zzso encodes a putative protein named zzso which is likely to be the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso I beta and which may be involved in the gating of the zzso channel of the sensory hair zzso This zzso belongs to the group of zzso zzso I, with its tail ending shortly after a zzso zzso zzso The second zzso encodes a novel type I zzso zzso which displays three zzso a head domain with the zzso zzso and zzso sites, a neck domain with a single zzso zzso and a tail domain with the zzso structure initially described in zzso zzso zzso The tail of zzso includes zzso a zzso region rich in basic zzso which may interact with zzso membrane zzso zzso a zzso zzso region, expected to contain an zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso domain found in a variety of zzso and signaling zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that the genes zzso zzso and zzso display a widespread tissue expression in the adult zzso zzso and zzso were mapped by in zzso zzso to the zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso The human zzso genes zzso and zzso were also zzso and mapped to the human zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso
