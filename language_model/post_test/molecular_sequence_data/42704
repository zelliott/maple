The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso which zzso zzso plant species, has been determined from cloned viral zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso excluding the zzso zzso tail, and contains a large open reading frame that codes for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame is flanked by a zzso untranslated region of 135 and a 3' untranslated region of 475 zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso with the sequences of other members of the zzso zzso allowed the zzso of putative zzso zzso zzso This comparison also showed that zzso has a zzso organization that is similar to other members of the zzso zzso As with other zzso the zzso zzso and zzso proteins were found to be the most variable and the zzso protein the most zzso when compared with the corresponding proteins of other zzso zzso differed from other members of the zzso zzso in the zzso acid at the zzso position of the putative zzso sites of the zzso zzso The putative zzso site for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso each contained a zzso at the zzso position which is zzso in most other zzso zzso at the zzso position has also been observed at the zzso junction of pea seed borne mosaic virus and zzso mosaic virus and at the zzso junction of zzso zzso virus zzso
