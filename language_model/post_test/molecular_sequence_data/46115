Since the discovery over 15 years ago of a protein zzso factor that possessed the ability to cross the plasma zzso zzso peptides zzso have been evaluated for the ability to transport diverse zzso into cells, zzso and zzso Certain zzso have been used for the zzso delivery of zzso molecules to zzso zzso interactions and thereby inhibit key cellular mechanisms of zzso The ability to introduce drugs into cells allows the conventional zzso of drugs to be altered in order to favorably impact zzso patient compliance, and other treatment zzso In this monograph, we present the current status and future prospects for the application of zzso to the development of human zzso We discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of using zzso in the in zzso setting, and review the current status of a number of zzso and human clinical studies of zzso delivery of zzso These include zzso zzso directed against a growing variety of targets and disease areas, including cancer, zzso pain, and zzso Our discussion focuses on those zzso that have been tested in humans, including a zzso zzso for the treatment of acute zzso zzso The promising results obtained in a number of these studies indicate that zzso may have an important role in the development of novel zzso
