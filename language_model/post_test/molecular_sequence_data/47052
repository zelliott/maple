zzso zzso zzso is a key regulatory zzso in the zzso zzso for zzso zzso As a first step in the zzso of the zzso relationship and the regulation of zzso an zzso zzso was cloned from rat zzso The cloned zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is very similar to that of human zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it shows less, but zzso similarity to zzso zzso as well as to other zzso including rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Like human and zzso zzso rat zzso has a large repetitive internal sequence in the zzso and zzso halves of the zzso Both parts of the repeat contain the zzso zzso the most zzso region in the zzso active domain of other zzso indicating the existence of two zzso zzso in zzso The zzso profile revealed that rat zzso is largely zzso and lacks a zzso stretch long enough to span a zzso zzso There was no prediction for an zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso clone resulted in an zzso increase in zzso activity, corresponding to an increase in the amount of zzso protein as detected on a Western zzso zzso of the zzso activity during liver development showed a zzso zzso increase between day 17 of gestation and birth zzso zzso and the amount of zzso protein changed zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that this was accompanied by an increase in the amount of zzso zzso Between day 17 of gestation and birth, the amount of zzso in fetal rat liver increased zzso zzso suggesting the regulation of zzso at both zzso and zzso levels during rat liver zzso
