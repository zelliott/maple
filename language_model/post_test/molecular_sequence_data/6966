The zzso zzso of zzso coli is a zzso iron storage zzso It is composed of 24 identical zzso which form a roughly zzso protein shell surrounding a central iron storage zzso Each of the 12 zzso zzso of zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso a zzso coordination scheme so far only found in zzso Members of the zzso family contain three partially zzso zzso zzso zzso the initiating zzso and in this study each was zzso by zzso and/or zzso The zzso zzso were devoid of zzso whereas the zzso and zzso zzso possessed full zzso zzso and were zzso indistinguishable from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso appeared to be correctly assembled and were capable of accumulating iron both in zzso and in zzso No major differences were observed in the overall rate of iron zzso for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The iron contents of the zzso zzso as isolated, were at least 4 times greater than for zzso zzso This study is consistent with the reported location of the zzso zzso site at the zzso axis and shows that zzso is unnecessary for zzso assembly and iron zzso
