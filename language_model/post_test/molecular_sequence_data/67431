The zzso zzso zzso zzso key regulator of diverse neurological zzso functional zzso derived from editing of its zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in five distinct zzso Here we describe a statistical technique that was developed for analysis of the zzso among the editing states of the five zzso The statistical significance of the observed correlations was estimated by comparing editing patterns in multiple zzso For both human and rat zzso the editing states of the physically zzso sites A and B were found to be strongly zzso In contrast, the editing states of sites C and D, which are also physically close, seem not to be directly dependent but instead are linked through the zzso on sites A and B, zzso We observed pronounced differences between the editing patterns in humans and zzso in humans site A is the key zzso of the editing state of the other sites, whereas in rats this role belongs to site zzso The structure of the zzso among the editing sites is notably simpler in rats than it is in humans zzso more complex regulation of zzso editing and, by zzso function in the human zzso Thus, exhaustive statistical analysis of the zzso editing patterns indicates that the editing state of sites A and B is the primary zzso of the editing states of the other three sites, and hence the overall editing zzso Taken together, these findings allow us to propose a zzso model of concerted action of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso approach developed here can be applied to other cases of zzso among modification sites in zzso and zzso
