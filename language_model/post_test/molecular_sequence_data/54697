zzso zzso are zzso zzso that mediate the zzso attachment of zzso proteins to the cell walls of zzso bacteria, and thereby play a crucial role in zzso infection and zzso by zzso Many zzso proteins are anchored by the zzso zzso zzso but other more zzso zzso exist that attach zzso of proteins or function in zzso zzso The zzso zzso or zzso from the zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso is responsible for generating the zzso linkages between the zzso zzso in the zzso of this zzso The crystal structure of zzso has been determined at zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso The structure shows that zzso is a class B zzso in contrast to other zzso zzso zzso which belong to class zzso zzso lacks a zzso believed to function in zzso recognition in class C zzso and instead has an elaborated zzso zzso The two independent zzso molecules in the crystal show differences in the positions and zzso of the zzso zzso and His zzso zzso and zzso correlated with movements of the zzso and zzso zzso that respectively follow these zzso Bound zinc zzso zzso these alternative zzso in the zzso This zzso zzso is likely to be important for function although there is no evidence that zinc is involved in zzso
