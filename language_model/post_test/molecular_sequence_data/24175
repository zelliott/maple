In plants, fatty acids zzso in the zzso are exported as zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso prevalent in zzso are involved in the storage and zzso transport of zzso We have previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso repeats, designated zzso and zzso which show conservation to zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso has revealed the presence of three more genes zzso putative proteins with zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to zzso have not been reported in any other zzso We show by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis that zzso , zzso and zzso are expressed in all plant zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso that share zzso identity and which contain zzso motifs were further zzso To demonstrate their function in binding zzso we have expressed them as zzso zzso proteins in zzso coli for in zzso binding zzso Both zzso and zzso bind zzso with high zzso zzso with lower affinity and did not bind zzso Eight zzso forms of each protein with single zzso acid zzso within the zzso domain were produced and zzso On binding zzso all zzso were impaired in zzso zzso zzso these novel zzso with zzso motifs have functional zzso zzso that bind zzso Their predicted zzso zzso suggests that they could maintain an zzso pool in the zzso or transport zzso from the zzso to the zzso in plant zzso zzso
