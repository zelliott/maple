In zzso gene identification from finished and unfinished human zzso sequence has become critically important in many projects seeking to gain insights into the gene content of zzso regions implicated in zzso To establish limitations and criteria for in zzso gene zzso and to identify novel genes of potential relevance to human prostate cancer and melanoma, 3 zzso of zzso 1 sequence have been analyzed using zzso This program is a software suite zzso of sequence similarity programs and four gene identification zzso A total of 49 potential transcripts were selected and 37 of them were selected for experimental zzso We verified 16 of the predicted genes by experimental zzso The comparison of the predicted transcripts with their cloned forms helped to refine predicted gene models as well as to identify zzso zzso for several of zzso Although sequences matching with ten of our verified genes have been recently deposited in the zzso six of them remain zzso Our studies support the feasibility of identifying novel genes from regions of interest using draft human zzso zzso
