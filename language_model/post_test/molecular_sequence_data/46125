zzso serving as respiratory complex II belong to the zzso zzso zzso that comprises zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso from the extreme zzso zzso zzso has been isolated, identified and zzso to zzso It consists of four zzso with apparent molecular masses of 64, 27, 14 and zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso anchor zzso zzso The existence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso clusters within the zzso protein was confirmed by electron zzso resonance zzso which also revealed a previously unnoticed influence of the zzso on the signal corresponding to the zzso zzso The zzso contains two zzso b zzso of reduction zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso revealed that the zzso forms a zzso with a predominantly zzso zzso The optimum temperature for zzso zzso activity is zzso which is in agreement with the optimum growth temperature of zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed sensitivity of the zzso to the classical zzso of the active site, as there are sodium zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the membrane part of the zzso is functionally connected to the active zzso zzso kinetic zzso showed that the zzso displays standard zzso zzso at a low temperature zzso with a zzso for zzso of zzso but exhibits zzso from it at a higher temperature zzso This is the first example of complex II with such a kinetic behavior suggesting positive zzso with zzso of zzso and Hill zzso of zzso While the crystal structures of several zzso are already available, no crystal structure of type A zzso has been zzso to zzso Here we present for the first time a detailed zzso and zzso study of type A zzso significant step towards understanding its zzso zzso
