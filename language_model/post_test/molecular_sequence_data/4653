zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso through its zzso domain zzso which consists of 21 zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso also interacts with a zzso form of zzso zzso and enhances its zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of both zzso and zzso but has no effect on zzso While both zzso and zzso contain an zzso zzso does zzso This suggests that the zzso of zzso is also involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells which lack zzso recovered their capacity to bind to immobilized zzso when zzso with zzso zzso zzso This binding was competitively inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso The interactions between synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso zzso and the immobilized zzso were analyzed with surface zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is thought to represent the binding site for zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso These results suggest that the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is the site which interacts with the zzso and may play an essential role in the zzso of the zzso activity of zzso
