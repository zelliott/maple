The small zzso modifier zzso is zzso attached to zzso zzso on target proteins by a specific zzso zzso involving the E1 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In an zzso manner, the zzso of zzso forms consecutive zzso bonds with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso before the zzso zzso complex zzso the formation of an zzso bond between zzso and the zzso group of the target zzso zzso on the protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso bears many similarities with that of zzso and other zzso protein zzso zzso and because of its production of a zzso zzso zzso and the lack of absolute requirement in zzso for zzso zzso the zzso system is a good model for the analysis of protein zzso pathways that share this basic zzso Here we describe methods of both zzso and zzso kinetic analysis of zzso and use these techniques to determine the role of two zzso zzso and zzso of zzso which are not found in zzso zzso from other protein zzso zzso These zzso are found close to the active site zzso in the zzso structure of zzso and although they are shown to inhibit the zzso reaction from zzso they are important for zzso recognition in the context of the zzso complex with zzso
