Two components zzso and zzso each composed of 28 zzso acid zzso were zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by an opportune procedure with zzso column zzso and repeated zzso Both components were totally accounted to about zzso zzso dry weight of the crude zzso The molecular weights of both components were determined to be 2950 and zzso by mass zzso which were fully coincidence with that of the known novel zzso peptides zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wu zzso zzso B, zzso M, zzso zzso zzso of four toxins from zzso zzso scorpion zzso which act on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso In addition, the sequence of component zzso was analyzed to be the same as that of zzso The components zzso and zzso zzso in this study were, thus, finally distinguished to be zzso and zzso from the same zzso Using whole cell zzso recording, it was found that zzso diminished the current of transient outward zzso channel in adult rat zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso effect was zzso Dynamic studies showed that the zzso zzso and recovery processes of the transient outward zzso channel were not changed significantly after applying of zzso In addition, when zzso was applied to guinea pig zzso zzso both delayed and inward zzso zzso currents showed no change compared with the zzso The results suggest strongly that zzso or -like peptides from scorpion zzso may provide a useful probe for the studying of transient outward zzso channel in rat zzso zzso
