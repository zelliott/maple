The zzso zzso complex is essential for the replication of dengue virus, which is the zzso agent of dengue and zzso zzso diseases that are a burden for the tropical and zzso areas of the zzso The active form of the zzso zzso linked to the 40 zzso of the zzso zzso shows highly flexible and zzso zzso that are responsible for its high propensity to zzso at the zzso necessary for zzso zzso studies or for zzso Limited zzso of this active form of the zzso enabled us to obtain a folded and new essential form of the zzso zzso zzso We found that the region from zzso zzso to zzso of zzso interacts directly and strongly with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso binding complex was determined by a rapid and continuous zzso resonance energy transfer activity zzso using a zzso zzso The new zzso complex zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso shows zzso zzso The zzso single quantum zzso spectrum of the zzso enriched protein complex shows good zzso zzso this is indicative of a stable folded zzso Our results significantly complement the X-ray structure of the zzso complex published zzso Moreover, these results open the way to performing direct structural and interaction studies in solution on a new active zzso complex with libraries of zzso and zzso in order to identify new drugs that prevent viral zzso zzso
