Seventy-five Norwegian patients with zzso zzso zzso were studied for zzso zzso response against synthetic zzso zzso representing the sequence of zzso outer membrane protein of zzso zzso containing four zzso acid zzso zzso with zzso zzso Ten zzso five zzso and seven zzso of 60 male AS patients showed elevated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso class, respectively, whereas for each zzso only one zzso of 25 healthy male controls was zzso zzso were not observed between female patients and zzso In all zzso zzso patients were more frequently found in patients with active zzso The zzso zzso zzso levels of the patients were generally not correlated with the zzso levels against the zzso representing the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso However, in one patient the zzso was shown to react with both peptides by zzso zzso Overall, it appears that any zzso relationship between zzso and zzso of AS is not zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso region encompassing the zzso sequence particularly at the T cell level require further zzso
