zzso zzso zzso in guinea-pig cardiac zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso and a large fraction zzso of the zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso This zzso remained when the cardiac zzso zzso were maintained in culture for 72 h zzso zzso The guinea-pig cardiac zzso zzso express the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and treatment of the zzso zzso with 20 zzso zzso for 72 h to evaluate zzso regulation of zzso expression revealed a dramatic zzso decrease in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso control zzso zzso The decrease in percentage of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso and zzso and selective for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were less zzso zzso a zzso zzso eliminated the zzso change in zzso positive zzso The zzso decrease in zzso zzso was eliminated in zzso solutions and by the addition of zzso indicating a requirement for calcium influx through zzso calcium zzso The addition of either the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso also eliminated the zzso decrease in zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso expression was not affected by zzso of protein zzso A or zzso C, but was reduced by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso and quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso showed that cardiac zzso zzso zzso levels were not diminished by chronic zzso exposure despite the dramatic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso content represents a balance between production and zzso These results suggested that one of the primary effects of zzso exposure may be enhanced levels of zzso release that exceeded production levels, resulting in zzso depletion and a zzso in the number of identifiable zzso cardiac zzso
