zzso are a zzso of zzso zzso and these zzso zzso have diverse zzso functions in many zzso Growing evidence suggests that many zzso are implicated in zzso In zzso zzso constitute a large zzso family, but in humans, only three genes were zzso By using the zzso candidate gene approach, we were able to identify a new zzso zzso tentatively named zzso (for zzso gene zzso This new gene maps to zzso zzso zzso is formed of five coding zzso and four zzso and shows structural similarity to other zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso breast, and zzso Our preliminary results show that zzso is zzso at the zzso level, in breast cancer zzso and breast cancer cell zzso Its expression is regulated by steroid hormones in the breast cancer cell line zzso This gene may be involved in the zzso and/or progression of breast cancer and may find zzso as a novel cancer zzso
