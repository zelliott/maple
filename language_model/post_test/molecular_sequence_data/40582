zzso (also known as zzso is the most recently identified member of the zzso zzso It is predominantly expressed in the nucleus zzso of the brain and involved in the control of stress response, food zzso and zzso In the present work, we have established a simple approach for the preparation of the mature human zzso zzso We first designed and zzso expressed a zzso zzso precursor in zzso coli zzso After zzso by immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso zzso in zzso through zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso mature human zzso was obtained in high yield and at low zzso zzso mapping and circular zzso zzso studies suggested that the zzso zzso adopted an zzso fold with the expected zzso zzso The zzso mature zzso was fully active in both zzso binding and zzso zzso The activity of the zzso precursor was very low, suggesting that a free zzso of the zzso is necessary for zzso and zzso of zzso Our present work provides a highly efficient approach for the preparation of zzso as well as its zzso for functional and structural zzso
