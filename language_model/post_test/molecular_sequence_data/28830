We have identified zzso a novel zzso protein expressed in the zzso zzso and have examined the tissue distribution and zzso zzso of zzso of this zzso Isolation of zzso zzso using the head domain identified in a previous zzso screen as probe, identified at least two zzso zzso in the zzso We have isolated coding sequences of two highly related zzso from the rat zzso that we have termed zzso and zzso zzso protein 3, A and zzso Both zzso code for predicted zzso with the zzso structure typical of zzso zzso members; namely a zzso motor domain, a region capable of forming a limited zzso secondary structure, and a zzso tail zzso Although almost identical in their head and stalk zzso these zzso diverge in their tail zzso This group of zzso is found in many zzso and cell zzso The zzso motor contains zzso motifs and an zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1) consensus sequence in its tail zzso Despite this zzso zzso is not associated with the same structures as zzso Instead, zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of developing zzso and their zzso in the zzso zzso with that of the small zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso are associated in a polarized fashion with the nucleus of maturing zzso at various stages of zzso Our findings suggest a possible role for zzso motor zzso in zzso maturation zzso by possible interaction with the Ran zzso
