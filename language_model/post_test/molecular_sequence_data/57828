The zzso gene was previously cloned from zzso zzso on a zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Blaser, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Miller, zzso Agents zzso zzso zzso In the current study, the zzso gene was localized by zzso zzso A region of approximately 600 zzso which contained the zzso gene was identified, and DNA sequence analysis revealed two overlapping open reading frames zzso within this zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis demonstrated expression of both zzso in zzso zzso therefore, zzso zzso was used to identify the zzso which encodes the zzso zzso No zzso was found between zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso experiments confirmed that the zzso probe zzso only to zzso zzso zzso strains and that the zzso probe zzso only to zzso strains presumed to carry zzso Seven zzso strains which had been classified as having zzso resistance profiles did not zzso with zzso for either zzso or zzso suggesting that at least one additional zzso gene may zzso The predicted zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso proteins showed significant sequence similarity between zzso 38 and 63 of the zzso protein and zzso 26 and 51 of the zzso zzso
