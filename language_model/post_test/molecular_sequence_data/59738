The complete zzso sequence of the zzso segment 5 zzso of a Thai isolate of rice ragged stunt virus zzso was zzso The zzso zzso sequence contains a single long open reading frame capable of zzso a zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 91 zzso zzso zzso by various truncated zzso of zzso were expressed using the zzso fusion protein zzso and the highest level of fusion protein was obtained from a construct zzso a zzso region of zzso zzso zzso raised against this fusion protein recognized a minor zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 91 zzso that was present in zzso preparations of zzso zzso infected insect zzso and infected rice zzso This indicates that zzso zzso encodes a minor structural zzso Comparing the zzso zzso sequence with sequences of other zzso did not reveal any significant sequence zzso
