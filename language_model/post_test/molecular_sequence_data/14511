Two zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso enable zzso zzso zzso zzso to function as two zzso receptors zzso and zzso for zzso zzso a potent cardiovascular protective zzso Following AM zzso both receptors undergo rapid zzso through a zzso pathway, after which zzso but not zzso can be recycled to the cell surface for zzso However, human zzso mediates zzso zzso much less efficiently than does zzso zzso the molecular basis of the single zzso domain zzso and the zzso domain of zzso during AM zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso various zzso zzso and zzso into zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that substituting the zzso zzso with that of zzso markedly enhanced zzso zzso of zzso However, this replacement did not enhance the cell surface expression of zzso zzso binding affinity or zzso zzso zzso More detailed analyses showed that substituting the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso with the corresponding sequence zzso from zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso In contrast, substituting the zzso target sequence with zzso did not significantly affect zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso in the negative regulation of zzso zzso and the aforementioned introduction of the zzso sequence into the zzso zzso may be a strategy for promoting zzso zzso
