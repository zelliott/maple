In zzso coli, zzso recruits zzso to the zzso leading to a coupled zzso required for spatial regulation of the zzso Z zzso How these proteins zzso however, is not clear because the zzso regions of zzso are zzso within a zzso zzso sheet and masked by zzso zzso zzso zzso that restore interaction between some zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These zzso alter the zzso structure leading to release of the zzso regions and the zzso zzso that bind the zzso zzso of zzso complexes revealed a zzso zzso sheet zzso zzso with the released zzso strands zzso zzso converted to zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso These results identify the zzso zzso changes in zzso that convert it from a zzso to an active form and lead to a model of how zzso persists at the zzso zzso
