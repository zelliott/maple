The purpose of this study was to examine the sugar recognition and transport properties of the zzso zzso zzso a secondary active zzso from zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso transport is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso harboring zzso were red on zzso zzso zzso indicator zzso We were able to measure zzso zzso transport and establish definitive kinetic behavior for zzso entry in such zzso zzso was an effective competitor of zzso transport in cells with zzso suggesting that the respective zzso and zzso binding sites and zzso pathways through the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by cells with zzso was profound, demonstrating active transport of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso used in cells for transport studies indicate an zzso primary zzso structure, ruling out the possibility that zzso zzso zzso transport by zzso We conclude that zzso is a bona fide zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Thus, future studies of sugar zzso zzso and zzso structure should consider zzso as well as zzso
