zzso zzso and zzso zzso assignments of the backbone atoms and zzso have been made for zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli, a zzso protein with 226 zzso acid zzso and a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso binding protein which plays an essential role in the active transport of zzso through the zzso zzso The assignments have been obtained from three-dimensional zzso zzso experiments on a zzso zzso zzso labeled sample as well as specifically labeled zzso zzso from the zzso zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the main sources used to make the resonance zzso Other zzso experiments, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been used to confirm the resonance assignments and to extend connections where resonance zzso are missing in some of the experiments mentioned zzso We have assigned more than zzso of the zzso backbone zzso of zzso The result of the standard manual assignment is in agreement with that predicted by an automated zzso method developed in our zzso A solution secondary structure of the zzso complex has been proposed based on chemical shift zzso from random zzso zzso Eight zzso and 10 zzso are derived using the Chemical Shift Index zzso
