The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso a member zzso zzso zzso family classified as a domain of unknown function zzso was solved to a resolution of zzso by zzso anomalous zzso zzso This protein is the first structural representative of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso organization, with the zzso domain presenting a new fold called the zzso domain that may bind an as yet unknown zzso The zzso domain forms a zzso zinc finger that is likely to be involved in DNA zzso Analysis of the zzso protein and the broader zzso family suggests a role as zzso zzso zzso
