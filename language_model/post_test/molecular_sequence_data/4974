A zzso zzso population naturally occurring in the zzso of zzso zzso was investigated in order to assess the degree of root association and microbial zzso at five stages of plant zzso The bacterial strains isolated on zzso zzso medium were mostly assigned to the species zzso zzso by an analysis of the restriction patterns produced by amplified DNA coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of some randomly chosen zzso confirmed the zzso zzso Throughout the study, zzso zzso was strictly associated with zzso roots, ranging from zzso to zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso among 83 zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by the random amplified zzso DNA zzso technique with two zzso zzso An analysis of zzso patterns by the analysis of molecular zzso method revealed a high level of zzso genetic diversity in this zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the genetic diversity was related to zzso among zzso root zzso with microbial genetic zzso markedly higher in the first stages of plant zzso in other words, the zzso of this zzso bacterial population decreased over zzso
