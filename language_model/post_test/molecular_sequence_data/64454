Although an zzso zzso factor zzso has often been hypothesized to zzso vascular relaxations that are independent of zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso techniques have failed to confirm the existence of a freely zzso zzso in a consistent zzso Indeed, observations that zzso of direct zzso zzso such as zzso peptides zzso Gap 26 and zzso and zzso acid derivatives zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso and relaxations suggest that an zzso spread of zzso zzso via zzso and zzso smooth muscle gap junctions plays an obligatory role in such zzso The zzso zzso that zzso relaxation results from the opening of zzso channels and is sustained by zzso zzso entry triggered by the depletion of zzso zzso stores in the zzso zzso zzso relaxations are also associated with a zzso synthesis of zzso that increases the zzso of gap junction channels and enhances the transmission of zzso zzso through the vascular wall in a zzso zzso This review will discuss the roles of these interacting zzso pathways in the mediation of the zzso zzso
