The promoter region of the mouse zzso zzso protein zzso gene was cloned into a promoter testing zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso early region zzso and contains the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso sequence at the zzso end of the cloning zzso The newly constructed zzso fusion zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso When the measured zzso activity in the zzso cells was zzso to the zzso cells (an appropriate control if the zzso early region promoter functions zzso in various cell zzso the results suggested that the promoter region of the zzso gene contains the information necessary for initiation of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso produced in viable cells was also detected by zzso zzso treatment followed by image analysis using zzso fluorescent zzso which allowed the zzso efficiency to be zzso and the zzso activity obtained by the regular zzso method was zzso with the value zzso This procedure indicated that the promoter region of the zzso gene did not show zzso zzso because the zzso zzso promoter was 10 times more active in zzso cells than in zzso zzso Thus, the standard experiment gave misleading zzso As our detection method is simple and can be used to analyze the promoter activity in a single cell, many applications should be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
