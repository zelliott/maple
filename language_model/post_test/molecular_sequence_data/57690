zzso of zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso promises the quick and cost-effective separation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso However, the efficiency of the method has yet to be fully zzso particularly with regard to disease type and selection of zzso zzso We have evaluated two approaches based on amplification of the zzso heavy chain gene using framework 2 zzso and framework 3 zzso region zzso Frozen tissue samples from 94 cases of zzso zzso zzso were investigated, all of which had previously been shown to be zzso by Southern zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we were able to show zzso in 85 per cent of zzso with zzso 80 per cent of zzso and using both techniques in separate zzso 90 per cent of zzso Thus, a significant zzso rate exists with either primer which can be reduced by using zzso We also found a difference in the efficiency of detection in different types of zzso only 87 per cent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to be zzso whereas all of the other zzso types tested were positive using one or both zzso We conclude that zzso detection of zzso zzso allows rapid analysis of tissue samples, including zzso zzso zzso results which occur in some types of zzso can be reduced by the use of two or more primer zzso
