zzso A and zzso zzso are two zzso produced by the zzso different strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the structural gene of zzso A was obtained from total zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was used as a probe to isolate a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso amplification revealed that both the structural genes of both the zzso zzso A and zzso zzso were zzso These zzso will be further referred to as zzso zzso zzso L can be defined as a small, strongly zzso zzso zzso consisting of 50 zzso zzso It is zzso as a precursor zzso of 65 zzso acids processed at a characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L hence belongs to the class II zzso It has a narrow zzso spectrum, being most active towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among 38 strains of the zzso zzso DNA zzso group, another 6 zzso zzso strains were also zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso A or zzso zzso structural genes could be detected in the zzso of three of these zzso zzso zzso but only after extensive zzso amplification, indicating that the zzso substances were slightly zzso The zzso were characterized as small zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides that were active in a wide pH range zzso Finally, preliminary experiments indicated that the production of zzso L by zzso zzso zzso zzso took place during a natural rye zzso indicating its potential importance in the development of a functional zzso starter culture for cereal zzso
