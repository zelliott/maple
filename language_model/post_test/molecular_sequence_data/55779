zzso molecular evidence was obtained for the critical role of a single zzso acid zzso in a structural zzso distinguished by the zzso zzso zzso which zzso selectively with severe zzso of citrus zzso virus zzso Different zzso zzso cause a wide range of symptoms in the diverse citrus species they zzso Severe symptoms include decline, stem zzso and zzso zzso Plants infected by mild zzso are essentially zzso The zzso zzso zzso which discriminates severe zzso from mild zzso of the virus, was used to map its zzso on the coat protein of zzso A diverse group of coat protein genes of geographically and biologically distinct zzso zzso which are either zzso or zzso was cloned and zzso A series of zzso coat protein genes was constructed through zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso coat proteins expressed in zzso coli was evaluated by Western zzso using zzso and zzso zzso prepared to zzso zzso A single zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso at position 124 of the coat protein abolished the zzso zzso of a severe zzso whereas a zzso zzso at the same site zzso zzso zzso on the coat protein of a previously zzso mild isolate of zzso
