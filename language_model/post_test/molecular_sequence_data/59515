The zzso sequence of a zzso region of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso unit zzso has been zzso This region lies between the previously analyzed zzso and zzso zzso Three open reading frames were contained within this region, potentially coding for proteins of 45, 40, and 12 zzso The zzso ends of transcripts capable of coding for the zzso and zzso proteins map to consensus zzso late zzso start sites zzso while the major zzso end of the transcript coding for the zzso protein maps 16 zzso downstream from another late zzso start site zzso zzso Attempts to prepare zzso viruses containing insertions within these three genes were negative, suggesting that they are all essential for virus replication in cell zzso The size and organization of transcripts expressed from this region of zzso were very similar to those of the previously described zzso region of zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso The three zzso protein sequences zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso acid sequence zzso with the proteins zzso zzso and zzso of zzso suggesting this region is highly zzso in zzso
