We have investigated the effect of zzso and DNA damaging agents on binding of the tumor zzso zzso zzso to its consensus DNA zzso zzso of zzso binding was seen for treatment with radiation, hydrogen zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, and zzso These results showed that DNA strand breaks were sufficient to lead to increased levels of zzso The protein synthesis inhibitor zzso blocks the increase in zzso following DNA zzso The increase in zzso zzso in zzso treated cells may result, at least in part, from an increased zzso of the protein and zzso increases in zzso protein zzso
