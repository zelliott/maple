The mechanism of channel formation and action of zzso zzso is a paradigm for the study of dynamic aspects of zzso zzso The following experimental results concerning interaction of the zzso E1 channel domain with target zzso in zzso and in zzso are zzso zzso the nature of the zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso unfolding of the zzso channel zzso during in zzso binding and zzso of the channel to zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso reversal of channel zzso binding to zzso by an zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso and gating of the zzso channel, discussed in the context of a zzso model for a zzso zzso zzso rescue of zzso cells by high levels of external zzso zzso zzso rescue of cells zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction of the channel domain with its immunity zzso
