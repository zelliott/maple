Dynamic zzso zzso during B cell differentiation was identified in the vicinity of J chain zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso I hypersensitive sites zzso zzso were zzso However, these zzso zzso turned out to be zzso with J chain gene zzso as the J chain zzso zzso remained in a closed zzso The open zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells might be related to the expression of a zzso zzso gene upstream of the zzso zzso which was identified in our Northern zzso zzso The zzso zzso are then closed in the next immature and mature B cell stages until the zzso opens the zzso zzso again as well as zzso to express J chain gene in the primary immune zzso The dynamic regulation of zzso structure during B cell differentiation for the expression of two zzso genes will provide a good model system for the study of B cell differentiation and gene zzso
