zzso of the zzso zzso is observed in a large number of zzso zzso and transgenic animal models have revealed a potent role for zzso in the generation of zzso and zzso However, the reason for high zzso protein levels in most cases is zzso We examined whether zzso protein stabilization could be a mechanism of zzso zzso in leukemia cell lines and in primary bone zzso samples from pediatric acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso We found that zzso protein zzso was prolonged in the majority of leukemia cell lines and bone zzso samples zzso There were no zzso in the zzso gene in any of the leukemia cell lines that could account for increased zzso zzso However, abnormal zzso at two zzso sites, zzso 58 and zzso 62, was observed in leukemia cell lines with stabilized zzso Moreover, stabilized zzso from the ALL cell lines showed decreased affinity for zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso zzso at zzso 58 and zzso its zzso These findings reveal that deregulation of the zzso degradation zzso controlled by zzso 62 and zzso 58 zzso is a novel mechanism for increased expression of a potent zzso known to be involved in zzso zzso
