zzso T zzso are normally only zzso to initiate an immune reaction through the recognition of peptides bound to class II major zzso complex zzso zzso Class II zzso molecules are zzso expressed on zzso cells which play a critical role in the initiation of immune zzso In disease states, however, other cells often express class II zzso molecules zzso This article suggests an hypothesis for the zzso of zzso diseases based on molecular zzso The mimicry described is between microbial or viral peptides presented by zzso cells and self peptides presented inappropriately on a target zzso This leads to helper T cells, zzso by peptides derived from infectious organisms, initiating an zzso attack on the target zzso
