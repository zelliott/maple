zzso A has been reported to be processed in zzso by an as yet undefined zzso suggesting that it is a precursor of biologically active peptides such as zzso In this study, plasma zzso was used as a model zzso to identify the zzso sites exposed in bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso A was zzso with human plasma zzso The zzso fragments produced were isolated by zzso and chemically characterized by zzso acid composition and sequence zzso The combined results indicate that the zzso has preference for specific single zzso zzso cutting zzso to this zzso acid, although certain pairs of basic sites were also zzso The characterized fragments were released in a selective manner from the whole zzso with rapid production of the fragments covering positions zzso and zzso
