The zzso zzso zzso zzso spontaneous phase variation involving a large number of zzso Our previous study indicated that phase I zzso were zzso whereas phase II zzso of zzso zzso F1 were zzso cells which did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 61, zzso In order to approach the study of the zzso zzso a locus containing two zzso from zzso zzso F1 zzso I) was identified by using functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis revealed that the first zzso zzso to the zzso gene coding for zzso and showed a high degree of zzso between the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from other zzso The second identified zzso in the opposite orientation encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso protein 2, zzso Both zzso zzso genes were required for the entire restoration of zzso coli zzso A sequence highly zzso to the zzso 28 consensus promoter was identified upstream from the coding sequences from both zzso The structure of the zzso gene and its surrounding region was shown to be the same in both phase zzso but Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso were, respectively, not and zzso transcribed in phase II zzso In addition, zzso experiments showed that zzso and zzso synthesis of phase II cannot be recovered by placing in trans zzso genes from phase zzso These latter results suggest that a zzso higher in the zzso hierarchy of the zzso zzso is switched off in zzso phase II zzso
