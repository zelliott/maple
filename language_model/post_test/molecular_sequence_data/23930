zzso across zzso DNA zzso in zzso cells is zzso primarily by zzso low zzso DNA zzso We studied zzso DNA synthesis zzso across a zzso zzso zzso a major zzso DNA zzso generated by tobacco zzso This was done using a quantitative zzso that measures zzso zzso by measuring the recovery of gapped plasmids zzso into cultured zzso zzso Analysis of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso across the zzso zzso occurred with an efficiency of 48 zzso zzso which is an order of magnitude higher than in zzso zzso In zzso zzso bypass was 16 zzso zzso suggesting that at least two-thirds of the zzso zzso in zzso were zzso exclusively by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was not required for bypass across zzso in a human zzso cell zzso Analysis of zzso specificity across zzso revealed that bypass was more zzso in zzso lacking zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso introduced into zzso zzso restored both the extent and zzso of bypass across zzso zzso was not required for bypass of a synthetic zzso zzso In zzso analysis demonstrated efficient bypass across zzso by both zzso and zzso suggesting that the biological role of zzso in zzso across zzso is due to regulation of zzso and not due to an exclusive ability to bypass this zzso These results indicate that zzso is zzso in zzso cells with relatively high efficiency and that zzso zzso zzso in zzso with higher efficiency and higher accuracy than other DNA zzso
