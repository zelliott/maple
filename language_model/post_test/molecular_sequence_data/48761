In the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso gain control mechanism at the first zzso between zzso sensory zzso zzso and projection zzso has been suggested to play a critical role in setting the sensitivity and detection range of the sensory zzso To approach the question if such a mechanism may be realized in the zzso recognition system of male zzso in this study attempts were made to explore if zzso zzso cells express a zzso zzso zzso a combination of zzso analysis, zzso experiments and screening of an zzso zzso library we have identified a zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, based on the zzso sequence we could predict a zzso protein from zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso To assess whether zzso is expressed in zzso of male antenna we performed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso positive cells were zzso under long zzso zzso known to contain zzso zzso In parallel it was shown that cells under long zzso hairs were zzso with zzso zzso specific zzso In addition, the zzso specific probe also zzso several cells under shorter zzso zzso but never stained cells under zzso zzso zzso Together, the results indicate that a zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and suggest a zzso gain control mechanism in the zzso terminals of these zzso
