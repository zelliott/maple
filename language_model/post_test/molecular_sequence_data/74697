Spinal muscular zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder that is characterized by the zzso of the motor zzso of the spinal zzso leading to muscle zzso zzso is a result of a zzso of the gene survival motor zzso zzso We have chosen to generate a transgenic zzso model of zzso for the development and testing of zzso and evaluation of zzso To this end, we report the first cloning and identification of the zzso zzso gene and show that there is significant sequence zzso between zzso and human zzso throughout the coding zzso zzso zzso chain reaction results demonstrated slight changes in zzso zzso expression during development and in different zzso In contrast, protein expression profiles were dramatically different based upon different zzso and zzso zzso consistent with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is consistent with human zzso zzso zzso within the zzso and in zzso nuclear structures characteristic of nuclear zzso zzso transient zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso type 1 zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso can rescue the zzso of zzso protein and gem formation in these zzso These studies provide the first characterization of the zzso zzso gene and zzso protein and suggest that a transgenic zzso zzso model is zzso
