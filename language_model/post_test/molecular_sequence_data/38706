In order to probe the structure and protein zzso function of the zzso zzso machinery, a zzso zzso extension containing a zzso in zzso zzso tag and a zzso His tag was added to a zzso precursor of the zzso zzso of the zzso complex to form zzso When zzso was attached to zzso precursor in zzso the zzso complex was neither imported nor did it form a zzso zzso zzso It did, however, competitively inhibit the zzso of zzso precursor with an apparent zzso unaffected by zzso It is shown that the precursor protein achieves a stable folded structure upon dilution from zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of transport results from a zzso proximity of zzso and zzso zzso It is further demonstrated that the majority of precursor rapidly binds to the zzso zzso remaining import competent and yet zzso by high salt or high pH treatment at ice zzso The membrane binding event is unaffected by zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso motive zzso transport steps make up a major fraction of the transport zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso on the zzso precursor is available for membrane binding and initial recognition by the transport machinery, but the attached zzso signals the machinery that the precursor is an incorrectly configured zzso and thus import is zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso mechanism must operate after precursor recognition but before the committed step in zzso
