Multiple deletions of zzso have not only been implicated in aging, but also in a wide variety of pathological zzso The zzso system used in zzso makes it possible to zzso the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso exposing the multiple deletions in zzso implicated in and, at least zzso responsible for these zzso But it is not the number or type of anomalous zzso that is zzso rather it is their frequency relative to the number of intact copies of the zzso zzso Our work exposes the necessity of zzso the number of normal zzso zzso The accuracy of the technique and the small sample size required permit one to detect multiple zzso located in a specific organ, and simultaneously measure the fraction of intact zzso This fraction can then be correlated with zzso dysfunction to serve both as an indicator of tissue aging and a monitor of an impending zzso
