Renal cell zzso zzso is the most lethal zzso cancer, and survival greatly depends on early zzso zzso reliable, new zzso for detection of zzso are zzso We assessed serum protein profiles of samples from two zzso with zzso zzso in duplicate on zzso chips at pH zzso zzso 1: 37 zzso + 32 healthy controls zzso set zzso 20 zzso + 25 zzso Mean peak zzso of detected proteins were compared between zzso and HC with zzso zzso zzso trees were built with discriminating zzso using one sample set as training set and the other as independent validation zzso We found 15 zzso significantly different zzso between zzso and zzso Two zzso trees could be built with these zzso Tree A achieved zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for zzso and 76 and zzso for independent zzso Tree B had 71 and zzso sensitivity and specificity for zzso and 83 and zzso for independent zzso Although two serum protein profiles zzso 5 protein zzso were found that could separate zzso from zzso the sensitivity and specificity is not sufficient to recommend large scale zzso Upon structural identification and quantitative zzso however, these proteins might prove suitable markers in the follow up of zzso zzso
