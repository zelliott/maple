zzso zzso in the zzso precursor protein zzso gene have been found on zzso 21 during the last 2 years in some early onset Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso evidence shows that other genes than the zzso are also involved in the zzso of zzso zzso to a zzso on zzso 14 has been found in early onset zzso The identification of zzso zzso has led to the realization that zzso zzso is a central event in the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso to test this in transgenic mice have so far met with little zzso There are many possible explanations for the problems to generate transgenic zzso These include the possibilities that mice are incapable of developing zzso for reasons dependent on their zzso zzso and that appropriate regulation of zzso gene is required for pathology to zzso Current attempts that seem promising to model the disease pathology are the use of zzso zzso to insert the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso into transgenic zzso
