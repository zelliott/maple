zzso zzso zzso zzso have been widely used in many European countries to control zzso leaf zzso which is caused by zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & MA zzso However, treatment efficacy has declined, and significant shifts in population zzso have occurred in recent years, with the isolation of particularly highly resistant strains from French, English and Irish zzso The present aim was to determine the zzso characteristics of these field zzso and to identify the possible resistance zzso 

Target zzso linked to 11 possible changes in the gene zzso zzso zzso was the basic resistance mechanism in zzso moderately and highly resistant zzso Changes in zzso combined with the zzso of drug zzso zzso probably result in zzso resistance in some of the most resistant zzso Finally, some moderately or highly resistant zzso were found to zzso an zzso in the zzso promoter and/or new combinations of known zzso in the target zzso 

An updated overview of zzso zzso field strains displaying low to high resistance to zzso is provided zzso The management of field resistance and efficacy should be adapted to take these findings into zzso
