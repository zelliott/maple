For DNA zzso to succeed as a scientific endeavor an accurate and zzso query sequence identification method is zzso Although a global zzso alignment can be generated for some zzso markers zzso zzso zzso not all zzso markers are as structurally zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso that depend on global zzso alignments are not universally zzso Some sequence identification methods that use local zzso alignments zzso zzso are unable to accurately differentiate between highly similar sequences and are not designed to cope with zzso zzso relationships or within zzso zzso Here, I present a novel zzso sequence identification zzso accounts for observed within zzso zzso and zzso relationships among zzso zzso identifies short variable segments and corresponding zzso zzso regions in reference zzso These zzso regions are used to score variable regions in the query sequence without the production of a global zzso zzso By incorporating observed within zzso zzso into the scoring zzso zzso arising from shared zzso are zzso An explicit treatment of more inclusive terminals allows for separate identifications to be made for each zzso level and/or for zzso zzso zzso performs better than all other methods when there is imperfect overlap between query and reference sequences zzso zzso queries against a full-length zzso zzso zzso consistently produced better identifications at the zzso for all query zzso
