zzso are zzso and composed of the hard zzso and soft zzso tick families, as well as the zzso a family with a single species, zzso zzso zzso biological differences in lifestyle strategies for hard and soft ticks suggest that various zzso adaptations occurred after their zzso The zzso relationships between the tick families have not yet been resolved due to the lack of molecular data for zzso zzso This tick possesses a zzso and zzso zzso as observed for zzso has a leathery zzso similar to zzso and has been considered the evolutionary missing link between the two zzso Little knowledge exists with regard to its feeding biology or host zzso Data on its biology and systematic relationship to the other tick families could therefore be crucial in understanding the evolution of zzso zzso in zzso Live specimens were collected and blood meal analysis showed the presence of DNA for zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Feeding of ticks on zzso showed that zzso occurred zzso similar to zzso but that blood meal concentration occurs via zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso nuclear and zzso zzso genes indicate that zzso zzso grouped zzso to the main tick zzso The data supports the zzso of all tick families and suggests the evolution of zzso zzso zzso in the ancestral tick zzso Based on the data and considerations from literature we propose an origin for ticks in the zzso basin of zzso during the late zzso The zzso family almost became extinct during the End zzso event, leaving zzso zzso as the closest living relative to the ancestral tick lineage and the evolutionary missing link between the tick zzso
