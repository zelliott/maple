Human zzso zzso is a zzso with zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to the zzso zzso of E coli zzso zzso Secondary structure predictions, zzso of zzso and zzso regions, and the pattern of zzso zzso suggest that the three zzso structures of the two proteins are likely to be zzso A three zzso model of zzso zzso was generated from the crystal structure of the zzso zzso of E coli zzso zzso in the zzso by aligning the zzso building in gaps, and zzso the zzso The binding sites for zzso zzso in both zzso are similar and the zzso binding site in zzso zzso appears to be in the same location as the zzso binding site in zzso zzso with zzso charged side chains replaced by positively charged zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene found in patients with zzso of the zzso zzso are clustered in important structural or functional zzso either in the interior of the zzso at the active site, or at the zzso zzso while zzso found in patients with milder zzso zzso disease are located primarily on the surface of the zzso The predicted effects of all known zzso zzso and in frame deletions in the zzso zzso gene on the structure and function of the mature zzso are zzso
