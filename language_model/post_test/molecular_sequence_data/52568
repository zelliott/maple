In zzso efficient protein transport across the zzso zzso zzso membrane may occur zzso or zzso The latter process is zzso by a membrane protein complex that consists of the zzso complex and the zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso cells protein zzso is almost exclusively zzso This transport depends on the zzso complex, which is zzso to the zzso zzso complex and has been identified in zzso as a zzso zzso membrane protein zzso We report here the existence of zzso zzso zzso complexes that associate with two ubiquitous proteins of the zzso zzso According to primary sequence analysis both proteins display zzso to the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and are therefore named zzso and zzso zzso The probable function of the zzso zzso complex is discussed with respect to its abundance in zzso zzso which, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso apparently lack efficient zzso zzso zzso
