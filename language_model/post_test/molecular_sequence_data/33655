zzso seeking to limit gene expression to zzso zzso of genetically engineered cereal crops have only a few choices of well characterized zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized the promoter of the rice Leaf zzso 2 gene zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein that is strongly expressed in leaves and other zzso zzso zzso rice plants containing an zzso zzso zzso reporter gene displayed an zzso pattern of zzso This expression corresponded to transcript levels observed on zzso blots of various rice zzso and zzso gene expression zzso The strongest zzso activity was observed in zzso stained zzso cells, but other green zzso and leaf cell types including zzso cells also exhibited zzso Low or zzso levels of zzso transcript and zzso reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and zzso zzso The zzso promoter is highly responsive to light and only weak expression was detected in zzso rice zzso The specificity and strength of the zzso promoter suggests that this promoter will be a useful control element for green zzso expression in rice and potentially other zzso zzso promoters like zzso will enable precise, localized expression of zzso in zzso crops and limit the potential of unintended impacts on plant physiology and the zzso
