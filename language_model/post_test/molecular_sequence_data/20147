Two zzso site zzso markers for the wheat yellow rust resistance zzso gene zzso have been derived through the identification and characterization of linked amplified zzso length zzso zzso The sequences of the 2 zzso markers partially overlap with one another, but belong to discrete zzso zzso completely zzso with zzso whereas zzso maps at a distance of zzso zzso The DNA sequence of zzso shows significant zzso with the 3' end of zzso site zzso - zzso repeat zzso - type zzso in particular with zzso of the rice bacterial blight zzso zzso The distinct genetic location of the 2 zzso zzso suggests that zzso falls within an zzso zzso Because neither sequence forms part of a zzso zzso product, we propose that the zzso zzso cluster includes zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso simple sequence repeat zzso marker has also been identified, which allows zzso to be effectively zzso along with other zzso for yellow zzso into elite wheat genetic backgrounds, through zzso zzso
