The zzso zzso protein RB restricts cellular zzso This may involve zzso the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that RB can repress pol III zzso when zzso either in zzso or in zzso We also demonstrated that pol III activity is elevated substantially in primary zzso from zzso zzso Here we address the molecular mechanism of this zzso RB is shown to repress all types of pol III zzso It can do this even if added after zzso complex zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that RB targets specifically the general pol III factor zzso A physical interaction between zzso and RB is indicated by zzso pull-down and zzso zzso We show that zzso activity is elevated in primary zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex that includes the zzso protein zzso and a zzso factor called zzso We show that RB itself contains regions of zzso to both zzso and zzso and propose a model in which RB zzso zzso by mimicking these two zzso
