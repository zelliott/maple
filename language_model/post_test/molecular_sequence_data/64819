The outer membrane protein CD zzso of zzso zzso is an outer membrane protein with several attributes of a potential vaccine zzso We isolated four zzso zzso of strain zzso on the basis of their reduced binding to zzso human lung cells in zzso formation zzso and we determined that they contain a zzso in zzso We also found that these zzso insertions had zzso zzso zzso grew zzso became serum sensitive, bound approximately zzso less to zzso cells, and appeared transparent when grown on solid zzso We confirmed that these various zzso could be attributed solely to disruption of zzso by constructing the zzso strain zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso coli bacteria expressing the gene product exhibited a zzso increase in adherence to zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso zzso zzso and our findings demonstrate that this gene product is an zzso for human lung zzso
