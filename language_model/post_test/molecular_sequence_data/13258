Growth factors and the zzso zzso have been shown to fulfill vital zzso roles in many embryonic zzso Our hypothesis is that a zzso role played by the zzso zzso in sea urchins may be the binding of a zzso growth factor to promote signaling zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso specific proteins isolated from zzso zzso zzso of these zzso to zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso The zzso are sensitive to the zzso from the zzso through the zzso zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso and zzso zzso are required for the early differentiation of the gut and zzso We present evidence that the zzso growth factor depends on the zzso zzso for signaling zzso zzso peptides representing the zzso zzso zzso binding sequence on human zzso were added to zzso zzso cultures to compete for binding sites with the zzso zzso growth zzso The experimental zzso inhibited zzso and caused zzso arranged multiple zzso to zzso Development was unaffected by a control zzso These studies support our hypothesis and suggest that zzso and zzso growth factors induce signaling events required for sea zzso zzso and zzso and suggest that an zzso zzso zzso growth factor is involved in differentiation along the zzso zzso
