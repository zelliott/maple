zzso zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso zzso designed to zzso in a controlled way into zzso and higher ordered structures depending on zzso In this work, we use various techniques to investigate the state of the zzso dispersed in water under dilute conditions at different pH and in the presence of zzso acid or zzso zzso We have identified stable zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso which have a length of zzso and diameter of zzso The zzso have the characteristic zzso zzso structure of zzso zzso as measured by circular zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso During incubation at pH zzso the zzso zzso very slowly via an zzso zzso zzso zzso without changing their diameter, and the zzso of such zzso depends on pH and zzso zzso At pH zzso we also observed a substantial amount of zzso in the system, which do not participate in the zzso zzso and degrade to zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been simulated using the zzso kinetic model, population balance zzso and the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental zzso It is also found that the zzso process is not limited by diffusion but rather is an activated process with energy barrier in the order of zzso
