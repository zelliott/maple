A three-dimensional zzso model of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been constructed by zzso zzso The model building has been based on a structural alignment of five X-ray structures of zzso from different zzso The 3-D model of the zzso zzso was obtained by zzso acid substitution in the human zzso which was chosen as template, modification of four zzso zzso zzso two zzso and subsequent energy zzso The active site of zzso zzso zzso was analyzed and compared to human zzso with respect to sequence variations and structural zzso Based on this analysis the molecular consequences of point zzso known to be involved in drug resistance were zzso The significance of the most important point zzso causing resistance, zzso could be explained by the model, whereas the point zzso associated with enhanced resistance, zzso and zzso seem to have a more indirect effect on inhibitor zzso
