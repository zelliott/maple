zzso zzso plays a key role in cell attachment, embryonic development, and wound zzso In this respect, it is known that zzso promotes zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine specific zzso zzso zzso zzso fragment, zzso collagen fragment, and zzso zzso zzso and a biologically active zzso within the zzso zzso for their ability to influence human zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso on gold zzso coated with different zzso zzso IV zzso zzso with or without the zzso zzso and the three zzso zzso After 20 zzso locomotion tracks were zzso by zzso image analysis that determines the area of each microscopic field occupied by migration tracks, a so-called migration index zzso zzso on type IV collagen and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso on the zzso domain and zzso domain of zzso were similar to our negative controls zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso domain on zzso zzso was found to be dose zzso Moreover, we could specifically inhibit the zzso locomotion using the zzso sequence contained in the zzso zzso We did not observe a synergistic effect zzso a higher zzso when we added the three fragments in a same zzso These results suggest zzso that the zzso zzso of zzso partially supports zzso zzso zzso that other untested zzso zzso should act in zzso with the zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso or alternatively zzso that the zzso function of promoting cell migration resides within the zzso zzso domain, but the proper presentation of this domain to the cell requires an intact, native zzso zzso and zzso that the zzso sequence is essential for zzso zzso
