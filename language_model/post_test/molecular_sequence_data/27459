The zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso II, zzso zzso B), respectively, isolated from children in Bangladesh, were analyzed zzso zzso zzso genes of these strains had zzso identity to each other and showed zzso identity to those of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequences revealed that strains zzso and zzso were located in a lineage of zzso zzso However, the cluster was highly divergent from the previously established zzso zzso The zzso portions of strains zzso and zzso showed more than zzso zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso zzso and these strains were clustered into the same zzso These findings indicate that the zzso of these strains should be classified into a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that is distinct from that of common zzso zzso zzso
