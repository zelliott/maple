Although many zzso promoters transcribed by zzso zzso II initiate zzso at multiple sites, the regulation of multiple start site zzso is not zzso Beginning with the prediction that multiple start site promoters may share regulatory features and using the zzso promoter (which can zzso either a single or multiple zzso start zzso as a model, several promoters with analogous zzso windows were grouped and searched for the presence of a common DNA zzso A downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso start site zzso zzso was found in the majority of promoters zzso zzso of this element within the zzso promoter reduced zzso by selectively decreasing zzso of downstream start zzso We propose that a new class of zzso zzso II zzso those that can zzso a distinctive window of multiple start sites, is defined by the presence of a downstream zzso zzso
