zzso zzso zzso expressed by various zzso cells zzso has been described as a zzso zzso for zzso T zzso Recently, we observed that zzso also serves as an important zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells zzso During these studies, low levels of zzso zzso were also detected on normal zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso also is involved in zzso zzso by zzso normal zzso zzso or the spontaneously transformed zzso zzso zzso 212 were treated with zzso or zzso to induce zzso zzso analyses showed induction of zzso expression on normal zzso zzso as well as zzso 212 zzso In functional zzso zzso or zzso normal or transformed zzso were far more potent zzso of primary zzso zzso responses than zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited the zzso activity of zzso an effect that was even more pronounced when zzso was added to the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso surfaces by a zzso zzso C zzso also significantly inhibited the zzso capacity of zzso for zzso zzso T zzso In aggregate, our data indicate that expression of zzso on activated zzso contributes to the capacity of these cells to induce proliferation of zzso T zzso
