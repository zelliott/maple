Various zzso acid substitution scoring zzso are used in conjunction with local alignments programs to detect regions of similarity and zzso potential common ancestry between zzso The usual scoring schemes derive from the implicit hypothesis that related proteins evolve from a common zzso by the zzso of point zzso and that zzso acids tend to be progressively zzso by others with similar zzso However, other frequent single zzso events, like zzso zzso or deletion and gene zzso change the translation reading frame and cause previously zzso zzso acid sequences to become unrecognizable at zzso Here, I derive five new types of scoring zzso each capable of detecting a specific frame shift zzso zzso and inversion in 3 zzso and use them with a regular local alignments program to detect zzso acid sequences that may have derived from alternative reading frames of the same zzso zzso zzso shifts are zzso from the sole comparison of the protein zzso The five scoring zzso were used with the zzso program to compare all the protein sequences in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the searches revealed hundreds of highly significant frame shift matches, of which many are likely to represent sequencing zzso Others provide some evidence that frame shift zzso might be used in protein evolution as a way to create new zzso acid sequences from pre-existing coding zzso
