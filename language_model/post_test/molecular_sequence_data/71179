zzso chain reaction for 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso were performed on 400 zzso coli zzso to determine their zzso prevalence among zzso zzso coli zzso from zzso pigs with zzso in the Republic of zzso A total of 200 of the 400 zzso coli zzso were also selected for characterization of the O zzso Of these 200 zzso zzso could be determined in 139 zzso but not in 61 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were the most common, followed in descending order by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the 400 zzso coli zzso carried genes for at least 1 of the zzso or zzso zzso Of these 97 zzso 27 carried genes for at least 1 of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso percent of the zzso that carried zzso zzso genes carried genes for at least 1 of the zzso and zzso of the zzso that carried zzso genes carried genes for at least 1 of the zzso zzso Genes for the zzso zzso were detected in zzso of the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso and zzso genes were detected in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Genes for zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The 6 major zzso observed in this study (in decreasing zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
