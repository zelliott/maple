zzso zzso acts as a general zzso of zzso in zzso by organizing zzso into zzso condensed forms of zzso The capability of zzso to bind to DNA with some sequence specificity is likely to be critical in the control of these zzso We show here that zzso and several other zzso including zzso zzso can inhibit DNA binding of zzso The results also show that zzso zzso affects binding of zzso to DNA in a fashion enhancing zzso sequence specificity of the zzso The study suggests a novel mechanism of zzso of zzso activity that has important implications for the role of zzso as a zzso zzso
