zzso A virus zzso protein 1 zzso zzso is a zzso factor which is targeted into the zzso It is a zzso protein that zzso host cell zzso processing and zzso host cell zzso zzso We show that the zzso protein can interact with all six human zzso alpha zzso indicating that the nuclear zzso of zzso protein is zzso by the classical zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein of the zzso zzso virus has only one zzso zzso or zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso whereas the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso virus also has a second zzso zzso zzso zzso is mapped to zzso 35 to 41, which also function in the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso was created by a zzso zzso extension zzso 231 to zzso that became prevalent among human influenza A virus types isolated between the years 1950 to zzso zzso includes basic zzso acids at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso also forms a functional zzso zzso signal zzso a function that was retained in zzso type virus zzso proteins even without the zzso zzso It is likely that the zzso zzso zzso targeting function of zzso protein plays a role in the zzso of influenza A zzso
