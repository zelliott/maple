The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with a general decrease in storage protein zzso altered protein body zzso and the synthesis of a novel zzso zzso storage zzso Unlike storage proteins in normal kernels and the majority of storage proteins in zzso zzso the zzso zzso contains a signal zzso that would normally be removed during protein synthesis and zzso The expected processing site of this zzso reveals a putative zzso zzso zzso that is not found at other junctions between signal sequences and mature zzso To investigate the impact of such a zzso on signal zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso processing system in zzso zzso of zzso from zzso kernels or synthetic zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso yielded a zzso zzso A normal signal zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso restored the capacity of the zzso to direct synthesis of a properly processed protein in a zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso of the zzso zzso The processed zzso zzso zzso was localized in the soluble portion of the zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso By remaining anchored to protein body zzso during zzso zzso the zzso zzso may thus zzso storage protein packing and zzso protein body zzso
