zzso serve as zzso in the synthesis of cell wall zzso and are themselves generated through sequential zzso reactions from zzso zzso as the starting zzso in the zzso and the zzso zzso For the present study, a soluble zzso with zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso from pea zzso zzso zzso sprouts by conventional zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso revealed that it is zzso by a predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso and is distinct from the zzso zzso localized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli exhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities with apparent zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The apparent equilibrium constant for zzso formation from zzso was zzso whereas that for zzso formation from zzso was zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso forms a group with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso apart from a group including zzso zzso and zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli showed high zzso zzso activity in addition to their zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and its close zzso zzso the zzso between zzso and zzso as the last step in the zzso de zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso the net flux of zzso may be from zzso to zzso as part of the salvage zzso for zzso
