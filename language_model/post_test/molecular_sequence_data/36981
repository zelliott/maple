A zzso of an zzso of 4 zzso in the gene for the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in a female with zzso zzso zzso due to the rapid degradation of alpha and beta zzso proteins of zzso zzso This zzso caused a zzso that altered the zzso acid sequence and created a premature stop zzso This zzso zzso has been found in an unrelated female patient with E1 alpha zzso It is rare that the same zzso is found in unrelated patients with this rare zzso error of zzso Furthermore, short deletions or zzso in the E1 alpha gene of patients with E1 alpha zzso have been found only in zzso 10 and zzso These zzso may be hot spots for the zzso by the zzso zzso This patient was zzso for the normal and a zzso zzso However, in most of the cultured skin zzso from this patient, the zzso zzso was zzso These observations suggest that the X zzso containing the normal zzso was predominantly zzso so that she developed zzso zzso and neurological abnormalities despite being zzso The zzso alpha zzso protein failed to form a stable structure of zzso zzso so that both alpha and beta zzso proteins were zzso zzso
