zzso active zzso zzso was obtained from zzso zzso by a modified zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a molecular mass of about zzso zzso and was composed of three zzso with molecular masses of 23, 26, and 45 zzso The zzso zzso contained a zzso group at its N zzso which could either be labeled with zzso zzso or removed by zzso thus, zzso sequencing became feasible for this zzso zzso was zzso bound to the zzso zzso if zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso which correlated with an observed zzso content of zzso zzso in zzso zzso No other zzso zzso was identified in the zzso A zzso pair zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso containing the two genes zzso and zzso zzso coding for a zzso protein was most likely translated as a zzso that was zzso zzso at a zzso site to give the zzso zzso and most probably a zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso and contained an in frame zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were transcribed together on a transcript of zzso zzso zzso was additionally transcribed as indicated by a zzso zzso zzso
