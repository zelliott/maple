To study the genetic zzso between zzso zzso zzso from Iran and other countries based on zzso gene zzso sequence zzso 

A zzso region of the zzso gene from 24 zzso zzso zzso obtained from human and surface water origins in Iran over a zzso period was zzso and compared with the sequence data from the zzso belonging to other zzso zzso analysis of the constructed zzso based on zzso sequence divergence for our clinical zzso showed one sequence type zzso whereas environmental zzso revealed eight zzso Interestingly, one of our environmental zzso was zzso with clinical zzso in the largest cluster containing the epidemic zzso Our 24 zzso plus 198 global zzso available in the zzso showed 77 sequence types zzso with at least one zzso zzso 

Our result suggested that zzso sequencing is a reliable analysis method for understanding the zzso of the local zzso with the zzso obtained zzso 

zzso the genetic zzso between zzso zzso zzso could give insights into the health care system for better control and prevention of the zzso
