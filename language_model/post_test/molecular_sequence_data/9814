A DNA vaccine constructed with the zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso and rev genes has been shown to induce an effective zzso immune response when zzso via an intramuscular zzso In the present study, we obtained high levels of both zzso and zzso immune activity by zzso administration of this DNA zzso The production of zzso zzso zzso in feces and zzso fluid was zzso significantly by zzso DNA zzso This route of administration resulted in a significant level of zzso zzso in feces and zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso administration of this DNA vaccine zzso a zzso immune zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso greatly enhanced these zzso zzso against zzso were present for at least 10 zzso zzso of the DNA vaccine with zzso and zzso plasmids induced high levels of zzso zzso and an increase in delayed type hypersensitivity when administered by the zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that zzso administration of this DNA vaccine with zzso together with zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso a strong level of zzso immune zzso
