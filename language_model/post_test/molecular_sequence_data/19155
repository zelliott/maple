zzso in the zzso zzso are associated with respiratory and enteric disease in dogs and zzso In addition, novel zzso zzso zzso have been identified in domestic and wild pigs in recent years, but are of unknown relevance to zzso The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence zzso zzso and genetic diversity of zzso in pigs in the zzso Using newly established multiplex real-time zzso zzso 385 zzso zzso zzso serum and zzso samples from pigs with various disease conditions were zzso A high zzso prevalence rate ranging from zzso to zzso % was identified in the investigated samples and often two or more zzso species were detected in the same zzso Cloning and sequencing analysis of the partial zzso protein zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso of DNA samples positive for zzso groups 1 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso or zzso revealed a high genetic diversity especially for the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso group 1 zzso gene displayed a low zzso zzso Using primer walking, 18 partial or nearly complete zzso of zzso were obtained and six of the 18 nearly complete zzso represented novel zzso zzso zzso analysis using partial zzso zzso and zzso genes and the nearly complete zzso indicated possible zzso events within and between zzso Further studies will be required to reveal the possible zzso role of these diverse zzso
