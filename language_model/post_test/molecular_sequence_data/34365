zzso of zzso spontaneous immune responses in cancer patients revealed that zzso and both zzso and zzso T cell responses were induced together in cancer zzso To explore whether such integrated immune responses are also spontaneously induced for other tumor zzso we have evaluated zzso and T cell responses against zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer patients and healthy zzso We found that zzso zzso of zzso cancer patients but no healthy donors showed specific zzso responses against zzso zzso zzso While none of 12 patients with high zzso zzso zzso showed spontaneous zzso zzso T cell responses following a single in zzso zzso significant zzso zzso producing zzso T cells were detected in 6 zzso Surprisingly, similar levels of zzso zzso T cells but not zzso T cells were also detected in zzso zzso cancer patients and zzso healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in healthy donors originated from a zzso zzso T cell population and recognized naturally processed zzso zzso zzso These results raise the possibility that zzso zzso T cells reflect abnormalities in zzso occurring in normal individuals and that they may play a role in processes of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso
