Most of the zzso kernel oil is located in the zzso while the majority of starch is located in the zzso zzso kernel composition and value are affected significantly by the ratio of the zzso size to the zzso size; however, the genetic regulation of zzso to zzso ratio zzso in zzso is zzso Here we identified zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso as a gene associated with zzso variation in zzso We first expressed rice Giant zzso zzso gene driven by zzso promoter in zzso and detected a zzso % reduction in zzso in transgenic seeds, demonstrating the existence of zzso zzso mechanisms for zzso determination in rice and zzso We next identified zzso zzso a zzso of rice GE sharing 70 % identity in zzso zzso as a candidate based on the similar expression pattern and zzso with a previously detected zzso for zzso Followed by linkage and association zzso a zzso zzso element zzso zzso in zzso region of zzso gene was identified to be associated with increase in zzso and kernel oil zzso zzso level of the favorable zzso zzso containing the zzso TE zzso was strongly zzso In addition, the zzso TE zzso site was a selection target during the artificial long-term selection for the high zzso trait in a high oil zzso This is the first report that demonstrates an association of zzso with zzso variation in zzso and identifies zzso gene as a promising target for manipulation of zzso and grain composition by either transgenic approach or molecular breeding in zzso
