We previously reported that a gene zzso isolated from zzso zzso is associated with copper zzso In the present study, the DNA upstream of the zzso was cloned and the zzso sequence zzso An open reading frame coding for 124 zzso acids was predicted, which was connected in frame to the zzso The deduced protein sequence exhibits striking zzso with known zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso renders zzso zzso hypersensitive to copper present in growth media, indicating that it encodes the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of copper content in the zzso and zzso cells showed that the copper content was increased in the zzso cells, further supporting that the previous proposal that the gene zzso is involved in copper zzso In addition, the cop zzso consisting of the genes zzso and zzso was identified by primer extension and reverse zzso chain zzso Our results indicate that the genes for copper import and export are located in separate zzso within zzso zzso
