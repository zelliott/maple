zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which plays a zzso role in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The present study was designed to define the gene structure, zzso and tissue specific expression of the zzso cardiac zzso of zzso Two sets of zzso libraries zzso zzso and zzso were screened using the mouse cardiac zzso zzso and several overlapping clones were zzso These clones were characterized using restriction zzso zzso Southern zzso and partial zzso The cardiac zzso gene consists of 11 zzso and its zzso zzso region is characterized by the presence of a zzso box, muscle specific promoter elements such as 7 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso and 1 Repeat zzso zzso as well as several muscle zzso zzso elements zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the cardiac zzso of zzso was first detected on day 11 zzso and approached adult levels by day 4 zzso zzso of cardiac zzso was also detected in adult zzso skeletal muscle, zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso characterization of cardiac zzso may form the basis for further evaluation of its regulatory role in zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso
