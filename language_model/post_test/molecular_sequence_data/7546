A 153 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso of pig heart zzso zzso zzso was specifically amplified by zzso using redundant zzso zzso based on partial zzso sequence data zzso and zzso zzso zzso 29, zzso This zzso zzso was then used as a probe to isolate zzso clones zzso the complete mature form of the zzso from a monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the monkey zzso and the partial sequence of the pig heart zzso revealed a high level of sequence zzso In addition, 3 overlapping fragments of the zzso for the zzso of monkey zzso were amplified using zzso zzso derived from the zzso sequence of a zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso fragments allow deduction of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso Since the zzso of monkey zzso has already been cloned zzso Hall, Perry and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a deduced zzso acid sequence is now available for all three zzso of zzso zzso zzso between these zzso are discussed and they are compared with the two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso
