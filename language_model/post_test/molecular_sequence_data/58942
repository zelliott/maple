zzso of several different zzso zzso zzso regulatory genes has been shown to cause inappropriate zzso zzso and growth zzso We previously exploited this observation that induced development caused growth zzso in designing a screen to identify other genes that could activate development when zzso We identified 16 zzso in which induced expression of different random zzso DNA sequences caused growth zzso zzso of zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso regulatory zzso and in several cases zzso This zzso was designated zzso for zzso expression zzso of zzso and the genes were called zzso through zzso Here we describe one of these zzso zzso which is predicted to zzso a zzso protein zzso that is zzso expressed and is essential for zzso While it is unclear why zzso of the zzso caused zzso we showed that this activity required other known early zzso regulators including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We propose that zzso is an example of a gene that is not only required for growth, but also has specific functions early in development that zzso zzso zzso presumably by allowing translation of specific zzso like zzso
