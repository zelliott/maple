The zzso synthesis of the N zzso analog of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso was characterized by low recovery from the zzso and the zzso appearance of four zzso zzso revealed molecular weights for two of these zzso that corresponded to the desired zzso plus zzso or zzso The other two were justified by zzso a CO2 elimination of the zzso protecting group to zzso 1) zzso plus zzso zzso and 2) zzso plus zzso and zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso allowed observation of zzso zzso down to an zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and the corresponding protecting zzso These data revealed that the zzso were not the result of incomplete zzso but the result of migration of the protecting groups to the zzso end of the zzso zzso experiments were subsequently performed and revealed the exact site of zzso the zzso positions of the zzso zzso These zzso are presumed to arise by zzso aromatic substitution of the zzso group during zzso zzso The desired zzso analog served as a convenient, albeit zzso intermediate for zzso of the highly charged zzso by zzso zzso zzso
