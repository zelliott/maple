Two clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a patient transferred from Bangladesh and hospitalized for zzso in Paris, zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed the zzso zzso zzso and was susceptible only to zzso and zzso while zzso zzso zzso expressed only the naturally occurring zzso gene at a zzso level and exhibited a zzso zzso resistance zzso In zzso the typical zzso zzso sequence zzso region of class 1 zzso usually present upstream of the zzso gene was replaced by a truncated zzso and a zzso repeated element zzso zzso of the zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso disrupted by zzso and an zzso zzso belonging to a common region zzso region 1 zzso immediately upstream of the zzso zzso were zzso Further zzso a second truncated zzso region in direct repeat belonged to zzso an zzso containing two gene zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Thus, the overall structure corresponded to a zzso class 1 zzso termed zzso zzso analyses revealed that both zzso were zzso related and differed by a zzso zzso zzso that contained zzso Both zzso contained another zzso zzso that carried three gene zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso This work identifies for the first time the spread of zzso zzso genes located on a zzso zzso It also reports for the first time a zzso element in zzso zzso that is associated with an zzso resistance zzso gene that is expressed from a composite zzso
