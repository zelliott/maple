zzso expression of a human zzso zzso Colo 205 cell derived zzso in cell lines which zzso express only zzso zzso has resulted in the expression of a beta 1 zzso zzso gene responsible for synthesis of zzso based upon the zzso type 1 core zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were panned on zzso coated plates after initial treatment with a combination of zzso zzso specific for type 1 chain terminal structures zzso and a very broadly specific zzso zzso with multiple type 1 chain derivatives zzso zzso cells after panning were capable of efficiently transferring Gal in beta 1 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso clones of zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells were produced and zzso zzso zzso cells do not express type 1 chain based zzso The nature of the type 1 chain based zzso produced in each of these clones was analyzed by solid phase zzso binding zzso Three types of behavior were zzso zzso of type 1 terminal structures that were either exclusively zzso or zzso or a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no difference in type 2 zzso expression between any clone and the parental cells was zzso These data suggest that coordination of subsequent reactions capable of zzso type 1 chain structures is not the same in all zzso The relationship of these results to aspects of cellular regulation of zzso zzso is zzso
