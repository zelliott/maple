The zzso neural crest arises at the border of the neural plate during early stages of nervous system zzso however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying neural crest zzso Here we identify a zzso zzso zzso which has the ability to prolong neural crest zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a graded pattern in the closing neural zzso It subsequently becomes restricted to the zzso neural folds and zzso neural zzso Over expression of zzso using zzso zzso causes an excess of neural crest zzso and extends the time that the neural tube is competent to generate as well as zzso neural crest zzso These results support an important role for zzso in regulating the production of neural crest cells by the neural zzso
