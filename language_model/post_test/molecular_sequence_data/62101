Cloning of zzso A and B has demonstrated clearly that zzso A and B are coded by different proteins with zzso zzso acid zzso With the zzso A and B zzso zzso we showed the tissue distribution and zzso structure of zzso A and B, the latter suggesting that they are derived from the same ancestral zzso The active sites, the role of zzso zzso the three-dimensional models and the zzso targeting zzso of both zzso have been zzso The zzso regulation of zzso A and B has been zzso zzso A zzso mice showed increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso B zzso mice showed increased zzso zzso levels zzso Both zzso A and B zzso mice showed increased response to zzso zzso A zzso mice showed increased emotional learning and memory and aggressive behavior, but the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors were down zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to abolish the zzso suggesting that the aggressive behavior may be zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso B zzso mice are resistant to zzso a toxin which zzso Parkinson's zzso Studies of these mice suggest that zzso A and B have distinct zzso and zzso zzso
