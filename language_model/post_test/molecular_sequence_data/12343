Several zzso have been identified as markers of early zzso disease during vascular injury and zzso Of particular importance, transforming growth zzso zzso 1) has been found to be crucial in promoting zzso tissue deposition resulting in both zzso and zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso 1 and beta 2 during cholesterol feeding in the Watanabe zzso an established model of zzso has not been zzso zzso we examined the expression of zzso 1 and beta 2 signal from zzso segments of 10 zzso Watanabe rabbits with the use of reverse zzso chain reaction zzso amplification during normal zzso diet and during zzso supplemental cholesterol feeding for a period of two zzso zzso transcripts from the zzso tissue were zzso at the end of the feeding zzso For Watanabe rabbits fed regular zzso the expression of both zzso 1 and beta 2 is reduced in the zzso arch as compared with the descending zzso In contrast, Watanabe rabbits fed high cholesterol diets zzso a differential expression of zzso zzso depending on the spatial location within the zzso In the zzso arch, increased transcript signals for both zzso 1 and beta 2 were noted as compared with rabbits on normal zzso The zzso found in the zzso arch are typified by abundant foam cells and zzso smooth muscle zzso Analysis of the zzso 1 and 2 profile on these same cell elements in zzso results in a similar expression of increased zzso zzso for zzso 1 and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
