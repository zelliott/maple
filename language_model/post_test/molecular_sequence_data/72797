Seven envelope regions from two series of patient zzso have been zzso cloned and analyzed for replication zzso and zzso Growth potential was analyzed for zzso sequences zzso into an zzso backbone zzso zzso zzso studies were conducted on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms of the zzso using zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso regions of the patient zzso zzso a spectrum of replication zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso Both patient series included zzso viruses with no ability to grow on zzso lines, and highly zzso inducing viruses which grew well on zzso zzso These differences in growth potential did not correlate with the ability of the zzso zzso to raise zzso in zzso Rather, the relative zzso of the zzso was patient and form zzso The zzso from patient 5 raised higher zzso of zzso than the zzso from patient zzso For each primary zzso the zzso form of the zzso raised higher zzso of zzso than the zzso zzso Thus, structural features of zzso that affect replication do not necessarily affect the ability to raise zzso
