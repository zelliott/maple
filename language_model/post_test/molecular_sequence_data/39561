The thermodynamics of the small zzso protein domain is studied by means of a simplified model where each zzso zzso acid interacts with the others through a contact potential controlled by a random zzso Good folding zzso characterized by a low native energy, display three main zzso zzso zzso a zzso ensemble, an unfolded zzso and a folded ensemble (plus two other states, frozen and random zzso populated only at extreme zzso Interestingly, the unfolded zzso has some regions already zzso zzso designed zzso on the other hand, display a wide transition from the random zzso to a frozen zzso The comparison with the zzso theory of zzso is zzso
