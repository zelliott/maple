The genetic diversity of recent clinical zzso of zzso zzso in Japan was studied on the basis of amplified DNA band lengths determined with a specific zzso primer reported to have been designed to span a zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso Our analyses of 301 clinical zzso of zzso zzso showed that they could be classified into five zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso 5 zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso The new zzso E was characterized to have a group I zzso zzso which is longer than zzso reported ones and which has a zzso sequence length of zzso zzso Our analysis of the zzso sequence indicated that it is composed of an zzso similar to that of zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso Analysis of the sequence of the internal transcribed zzso zzso region of the zzso E strain showed that its sequence is identical to those of strains of other zzso with only a few base substitution zzso Throughout the study, the possible horizontal transfer of the group I zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso A high degree of correlation between the presence of a group I zzso in zzso zzso zzso E and zzso to the zzso agent zzso was zzso The five zzso of zzso zzso examined in the present study showed genetic diversity when they were compared by randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso pattern analysis, and this diversity was also confirmed by the analysis of ITS region zzso
