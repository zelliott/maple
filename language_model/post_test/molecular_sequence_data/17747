zzso zzso zzso recognizes a single 140 zzso zzso on the surface of zzso zzso zzso an zzso which is distinct from the extensively characterized zzso zzso zzso To more thoroughly characterize this additional surface zzso a zzso expression library was screened with zzso and an zzso clone zzso was obtained which expressed part of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso included two unique repetitive sequences of zzso acids and a zzso sequence motif which is found in several proteins including the zzso protein zzso zzso The cloned DNA zzso to a zzso zzso chain zzso amplified zzso zzso demonstrating the zzso expression of this zzso A synthetic zzso of one of the repeats, zzso was recognized by zzso and mice zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso produced high levels of zzso that reacted with the surface of zzso and specifically to the 140 zzso zzso Thus, at least two different proteins are on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso exterior of the zzso stage of malaria zzso is more zzso complex than previously zzso
