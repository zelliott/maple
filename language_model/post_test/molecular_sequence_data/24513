The zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate large numbers of low zzso genes from the zzso winter barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One hundred and sixty zzso zzso low zzso zzso clones were zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that several zzso clones were zzso expressed by treatment of low temperature, zzso zzso and zzso One of the zzso zzso was induced from 3 to 72 h after cold treatment while its transcript was detected only at 12 h after zzso treatment, indicating that the expression of zzso by low temperature was regulated by an zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequences were zzso zzso long and the open reading frame consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences showed no sequence zzso with the previously reported low zzso zzso barley zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that the zzso contains three zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel zzso protein induced by low zzso
