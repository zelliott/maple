zzso viral zzso zzso represent some of the most potent and promising vehicles for therapeutic human gene transfer due to a unique combination of beneficial zzso These include the zzso of the underlying zzso viruses and the highly advanced zzso for production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A further particular advantage of the zzso system over other viruses is the availability of a wealth of naturally occurring zzso which differ in essential properties yet can all be easily engineered as zzso using a common zzso Moreover, a number of groups including our own have recently devised strategies to use these natural viruses as templates for the creation of synthetic zzso which either combine the assets of multiple input zzso or which enhance the properties of a single zzso The respective technologies to achieve these goals are either DNA family zzso zzso fragmentation of various zzso zzso genes followed by their zzso based on partial zzso (typically zzso for most zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of usually seven zzso acids into an exposed loop of the viral zzso where the zzso zzso mediates zzso to a desired cell zzso For maximum success, both methods are applied in a zzso fashion zzso the protocols are zzso to yield libraries of around one million distinct zzso zzso Each clone is then comprised of a unique combination of numerous parental viruses zzso zzso zzso or contains a distinctive zzso within the same viral backbone zzso display zzso The subsequent final step is zzso selection of such a library on target cells in order to enrich for individual zzso fulfilling most or zzso all requirements of the selection zzso The latter preferably combines positive pressure, such as growth on a certain cell type of interest, with negative selection, for instance elimination of all zzso reacting with zzso zzso This combination increases chances that synthetic zzso surviving the selection match the needs of the given application in a manner that would probably not have been found in any naturally occurring zzso zzso Here, we focus on the DNA family zzso method as the theoretically and zzso more challenging of the two zzso We describe and demonstrate all essential steps for the generation and selection of shuffled zzso libraries zzso 1), and then discuss the pitfalls and critical aspects of the protocols that one needs to be aware of in order to succeed with molecular zzso zzso
