We have investigated the consequences of introducing a zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso with prolonged simulation periods in zzso and in a zzso box revealed two main zzso zzso of the zzso arm and stacking of the zzso zzso and the neighboring zzso zzso of both zzso zzso synthesis produced the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso They were zzso to zzso to probe the zzso properties of zzso with zzso zzso To assess affinity zzso in zzso binding to zzso testing was performed with zzso zzso cultured cells, tissue sections and zzso The panel of zzso including an zzso zzso revealed up to a zzso difference in affinity zzso for these zzso relative to data on the zzso zzso reported previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso 8, zzso The enhanced affinity for zzso is in zzso with the increased percentage of cell zzso in zzso and zzso analysis of zzso binding of labeled zzso to cultured tumor cells and routinely processed lung cancer zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso into mice revealed the highest zzso in liver and zzso for the zzso compound compared with the zzso or zzso zzso Thus, this substitution zzso zzso properties in interactions with zzso a key finding of this zzso zzso zzso tailoring provides a versatile approach to the preparation of newly zzso zzso with favorable zzso properties for medical zzso
