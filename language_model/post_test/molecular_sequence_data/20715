We report here on the zzso zzso molecular zzso and expression of a new zzso initially isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be a zzso protein with a molecular mass of 55 zzso The cloned gene of zzso contained an zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 460 zzso zzso A zzso search revealed that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family, with identities to a hypothetical protein from zzso zzso a putative zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso kidney at 89, 88, 67, 29, and zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso into an expression zzso zzso and was expressed in zzso zzso zzso The amount of the zzso zzso expressed in the zzso zzso cells was approximately zzso higher than that of zzso found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso activity towards various zzso acids and zzso zzso with a preference for the zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso with an optimum pH and temperature for reaction of about zzso and 50 degrees zzso (at pH zzso
