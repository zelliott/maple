Assisted zzso technologies are increasingly applied to support breeding efforts for many endangered zzso To explain the highly variable responses among zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso we analyzed a zzso zzso spanning a zzso region of the zzso zzso in the domestic cat zzso and nine wild zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the newly zzso zzso together with the bear zzso belong to the zzso group closely related to the zzso zzso Within zzso genetic distances were zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso In zzso comparisons among zzso and all new zzso similarity ranged from zzso to zzso for zzso and from zzso to zzso for zzso Besides zzso zzso zzso variation was also detected on both the zzso and the protein zzso There were no indications for an expression of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso
