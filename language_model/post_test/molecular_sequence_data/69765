The structure and organization of the human vitamin zzso protein zzso gene has been zzso The gene is composed of 13 zzso and 12 intervening zzso With the help of the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were amplified using zzso zzso zzso and were zzso after zzso the zzso borders were zzso The zzso 2, 5, 7, 9 and 10 were zzso zzso the zzso 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11 and 12 were zzso in zzso We designed zzso zzso for the amplification of each zzso by the zzso This permits the analysis of zzso and zzso zzso By comparison with the genes for human zzso and zzso the gene for zzso is confirmed as a member of this zzso zzso The location of the zzso in the coding region of the human zzso is identical with the position of the zzso in the rat zzso
