As a typical zzso zzso mediates cellular adaptation in diverse bacteria by degrading zzso on its zzso Although the zzso core of zzso is thought to be identical to well-studied zzso this zzso specifically targets zzso zzso that are associated with zzso in zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso recognition and zzso by zzso and the requirement of zzso for its optimal activity, largely remain zzso Here, we report the structure of zzso bound to zzso zzso in zzso state, revealing that both the zzso and zzso zzso participate in zzso zzso The zzso is recognized by the zzso core of zzso of which the general zzso zzso are within zzso distance to their reaction zzso demonstrating an active zzso of zzso on zzso Also, the zzso orientation involves the universally zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, mass zzso data indicated that zzso zzso zzso following the second position at the zzso zzso resulting in a final product with a zzso at the newly formed 3' zzso Our results demonstrate a classical zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and provide insight into how the zzso is essential for its specific zzso
