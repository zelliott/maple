Both experimental work and surveys of the lengths of internal zzso in nature have suggested that zzso internal zzso require a minimum size of approximately 50 zzso for efficient inclusion in mature zzso This phenomenon has been ascribed to zzso interference between complexes involved in recognition of the zzso signals at the two ends of short internal zzso To determine whether zzso small nuclear zzso a zzso zzso factor that is involved in the first recognition of zzso sites, contributes to the lower size limit of zzso internal zzso we have taken advantage of our previous observation that zzso small nuclear zzso zzso which bind upstream or downstream of the zzso zzso site zzso stimulate zzso of the upstream zzso By varying the position of zzso binding relative to the zzso we show that zzso zzso of the upstream zzso becomes inefficient when zzso is positioned 48 zzso or less downstream of the zzso suggesting a minimal distance between zzso and the zzso of approximately 50 zzso This distance zzso well to the suggested minimum size of internal zzso The results of experiments in which the zzso region of the reporter was duplicated suggest an optimal distance of greater than 72 zzso We have also found that inclusion of a zzso zzso is promoted by the binding of zzso to the downstream zzso but not by binding to the zzso Our results are discussed in the context of models to explain zzso zzso of small zzso in zzso
