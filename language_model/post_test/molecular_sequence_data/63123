The zzso Snail protein is a zzso zzso that is necessary for zzso zzso Here, we identify the zzso protein as an essential Snail zzso In zzso zzso zzso Snail target genes are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and Snail interact both genetically and zzso We identify a Snail domain that is sufficient for zzso zzso and which functions independently of another Snail zzso zzso zzso This zzso interaction domain is zzso among all insect zzso zzso is a potent repression domain and is required for Snail function in transgenic zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso is part of the zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso We found that zzso interacts with zzso zzso and that zzso zzso or addition of a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso repression in zzso In the early zzso zzso is recruited to a Snail target gene in a zzso manner, which zzso with zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that Snail requires the combined activities of zzso and zzso and indicate that zzso zzso is a repression mechanism in early zzso zzso
