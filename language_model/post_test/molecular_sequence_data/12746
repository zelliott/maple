zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso cells is closely coordinated with entry into S zzso Previous studies with zzso zzso zzso have shown that sequences upstream of the coding region as well as an zzso in the transcribed region are both necessary for proper regulation of zzso zzso content in zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to identify the upstream regulatory zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso sequences linked to the zzso coding region zzso by zzso 1 and 2) were zzso zzso into mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region revealed that there is a close correspondence between the upstream sequences that are necessary for S phase regulation and the 30 zzso region that is essential for promoter zzso These observations raised the possibility that regulation of the zzso gene occurs at the zzso zzso However, nuclear zzso zzso showed that the rate of zzso of the zzso gene changed very little during the zzso phase zzso Furthermore, when the zzso promoter was linked to an zzso zzso indicator zzso there was no change in expression following zzso Therefore it appears that the zzso gene is controlled primarily at the zzso level, and that the zzso essential promoter region is necessary (although not zzso for proper S phase zzso
