We cloned a new zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso DNA zzso revealed 10 open reading zzso majority of which showed high similarity to the previously characterized type II zzso zzso zzso zzso An unusual feature of the zzso cluster is a disconnected organization of minimal zzso zzso zzso is located apart from the genes for zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene cluster was disrupted in zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso replacing the four genes zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso with zzso resistance marker zzso The disruption did not affect growth and zzso and disrupted strain produced spores with zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the culture extracts from zzso zzso wild type and zzso strains did not reveal any difference in the pattern of zzso zzso
