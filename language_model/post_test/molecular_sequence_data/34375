Two zzso moderately zzso bacteria, designated strains zzso and zzso were isolated from salted zzso Both strains were zzso strictly zzso zzso growing in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth at zzso zzso zzso between pH zzso and zzso zzso growth at pH zzso and at temperatures between 15 and zzso zzso growth at zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparison showed that both strains showed a similarity of zzso and were closely related to species of the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso with zzso album zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso and zzso for strains zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso between both strains was zzso whereas the values between strain zzso and the species zzso album zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, showing unequivocally that strains zzso and zzso constitute a new zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The main respiratory zzso zzso was zzso although small amounts of zzso were also zzso The polar lipids of the type strain consist of zzso zzso one unidentified zzso and one zzso The zzso type is zzso with zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso analysis, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso we propose strains zzso and zzso as a novel species of the zzso zzso with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
