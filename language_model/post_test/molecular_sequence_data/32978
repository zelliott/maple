The 3' ends of zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of a zzso tail, which plays a critical role in stability, zzso and translation of the zzso In the present study, we report the zzso zzso and zzso characterization of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso an important human zzso As a first step toward zzso the nature of the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were also performed to monitor the binding of zzso to the zzso Our zzso revealed that the initial interaction between zzso and the zzso is characterized by a high zzso of association and that the minimal zzso binding site of the zzso is eight zzso Moreover, both the zzso of real-time zzso binding and the contribution of zzso interactions to the overall binding energy were zzso Finally, we also correlated the effect of zzso binding on protein structure, using both circular zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies as structural zzso Our data indicate that the protein zzso structural modifications upon zzso zzso although the interaction does not significantly modify the stability of the zzso In addition to the determination of the zzso of zzso zzso our study provides a better understanding of the molecular basis of zzso binding by zzso zzso
