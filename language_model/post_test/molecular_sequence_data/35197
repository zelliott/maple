zzso per cent of marine organic matter burial occurs in zzso margin zzso where a substantial fraction of organic carbon escapes zzso and enters long-term zzso storage within zzso zzso In such zzso microbial metabolism is limited by the zzso supply of electron zzso One strategy to zzso energy yields in a zzso habitat is symbiotic zzso exchange among microbial zzso zzso and zzso considerations indicate that microbial zzso are likely to play a critical part in zzso organic carbon zzso Yet only one association, between zzso zzso and zzso bacteria, has been demonstrated in marine sediments in zzso and little is known of the role of microbial symbiotic interactions in other zzso zzso zzso Here we report in zzso molecular and zzso evidence for a novel symbiotic consortium between two zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sediments of the Soledad basin at the Mexican Pacific zzso A mass balance of zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding nitrogen isotope composition of nitrate and ammonium zzso indicate that zzso bacteria rely on zzso species for the supply of zzso zzso and account for about zzso per cent of the total zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso fixed nitrogen losses in zzso zzso bypassing zzso limitations by efficiently zzso the zzso nitrogen and zzso zzso
