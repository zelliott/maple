zzso with sequences based on the leader sequence of zzso zzso c zzso zzso IV zzso zzso activate the zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso such as zzso and zzso by rat liver zzso with zzso zzso 11-15 zzso zzso of these zzso is dependent on zzso and is prevented by zzso agents, and the zzso for zzso is zzso zzso zzso more slowly, the zzso zzso and zzso are also transported by this zzso Treatment of the peptides with zzso K eliminates the zzso zzso Since the zzso rate is not inhibited by zzso or by zzso we conclude that this zzso is not related to the zzso zzso channel or the zzso zzso transition zzso Transport is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not by a zzso acid zzso representing the nuclear location sequence of the zzso large T zzso which is responsible for directing that protein to the zzso zzso which has four positive charges, also has no zzso effect, and an zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso III with seven net charges is only zzso as effective as zzso zzso Thus, these data indicate that the zzso is important for zzso of zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso previously reported to be induced by these zzso actually reflects coupled zzso of zzso In view of our findings, it is also likely that the zzso effects attributed to these peptides are secondary to swelling and are not due to membrane damage per zzso Finally, we show that, in zzso media, the zzso is an inhibitor of zzso c zzso
