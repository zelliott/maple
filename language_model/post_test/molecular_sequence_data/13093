zzso junctions are important elements in the architecture of folded zzso zzso The global geometry of fully zzso zzso junctions between zzso zzso has been analyzed by comparative gel zzso zzso appear to fold by zzso zzso zzso stacking in one of two possible zzso equivalent zzso based upon alternative selections of stacking zzso In the presence of 1 zzso zzso the two continuous zzso axes are approximately at right angles to each other for all junctions zzso but the zzso junctions exhibit significant zzso differences in their structures as a function of zzso zzso The zzso junction found in the zzso zzso folded by zzso zzso zzso It retained the 90 degrees crossed stacked structure under all zzso conditions tested, despite the presence of a zzso mismatch at the point of strand zzso
