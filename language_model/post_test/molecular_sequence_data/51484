The low density zzso zzso protein zzso is a large zzso clearance zzso that has been implicated in the zzso zzso of zzso remnants and in the removal of zzso complexes from the circulation and from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in mice blocks development of zzso zzso around the zzso zzso The expression pattern of zzso in the zzso stage zzso is identical to that of zzso a zzso zzso that zzso invasive properties to zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso mediates zzso and degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 1 complexes and propose that the inability of the giant cells to remove the inactive zzso complexes from their surfaces interferes with zzso of the zzso
