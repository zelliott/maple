We have investigated an zzso regulatory zzso for the DNA binding activity of a zzso cellular zzso factor, nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso B), has been investigated by using zzso zzso B prepared from the nucleus and the zzso of the primary human T zzso We show that a cellular reducing catalyst zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso of the DNA binding of zzso zzso B in zzso and stimulation of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We demonstrate evidence suggesting that zzso regulation of zzso zzso B by zzso might be exerted at a step after zzso of the zzso zzso I zzso B, a zzso protein for zzso zzso zzso To examine the effect of zzso in intact cells, we performed transient zzso with a zzso zzso zzso under the control of human zzso virus zzso long terminal repeat and an zzso zzso expressing human zzso The promoter activity from zzso long terminal repeat was greatly zzso by zzso the zzso zzso whose effect was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings have suggested that zzso zzso of zzso zzso B might be involved in the zzso by zzso zzso B and that the zzso control mechanism zzso by zzso might have a regulatory role in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These results may also provide a clue to understanding of the molecular process of AIDS zzso and its possible zzso zzso
