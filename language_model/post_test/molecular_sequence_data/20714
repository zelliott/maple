zzso I was highly zzso from onion bulbs by zzso zzso and zzso column zzso With zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso activity of the zzso zzso is the highest reported to date in zzso The zzso zzso showed a single major band with a relative molecular mass of approximately 25,000 on zzso A zzso zzso zzso I was cloned and zzso zzso comparison suggested that it is to be classified as a zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of zzso I in healthy onion plants and responses to various stresses were examined by Western zzso zzso I exists at high concentration in roots, young bulbs, mature bulbs, and mature leaves, the highest concentration being in mature zzso zzso of zzso I and zzso II zzso activities were observed in response to various zzso and an increase in zzso I protein was also seen by zzso Our results suggest an important role of the zzso I gene in the plant zzso stress zzso
