The zzso zzso of zzso has 51 zzso repeats and produces the symptoms of zzso disease in transgenic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein into zzso has been attributed to its zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso forms polar zzso similar to those of zzso In solution at acid zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rendered soluble by the addition of two zzso at the zzso end and two zzso at the zzso end, gives a zzso CD zzso it zzso at neutral zzso A zzso zzso zzso gives an zzso CD spectrum at all zzso and does not zzso a zzso with the sequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso of human zzso preceded by two zzso and followed by two zzso exhibits a random zzso spectrum and does not zzso zzso zzso of several zzso with the sequence of the zzso Alzheimer's zzso zzso shows that they can be linked together by a network of salt zzso We also asked why single zzso acid replacements can so destabilize the native structures of proteins that they unfold and form zzso The difference in free energy of a protein zzso between its native, fully ordered structure and an zzso mixture of randomly coiled chains is only of the order of 10 zzso zzso shows that zzso of the native structure by no more than 2 zzso can increase the probability of nucleation of zzso zzso from which zzso could grow zzso
