zzso of zzso DNA isolated from nuclear envelopes of mouse zzso were previously cloned and partially characterized in our zzso One of the cloned fragments zzso had unusual zzso abundant zzso in the clone library (about zzso and zzso with DNA of zzso An analysis of zzso sequence of this zzso conducted in more detail allowed the detection of an evolutionary zzso region present in the zzso of various organisms (from bacteria to zzso Other characteristics of zzso zzso suggest a possible functional role of zzso DNA regions determining the attachment of zzso to the nuclear zzso
