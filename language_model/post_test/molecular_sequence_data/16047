zzso responsive elements zzso have been mapped at variable positions relative to the zzso start site and are often adjacent to binding sites of zzso regulatory zzso In order to define the role of these zzso control sequences in the induction process, we inserted the previously defined zzso zzso response element zzso or zzso zzso response element zzso immediately upstream of the zzso box of the zzso zzso promoter, deleting all zzso promoter zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the respective hormone to the truncated zzso These data suggest that the steroid zzso zzso possibly in conjunction with the zzso box binding zzso is able to form an active zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso when inserted zzso zzso upstream of the start site of zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso is not capable of zzso hormone zzso zzso can be attained at this position by either two zzso or a single zzso in combination with a zzso zzso A cluster of point zzso in the zzso box zzso hormone zzso strongly suggesting a synergistic action between the zzso zzso and the factor recognizing the zzso zzso The zzso box can be replaced by a zzso box, an zzso I and an zzso binding site, thus demonstrating that synergistic action is not restricted to the zzso box binding zzso These combinations of a zzso with different zzso factor binding sites show a pronounced zzso zzso induction of zzso
