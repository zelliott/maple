In the zzso the zzso zzso zzso is one of the main constituents of the zzso zzso We have recently reported the cloning of the zzso for the related zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1993; zzso zzso The protein has now been isolated from the same organ and its zzso zzso acid sequence has been zzso zzso exhibited an zzso point of approximately zzso High levels of zzso zzso were detected in the corpus and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso seminal zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso by zzso A quantitative analysis of the zzso zzso fluid by sandwich zzso revealed that zzso represented approximately zzso of the total zzso For zzso zzso the zzso coding sequence was introduced into the zzso zzso before zzso of baby zzso kidney zzso cells and selection with zzso and zzso zzso in insect cells was achieved by zzso of zzso cells with a transfer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated in quantities sufficient for structural zzso zzso zzso treatment showed that all 16 zzso were engaged in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the six zzso localized in the zzso zzso formed three bonds with each other, suggesting the existence of two discrete zzso in the zzso
