Most zzso proteins are exported via a type III export apparatus which, in part, consists of the membrane proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is housed within the zzso ring formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso integral membrane protein with eight predicted zzso zzso Its function is not zzso but it is necessary for zzso zzso We have created zzso in which potentially important sequences were zzso zzso lacking the zzso sequence prior to the first zzso span failed to complement and was dominant negative, suggesting that the sequence is required for zzso Similar effects were seen in a zzso lacking a highly zzso domain zzso within a putative zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis of the zzso domain zzso demonstrated that substantially all of zzso is required for efficient zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso interacts with several other export apparatus membrane zzso The implications of these findings are discussed, and a model of zzso within the export apparatus is zzso
