A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso is zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso seeds and is responsible for degradation of the seed proteins accumulated in protein bodies zzso storage zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family and has a large zzso zzso consisting of 104 zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso of 10 zzso acid zzso It has been suggested that an zzso zzso zzso zzso processing zzso 1 zzso is involved in the zzso zzso processing of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli cells, zzso to zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis of intact zzso zzso revealed that the zzso pH of zzso cells changes from zzso to zzso during seed zzso and early zzso zzso zzso was converted in zzso to the mature form through zzso processing at a pH mimicking the zzso pH at the mid and late stages of seed zzso but not at the pH of the early zzso zzso accelerated the rate of processing of zzso in zzso at the pH equivalent to the zzso pH at the early and mid stages of zzso In addition, the zzso sites of the in zzso processed zzso and the mature form of zzso were identical to those of zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso processing mainly functions in the zzso of zzso at the early stage of seed zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso function zzso in the zzso of zzso in zzso at the mid and late zzso
