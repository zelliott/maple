The position of deletion zzso in a series of four zzso male zzso patients has been refined using new markers derived from zzso clone DNA sequence covering the zzso male zzso zzso The zzso half of the zzso zzso is occupied by zzso sequences with zzso to zzso The zzso half contains an anonymous expressed sequence tag (named zzso found transcribed in brain, zzso and skeletal muscle and the zzso and zzso zzso All the patients have zzso and zzso deleted in their entirety and three patients additionally have zzso zzso The three patients with zzso zzso and zzso deleted show a severe zzso cell only syndrome type I zzso whereas the patient that has retained zzso shows a milder zzso zzso The expression of zzso in a cell line from this latter patient is zzso this shows that it is the loss of genes lying within the deletion that is responsible for the observed zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso zzso from normal and zzso mice zzso of germ zzso has shown that zzso is expressed primarily in zzso cells and that the level of expression is zzso during germ cell zzso This contrasts with zzso where no transcripts are zzso in zzso mouse zzso and expression occurs specifically in zzso zzso in a germ cell dependent zzso
