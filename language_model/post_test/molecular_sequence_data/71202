Two homogeneous proximity zzso for zzso zzso zzso proximity zzso zzso and homogeneous zzso zzso zzso have been developed and zzso In both formats, the zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the case of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso After the zzso reaction was stopped, zzso zzso beads or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were added as detection zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso signal was detected only when the energy donor zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and the energy zzso molecules zzso beads for zzso zzso for zzso were in close zzso both zzso required no wash or liquid transfer zzso This homogeneous zzso nature allows these zzso to be much zzso more zzso and easier to automate than traditional protein zzso zzso such as a filter binding zzso or zzso Both zzso have been zzso to a zzso format to reduce the zzso volume, thereby saving the valuable screening samples as well as zzso zzso and automated using automated zzso stations to increase the zzso zzso Several advantages and disadvantages for each zzso are zzso
