zzso zzso channels regulate cardiac and zzso zzso by stabilizing the resting membrane potential and by modulating shape and frequency of action zzso The delicate control of membrane zzso requires structural and functional diversity of zzso channel zzso expressed in a given zzso Here we reveal a previously zzso biological zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates alternative translation initiation zzso of human zzso zzso background channels via zzso of 5 zzso zzso zzso expression of full-length protein or truncated zzso initiated from two downstream start zzso determines zzso current zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso The interaction between zzso zzso zzso translation and function increases zzso channel complexity and is expected to contribute to zzso plasticity of excitable zzso
