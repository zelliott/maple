zzso synthesis zzso factor 2 zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso from the A site to the P site of the zzso Most organisms zzso a single zzso protein and its activity is regulated by zzso We have identified a family of genes in zzso zzso that zzso proteins zzso to zzso yet are expressed only during sexual zzso These genes have been designated zzso for zzso Factor 2 zzso zzso transcripts were not detected in zzso cell cultures but rapidly increased about 6 h after the start of zzso zzso For comparison, we zzso zzso and analyzed the expression of the standard zzso gene from zzso zzso Unlike zzso transcripts from zzso were detected in zzso cells but were present at lower zzso during zzso Despite the high sequence identity between zzso and zzso from other organisms (about zzso at the zzso acid zzso key regulatory sequences that are involved in the regulation of zzso are altered in zzso The sequence and expression data suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso involved in a major translation regulatory mechanism that occurs during the formation of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
