Numerous in zzso and in zzso studies have shown that zzso increases the expression of its zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell lines and in zzso zzso of the developing and mature nervous zzso To determine if zzso zzso is required for the normal zzso increase in zzso and zzso expression that occurs in sensory zzso shortly after they zzso their targets, we used quantitative zzso to compare the levels of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of normal mouse zzso and zzso that are zzso for a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We show that the marked increase in zzso and zzso zzso expression that occurs between E11 and zzso in normal zzso takes place on time and to the same extent in zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso have very similar dose responses for survival induced by zzso These findings clearly show that the expression of both zzso and zzso and the sensitivity of developing sensory zzso to zzso do not require and are not modulated by zzso zzso during the early stages of target field zzso
