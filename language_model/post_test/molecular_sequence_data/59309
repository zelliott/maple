When target cells are exposed to a hormone, their responsiveness wanes with time, in spite of the continuous presence of the zzso This phenomenon, referred to as zzso is due to regulatory steps that occur at the level of the hormone zzso as well as at zzso zzso While zzso events may be specific for the zzso pathways activated in a given target cell, zzso events are more general in nature and zzso within a given family of zzso There are at least two categories of regulatory events that occur at the level of the zzso and contribute to the process of zzso One of them, referred to as zzso zzso will be used here to zzso a change in the functional properties of a constant number of receptors resulting in a reduction in the ability of the zzso to activate its most zzso zzso zzso The other, referred to as zzso zzso will be used here to zzso a reduction in the density of cell surface zzso zzso is generally faster than zzso and is believed to be due to zzso modifications of the zzso zzso on the other hand, is zzso and could be due to an increase in the rate of zzso zzso zzso or degradation, and/or to a decrease in the rate of zzso zzso processing or zzso In this paper, recent studies from my laboratory designed to directly address the potential involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the process of zzso have been zzso
