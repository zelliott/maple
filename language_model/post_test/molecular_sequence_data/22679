Human zzso a zzso composed of zzso and zzso plays opposing roles in zzso zzso by zzso zzso II zzso Pol zzso Here, we describe an zzso zzso repetitive zzso motif zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso of zzso which, like the zzso domain zzso of zzso Pol II, is highly zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso repeats are functionally important zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is critical for the zzso zzso activity of zzso but not to its zzso repression zzso In zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso and for efficient progression of zzso Pol II along the zzso We consider this zzso to be a switch that converts zzso from a zzso to an zzso We propose the zzso hypothesis, in which zzso zzso is thought to function in a manner analogous to zzso zzso serving as an additional code for active zzso zzso
