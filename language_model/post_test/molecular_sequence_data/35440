The genetic diversity of seven northern China isolated zzso virus strains zzso has been zzso and zzso regions of the zzso gene of 7 zzso were zzso and zzso in order to obtain zzso and zzso information, and to suggest typing criteria for zzso zzso analysis of zzso regions of the zzso gene in the zzso of these zzso revealed a sequence zzso of zzso among all seven local zzso zzso from zzso zzso from China, with a similarity of zzso in deduced zzso acid zzso These local zzso shared zzso sequence zzso with six zzso reference strains in zzso (including two zzso reference strains from zzso zzso from zzso which represents a zzso similarity in deduced zzso acid zzso zzso analysis also showed that five zzso strains from zzso zzso from China had a zzso deletion at zzso acid positions zzso and two zzso strains infecting the Korean zzso had a zzso deletion at zzso acid positions zzso in comparison with other zzso zzso analysis revealed two major groups zzso zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso and AM zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be further divided into zzso Based on the results of zzso analysis, a similarity scan of zzso zzso sequences was carried out by using zzso software and results in similar zzso Our results suggest possible typing criteria for zzso based on the zzso tree and sequence zzso and also that the virus has host specificity and regional zzso
