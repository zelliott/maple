On the basis of synthetic zzso five genes in zzso zzso are known to be redundant with the zzso zzso which encodes a protein that contains two copies of an zzso recognition motif zzso and affects alternative zzso zzso The molecular identities of two of the redundant zzso zzso and zzso were previously zzso The remaining three genes have now been zzso and their zzso lethal zzso with zzso are described in more zzso Animals zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso die during late zzso The zzso predicted protein contains three zzso we propose that zzso and zzso can substitute for each other in promoting the maturation of the transcripts of a vital zzso Animals zzso for zzso in zzso and in either zzso or zzso have the same striking zzso they arrest development just prior to or just after zzso with a zzso that appears fully formed but is not properly attached to the body zzso zzso encodes a protein of unknown function with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and may also have zzso in zzso and zzso We propose that zzso and zzso contribute to a common zzso zzso that is redundant with a zzso zzso
