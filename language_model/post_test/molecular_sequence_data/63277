zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso agent of respiratory disease in zzso is tentatively assigned to the zzso zzso in the family zzso A nearly full-length zzso of the zzso zzso was cloned and the zzso sequence zzso zzso possesses a putative leader zzso a small 2A protein and a zzso zzso which are characteristic of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso acids were identical within the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins are as much as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso leader protein is rapidly released from the viral zzso and zzso zzso at a rate similar to zzso leader zzso suggesting a functional relationship between the leader protein in these zzso The results suggest that zzso is closely related to zzso and should therefore be considered as a new species within the zzso zzso
