zzso is a zzso that was originally identified in the mouse as a T cell growth factor, but whose spectrum of potential targets was recently shown to include mast cells as well as zzso zzso zzso Given these multiple activities, it was proposed that the protein be renamed zzso The analysis of zzso zzso clones reported here shows that the human and mouse zzso genes consist of 5 zzso spread over approximately 4 zzso of DNA and organized in a similar fashion in both zzso The two genes exhibit a high degree of identity in the coding sequence and in the zzso untranslated regions, which contain, among other consensus zzso a zzso sequence for the binding of zzso zzso of human zzso was studied in zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso and a calcium zzso induced strong expression of a zzso zzso zzso No message was detected in zzso cells or in cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso indicating that zzso expression is not zzso and suggesting that the gene is not easily activated in B zzso and in zzso By contrast, T cell zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso induced a substantial zzso expression that was further enhanced in the presence of zzso Cell zzso experiments indicated that, under these conditions, the protein is zzso induced in zzso T zzso The induction of zzso by zzso zzso suggests that zzso production is part of the normal T cell response to zzso zzso
