In contrast to chicken and zzso the ostrich zzso eggshell layer zzso contained two different zzso zzso proteins as major zzso These zzso named zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and their zzso acid sequence was zzso zzso clearly was the zzso of goose eggshell zzso Its zzso acid sequence had the same length as that of zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso sequence identity with the goose eggshell protein compared to zzso with chicken eggshell zzso Furthermore, as zzso and unlike zzso it contained an zzso zzso zzso that was, however, located close to the zzso of zzso and not in the zzso third of the sequence as in zzso zzso showed features of both zzso and chicken eggshell zzso zzso Its sequence was zzso identical to that of zzso and zzso identical to zzso It contained the same stretches of zzso charged zzso acids zzso in zzso and zzso which are absent in zzso On the other hand, its length of 142 zzso acids was identical to that of zzso and it contained only the usual set of six zzso zzso in most zzso zzso zzso The presence of three zzso zzso located at exactly the same region of the sequence as the two zzso of zzso further stressed the similarity between zzso and zzso
