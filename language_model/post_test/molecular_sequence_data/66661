The zzso zzso zzso protein excludes zzso zzso by binding nascent zzso zzso and zzso transcripts at zzso and zzso respectively, and inducing zzso termination just downstream of these zzso zzso is more efficient at zzso than at zzso One difference between zzso and zzso is the presence of zzso III processing sites zzso located immediately promoter zzso to zzso zzso We found that deletion of zzso dramatically reduced zzso zzso arrest in zzso but had little effect on termination in zzso However, consistent with the in zzso results, zzso of a transcript carrying zzso and zzso efficiently zzso zzso allowing zzso to grow on a strain that expressed zzso whereas a transcript carrying only zzso or zzso with zzso 97 to 141 deleted was zzso zzso an zzso III zzso that binds but does not cleave zzso also prevented zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso enhances the zzso of zzso at zzso stimulating zzso arrest in zzso We have shown that a specific element in zzso zzso box C zzso strongly enhances arrest on zzso zzso zzso interactions do not stimulate zzso termination in zzso presumably because formation of the zzso complex is normally not zzso in the zzso In contrast to zzso N is not zzso by zzso and is not efficiently zzso by a zzso zzso
