The zzso form of the zzso protein was recently shown to be bound to the outer membrane of zzso zzso and proposed to be involved in survival of the pathogen to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of three zzso The central and the zzso zzso display zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B activities respectively, zzso the ability to reduce specifically the S and the R zzso of the zzso function of the zzso zzso which are easily formed upon zzso of zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso which possesses a zzso zzso was recently shown to zzso the oxidized forms of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso as the zzso coli zzso zzso 1 zzso The X-ray structure of zzso of zzso determined here shows a zzso in agreement with the zzso properties of zzso However, substantial structural differences with zzso zzso zzso zzso displays more structural zzso with the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso maturation pathways in zzso The active site of the reduced form of zzso reveals a high level of stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso environment of the zzso recycling zzso in the zzso zzso consistent with the zzso values measured for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso maturation zzso zzso and to zzso one edge of the active site is covered by four additional zzso zzso The putative role of the resulting zzso is discussed in relation to the zzso zzso properties of zzso
