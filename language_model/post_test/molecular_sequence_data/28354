zzso zzso virus zzso zzso bears two overlapping zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso on the major surface zzso zzso Both are zzso zzso zzso that require prior formation of zzso bridges and addition of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso specific for each of these zzso as well as for zzso zzso we have investigated the requirements for zzso and folding of the zzso The zzso zzso themselves do not appear to comprise critical informational components of these zzso but are required for proper folding of the nascent zzso chain within the rough zzso zzso These zzso differ in their resistance to zzso zzso D is retained when zzso with zzso under zzso conditions, whereas zzso A is zzso zzso zzso to zzso A zzso with several strains of zzso However, zzso D is detected in only a subset of zzso derived from the Armstrong strain of zzso By zzso sequence analysis, we have mapped a single zzso acid change distinguishing those zzso containing zzso zzso Acquisition of binding activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso or zzso zzso at zzso acid 173 of the zzso zzso and zzso disruption of a consensus zzso zzso zzso
