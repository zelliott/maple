zzso associates with the zzso locus within the zzso zzso gene zzso However, V beta zzso T cells, zzso by this zzso have never been implicated in the zzso zzso destruction that characterizes primary zzso zzso Both V beta 13 and V beta 2 T cells have been implicated in zzso zzso We therefore analyzed the association of zzso with both zzso the only zzso zzso and the zzso locus (the zzso family member which lies closest to zzso Our results show that the prevalence of zzso zzso is significantly increased in zzso and that there is a high degree of linkage zzso between this locus and zzso not previously described across the zzso zzso gene zzso However, zzso does not associate with the zzso zzso These results suggest that it is the V beta zzso T cell which may be responsible for the zzso destruction that characterizes zzso and that the previous association of this condition with the zzso locus is primary due to the linkage zzso that exists between it and zzso
