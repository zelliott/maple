zzso contain an unusual DNA base J zzso which replaces a fraction of zzso in zzso and other DNA zzso To determine the function of base J, we have searched for zzso that catalyze J zzso We present evidence that a protein that binds to J in DNA, the zzso protein 1 zzso may also catalyze the first step in J zzso the conversion of zzso in DNA into zzso We show that zzso belongs to the family of zzso and zzso zzso and that replacement of zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso the ability of zzso to contribute to J synthesis without affecting its ability to bind to zzso We propose that zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for the local amplification of J inserted by zzso another putative zzso zzso
