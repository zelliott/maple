The zzso zzso protein zzso of human zzso virus, type 1, which is expressed during the late stage of the viral infection, has received special attention because of its ability to control zzso of the human zzso virus, type 1, long terminal repeat and to influence cell cycle zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso has the ability to regulate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the key regulators of the cell cycle, in human zzso zzso The results from zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso promoter activity of zzso through the zzso region located between zzso zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso zzso start zzso zzso of zzso by zzso required zzso of zzso which binds to the DNA sequence spanning zzso to zzso zzso from zzso zzso revealed an increased level of zzso DNA binding activity in the presence of zzso Furthermore, zzso was able to associate with zzso via the zinc finger domain located in the zzso region of zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso between zzso and zzso requires the zinc finger domain at the C zzso and the zzso domain at the N zzso of zzso zzso of zzso further enhanced the level of zzso zzso zzso of zzso through the sequence spanning zzso to zzso and increased the DNA binding activity of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso from zzso zzso pull-down zzso showed the association of zzso with zzso in extracts containing zzso Altogether, the outcome of our functional and binding studies suggested that the physical interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso could zzso zzso activity of zzso
