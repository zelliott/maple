The zzso zzso zzso gene has been zzso zzso and expressed as an active zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso identity with its counterpart in zzso zzso but low similarity with all other available zzso sequences including those of zzso It contains an zzso zzso signal zzso and has a calculated basic zzso point zzso zzso zzso a feature often associated with zzso zzso The zzso has a predicted mass of approximately 50 zzso similar to that of many zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The natural zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso and appeared to exist in several zzso states, an apparent zzso being the zzso zzso Its kinetic properties were compared with those of the zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso values for zzso and zzso were found for the zzso zzso zzso However, removal of the tag produced an zzso displaying similar values as the natural zzso zzso for zzso zzso 43 and 60 zzso for the natural and the zzso zzso zzso None of these zzso presented activity with zzso As reported previously for zzso from several zzso no zzso was exerted by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
