The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene coding for the zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The complete gene contains zzso base pairs and the zzso protein is composed of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso protein resembles the signal sequences of other zzso proteins zzso by zzso zzso and that of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso In addition, the zzso protein exhibits high zzso acid similarity with the strain zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso previously isolated and zzso in this zzso These results indicate that all three zzso genes evolved from a common ancestral zzso
