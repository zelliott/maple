An zzso zzso zzso previously shown to inhibit zzso viral expression in chronically infected zzso cells, was zzso labeled to study zzso zzso and zzso within living zzso Observations based on flow zzso and zzso zzso show the zzso within around zzso zzso an apparent zzso distribution of the zzso is achieved in which the zzso zzso concentration is less than that present in the external zzso following zzso zzso and zzso of the cells in zzso zzso an zzso zzso with a time constant similar to that for zzso is observed (although a significant fraction of the zzso remains within the zzso cellular zzso as a function of the external zzso concentration is zzso being more efficient at lower zzso (less than 2 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso within the cell nucleus and zzso zzso is zzso
