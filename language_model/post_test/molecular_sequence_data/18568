zzso is an important protein modification that involves zzso attachment of zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso the structure of these zzso and the effects of zzso are vital for developing indicators of disease development and zzso Although zzso methods based on mass zzso data have proven to be effective in monitoring changes in the zzso developing such methods for the zzso are challenging, largely due to the inherent complexity in simultaneously studying zzso structures with their corresponding zzso zzso This paper introduces a zzso framework for identifying intact zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso attached to their zzso sites, in complex zzso zzso zzso zzso are presented for tandem mass zzso of zzso resulting from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and electron transfer zzso zzso fragmentation zzso An empirical zzso rate zzso method, based on a zzso search approach, is derived for assigning zzso The power of our method is further enhanced when multiple data sets are pooled together to increase identification zzso Using this zzso 103 highly confident zzso zzso from 53 sites across 33 zzso were identified in complex human serum zzso samples using conventional zzso platforms with standard depletion of the zzso abundant zzso These results indicate that our method is ready to be used for characterizing zzso protein zzso in complex zzso
