The rat brain zzso zzso zzso gene has a structurally complex zzso Although it contains a consensus zzso zzso II zzso box, this is located at zzso relative to the main zzso start site, an unprecedented distance for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso is extremely abundant in brain, yet barely zzso in zzso Using a nuclear zzso analysis, we show that this difference is due, at least in part, to a difference in the rate at which zzso is transcribed in these zzso We also demonstrate a zzso hypersensitive site in the promoter region of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments using nuclear extract isolated from liver, brain, and zzso cells show a marked difference in the way these extracts recognize the zzso zzso Two different zzso complexes can assemble on the zzso promoter, one which initiated at the same downstream zzso used in normal adult rat brain and one which initiated 35 base pairs further zzso zzso from brain form exclusively the downstream initiating zzso However, liver extracts favor formation of the upstream initiating complex, but formation of this complex can be blocked if brain or zzso extract is added zzso We demonstrate that the upstream consensus zzso box can function as a zzso box to mediate upstream zzso but is not required for downstream zzso We have shown previously that brain and zzso cell nuclear extracts contain an abundant factor, zzso which binds to the upstream consensus zzso box and have proposed that this factor is distinct from the classical zzso box binding factor zzso We propose that binding of zzso to the upstream consensus zzso box may block formation of the upstream initiating zzso
