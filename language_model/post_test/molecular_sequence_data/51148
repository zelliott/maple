zzso zzso activity is markedly elevated in cell lines selected for resistance to zzso a zzso drug known specifically to inhibit zzso zzso From a zzso library constructed from a highly zzso zzso lung cell line, zzso in which the activity is elevated more than zzso we have isolated a full length zzso for the small zzso of the zzso The zzso is zzso zzso long with an open reading frame of zzso zzso and a long 3' zzso region of zzso zzso from the termination zzso The derived zzso sequence is closely similar to the small zzso of the zzso differing from it in 20 zzso acid zzso Most of these replacements occur in the zzso segment of the zzso The zzso zzso does not contain 4 zzso acid zzso found in the mouse small zzso near the zzso zzso zzso blots zzso with the zzso show two zzso zzso species which are elevated in zzso zzso
