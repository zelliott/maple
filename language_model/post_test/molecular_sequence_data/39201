We describe the identification and characterization of two new zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso from the male antennae of zzso zzso a species where no zzso have been identified to zzso Because zzso are thought to participate in the first step of odor detection in a specific manner, we focused our investigation on this zzso protein family using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso revealed mature proteins of 142 and 143 zzso zzso respectively, with six zzso zzso in zzso positions relative to other known zzso The alignment of the two mature zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso showed high sequence identity zzso with other full-length sequences from zzso zzso identity between zzso and zzso was only zzso suggesting that the two proteins belong to different classes of zzso already described from the zzso Furthermore, analyses of expression patterns of zzso and zzso were performed by in zzso zzso on antennae of both zzso and these studies revealed the expression of the two zzso at the bases of zzso zzso zzso or zzso from both zzso The possible binding properties of these two new zzso are discussed according to their zzso with other known zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
