The zzso are a highly zzso ubiquitous family of proteins that commonly function in binding zzso zzso Although a specific tear zzso is a major component of zzso fluid and tears in many zzso there has been no definitive identification of such a protein in rabbit zzso The goals of this project were to identify the major proteins in rabbit zzso zzso zzso fluid, so as to determine if they include a zzso and, if such a protein is present, to determine its zzso zzso fluid was collected from zzso sexually mature female zzso and culture medium from rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells was zzso zzso from these zzso were separated by zzso zzso and analyzed by sequencing the intact proteins and sequencing or mass analysis of fragments derived by zzso zzso zzso of approximately 85 and 67 zzso were identified as rabbit zzso and serum zzso respectively, while components of 17 and 7 zzso had zzso sequences identical to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso searches of the zzso database with the zzso sequence of a protein of 18 zzso did not identify any zzso However, when used to scan the zzso database, it was found to contain a zzso signature zzso It is closely related to two zzso previously isolated from rabbit saliva and zzso zzso Further studies with the zzso and internal sequences confirmed that the zzso protein is a zzso that is truncated at the zzso as compared with other tear zzso and is more similar to zzso binding proteins from zzso
