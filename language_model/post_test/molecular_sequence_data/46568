The zzso zzso toxin zzso V zzso uses a dedicated signal zzso export system for its zzso in zzso coli that involves the products of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso As a member of the membrane fusion protein zzso family, the zzso protein has been proposed to interact with an outer membrane protein zzso via its zzso zzso zzso The importance of this domain, which is highly zzso throughout the members of zzso family, was analyzed by use of zzso zzso of zzso or nonsense zzso with zzso All the nonsense zzso tested resulted in the loss of zzso zzso indicating the importance of the zzso of zzso including the last 100 zzso zzso The zzso zzso of several zzso zzso acids have no drastic zzso On the other hand, when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso protein was zzso the zzso of zzso was greatly reduced in certain zzso While some zzso resulted in structural instability, zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso proteins were relatively stable, but were not functional in zzso zzso The results indicate that these zzso zzso acids are important for the structure and functions of zzso in the zzso of zzso
