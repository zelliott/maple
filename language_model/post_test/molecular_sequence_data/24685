Two rearranged bands of the zzso gene were detected in a case with B cell chronic zzso leukemia zzso The expressed zzso gene was only zzso with no zzso zzso in zzso and zzso The expressions of C zzso C zzso and C gamma were detected by reverse zzso of zzso followed by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso analysis of the zzso regions of each zzso reaction product showed that the sequence of one rearranged zzso was identical to those of the expressed zzso zzso C zzso and C zzso and the sequence of another rearranged zzso was identical to that of C zzso However, none of the expressed zzso genes was detected in zzso These findings suggest that this is a case of zzso lacking zzso exclusion and undergoing a class switch of one zzso with the incomplete expression of the zzso zzso
