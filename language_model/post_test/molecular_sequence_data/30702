zzso B (or Christmas disease) is an zzso zzso bleeding disorder caused by zzso in the gene for zzso factor zzso There is a rare class of patients, exemplified by zzso B zzso who suffer from zzso B as children but improve after zzso In these patients, plasma factor IX zzso are less than zzso of normal during childhood, but after zzso they gradually rise to between 40 and zzso of zzso zzso clustered around the main zzso start point zzso as zzso zzso have been reported in seven of these patients (at zzso zzso 1, 3, zzso zzso zzso 5, 6) and zzso zzso 7, zzso To determine how these zzso interfere with factor IX zzso we have zzso for zzso factors binding to this area and have identified a nuclear zzso liver zzso binding site zzso to zzso and a binding site for the zzso binding protein zzso zzso to zzso We show that the zzso zzso at zzso prevents the binding of zzso to this zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is capable of zzso a zzso normal factor IX promoter but not the zzso zzso This is the first natural zzso to be reported which zzso a zzso binding site and is an illustration of the importance of this zzso factor in zzso
