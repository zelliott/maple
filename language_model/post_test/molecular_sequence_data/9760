zzso is a zzso protein zzso and zzso by zzso zzso which regulates zzso and body zzso To investigate the peripheral effects of zzso human zzso lean zzso mice were treated with subcutaneous injections of vehicle or 20 zzso zzso for 1 to 14 zzso Groups of animals were killed on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, or 8 and 15 to evaluate the time course of clinical chemistry, zzso and molecular changes in white zzso and brown zzso tissue zzso zzso There was a progressive daily reduction in the body weight of mice receiving zzso By Day 15, the body weight of zzso groups decreased by zzso to zzso relative to zzso zzso Clinical chemistry changes in treated mice included decreased cholesterol and zzso zzso At zzso the mice had rapidly progressive zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso BAT zzso with complete depletion of fat stores by Days 3 to 4 in most females and by Days 7 to 14 in male zzso zzso white and brown zzso underwent marked zzso with loss of zzso droplets and zzso of BAT cells in zzso zzso zzso white and brown zzso contained numerous, enlarged zzso zzso analysis of key zzso tissue genes in brown and white fat zzso revealed a zzso selective increase in the zzso expression of zzso proteins and zzso zzso including zzso proteins 1 and 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with decreases in the zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso c zzso These data suggest that the peripheral effects of zzso include increased zzso and zzso zzso in brown fat coupled with increased zzso and decreased fat synthesis in white and brown fat, which lead to a rapid reduction in the body weight and zzso of zzso
