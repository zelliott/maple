zzso zzso is emerging as an important human zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso From a clone bank of zzso zzso zzso DNA produced in zzso coli zzso zzso clones expressed zzso zzso and of these, two expressed functional zzso By virtue of different restriction maps and a lack of zzso by Southern zzso the two cloned fragments zzso the two zzso have been shown to be zzso zzso analysis revealed that clone 1, carrying zzso zzso produces three zzso zzso one of zzso zzso and two of approximately 14 zzso zzso zzso of each of the proteins appears to be under the control of an zzso zzso zzso 2, carrying zzso zzso produces two zzso one of 93 zzso and the second of 17 zzso zzso of both of these proteins in zzso coli requires the zzso promoter in the zzso By preparing a series of zzso and testing each by zzso analysis and for zzso activity, a functional map of the insert of clone 1 was deduced and the zzso zzso zzso identified as the zzso Using similar methods, the 17 zzso protein was found to be the zzso of clone zzso The zzso sequences of both zzso genes were determined and are zzso Computer analysis revealed no zzso between the two zzso and no zzso to any previously zzso zzso These are the first genes of this zzso to be cloned and zzso
