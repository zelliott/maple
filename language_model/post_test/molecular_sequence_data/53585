In zzso zzso the family of zzso zzso regulators consists of a zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso The zzso factor zzso does not activate zzso through zzso sites in zzso even though it binds these sites in zzso Unlike zzso zzso in other species, zzso and zzso zzso is not affected by protein zzso A or by stress, and zzso and zzso are not required for zzso salt induction of zzso through an optimal zzso zzso zzso is important for a variety of biological functions including growth on zzso carbon sources, and zzso zzso is modestly regulated by carbon zzso zzso lacking zzso are zzso normal, but zzso of zzso suppresses some defects associated with the loss of zzso indicating a functional overlap between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both by recruiting the zzso zzso and by directly competing with zzso and zzso for target zzso zzso does not fully account for zzso regulation through zzso sites, and a novel zzso zzso that is not a zzso protein is required for zzso site zzso in response to high zzso In addition, zzso does not affect a number of zzso that arise from loss of zzso Thus, members of the zzso zzso zzso family have zzso but zzso biological functions and target zzso
