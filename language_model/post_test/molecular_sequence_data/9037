The zzso are zzso pathogens that cause zzso a zzso of worldwide zzso The zzso zzso includes smooth and rough species that differ in that they carry smooth and rough zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are typical smooth zzso However, these smooth zzso zzso into rough zzso devoid of the zzso zzso a major zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in regions zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrate here the occurrence of spontaneous zzso events in those three zzso species leading to the deletion of a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso gene and to the appearance of rough zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso suggested zzso zzso between the zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso as the mechanism generating the zzso zzso of zzso was reduced but not zzso in a zzso zzso showing the existence of both zzso and zzso zzso Although the involvement of the zzso copies zzso zzso suggested a zzso event, the predicted zzso joint could not be zzso This absence of zzso zzso was consistent with the presence of zzso in the zzso repeats of one of the zzso zzso The spontaneous zzso of zzso represents a novel zzso mechanism of smooth zzso that adds to the previously described zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso and the different zzso levels of the excised zzso and of other zzso genes suggest that the zzso zzso locus is the result of at least two horizontal acquisition zzso
