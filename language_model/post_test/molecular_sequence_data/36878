zzso sequences are a complex repetitive family of DNA sequences in zzso that are associated with zzso regions, zzso zzso and the Y zzso A component of the zzso family containing open reading frames zzso is zzso These zzso elements within the zzso family are designated zzso since zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso signal exclusively at the zzso zzso One zzso that has been zzso includes zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso are overlapping but one zzso out of frame with respect to each zzso The longer zzso contains zzso motifs strongly resembling zzso acid binding zzso of zzso zzso and the overall organization of the zzso zzso is reminiscent of LINE zzso The zzso are transcribed and appear to be zzso in zzso species related to zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso may play a role in the structure and/or function of zzso
