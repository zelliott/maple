We zzso the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso provided good resolution between these species, including discrimination of the novel species zzso zzso By contrast, the more zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not sufficiently zzso zzso zzso sequences were used to develop a real-time zzso zzso with a locked zzso zzso zzso probe for the specific detection and identification of zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed excellent specificity and a detection limit of zzso zzso copies for the detection and identification of zzso zzso zzso which makes it a promising tool for molecular identification and zzso zzso In conclusion, this article describes for the first time a zzso zzso for the specific identification of zzso zzso
