Stocks of zzso zzso X zzso carrying terminal deletions zzso zzso have been maintained for several zzso Some of the zzso are slowly losing DNA from the broken ends (as expected if replication is zzso and show no zzso DNA added to the receding zzso Two stocks carry zzso that have become zzso and are no longer losing zzso In both stocks the broken zzso end has acquired a segment of zzso DNA, a family of complex repeats found only at zzso and in zzso zzso Although the zzso family is complex, the zzso sequence joined to the broken zzso end is the same in both zzso In contrast, the two zzso are broken in different places and have no zzso sequence similarity at the junction with the new zzso zzso analysis suggests that the new zzso sequences have been added by a specific mechanism that does not involve zzso zzso
