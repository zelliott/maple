A zzso zzso zzso that specifies the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso sequence revealed two open reading frames zzso a small zzso with 295 zzso and a large zzso containing zzso zzso For both zzso there was no stop zzso on the zzso zzso A partially overlapping zzso zzso was used to locate the translation stop of the large zzso The entire zzso contained zzso coding zzso followed by an apparently zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence would result in a protein of 200 zzso Both zzso have their putative zzso and translation signals in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is preceded by a promoter region containing a zzso complementary direct zzso Both the truncated zzso and the zzso proteins have a signal zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The protein specified by zzso contained regions of extensive zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Specifically, zzso acid sequences involved in the formation of the active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso are well zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences are separated by zzso regions which contain several zzso most notably a sequence of approximately 200 zzso acids between the His and zzso zzso of the active zzso
