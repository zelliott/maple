In this report we present an extended linkage map of the American mink zzso zzso consisting of 157 zzso markers and zzso at least one linkage group for each of the zzso Each linkage group has been assigned to a zzso and oriented by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and/or by means of zzso comparative zzso The average zzso between markers is zzso zzso and the linkage groups collectively span zzso zzso In addition, 217 and 275 mink zzso have been placed on human and dog zzso zzso In conjunction with the existing comparative zzso data, these assignments represent useful virtual maps for the American mink zzso zzso of the current zzso assembled sequential map with the existing zzso zzso maps helped to refine the zzso comparative zzso Furthermore, comparison of the human and dog zzso zzso revealed a number of large zzso blocks, some of which are zzso by data from the mink linkage zzso
