zzso shock zzso zzso a series of inflammatory processes that includes the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that HS zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso that zzso zzso zzso functions, in the lungs of zzso zzso rats were subjected to compensated or zzso HS followed by resuscitation and death at 4 or 8 zzso Animals subjected to HS demonstrated acute lung injury with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso reverse zzso chain reaction, we detected a zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso levels in the lung of animals subjected to HS compared with sham zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased with increased duration of the zzso phase of zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso cells were the major cellular site of zzso zzso Thus production of zzso zzso by zzso cells is dramatically increased in a rat model of HS that also demonstrated lung zzso Increased local zzso levels may contribute to zzso recruitment and zzso and zzso lung injury in zzso
