In humans, deficiencies in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso zzso a rare disease that is often fatal in zzso Such deficiencies can result from zzso errors in the zzso structural gene or from zzso that impair the zzso of dietary zzso into zzso B12 zzso the required zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the terminal step in the conversion of zzso into zzso zzso evidence indicates that inherited defects in this zzso lead to zzso zzso but the corresponding zzso gene has not been zzso Here we report the identification of the bovine and human zzso zzso as well as the corresponding human zzso A bovine liver zzso expression library was screened for clones that zzso an zzso bacterial strain for color formation on zzso indicator zzso and four positive clones were zzso The DNA sequences of two clones were determined and found to be zzso zzso similarity searching was then used to identify a zzso human zzso zzso zzso and its corresponding gene that is located on zzso zzso The bovine and human zzso were independently cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that expression strains produced 87 and 98 zzso zzso activity, zzso These specific activities are in line with values reported previously for bacterial zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the human zzso clone zzso an zzso bacterial zzso for zzso growth on zzso This demonstrated that the human zzso is active under zzso conditions albeit in a zzso zzso In addition, Western blots were used to show that zzso expression is altered in cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso patients compared with cell lines from normal zzso We propose that zzso errors in the human zzso gene identified here result in zzso zzso The identification of genes involved in this disorder will allow improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of this serious zzso
