Using zzso covering about 117 zzso upstream of the human zzso chain C zzso zzso we have identified a potentially functional zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso This zzso gene is only about 95 zzso from the C zzso gene and is probably the first functional zzso segment of the zzso zzso These results illustrate the proximity of the human zzso zzso and zzso segments involved in creation of the complete heavy chain zzso
