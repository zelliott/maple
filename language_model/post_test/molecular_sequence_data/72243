zzso duplicated zzso genes have been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons with zzso genes from other species suggest they zzso zzso zzso being most closely related to the zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso The duplicated zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso share zzso zzso sequence identity over their entire putative coding zzso Analysis of the distribution of zzso differences shows the first zzso zzso are identical between the two coding regions, with the 18 zzso changes occurring in the remaining zzso zzso This observation suggests a gene conversion event has taken place between the duplicated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso frames indicates the products of these genes are zzso apart from a single zzso acid difference at zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and northern zzso analysis have shown both zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are expressed during zzso development and in the brain of newly enclosed zzso A region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene start zzso has been identified which contains regulatory sequences commonly found in the promoter region of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso
