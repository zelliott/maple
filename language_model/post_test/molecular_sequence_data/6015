Chicken zzso upstream zzso factors zzso are expressed in the developing nervous system and interact with nuclear hormone receptors to regulate expression of different zzso The role of zzso orphan receptors in zzso is virtually zzso To study the possible function of zzso I during zzso zzso we generated zzso I zzso zzso zzso cell lines and analyzed zzso acid zzso zzso differentiation of these zzso zzso I zzso results in the blockade of zzso differentiation after induction to zzso zzso I zzso expression of zzso protein 2 zzso gene and delays induction of zzso protein 43 zzso gene zzso In contrast, expression of the zzso light zzso zzso gene is not affected by zzso I zzso during zzso zzso Also, cells zzso zzso I do not stop zzso after zzso and zzso treatment and possess suppressed zzso zzso from different zzso response zzso These results suggest that zzso I plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso zzso
