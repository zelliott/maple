A zzso gene cluster was identified in zzso zzso zzso showing a high degree of zzso to the zzso gene cluster and occupying the same genetic locus as the spa genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene cluster exhibits diversity with respect to zzso of two zzso genes which are separated by a sequence similar to a portion of a zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso culture extracts confirmed the presence of two zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso resulted in loss of production of both zzso demonstrating that they are processed in an zzso zzso Although precursors of zzso S and A show only zzso of identity, the matured zzso peptides reveal highly similar physical zzso separation was only achieved after zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso Based on zzso and zzso degradation in combination with zzso zzso for zzso S a zzso zzso pattern is zzso For zzso A two zzso rings are different from the zzso pattern of zzso Due to only four zzso acid exchanges, zzso S and zzso revealed similar zzso activities as well as similar properties in response to heat and zzso zzso For zzso A only minor zzso activity was zzso
