zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso small zzso body zzso particles zzso responsible for site specific zzso of zzso in zzso and small nuclear zzso Recent evidence from studies on zzso zzso suggests its second functional role in zzso zzso zzso independent of guide zzso In order to act both as a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso must differentiate features in zzso zzso from those in zzso or zzso Most zzso zzso contain a hallmark zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso Here we challenged an zzso zzso (in the form of a zzso complex with its accessory proteins zzso and zzso with zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso in the zzso Although these zzso were previously shown to be zzso for the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex was only able to modify those without zzso zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso bound with an zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso binding mode, thereby suggesting that the zzso zzso function of zzso likely supersedes its zzso zzso
