The technique of zzso polarization zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been used to study DNA zzso and zzso which are being recognized as primary zzso in zzso control and other cellular zzso zzso modulated zzso when applied to two DNA zzso a zzso 50 zzso duplex fragment, and a bent zzso of similar zzso has yielded different zzso diffusion zzso for the two zzso The data have been processed with an zzso model and with zzso dynamics simulations, obtaining a good fit and a quantitative agreement between the two zzso Both analyses have confirmed that one zzso can be described as a straight cylinder, while the other zzso is bent, with an angle estimated to be 45 degrees zzso 3 zzso zzso has proved to be very powerful in determining simple zzso of short DNA duplexes and also particularly apt to probe the zzso features of DNA fragments where conventional methods are either too cumbersome or fail to give quantitative zzso In addition, the zzso no longer behaves zzso due to its complex structure and charge zzso Thus for the protein the slope is no longer related simply to the net zzso charge, and the zzso model gives a much larger slope than the zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
