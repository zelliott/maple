To clone the mouse zzso specific gene zzso via a zzso zzso 

The expressed sequence tags zzso in the normal mouse zzso were obtained from the online zzso database zzso Their highly zzso zzso sequences were retrieved through the zzso database to construct zzso and spliced with the biomedical software zzso The corresponding zzso and zzso within the zzso sequences were predicted with the software zzso zzso were designed according to the open reading zzso zzso was applied in cloning the zzso of the novel gene from the mouse zzso tissue and analyzing its expression patterns in the zzso zzso and various organ zzso as well as in different zzso stages of the mouse zzso The sequencing results of zzso underwent zzso zzso 

The novel mouse zzso gene zzso was successfully zzso with full-length sequence of zzso zzso The open reading frame was 267 zzso coding a protein of 88 zzso acid zzso and demonstrated to be correct by zzso The expression of zzso was high in the mouse zzso regular in the zzso zzso samples of different zzso days, and zzso in the zzso zzso No obvious zzso with other mouse zzso was found for zzso The zzso zzso number zzso was zzso zzso prediction showed that mouse zzso was probably a soluble zzso protein located at zzso zzso or a zzso with 2 zzso sites of protein zzso C zzso and 1 of zzso zzso II zzso 

A novel mouse zzso specific gene zzso was successfully zzso which could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso This has prepared the ground for further researches on the biological function and expression regulation of zzso
