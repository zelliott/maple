zzso zzso can possess a multitude of functions within a zzso transport zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso or zzso parts of the zzso or fulfilling a structural requirement, such as guiding the depth of membrane zzso In this study, the nine zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein were individually zzso to zzso and zzso and the functional consequences of these changes were zzso zzso zzso for each zzso zzso were functionally zzso However, zzso modifications revealed an important functional role for three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each of which is well zzso among zzso transport proteins in the major zzso zzso The most functionally compromising zzso an zzso substitution for zzso likely to be located at the zzso interface of zzso segment 2, abolished all zzso zzso resistance and transport zzso zzso zzso analyses identified several zzso that rescued the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso all of these zzso zzso were shown to be located in zzso zzso between zzso zzso 2 and 3 or 12 and 13, demonstrating novel functional associations between zzso acid positions on opposite sides of the membrane and in zzso zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso
