zzso is a zzso region of the zzso virus zzso zzso that supports the replication and stable maintenance of plasmids in human zzso zzso contains two essential zzso called the zzso and the zzso both of which contain multiple binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso appears to function as the zzso of zzso while the zzso acts in conjunction with zzso to prevent the loss of plasmids from zzso zzso Because of zzso role in stabilizing plasmids through the zzso it has not been entirely clear to what extent zzso might be required for replication from zzso per se, and a recent study has questioned whether zzso has any direct role in zzso In the present study we found that plasmids carrying zzso required zzso to replicate efficiently even when zzso only 2 days after plasmids were introduced into the cell lines zzso and zzso zzso using zzso cells it was demonstrated that the zzso function of zzso and the zzso did not contribute significantly to the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso supported efficient zzso replication in the absence of the zzso The zzso contains two pairs of closely spaced zzso binding sites, and a previous study had shown that both sites within either pair are required for zzso However, it was unclear from previous work what additional sequences within the zzso might be zzso We found that each zzso of the zzso including a pair of closely spaced zzso binding sites, had significant zzso activity when the other half had been zzso The only significant DNA sequences that the two halves of the zzso share in common, other than zzso binding sites, is a zzso sequence that is present twice in the zzso zzso and once in the zzso zzso These zzso repeats, while not essential for activity, contributed significantly to the activity of each half of the zzso Two zzso occur at unique positions within zzso binding sites 1 and 4 at the zzso and become sensitive to zzso by zzso when zzso zzso but zzso of each to the consensus base, zzso actually improved the activity of each half of the zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso of zzso is an zzso zzso and its minimal active core appears to be simply two properly spaced zzso binding zzso
