Recent evidence indicates that zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are derived by zzso from common zzso Although proteins and zzso with various domain structures have been identified, proteins containing zzso zzso or the complete mature precursors have not yet been zzso This prompted a closer examination of the putative start zzso signal zzso and the segment upstream of these zzso A critical evaluation of sequence information of these precursors indicates that the putative signal zzso identified in these precursors may be an internal zzso segment within the zzso There is also evidence to indicate that zzso zzso proteins are also derived from these zzso Thus the available sequence data of the precursors appear to be zzso
