zzso isolated from partially decayed wood log samples showing characteristic diversity for spore zzso colony zzso and arrangement of spores were assessed for zzso zzso zzso zzso showing a zzso index of zzso were zzso for filter paper zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization confirmed the identity of the selected zzso isolate as a strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso and zzso activity by about 20 and zzso zzso zzso studies conducted at parameters zzso pH zzso moisture content zzso and zzso zzso through response surface methodology in a solid-state zzso tray zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and protein content of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In comparison, zzso zzso zzso which is a model zzso for growth and development studies, produced significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and protein content of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively under the same process conditions as were used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to nearly zzso and zzso increase in zzso and zzso activity, respectively showing promise for zzso production by zzso zzso zzso at a higher scale of zzso zzso analysis revealed two zzso each for zzso and zzso and three zzso for zzso Crude zzso complex produced by zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso under zzso conditions showing potential for use in zzso zzso
