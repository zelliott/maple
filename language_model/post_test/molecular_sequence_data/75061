The zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 protein zzso binds to zzso DNA, but not to zzso DNA, as determined by a gel zzso zzso The nature of the interaction was further studied by zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to fragments containing the right or left terminal sequences of zzso 29 DNA, producing a characteristic pattern of hypersensitive bands spaced about 24 zzso apart along most of the fragment, zzso protected zzso zzso of protein zzso to an internal zzso 29 DNA zzso was also observed, but the footprint pattern was more salt sensitive than that obtained with the terminal zzso 29 DNA zzso By electron zzso protein zzso was shown to cover the DNA, totally or zzso from one zzso In addition, binding of protein zzso to relaxed circular DNA induced positive zzso indicating that a zzso change in the DNA zzso
