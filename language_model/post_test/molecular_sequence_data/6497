The zzso zzso domain has been identified by sequence zzso in approximately zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have determined the solution structure of a zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso We have zzso this approach by applying a series of zzso zzso experiments, including several novel zzso zzso The zzso domain forms a core of two zzso strand segments around the zzso zzso zzso with a network of zzso zzso S gamma hydrogen bonds stabilizing the zzso zzso with other zzso domain structures provides insight into the common structural elements used in metal coordination and DNA zzso
