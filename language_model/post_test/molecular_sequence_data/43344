zzso coli zzso zzso lacks all of the genetic information necessary for zzso tail, and zzso zzso zzso is therefore dependent on a helper zzso such as zzso for zzso zzso During zzso zzso of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso by the action of the zzso zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso gene and identified the zzso E zzso The zzso gene product is the only zzso protein required to zzso zzso zzso which leads to in zzso zzso DNA zzso A zzso zzso zzso system has been developed to examine the zzso activity of zzso The reporter zzso contains the two face-to-face zzso zzso and zzso involved in the zzso zzso switch of zzso zzso and the immunity zzso zzso The zzso promoter is coupled to a cat reporter zzso In the zzso the C zzso is transcribed from the zzso promoter and zzso the zzso promoter, which mimics the in zzso zzso zzso The E protein is supplied in trans from a compatible zzso in which the zzso gene is under the control of the zzso zzso We show here that in the zzso zzso system, induction of the E protein zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is located upstream of the zzso zzso enhances the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso E protein shows no specific DNA binding activity, and the implications of this are zzso
