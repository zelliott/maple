The complete zzso sequence of the zzso gene of influenza virus zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso comparison between zzso zzso protein and the known zzso sequences of the influenza strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicates extensive zzso acid zzso for the influenza A virus zzso zzso Small clusters of basic zzso acids are zzso in all zzso proteins including the influenza B zzso protein which has only zzso sequence zzso overall to the zzso zzso of type A influenza zzso The evolutionary rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per site per year and zzso zzso acid changes per year between the zzso and zzso zzso appears to be higher than that calculated earlier for zzso zzso and zzso An unusually high degree of sequence change between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was revealed and this is discussed in terms of its probable zzso
