A plant zzso was isolated from barley zzso zzso zzso using zzso extraction and different zzso zzso zzso of more than 50% of the protein sequence by zzso degradation confirmed a full-length zzso zzso The subsequently identified open reading frame encodes for a 15 zzso protein which could be found in the soluble fraction of barley zzso This protein exhibited specificity towards zzso sugar and is therefore, accordingly named as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Database searches performed with the zzso protein sequence revealed a sequence and structure zzso to the zzso family of zzso zzso Together with its affinity towards zzso zzso is now identified as a new member of the zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso shares a high zzso acid zzso to the highly zzso protein zzso and, in addition to two zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso where the zzso zzso proteins are examples of zzso zzso containing a zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis with a zzso zzso zzso in combination with Northern zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed tissue specific expression of zzso in the zzso The function of zzso is discussed in the context of its particular expression in zzso and is then compared to other zzso which apparently share a related response to zzso or zzso stress zzso
