Gross zzso zzso zzso are frequently observed in cancer zzso zzso in different DNA metabolism including DNA zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso and repair cause zzso in zzso zzso Recently, we used zzso screening to identify several genes the deletion of which increases zzso in zzso zzso zzso which was discovered during this zzso functions in DNA replication by participating in an alternative replication factor zzso Here we further characterize the zzso suppression mechanisms observed in the zzso zzso strain in conjunction with the zzso maintenance role of zzso The zzso zzso enhanced spontaneous DNA damage and resulted in zzso zzso However, DNA damage due to zzso of zzso activates the zzso zzso which suppress further zzso zzso The zzso checkpoints activated by the zzso zzso also suppress zzso formation in strains defective in the DNA replication zzso Lastly, the zzso zzso increases zzso size independently of other previously known zzso maintenance proteins such as the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso size regulator zzso The increase in zzso length caused by the zzso zzso was suppressed by a zzso in the DNA replication checkpoint, which suggests that DNA replication surveillance by zzso also has an important role in zzso length zzso
