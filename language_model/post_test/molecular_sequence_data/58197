An zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso gene required in transient expression zzso for late and very late viral gene expression was identified, zzso and zzso zzso This zzso designated late expression factor 1 zzso was located between zzso and zzso map units of the zzso physical zzso It was identified by zzso zzso zzso cultured cells with a collection of overlapping cloned DNA fragments covering the entire zzso zzso and a reporter gene controlled by an early, late, or very late zzso zzso zzso of the DNA zzso containing zzso curtailed most late and very late gene expression but not early gene zzso zzso was found to be an early gene transcribed as a zzso zzso in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso The C zzso of the predicted zzso product, zzso contained a sequence motif characteristic of zzso zzso zzso
