We characterized the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and evaluated its expression profile under different environmental zzso It is highly zzso at both DNA and protein levels, displaying many of the hallmarks of zzso and sharing zzso of overall zzso acid identities with zzso sequences from other zzso The changes are mainly concentrated in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso analysis was consistent with the known zzso of zzso The zzso gene was located by in zzso zzso in region zzso at the third zzso zzso a locus activated upon heat shock as shown by zzso pol II zzso As zzso zzso is widely used in aquatic zzso testing, we studied zzso gene induction in fourth zzso aquatic larvae submitted to heat shock and selected environmental pollutants classified as potential zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso levels increased significantly zzso after short-term acute zzso to a temperature shift zzso cadmium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso treatments were able to activate the zzso zzso The zzso form, zzso was also zzso and, unlike zzso was not altered by any of the different treatments zzso Moreover, at the times tested, there was no significant mortality of the zzso The rapid zzso of the zzso gene suggests that it is sensitive and selective for different environmental pollutants, and could be used as an early molecular zzso in zzso zzso
