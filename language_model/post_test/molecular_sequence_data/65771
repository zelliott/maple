Alternative zzso of zzso greatly contributes to the zzso diversity of gene expression in zzso However, the molecular basis of zzso regulation and the precise sequence of alternative zzso processing in zzso are poorly zzso In the present study, we focus on the zzso switching of the mutually exclusive alternative zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso from the zzso 9 form in zzso to the zzso 10 form in zzso By visualizing the usage of the zzso mutually exclusive zzso through differential expression of green fluorescent protein zzso and red fluorescent protein zzso we isolated several zzso zzso and identified the alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso family of zzso zzso zzso of the amounts of partially spliced zzso zzso in synchronized zzso and zzso zzso worms suggested that either of the zzso downstream from the zzso mutually exclusive zzso is removed prior to the removal of the upstream ones, and that zzso promotes biased zzso of zzso 10 in the late zzso zzso We propose that the zzso switching between alternative sequences of zzso removal determines the ratio between the mature zzso zzso zzso
