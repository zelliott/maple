zzso zzso zzso is one of the key zzso in the zzso acid cycle, which involves in providing energy and zzso precursors for zzso Here, we report for the first time the zzso characterization of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso database zzso number zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso was about 80 zzso typical of a zzso zzso and showed high zzso acid sequence identity with known zzso zzso The optimal activity of the zzso zzso was found at pH values zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the optimal temperature was around 46 degrees zzso zzso studies showed that about 50% zzso activity was preserved at 38 degrees C after 20 zzso of zzso The zzso zzso displayed a zzso zzso preference for zzso over zzso with zzso and a zzso greater specificity for zzso than zzso with zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso with remarkably high zzso preference for zzso
