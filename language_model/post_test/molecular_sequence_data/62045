Type I zzso zzso represent a crucial component of the innate immune response to zzso An important downstream zzso of zzso is the zzso zzso which is activated solely through this zzso zzso proteins are characterized by a zzso zzso domain, zzso family signature, and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are transcribed upon zzso of an zzso response element zzso located in the zzso promoter zzso In this article, we describe the cloning and analysis of an zzso gene and its corresponding promoter from the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso domain, zzso family signature, and zzso zzso motif common to zzso zzso and shows a 50% identity to human zzso and zzso identity both to rainbow trout and to Atlantic zzso zzso liver cells produced high levels of zzso zzso in response to induction by the known zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso promoter contains two zzso zzso to those found in the promoter regions of many zzso zzso and was able to drive zzso of a zzso reporter gene when induced by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso
