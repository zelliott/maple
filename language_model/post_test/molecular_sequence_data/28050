The complete zzso loop structure of human alpha zzso zzso has been zzso alpha zzso zzso isolated from human plasma was found to be a zzso protein composed of a heavy and a light zzso The heavy chain comprises the zzso of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and part of the connecting zzso which has been predicted from the corresponding zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso Bowman, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso whereas the light chain zzso to the zzso of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso Chang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Twelve zzso zzso are present in the alpha zzso zzso zzso and 11 of them are positioned in the heavy chain and a single one in the light chain of the zzso they form six zzso zzso The first and the last zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of alpha zzso zzso are engaged in the formation of a loop spanning the extreme zzso and zzso portions of the zzso thereby connecting the heavy and light zzso The other 10 zzso zzso are linked zzso in the heavy chain and form five zzso which span zzso zzso acid zzso Among them are two pairs of zzso which are characterized by mutual sequence zzso The particular arrangement of zzso zzso in alpha zzso zzso is similar to the patterns of zzso arranged and zzso repeated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso It is concluded that alpha zzso zzso represents a structural zzso of a novel family among the zzso zzso characterized by the presence of two zzso building zzso zzso similarity among the zzso sequences of alpha zzso zzso and human zzso zzso suggest that the latter protein is another candidate protein of this new zzso
