T cell recognition of foreign zzso is a result of a zzso complex between T cell zzso nominal zzso and major zzso complex zzso It has been proposed that the nominal zzso which is presented by accessory cells to T cells, has a characteristic structure which can be predicted on the basis of zzso zzso To further study this zzso we zzso T cells from normal human blood donors with synthetic peptides (each of approximately 15 zzso acids in zzso from the heat shock protein 65 of zzso zzso zzso We found that while the characterization of certain zzso follows commonly used predictions, other zzso cannot be predicted by known zzso
