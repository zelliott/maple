In this paper, we show that both zzso B and the high mobility group protein zzso zzso zzso are required for virus induction of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso B binds to the terminal regions of a 10 zzso regulatory sequence through contacts in the major zzso while zzso zzso recognizes the central region of the same sequence through contacts in the minor zzso zzso that interfere with binding of either protein decrease the level of virus zzso and zzso of the gene can be blocked by either zzso B or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the binding of zzso B to the zzso promoter, and it may also function as a zzso accessory factor for zzso B zzso zzso
