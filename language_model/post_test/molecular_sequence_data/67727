The zzso zzso and zzso that are present in trace amounts are suggested to have a signaling function in zzso Recently, it was demonstrated that zzso metabolism contributes to zzso zzso defense against the green zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an important insect zzso of a large variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism was shown to curtail zzso infestation by promoting starch zzso and expression of the zzso zzso zzso which has important roles in regulating zzso and zzso against zzso Here we show that zzso metabolism is similarly activated in leaves of zzso tomato zzso zzso plants and likely contributes to tomato defense against zzso zzso leaves of tomato accumulated zzso which was accompanied by the transient zzso of zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was also accompanied by starch zzso and the zzso of zzso the tomato zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso application induced zzso expression and starch zzso and curtailed zzso zzso suggesting that like in zzso zzso contributes to tomato defense against zzso
