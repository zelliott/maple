The aim of the present study was to purify and clone the zzso zzso from the guinea pig zzso and characterize their zzso zzso 

zzso from pancreatic zzso were isolated by zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso was tested with zzso zzso B, and zzso zzso zzso for zzso were cloned from total zzso after reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso of zzso yielded a single peak with an zzso zzso sequence of zzso Cloning of zzso zzso revealed 2 distinct but nearly identical zzso At the zzso acid level, the only difference between the 2 zzso is an zzso change at position 15 within the signal zzso Thus, both zzso zzso give rise to the same mature zzso upon zzso zzso pig zzso is readily activated by zzso and zzso B but exhibits essentially no zzso under conditions where human zzso and zzso zzso rapidly zzso 

The observations suggest that multiple zzso zzso and their ability to zzso are not required universally for normal zzso physiology in zzso Furthermore, the inability of guinea pig zzso to undergo zzso suggests that this species might be more resistant to zzso than humans, where increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been linked to zzso zzso
