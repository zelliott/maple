The zzso rule links the zzso of a protein to the identity of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are recognized by zzso zzso zzso termed zzso A zzso structural domain called the zzso box is responsible for their zzso Here we report the crystal structures of the zzso boxes of the human zzso zzso and zzso alone and in complex with an zzso rule zzso zzso These structures show that the zzso box adopts a previously zzso fold stabilized through the binding of three zinc zzso to form a binding pocket for type 1 zzso zzso experiments reveal a preference for zzso zzso zzso binding is zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso or loss of the positive charge of the zzso zzso These results zzso and refine the empirical rules for the zzso of type 1 zzso We also confirm that a zzso zzso in zzso that is responsible for zzso syndrome leads to zzso box unfolding and loss of zzso
