zzso the presence of a species in the high latitudes separated by a gap in distribution across the zzso is a well-known pattern of global species zzso But the question of whether bipolar species have evolved independently at the poles since the establishment of the zzso provinces 16-8 million years ago, or if genes have been transferred across the zzso since that time, has not been zzso Here we examine genetic variation in the small zzso zzso zzso gene of three bipolar zzso zzso zzso We identify at least one identical zzso in all three zzso in both the Arctic and Antarctic zzso provinces, indicating that zzso gene flow must have zzso Our genetic analysis also reveals that zzso zzso can consist of a complex of genetic zzso Such zzso of genetically distinct populations within one zzso may affect the use of zzso zzso as a zzso proxy for climate change and zzso a reassessment of the species concept for the zzso
