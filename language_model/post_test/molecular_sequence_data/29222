In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport activity has been characterized but ammonium transport genes have not been zzso The zzso gene zzso a zzso responsible for zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso appeared essential to take up ammonium when it was present at low zzso in the external medium and might also be involved in recapture of ammonium leaked out from the zzso zzso of zzso which was induced in the absence of ammonium and also influenced by the zzso carbon supply, was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso The promoter of zzso was found to exhibit the structure of zzso zzso and specific binding of zzso zzso to zzso promoter sequences was zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and that zzso may respond to both nitrogen and carbon zzso
