zzso zzso zzso was bound specifically to the cells of two zzso zzso lines, zzso and zzso which expressed zzso zzso The binding was zzso cell zzso and zzso and was zzso Although the cloned zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso from rat adrenal zzso was identical to that from rat zzso cells, significant differences in the zzso binding properties between two cell lineages were zzso 1) zzso cells had a single class of binding sites with very low affinity zzso zzso 16 zzso whereas zzso cells had two classes of binding sites with different affinities zzso zzso 95 zzso for high affinity sites and zzso zzso for low affinity zzso and 2) zzso experiments revealed one zzso product of 105 zzso for zzso cells and two products of 140 and 120 zzso for zzso zzso Taken together with additional results, the presence of a putative accessory zzso that may alter the zzso binding affinity through interaction with zzso zzso is zzso The binding of zzso to zzso cells caused a rapid increase in the zzso concentration of free zzso The presence of zzso had no effect on the zzso binding but completely inhibited the calcium increase, indicating that zzso zzso the calcium influx from outside of the zzso The addition of zzso to the culture media of zzso cells elevated the zzso zzso of zzso
