zzso editing in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso processing reaction in which exclusively zzso zzso are inserted into, and less frequently deleted from, zzso zzso central to the process are so-called guide zzso zzso which function as templates in the zzso For a detailed molecular understanding of the mechanism of the editing process knowledge of structural features of zzso will be zzso Here we report on a zzso molecular zzso approach to construct the first three-dimensional zzso model for zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso process relied on chemical modification and zzso probing data and was validated by in zzso zzso zzso The model predicts a reasonably compact structure, where two zzso secondary structure elements are brought into close proximity by a triple A zzso interaction, forming a core element within the zzso of the zzso The model further suggests that the surface of the zzso is primarily made up of the zzso zzso On the basis of the model, zzso experiments of zzso in a complex with the zzso binding protein zzso could successfully be interpreted and provide a first picture for the assembly of zzso within a zzso zzso
