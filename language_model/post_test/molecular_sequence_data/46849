The responses of zzso zzso to zzso conditions were studied at the level of protein synthesis at a lethal zzso pH zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso pH zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins were separated by two-dimensional zzso zzso and analyzed by a zzso zzso gel analysis zzso The two zzso conditions upgraded a number of zzso proteins and induced synthesis of a number of novel zzso The majority of these induced proteins were common to the two zzso and the lethal zzso pH induced more proteins than the mildly zzso zzso suggesting that the responses to the two zzso conditions involve many common proteins and that additional proteins are required when the bacteria have to face more severe zzso zzso In waiting for identification of more proteins involved in order to have a wholesome zzso picture of the acid response in zzso zzso we present here the first results obtained from identification of the most abundant of these zzso proteins using zzso mass zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso
