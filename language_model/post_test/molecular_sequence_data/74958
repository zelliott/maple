We have already determined the primary structure of the zzso inhibitor for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso sequence and revealed that the zzso inhibitor contains four internally repeating units which could be responsible for its multiple zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso zzso fragments of the zzso corresponding to each of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the total zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso site of zzso or zzso in a direction and frame matched to the zzso open reading frame of the zzso Under the zzso zzso system, we succeeded in producing truncated fragments of the zzso inhibitor in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor fragments were partially zzso and the zzso activities toward zzso zzso zzso were zzso All fragments containing well zzso regions of about 30 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso located in the middle of the four units exhibited the zzso zzso However, their zzso activities varied zzso Further zzso experiments revealed that small fragments containing zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso inhibitor still retained zzso zzso From these experimental results the following conclusions can be zzso 1) each of the four repeating units of the zzso inhibitor (about 140 zzso acid zzso is a real functional unit and can inhibit zzso activity zzso and 2) zzso corresponding to well zzso sequences of about 30 zzso acid zzso containing a consensus zzso sequence are essential for the zzso activity, and the bordering regions are important for its zzso
