A new zzso primer zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso region of zzso was tested in its specificity to amplify zzso of zzso from zzso zzso origin by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso primer targeting the zzso zzso generated a common zzso by zzso with DNA from zzso and zzso reference zzso but not from zzso zzso zzso analysis of clones obtained by zzso amplification with zzso and zzso and total DNA isolated from the zzso zzso and zzso contents of one zzso resulted in zzso and zzso sequences mainly retrieved from zzso zzso The primer pair was further validated in a culture independent zzso to monitor broad fluctuations of zzso populations in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also used for zzso zzso determination throughout zzso zzso in parallel with zzso and short chain fatty acids zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso were correlated with zzso detection in early stages of zzso Based on the obtained results, a simple monitoring zzso approach is proposed, zzso its application to the study of the dynamics of specific bacterial populations in complex zzso
