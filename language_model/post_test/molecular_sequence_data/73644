We previously have shown that zzso zzso zzso male sterile zzso zzso I and II present large zzso deletions and that the zzso zzso of complex I (the main zzso of the zzso respiratory zzso is absent in zzso zzso Here, we show that, despite a large difference in size in the zzso zzso zzso I and II display similar zzso Both have an impaired development from zzso to zzso with partial male zzso that becomes complete under low zzso Besides zzso two other complex I zzso are missing zzso and the zzso zzso zzso identified on two-dimensional patterns of zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso leaves showed altered zzso Although their zzso zzso through complex II was close to that of the wild type, zzso of zzso a priority zzso of plant zzso was significantly zzso The remaining activity was much less sensitive to zzso indicating the breakdown of Complex I zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso generation and partly sensitive to zzso was strongly zzso These results suggest respiratory compensation mechanisms involving additional zzso zzso to complex zzso Finally, the capacity of the zzso alternative zzso zzso was enhanced in zzso and higher amounts of zzso were evidenced by zzso
