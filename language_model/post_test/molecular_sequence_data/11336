The zzso of several zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso with completely zzso zzso zzso under the zzso reaction conditions was studied in order to develop a method for the zzso synthesis of selectively protected zzso zzso in a form that can be used for further preparation of corresponding zzso donors and zzso zzso We found that zzso were the major primary products of the reaction, and their further conversion into zzso zzso depended on pH and can be regulated by the type of molecular zzso zzso When Acid zzso zzso zzso zzso 300 were used, zzso were predominantly zzso No selective formation of the zzso zzso was observed upon zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso was most efficiently zzso by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso With zzso or zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso this zzso can also be zzso but with a lower yield of the target zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso
