In diverse organisms from zzso to mice, zzso in numerous genes required for DNA repair may lead to defects in zzso Although it is likely that zzso is zzso throughout evolution, little is known about the zzso of zzso in humans even though zzso arrest associated with zzso is zzso In this work, we compared the sequence zzso of a zzso marker amplified from DNA of two groups of zzso those with zzso biopsy suggesting zzso arrest and those with normal zzso who were zzso We demonstrated that zzso are more common in DNA from zzso tissue derived from men with zzso arrest than in DNA from zzso tissue derived from men with normal zzso and physical obstruction zzso zzso zzso No zzso were observed in blood tissue from either group of zzso This suggests the possibility that defects in genes required in DNA repair could contribute to zzso arrest in men just as has been observed in other zzso
