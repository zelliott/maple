The zzso zzso zzso system, zzso five zzso complexes, is located in the inner membrane of zzso and is the final zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso system can cause a wide range of clinical zzso these diseases are often progressive and zzso Numerous genes have been implicated in zzso deficiencies and many zzso have been zzso However, in a substantial number of patients with decreased zzso activities of two or more zzso complexes, no zzso in the zzso DNA or in nuclear genes known to be involved in these disorders have been zzso In this study, four nuclear candidate zzso zzso zzso and zzso screened for zzso in 22 patients with a combined zzso zzso of primarily the zzso complexes I, III and IV to determine whether a zzso in one of these genes could explain the zzso zzso For each zzso not yet reported as a zzso 100 control samples were screened for the presence of the zzso This way we identified 14 new zzso and 2 presumably zzso zzso No zzso were found that could explain the zzso disorder in the patients investigated in this zzso zzso the genetic zzso in these patients must be located in other nuclear genes involved in zzso zzso zzso or translation, in import, processing or degradation of nuclear zzso zzso zzso or in assembly of the zzso zzso
