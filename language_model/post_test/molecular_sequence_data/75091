A zzso zzso was constructed with six synthetic DNA zzso such that the DNA sequence corresponding to zzso zzso is flanked by a zzso promoter and a zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso gives an unmodified zzso of the expected sequence having correct zzso and 3' zzso This zzso transcript can be specifically zzso by zzso zzso zzso and has a zzso only zzso higher than that of the native zzso zzso The zzso is independent of zzso zzso whereas the zzso is very dependent on zzso zzso zzso of the melting profiles of the native and the unmodified zzso at different zzso zzso suggests that the unmodified zzso has a less stable zzso zzso Using one additional DNA zzso a zzso zzso was constructed having a zzso to zzso change at position 20 in the zzso zzso A decrease in zzso by a factor of 14 for zzso of the zzso zzso transcript is zzso
