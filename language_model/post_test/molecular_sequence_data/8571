In zzso the zzso group zzso proteins are responsible for the stable and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso apparently uses zzso mechanisms to zzso zzso zzso regulators such as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is part of a large zzso complex composed of other members of the zzso We have identified functionally relevant zzso of the zzso protein by sequencing different zzso zzso Additionally, using a zzso gal fusion protein with deleted internal zzso repeats, we found that this zzso protein cannot bind to four particular target zzso but otherwise does not change the remaining overall binding zzso We show that, in contrast to the dotted zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the nuclear distribution of zzso proteins becomes zzso Surprisingly, in zzso zzso the zzso zzso another member of the zzso is also redistributed in the zzso Our results indicate that the appropriate zzso zzso of the two proteins is critical for the zzso function of the zzso zzso
