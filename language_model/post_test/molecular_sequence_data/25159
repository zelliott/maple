zzso zzso surface zzso zzso exemplify a class of zzso zzso zzso that rely on a zzso attached zzso zzso for membrane zzso The zzso anchor is acquired soon after translation of the zzso apparently by replacement of a short sequence of zzso zzso acids with a precursor zzso A candidate zzso precursor zzso and a related zzso zzso have been identified in polar zzso extracts from zzso Both lipids are zzso species containing a zzso core zzso indistinguishable from the backbone sequence of the zzso zzso zzso We and others have recently described the zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and a spectrum of putative zzso zzso zzso using crude preparations of zzso zzso In this paper we use these preparations to show that all three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are derived from zzso
