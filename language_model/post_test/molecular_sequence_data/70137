We have previously described the isolation and initial characterization of 15 zzso protein zzso zzso from rabbit zzso zzso zzso that bind to zzso coli and zzso the zzso actions of other zzso proteins on this gram negative zzso We now report that the zzso differ in primary zzso The cloning and sequencing of two distinct zzso zzso from a rabbit bone zzso library reveal that two of the zzso are closely similar in primary structure differing at only two zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso putative signal sequences suggesting a zzso zzso for these zzso Analysis of the derived zzso primary structures reveals zzso to two zzso zzso zzso an 18 zzso zzso zzso binding protein from rabbit zzso and zzso an 11 zzso zzso zzso inhibitor from zzso zzso This structural similarity suggests the existence of a novel family of low molecular weight zzso proteins with potential roles in zzso
