We have isolated and characterized zzso and zzso zzso plasmids that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso plasmids were identified using a probe derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso The zzso gene contains two zzso and encodes a protein 398 zzso acids in length that shows a high degree of zzso to the zzso zzso protein of both lower and higher zzso During development, both the pattern of zzso of zzso zzso and changes in its zzso activity are identical to those observed for other zzso zzso
