The successful genetic manipulation of zzso zzso for the increased production of zzso will depend on an understanding of gene structure and regulation in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is regulated by zzso zzso transcribed from a downstream promoter, in the opposite direction to the zzso zzso An open reading frame zzso was detected downstream of the zzso zzso which has sequence zzso to response regulators with zzso activity and may be involved in sensing nitrogen zzso The expression of the linked zzso zzso and zzso genes was investigated throughout the bacterial growth cycle by zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was independently expressed as a zzso transcript which peaked at 12 zzso immediately prior to the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes were transcribed throughout the zzso and zzso zzso A regulator zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified and zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso the degradation of starch by an zzso zzso zzso zzso and may therefore play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso in this zzso
