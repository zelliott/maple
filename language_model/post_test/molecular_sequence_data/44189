The basic region of zzso and other basic zzso zzso proteins bind to the zzso DNA sequences zzso For the zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso family, zzso of several basic region zzso abrogates muscle zzso but not DNA zzso One of the zzso acid positions displaying this behavior in zzso zzso with a highly zzso zzso in zzso This zzso zzso displays complete tolerance for zzso substitution as measured by DNA zzso To test the possibility of whether the basic region of zzso encodes a second biological function, the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and tested for the zzso functions of cellular transformation and zzso In contrast to the deleterious effects of such zzso in zzso the zzso zzso functions normally for both zzso cellular transformation and zzso zzso zzso a basic region function distinct from DNA binding may not be a general feature of zzso zzso zzso
