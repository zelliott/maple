zzso between two zzso zzso cells is generally controlled by the zzso action of zzso mating zzso cells of each mating type releasing zzso that induce zzso changes in cells of the opposite zzso Recent studies into zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso have revealed significant parallels with processes in higher zzso and could provide the opportunity for investigating communication in an zzso that is amenable to both zzso and genetic zzso
