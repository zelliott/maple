In response to zzso stress, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates compatible zzso either by de zzso synthesis or by zzso from the zzso To characterize transport systems responsible for the zzso of compatible zzso a zzso gene bank of zzso zzso was transferred into the zzso strain zzso coli zzso and two genes were cloned by functional zzso required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso by an open reading frame of zzso zzso named zzso The gene zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso which shares significant identity to zzso zzso zzso The zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso by an open reading frame of zzso zzso called zzso The potential, zzso zzso protein consists of 493 zzso acid zzso and belongs, like zzso to the zzso zzso The affinity of whole cells of zzso coli zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined, suggesting that zzso and zzso exhibit a high affinity for their zzso An zzso of the zzso in the medium resulted in an increased zzso of zzso via zzso and zzso zzso via zzso in zzso coli zzso cells, demonstrating that both systems are zzso
