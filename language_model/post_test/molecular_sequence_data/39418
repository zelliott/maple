zzso tamoxifen zzso and zzso interact differently with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a competitive inhibitor whereas zzso has zzso but zzso effects on zzso This study compared the effects of zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso on gene expression in zzso breast cancer cells using zzso each representing nearly 20,000 human zzso zzso differences between the sets of genes affected by these two drugs were zzso Both zzso and zzso affected zzso of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell zzso and zzso formation, however, only zzso of zzso zzso genes and zzso of zzso genes were similarly regulated by zzso A selective zzso of zzso by zzso but not zzso was observed and confirmed by zzso Similar zzso of this gene by zzso was observed in the zzso of zzso (4 zzso for 7 zzso rats, in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression zzso were both zzso These data show that zzso and zzso regulate the expression of different sets of zzso reflecting their different modes of interaction with zzso zzso zzso of zzso could explain its positive benefit rates in acquired tamoxifen zzso
