zzso protein zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso display two highly zzso sequence elements in the promoter zzso The molecular dissection of these promoters revealed that zzso zzso is not based on a zzso zzso The sequence which promotes zzso zzso is the zzso sequence zzso or the zzso form zzso called the zzso D zzso zzso of the zzso D box a tandem repeat zzso or the zzso form zzso appears in some zzso called zzso zzso This element functions in the zzso arrangement with zzso D as an zzso zzso A compilation of zzso D and zzso E sequences identified in other zzso promoters revealed that several putative zzso II and zzso III promoters display a zzso D box or the zzso zzso D zzso
