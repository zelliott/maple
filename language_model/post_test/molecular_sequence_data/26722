zzso zzso zzso zzso is described from the zzso zzso On average, the new species is larger and the zzso of the upper surface darker than in most other species of the zzso Seemingly the species has been zzso with others in the past, particularly zzso zzso zzso zzso Males can be separated from zzso similar species by studying the shape of the zzso Additionally, the anterior margin of the zzso is provided with a distinct rim in both zzso which is absent or only zzso present in other zzso The zzso and the male zzso of the new species are zzso and compared with those of zzso zzso External zzso differences from other members of the zzso are zzso According to studies of the molecular zzso based on fragments of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is clearly separated from previously described species of zzso zzso 1943, apparently being relatively zzso within the zzso The new species is rather widely distributed in the zzso part of the zzso Peninsula, inhabiting pools in small temporary zzso zzso We provide zzso maps for all eight zzso zzso and estimate the potential zzso areas of the new species and the other two endemic zzso species zzso zzso zzso & zzso 1990 and zzso zzso zzso 2011, based on environmental niche zzso
