Previous studies in the zzso zzso zzso have proposed a zzso zzso for zzso which is difficult to reconcile with its ability to zzso zzso zzso We used fluorescent zzso to show that the red fluorescent protein zzso fused to the zzso of zzso although mostly localized in the zzso was also targeted to the cell zzso Also, hybrid zzso zzso fused at their zzso with the zzso internal zzso revealed that a 131 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso sufficient to target the fusion protein to the cell surface, enabling growth of the zzso zzso on zzso The unique zzso domain appeared to be indispensable for the production of a functional zzso and its removal zzso zzso zzso and growth on zzso Finally, the zzso significance of the zzso zzso of zzso was established by showing that fusion of the signal zzso of zzso to zzso truncated zzso allowed the zzso zzso to grow on zzso whereas the signal sequence of the zzso zzso constrained zzso in the zzso and prevented growth of this zzso on zzso Use of trafficking zzso that impaired zzso delivery to the zzso zzso neither its activity nor its growth on zzso zzso
