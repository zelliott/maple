zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the hot spring at zzso in northern zzso and the hot spring at zzso in central zzso zzso The strains of zzso zzso produce zzso colonies and have an optimum growth temperature of about 55 degrees C, while the strains of zzso zzso produce zzso colonies and have an optimum growth temperature of about 50 degrees zzso The strains of both species are zzso zzso These species can be distinguished from each other and from zzso zzso by zzso zzso fatty acid composition data, and zzso zzso gene sequence zzso Our zzso analysis showed that strains zzso zzso zzso type zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso line of zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
