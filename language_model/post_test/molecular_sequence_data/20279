The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and patterning of the nervous system are relatively poorly understood for zzso (like zzso as compared with zzso (especially zzso and zzso (especially zzso zzso we have undertaken a candidate gene approach to study aspects of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined the zzso expression for zzso zzso of four genes zzso Churchill, zzso and zzso known to play key roles in zzso zzso During zzso development, zzso is expressed in the zzso and its expression switches off when committed neural precursors are zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso neural precursors in the central and peripheral nervous zzso Finally, zzso and Churchill are transcribed in patterns consistent with their involvement in neural zzso The expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso closely resemble those in zzso and zzso suggests that zzso of these genes play similar zzso roles in all zzso Whereas zzso zzso like its zzso zzso plays a role in neural cell zzso related genes in zzso do not appear to be involved in zzso Finally, zzso to Churchill in zzso zzso zzso of this gene are expressed during zzso formation, but not later during nerve cell zzso in the insect zzso zzso of these genes have been zzso zzso In spite of such instances of functional divergence or loss, the present study shows conspicuous similarities in the genetic control of zzso among zzso These zzso suggest that key features of the genetic program for zzso are ancestral to zzso
