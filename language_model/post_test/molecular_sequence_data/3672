zzso of zzso is directed by a signal sequence located within its zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso analyses have indicated that the extreme end of this zzso is critical for zzso however, it is not known if this region contains structural features necessary for zzso In this study, we have used a zzso approach to generate two zzso zzso random libraries zzso and zzso in the signal sequence to investigate the functional specificity of the last 16 zzso The large number of zzso generated had provided us with a rich data set to determine if a restricted subset of sequences was actually required for function in the extreme zzso We observed that over zzso of the random sequences in the zzso region were zzso at close to zzso level, while the zzso region was more restricted with only 50% of the random sequences supporting zzso zzso It appeared that, in the zzso region, the relative lack of positive charge is favored for zzso These findings, along with previous results, allow us to propose a model for recognition and transport of zzso that emphasizes secondary structure and general zzso properties over primary zzso This model may have implications for understanding the broad zzso specificity common among zzso cassette zzso
