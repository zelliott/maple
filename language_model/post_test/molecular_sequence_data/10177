zzso zzso zzso zzso a rat model of human minimal change zzso is characterized by extensive zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso foot processes and by severe zzso For comparison of expression of zzso membrane proteins of normal and zzso rats, a membrane protein fraction of isolated rat zzso was prepared and zzso zzso were raised against zzso An zzso clone designated zzso was selected that specifically zzso zzso of normal but not of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso cloning of its zzso was performed in a delta zzso expression library prepared from zzso of isolated rat zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence indicated a zzso integral membrane protein with a single zzso domain, two potential zzso sites in its short zzso tail, and six potential zzso sites in the large zzso High zzso acid sequence identities were found to membrane zzso of rat lung and bone and mouse zzso zzso cells as well as to a zzso protein in a mouse zzso cell line and to a canine influenza C virus zzso In zzso expression of this zzso protein was selectively reduced to zzso zzso as determined by quantitative zzso electron zzso zzso and Northern zzso These data provide evidence that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is specifically zzso in zzso To indicate that this protein could be associated with transformation of zzso foot processes to flat feet zzso zzso zzso we have called it zzso
