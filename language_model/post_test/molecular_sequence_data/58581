zzso infectious anemia virus zzso is a zzso that replicates predominantly in mature tissue zzso zzso expression is strongly influenced by the state of differentiation of the host zzso While blood zzso can be zzso viral zzso is limited until the cell zzso into a mature zzso zzso of mature zzso infected with zzso might also alter viral zzso presumably through binding of cellular zzso factors to viral zzso acid sequences within the long terminal repeat zzso Using DNA amplification techniques, we compared zzso sequences of zzso field strains of zzso to sequences of a laboratory adapted strain of the zzso All field strain sequences were more closely related to Wyoming strain than to the zzso laboratory adapted strain or a previously zzso infectious molecular clone of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures were infected with virulent and zzso strains of zzso and the effects of zzso stimulation on zzso expression were zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso activated the cells to zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso This zzso signal also resulted in a significant zzso of viral expression as determined by zzso reverse zzso zzso This effect occurred independent of the zzso of the virus strain used or the zzso acid sequence of the viral zzso This may represent an zzso response of zzso to evade the host immune response and establish a persistent zzso
