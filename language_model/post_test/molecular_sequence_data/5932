A large subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso are immediately to the C zzso of diffuse B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are generally considered to be zzso zzso many are zzso zzso zzso appear to function as zzso factors, or have specific zzso zzso Since dual domain zzso zzso are known to have significant properties in other zzso it is possible that a defined zzso relationship is required for zzso zzso We determined the solution structure of the human zzso zzso domain for a construct partially extended into the preceding zzso zzso There are specific structural contacts between the zzso and the vestigial zzso zzso This appears to involve structural elements common to this zzso of zzso zzso and to zzso zzso The human zzso zzso domain binds to zzso zzso with a approximately 60 zzso M zzso Using chemical shift zzso the binding site is identified to be essentially identical to that observed zzso for the zzso zzso complex with the zzso domain of zzso zzso This site may serve as an zzso regulator of zzso or other zzso zzso While the overall fold of the human zzso zzso domain is similar to other zzso zzso the size and position of the zzso zzso and the presence of an zzso zzso of the vestigial zzso domain suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso may be a well defined structural group in which the zzso domain is a membrane zzso and zzso
