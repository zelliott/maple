zzso binding to G zzso receptors is believed to promote a zzso change that leads to the formation of the active zzso zzso However, the character of this zzso change which provides the important link between zzso binding and G protein zzso is not zzso Here we report evidence that zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso a zzso change around zzso in zzso domain zzso III and around zzso in TM zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso with a limited number of zzso available for chemical zzso were zzso zzso labeled with the zzso sensitive, zzso zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso receptors containing zzso and/or zzso showed an zzso decrease in fluorescence, while no zzso response was observed in a zzso where these two zzso were zzso These data suggest that zzso bound to zzso and zzso are exposed to a more polar environment upon zzso zzso and indicate that movements of zzso segments III and VI are involved in zzso of G zzso zzso
