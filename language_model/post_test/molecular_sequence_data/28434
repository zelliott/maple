An in zzso zzso zzso zzso system has been zzso in which the zzso was initiated to a specific length zzso by the absence of the appropriate zzso zzso When the zzso zzso zzso complex was exposed to zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso a small fractional occupancy at each zzso and the zzso transcript then allowed to zzso in the presence of all four zzso zzso there was a zzso increase of zzso lengths up to sites occupied by zzso A unique characteristic is that zzso zzso was completely terminated at every zzso site, in contrast to bacterial zzso zzso where zzso past drug sites occurs and results merely in a delay of zzso at each site due primarily to zzso of drug from the zzso Similar termination of zzso at each drug site was observed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The termination at drug sites in the zzso system results in zzso of specific lengths which define the location of zzso sites, and the zzso concentration provides a measure of relative zzso occupancy at that zzso zzso of zzso was observed with four drugs with relatively long DNA residence times zzso greater than or equal to 300 s at 20 degrees C for zzso zzso zzso and zzso but to a lesser extent with drugs of intermediate residence times zzso zzso and an zzso with zzso of 230 and 7 zzso respectively, at 20 degrees zzso
