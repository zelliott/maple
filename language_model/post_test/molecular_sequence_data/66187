zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with multiple cellular functions, including DNA repair, zzso regulation, and cell zzso zzso has a modular architecture with six independent zzso zzso the zzso zzso Two zinc finger zzso at the N zzso of zzso bind to DNA and thereby activate the zzso domain situated at the C zzso of the zzso The tight zzso of DNA binding and zzso activities is critical to the cellular regulation of zzso zzso however, the mechanism for zzso these activities remains an zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate using zzso and zzso analysis that human zzso has a third zzso zzso zzso zzso and deletion analysis indicate that this region mediates zzso contacts important for zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the third zzso domain reveals a zinc ribbon fold and suggests zzso zzso that could form zzso zzso The new zzso domain zzso in the crystal lattice to form a zzso with a zzso zzso The structure of the zzso provides a scaffold for assembling the activated state of zzso and suggests a mechanism for zzso the DNA binding and zzso functions of zzso
