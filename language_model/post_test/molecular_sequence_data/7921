In zzso disease zzso the zzso zzso (A zzso accumulates in plaques in the zzso A beta can be zzso by a mechanism involving induction of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso of zzso free calcium levels zzso In light of evidence for an inflammatory response in the brain in zzso and reports of increased levels of tumor necrosis factor zzso in zzso brain we tested the hypothesis that zzso affect zzso vulnerability to A zzso A zzso and A zzso induced zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cultures for 24 zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in significant zzso of A zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced in zzso by A beta was significantly attenuated in zzso cultures, and zzso protected zzso against iron zzso suggesting that zzso induce zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso zzso by zzso zzso was markedly zzso in zzso exposed to A zzso and this action of A beta was suppressed in cultures zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an induction of a zzso zzso activity in zzso cells exposed to zzso Exposure of cultures to I zzso B zzso zzso zzso a manipulation designed to induce zzso B, zzso the protection by zzso These data suggest that zzso protect zzso zzso against A beta toxicity by suppressing zzso of zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to mediate these zzso A zzso role for zzso in the neurodegenerative process in zzso is zzso
