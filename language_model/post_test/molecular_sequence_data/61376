zzso zzso of the zzso zzso ligament of the zzso is a common form of human zzso with a prevalence of as much as zzso in a variety of ethnic zzso To clarify the genetic factors that zzso to zzso we have studied zzso zzso zzso a mouse model that presents zzso zzso of the spinal ligaments similar to zzso and have found that the zzso zzso is caused by the nonsense zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso thought to produce zzso zzso a major inhibitor of zzso and zzso To investigate a possible role of zzso in the zzso of zzso we have examined its genetic variations in zzso zzso A total of 323 zzso patients was screened by means of zzso chain zzso zzso zzso analysis covering all the zzso and their surrounding zzso plus about zzso of the promoter zzso We identified ten zzso variations in the zzso zzso five of the zzso caused zzso zzso and two of them were found specifically in zzso zzso zzso we performed an association study using these variations and found a significant association of an zzso zzso a deletion of T at a position 11 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso site of zzso 20 zzso with zzso the proportion of the individuals having this deletion was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients than in controls, indicating that those who have this variation may be more susceptible to the abnormal zzso of the spinal zzso Thus, our study suggests that zzso plays an important role in the zzso of human zzso
