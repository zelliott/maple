The zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to family B of the zzso coupled receptors zzso and has become a promising target for the treatment of type 2 zzso Here we describe the development and characterization of a fully functional zzso and zzso truncated zzso Single zzso were initially zzso with zzso and functionally redundant zzso were subsequently changed zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important for the zzso response, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso deletions were made in the zzso tail of zzso in order to determine the limit for zzso As for other family B zzso we observed a direct correlation between the length of the zzso tail and specific binding of zzso indicating that the membrane zzso part of the zzso is involved in zzso expression at the cell zzso The results show that seven zzso and more than half of the zzso tail can be removed from zzso without compromising zzso binding or zzso
