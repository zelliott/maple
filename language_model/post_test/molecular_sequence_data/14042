The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by its ability to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso which was otherwise unable to grow on minimal medium lacking zzso The zzso zzso zzso also enabled the in zzso reduction by zzso coli of zzso zzso to zzso as well as the in zzso reduction of zzso When present in zzso coli, the zzso zzso zzso supported the replication of zzso zzso but not the growth of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso and the zzso was found to be most like that of zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As in the case of zzso coli, the gene was located immediately upstream of the gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso gene in zzso zzso and the cloned gene in zzso coli indicated that it was transcribed as an independent unit and that the major zzso start sites were the same in both zzso
