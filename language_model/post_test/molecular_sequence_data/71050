In zzso zzso the his zzso contains all the genes necessary for zzso zzso It is transcribed from a unique promoter, localized 300 zzso upstream of the first zzso The region corresponding to the untranslated zzso end of the transcript, named the his leader region, displays the typical features of the T box zzso zzso mechanism which is involved in the regulation of many zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Here we describe the regulation of zzso of the his zzso by the level of zzso in the growth zzso In the absence of zzso two transcripts are zzso One covers the entire zzso while the other stops at a zzso situated about 250 zzso downstream of the zzso start zzso DNA sequences implicated in regulation of the his zzso were identified by zzso fusion with zzso genes and zzso zzso In addition to the previously defined sequences necessary for effective zzso regulation, new essential regions were zzso zzso percent of the positions of the his leader region were found to differ in seven zzso related strains of zzso zzso Analysis of the variable positions supports the folding model of the central part of the his leader zzso Lastly, in addition to the zzso regulation, the zzso is regulated at the level of initiation of transcription, which is zzso in the presence of zzso An operator site, necessary for full repression, zzso the zzso involved in the T box zzso zzso The functionality of the operator is altered on plasmids with low and high copy numbers, suggesting that zzso may play a role in the expression of the his zzso The zzso of regulation at the levels of initiation and zzso of zzso are 6- to zzso and zzso zzso Together, the two levels of control allow a zzso range of regulation of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso
