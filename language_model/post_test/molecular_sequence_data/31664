A new zzso strain, zzso was identified and zzso 

The strain was identified by zzso observation and zzso zzso homogeneous zzso zzso was identified by monitoring the zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso using a reversed phase High Performance zzso zzso zzso The regulation of zzso expression was studied by measuring zzso activity of 11 different carbon sources and 7 nitrogen sources in shaking zzso The zzso capacity was investigated in both solid-state zzso and submerged zzso 

The zzso and zzso of zzso corresponded to the characteristics of zzso section zzso zzso and the zzso zzso sequences showed zzso at zzso to zzso zzso Crude zzso prepared by both submerged zzso and solid-state zzso could zzso zzso to zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso could remove zzso from citrus juice zzso zzso resources, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and organic nitrogen resources, zzso zzso zzso soybean zzso zzso extract and corn syrup were shown to express the zzso The strain had an outstanding ability to yield zzso in the solid-state zzso which showed an zzso activity of zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by Davis zzso 

It is the first time to report a stain of zzso zzso can produce zzso carbon source containing zzso groups are able to induce the zzso zzso The stain zzso is a new zzso source for high yield of zzso in particularly by the solid-state zzso
