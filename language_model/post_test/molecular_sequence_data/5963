A single reverse zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso zzso zzso confirmed by zzso of amplified products with zzso zzso using DNA zzso zzso zzso was compared to zzso zzso on 20 zzso from patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso or acute zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso obtained by zzso confirmed by zzso and by zzso zzso All but one of the patients with chronic zzso and positive zzso zzso as well as the patients with acute zzso had zzso zzso zzso in zzso all patients with chronic zzso and indeterminate zzso zzso and all controls zzso zzso 5) were negative by the two zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso remained positive after 7 zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso The threshold of detection for zzso was 15 zzso copies per zzso as assessed by testing serial zzso of an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed by zzso for zzso zzso appears to be as sensitive and specific as zzso Furthermore, it is easier to perform, with less of contamination, is less zzso requires fewer zzso and it permits zzso of zzso zzso
