The inner zzso collecting duct cell line, zzso absorbs zzso by an zzso zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to characterize the zzso zzso zzso channels responsible for zzso zzso zzso To this end, we measured zzso currents in single cells with the zzso technique and zzso currents across zzso mounted in zzso zzso In whole cell zzso experiments, zzso inward zzso currents were zzso by zzso zzso zzso In single-channel zzso experiments, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso channels were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and were permeable to zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels were never observed in whole cell or single-channel zzso zzso zzso across zzso zzso was inhibited with a rank order potency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data are most consistent with the view that zzso channels mediate zzso zzso zzso across zzso zzso
