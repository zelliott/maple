A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fruit zzso zzso zzso and its corresponding gene zzso showing sequence zzso to higher plant zzso genes have been zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame zzso a 16 zzso protein with 156 zzso zzso The zzso has an zzso signal zzso a repetitive zzso zzso and a zzso zzso region zzso to other zzso zzso Northern zzso and zzso analysis have shown that the zzso transcript is specifically expressed in fruit, not being detected in other plant zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies have indicated that the zzso gene is strongly expressed in zzso zzso cells, in the vascular and zzso cells of immature green fruit and in the vascular cells of mature red zzso The zzso removal from zzso green fruits induced the expression of this zzso zzso This induction was reverted by treatment of zzso fruit with the zzso zzso supporting the idea that zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein has been localized in zzso cells of immature fruits associated to structures containing condensed zzso The results are discussed supporting a putative role of this protein in the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso fruit during growth and zzso
