We have produced transgenic mice that express an zzso avian zzso zzso An zzso natural gene construct containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso and 19 zzso of 3' zzso sequences together with the 4 zzso zzso structural gene was expressed in a zzso manner in transgenic zzso A single injection of zzso caused a zzso to zzso stimulation of zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso had the same initiation sites of zzso as the native zzso isolated from laying zzso liver, and the same sites were used before and after zzso zzso The number of zzso that stain positive for zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso to zzso in 24 h after zzso zzso Thus, in zzso mice as in the zzso zzso are zzso zzso and induction of zzso synthesis occurs by recruitment of zzso In the zzso zzso compared to controls, transgenic mice have a 3- to zzso higher zzso total plasma zzso which was accounted for by a zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment results in a approximately zzso increase in the zzso zzso over zzso levels and zzso increase over zzso mice, which did not show any change in zzso in response to zzso zzso mice with the integrated zzso gene provide a useful model for the study of the regulation of zzso metabolism by zzso
