We have characterized a zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and found a regulatory element required for zzso between a zzso element and an zzso site in the zzso We designated this regulatory element zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso element, the zzso site and the zzso are required for efficient zzso zzso induction of zzso from the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso cell zzso We show that the zzso is also required for zzso between the zzso element and a zzso response element, both in the presence or absence of zzso indicating that the zzso is generally capable of zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains multiple overlapping binding sites for nuclear zzso designated zzso zzso factors zzso zzso We have identified putative binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso sites in the zzso zzso are highly zzso between zzso We demonstrate the binding of zzso to the NIP element, a previously characterized regulatory element in the human zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that this factor plays a role in regulation of a variety of zzso
