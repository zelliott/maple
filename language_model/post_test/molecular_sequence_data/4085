A robust forward genetic model for zzso could greatly enhance functional analysis of genes in these important zzso zzso We have developed and successfully tested a genetic zzso strategy based on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning to zzso DNA, we show that zzso sequences can be shuttled between zzso zzso and bacterial zzso providing an efficient tool for the recovery and functional assessment of candidate zzso We show zzso gene zzso and biological zzso with a zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso We also explored the utility of this approach to clone genes based on function from other zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso A zzso library containing zzso zzso zzso DNA was generated, and we identified a zzso zzso gene coding for zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso analysis demonstrates a clear zzso origin of this gene and strongly suggests its lateral transfer from zzso The zzso origin of this zzso might make it a promising target for zzso directed against zzso
