We sought to identify novel zzso zzso to better understand the zzso zzso and zzso of type 1 zzso 

zzso and human zzso zzso libraries expressed in zzso cells were screened with human diabetes zzso A positive clone was zzso directly and after zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso revealed the tissue distribution of the corresponding zzso zzso expressed by in zzso translation, and zzso peptides were analyzed by zzso For the zzso 183 zzso 60 zzso and 91 control zzso were zzso zzso zzso were used in zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was used in competition zzso 

zzso yielded an zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso protein zzso containing consensus protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso identical in the zzso domain, but only zzso identical zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to brain, zzso pancreatic zzso and adrenal zzso After limited zzso the in zzso translated zzso was 37 zzso zzso was recognized by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of new diabetes zzso but only zzso of healthy zzso Only zzso zzso binding zzso failed to bind zzso whereas zzso binding zzso did not bind zzso zzso zzso was not fully displaced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso 27, 80, or 160 zzso acids of zzso decreased zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This new zzso zzso is likely to be the precursor to the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is structurally related to zzso but has distinct diabetes zzso zzso located at the C zzso
