A newly discovered zzso zzso strain zzso differed significantly from strains zzso and zzso the previously described zzso zzso which grew on nitrate but not on zzso In contrast, strain zzso did not zzso nitrate but grew on zzso with either zzso or zzso serving as the electron zzso and even preferred zzso Both zzso and zzso reduction were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso on its cell wall, zzso compounds commonly used by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso provided zzso zzso of zzso that supported cell zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso was zzso from strains zzso and zzso strain zzso grew on different electron donors and electron zzso and fell within the zzso group of the zzso whereas zzso and zzso fell together in the zzso of the zzso Together, these results suggest that organisms spread among diverse bacterial zzso can use zzso as a terminal electron zzso and that zzso zzso reduction might occur in the zzso zone at zzso zzso of environmental zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso is a new species of the zzso zzso and zzso the name zzso zzso is zzso
