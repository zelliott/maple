We developed a new simple zzso zzso DNA extraction zzso based on a modified alkaline zzso method, using only one zzso zzso zzso zzso In this method, cell zzso zzso by alkaline and zzso zzso are performed on only one zzso zzso zzso After washing out zzso or other zzso zzso DNA is zzso by zzso strength solution, although zzso zzso DNA is not zzso The zzso prepared by this method can be applied to sequencing reactions or restriction zzso zzso
