zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein originally isolated from freshwater zzso algae zzso zzso has been reported to have potent zzso zzso In this paper, we described the expression and zzso of zzso zzso gene in zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso in shake flask cultures was primarily expressed either in the form of inclusion bodies at zzso or in the soluble fraction at zzso zzso a zzso zzso based on zzso zzso was employed and 15 zzso of highly zzso zzso zzso from zzso of cell cultures was zzso The zzso zzso was then subjected to zzso analysis for protein zzso In conclusion, for the first time, the zzso was successfully cloned and expressed in zzso which is useful for further study and large-scale cost-effective production of zzso zzso
