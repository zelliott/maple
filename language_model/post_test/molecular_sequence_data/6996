The zzso protein of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso confirmed the first 22 zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso has zzso and zzso activities which catalyze the synthesis of zzso from zzso via an zzso zzso We present evidence that the transfer of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso proceeds via an zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso were zzso Treatment of inactive zzso with zzso restored approximately zzso of the zzso and zzso activities, indicating the involvement of zzso groups in zzso zzso The zzso zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso abolished both zzso zzso Native zzso protein was a zzso zzso 40 zzso that functioned zzso at pH zzso and 37 degrees zzso zzso and kinetic parameters for both activities were zzso The preferred zzso zzso for this zzso was zzso In zzso experiments are consistent with previous genetic studies which had suggested that zzso was the preferred zzso of zzso and that zzso functioned more efficiently in the absence of zzso
