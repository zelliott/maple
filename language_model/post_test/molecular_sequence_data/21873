The zzso position of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated on the basis of gene order data from completely zzso bacterial zzso Gene order data can be an excellent source of zzso zzso Shared gene arrangements are unlikely to have arisen by chance zzso They are likely to reflect common zzso zzso zzso was found to share three gene arrangements that are present uniquely in zzso of members of the zzso zzso indicating convincingly that zzso zzso is a member of this zzso zzso orders within the zzso zzso were zzso by identifying zzso groups of species, which were circumscribed by characteristic gene zzso The branching orders thus zzso were in good agreement with previously reported zzso based on single zzso zzso gene sequences and on multiple protein zzso The gene order comparisons revealed a close zzso affinity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
