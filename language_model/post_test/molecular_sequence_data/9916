zzso of the zzso sequences of the left arms of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso They exhibit a characteristic mosaic pattern of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso extends over the zzso site and zzso zzso 5 to 9, rep and the 3' part of zzso zzso Two major zzso regions were zzso One is found between the zzso and zzso zzso the other spans the region of promoters and the zzso zzso Variations in the region of the zzso which is involved in the choice between a zzso and a zzso zzso and some zzso in the zzso coding sequences are probably responsible for the observed immunity differences between the two zzso zzso in the distribution of consensus sequences for an integration host factor zzso and zzso sites and promoters are zzso These data offer an explanation of the relationship between three types of zzso zzso It allows in turn a final settlement of the nomenclature variation in the zzso The results zzso which are similar to those obtained for other zzso groups, suggest that the mosaic structure of zzso zzso is a normal outcome of zzso zzso
