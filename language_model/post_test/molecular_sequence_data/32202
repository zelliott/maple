The zzso are a group of rare zzso disorders that are caused by zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso are found only in 50% of patients with clinically diagnosed zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the structural effect of zzso zzso on zzso in order to gain better understanding of the impact of zzso zzso on protein zzso 

We tested for zzso zzso in 22 patients with zzso zzso inflammatory zzso infantile zzso zzso zzso syndrome, 12 with zzso syndrome zzso 18 with familial zzso zzso syndrome zzso and 3 zzso with zzso In a subset of zzso patients, we screened for zzso in proteins that are either zzso to zzso or involved in the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso and other candidate genes were zzso models of zzso zzso were constructed using structurally zzso proteins as templates, and zzso zzso were zzso 

Forty patients were zzso positive, and 7 novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in 9 zzso No zzso in any candidate genes were zzso Most zzso mapped to an inner surface of the zzso ring in the zzso model, consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso disrupt a closed form of zzso thus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with disease severity only for a subset of known zzso 

Our modeling provides insight into potential molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso can inappropriately activate an inflammatory zzso A significant number of patients who are clinically diagnosed as having zzso do not have identifiable zzso zzso
