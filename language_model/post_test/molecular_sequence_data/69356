Although specific binding sites for zzso hormone zzso and its zzso have been demonstrated in biopsy samples of human zzso cancer, their biological significance remains zzso In this study we evaluated whether binding sites for zzso are also present in the human zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and if such sites could mediate zzso effects of zzso zzso Using zzso as a zzso a high zzso capacity binding site was detected in both zzso zzso line, zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding capacity zzso zzso 78 zzso zzso zzso line, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso In addition, a second class of low zzso capacity binding sites for zzso was demonstrated zzso line, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso Ishikawa, zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso and zzso cell lines was significantly reduced to 76 zzso zzso and 88 zzso zzso of controls, respectively, after 24 h and to 64 zzso zzso and 62 zzso zzso respectively, after 6 zzso zzso experiments showed that lower zzso zzso zzso of the zzso decreased the proliferation to 80 zzso zzso for the zzso line and 71 zzso zzso of controls for the zzso line after 6 zzso zzso effects are enhanced by increasing the doses of zzso and were zzso in this series of experiments at zzso zzso the proliferation in the zzso line being 62 zzso zzso and in the zzso line 52 zzso zzso of controls, zzso Similar zzso and zzso zzso effects were obtained in both cell lines with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso can directly inhibit the proliferation of human zzso cancer cells in zzso This direct action could be zzso through the high affinity zzso binding zzso
