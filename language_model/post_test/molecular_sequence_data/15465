Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso isolated from a zzso soil collected from the zzso valley, zzso northern Norway, have been characterized zzso using a zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the two zzso zzso formed a distinct zzso line within the zzso zzso of the order zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that strains zzso and zzso are closely related zzso % zzso and belong to the same species, although they show slightly different colony zzso The closest zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with 96 % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso growth of zzso and zzso occurred zzso in the absence of zzso but both zzso tolerated up to 2 % zzso zzso in the growth zzso Growth under zzso conditions was slow and zzso The zzso of both zzso was of the zzso type with zzso as the zzso acid and zzso as a component of the zzso bridge with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids present in both zzso were zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso were present at exceptionally low levels in both zzso and only zzso zzso could be identified with any degree of zzso zzso analysis and differences in zzso and zzso characteristics between the strains and zzso zzso zzso indicate that these zzso belong to a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
