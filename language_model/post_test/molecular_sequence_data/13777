The regulation of the gene expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated in a zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso When zzso zzso cells were cultured with transforming growth factor zzso zzso binding sites increased with increasing dose of zzso These binding sites were identified as zzso by a displacement experiment with zzso zzso zzso and by the affinity zzso of the zzso binding sites with a chemical zzso to determine the molecular weight of the zzso This zzso of the zzso expression was zzso to occur at the zzso level by Northern zzso experiment, comparison of the relative amounts of zzso by reverse zzso zzso and in zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso biological zzso zzso and zzso was shown to be zzso by zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates the gene expression of zzso in the zzso zzso cells and that zzso and zzso might affect the zzso zzso cell zzso
