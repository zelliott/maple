We describe the crystal structure of human zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso that was recently found to be highly zzso in human zzso zzso To characterize zzso with respect to zzso properties and zzso structure, we cloned the respective zzso zzso the protein in zzso coli and zzso it to zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso steps with a yield of 30 zzso zzso The zzso protein revealed a zzso higher affinity for zzso acid than for zzso and zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso human zzso was determined to zzso A and refined to an zzso of zzso The initial residual electron density maps clearly showed the presence of a zzso which was identified as zzso bacterial fatty zzso Within a central cavity of 252 zzso this zzso is bound in a zzso zzso its zzso group interacting with zzso 131 and zzso 129 and zzso the latter via an ordered water zzso The zzso crystal structure is unique in the zzso family because of the presence of a zzso bridge between zzso 120 and zzso that may be zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso 67 and 87 are also in close vicinity but in contrast do not form a zzso zzso We zzso that this protein belongs to a particular zzso zzso whose members share common structural as well as functional zzso
