The zzso gene clusters of zzso zzso are zzso by various different repetitive DNA zzso A specific zzso the zzso element, has been mapped by Southern analysis and some of its locations have been subsequently confirmed by zzso zzso zzso family members seem to represent mobile genetic elements and display a high degree of zzso The zzso sequences upstream to the adult beta zzso gene and to the two zzso expressed zzso beta zzso and beta zzso genes have been determined and compared to those of the adult zzso Besides some repetitive DNA elements and a short sequence of rather weak zzso we have found no characteristic sequence motifs to be common to the adult zzso and zzso The two zzso zzso share one short sequence element being absent from the adult zzso This might reflect completely different sequence requirements for protein interactions and for the regulation of adult and zzso zzso gene zzso
