To isolate and characterize zzso zzso produced by a zzso isolated from a soil sample associated with the roots of a medicinal plant, zzso zzso 

zzso cultural, zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso showed zzso similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso isolated from the fermented broth was characterized as zzso zzso It showed high activity against various zzso and zzso bacterial cultures, zzso tuberculosis zzso and human zzso cells in zzso using standard zzso 

The isolated strain zzso zzso produced zzso predominantly (210 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso under zzso growth zzso 

zzso zzso may be exploited as a potential source for the commercial production of zzso as this strain is not reported to produce zzso Further investigations on the strain for commercial application will be of immense pharmaceutical zzso
