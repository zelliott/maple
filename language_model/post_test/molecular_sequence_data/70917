The in zzso metabolism of the newly identified zzso zzso for the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso was studied using zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso mass zzso The results show that zzso is zzso zzso in zzso into fragments zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso and zzso fragments have the same zzso zzso suggesting that this is a motif recognized by an zzso which fragments the zzso in two consecutive zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into rat zzso had no effect on spatial learning or motor function under conditions where zzso is active, showing that this zzso conversion reduces affinity for the zzso
