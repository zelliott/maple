zzso zzso zzso the unrelated zzso zzso In this paper we show that this is due to the zzso of the zzso late promoter zzso by the zzso Cox zzso This is in contrast to the effects of Cox on zzso for which it is known from previous work that it acts as a zzso of the promoter zzso which is responsible for expression of the immunity zzso zzso The zzso role of Cox was revealed by its effect on replication of zzso DNA and on the formation of zzso zzso when a zzso cat gene was inserted downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I protection studies revealed that the Cox protein binds to the zzso promoter zzso of zzso zzso and to the promoter zzso of zzso zzso In the latter case the Cox protein binds upstream of the zzso region, in zzso to several other zzso of zzso A weak binding was found in the promoters zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The Cox protein is a case of viral zzso of the replication genes of one zzso by a control protein of the zzso However, the effects of the Cox protein are totally different in the two zzso repressive in one case and zzso in the zzso
