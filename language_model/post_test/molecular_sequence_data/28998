The DNA zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso product of the interaction between zzso oxygen species and zzso To maintain zzso integrity, cells have evolved mechanisms capable of removing this frequently arising zzso zzso zzso repair zzso appears to be one zzso associated with the repair of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Buckley, zzso zzso Kidd, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cutler, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Nelson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso Cell 4, zzso Here we report the effect of zzso DNA zzso containing a single zzso on the DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso right zzso zzso exchange activities of zzso and zzso We found that zzso binds the zzso DNA zzso with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso A similar trend was observed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exchange activities of zzso In contrast, zzso did not appear to bind any of the zzso containing DNA zzso nor was there enhanced zzso or zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso These results suggest that only zzso is activated by recognition of zzso zzso Our data are consistent with the notion that zzso zzso only zzso in the repair of mismatched zzso zzso
