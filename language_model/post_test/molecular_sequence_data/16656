To identify zzso zzso in the zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso genes and to characterize the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso genes were screened by direct sequencing for zzso in 216 patients and zzso patients, respectively, with various zzso retinal zzso A zzso in zzso segregating with zzso dominant cone zzso was further evaluated zzso by employing zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and limited zzso in the absence and presence of zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso 143 by zzso and zzso affecting the zzso zzso loop, was identified in a zzso father and son with zzso dominant cone zzso Both patients had much greater loss of cone function versus rod zzso previous zzso evaluation of the father's eyes at autopsy (age 75 zzso showed no zzso cones but a few, scattered cones remaining in the peripheral zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso adopted a zzso susceptible to zzso and the zzso inhibited zzso only partially at high zzso zzso Individual patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso had additional zzso zzso and zzso gene changes zzso and zzso of unknown zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso caused a form of zzso dominant cone zzso that destroys zzso cones by zzso but spares some cones in the peripheral zzso up to 75 zzso Properties of the zzso zzso protein suggested that it is incompletely zzso by high zzso zzso as should occur with dark zzso The continued activity of the zzso zzso likely results in higher-than-normal zzso zzso levels which may, in turn, account for the progressive loss of zzso
