A complete protocol for the expression of zzso zzso c genes from zzso zzso zzso and rat in a zzso strain, zzso which does not express its own zzso c is zzso The construction of the expression zzso transformation and large-scale growth of the zzso and preparation and zzso of the zzso zzso c are zzso It was found that, contrary to the way zzso zzso its own zzso zzso the zzso proteins were partially zzso at their zzso except for the zzso zzso which remained entirely zzso Furthermore, the zzso and rat proteins were close to fully zzso at zzso 72, while the zzso protein could be separated zzso into forms containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 72 showing corresponding zzso in the zzso zzso These observations emphasize that, in employing expression procedures to obtain native or zzso forms of zzso zzso it is essential to identify the variety and extent of zzso modifications and to separate the preparation into pure zzso zzso Otherwise, it may become impossible to distinguish between the influence of a zzso zzso and unexamined zzso zzso
