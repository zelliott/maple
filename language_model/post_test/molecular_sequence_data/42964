zzso of cardiac zzso C zzso and fast skeletal muscle zzso C zzso genes during development was analyzed by in zzso zzso and Northern zzso At zzso stage 14, zzso zzso was detected in zzso At stage 20, zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in embryonic zzso at the other zzso zzso This suggested that zzso of zzso zzso at stage 20 was stage and zzso At early stage 10, zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso veins at the zzso region where right and left veins zzso from zzso In the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso was transcribed in both the zzso and zzso walls of the zzso The area of zzso gene expression in zzso vein is wider than those of zzso and smooth muscle zzso genes zzso and Schwartz, zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso plays an important role relating embryonic zzso in the wider area including zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified also in zzso embryonic breast muscle and adult breast zzso Since zzso protein was zzso in adult breast muscle by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso the imbalance of zzso zzso and protein levels suggested the operation of specific mechanisms that separately regulated the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
