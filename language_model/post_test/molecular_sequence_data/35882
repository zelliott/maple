zzso experiments suggested previously that protein binding to the DNA zzso sequence zzso identical to the zzso element of the zzso zzso plays an important role in the early development of the zzso We established from a series of overlapping mouse zzso clones the sequence of a candidate zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli of a fusion protein which binds specifically the zzso box in zzso confirmed its zzso On the other hand, the translated zzso zzso acid sequence shows two regions with high degrees of similarity to the protein precursor zzso of the zzso zzso that accumulates in the brain and blood vessels of zzso zzso A continuous stretch of 195 zzso acids includes 133 zzso identical to part of the zzso domain of zzso and 48 of the 70 zzso zzso of the open reading frame are identical to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
