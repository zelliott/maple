The zzso domain of the largest zzso of zzso zzso II in higher zzso is present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a strongly modified zzso To determine whether this is a general feature of the zzso and to determine the role of this domain in zzso zzso II transcription, we have zzso the zzso domain of the zzso related species zzso zzso No zzso identity of zzso acid zzso between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso Moreover, both zzso lack the zzso repeat structure present in higher zzso The two zzso are, however, very similar in zzso acid zzso being rich in zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso The latter observation is compatible with the concept that in zzso zzso of the zzso activates zzso zzso zzso
