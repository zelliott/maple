zzso which is abundant in zzso and many other zzso is known to play an important role in electron transfer, oxygen zzso regulation of gene zzso and many other biological zzso With the belief that the zzso of zzso peptides forming higher order zzso is one of the central pathological pathways in Alzheimer's disease, the formation of the zzso complex is essential as it zzso zzso zzso and protects the zzso from zzso In our studies, conventional molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the 1 zzso + 1 zzso and 2 zzso + 4 zzso system, respectively, with the identification of several dominant binding zzso We found that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have a high affinity to interact with zzso instead of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso interaction plays a dominant role in the zzso complex formation which indirectly serves to physically prevent zzso zzso
