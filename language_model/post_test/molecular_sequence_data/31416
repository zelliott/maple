In zzso and in some crops, zzso is prevalent and has been widely used in breeding to produce excellent zzso However, the molecular basis of zzso in zzso remains zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso factor family, has been suggested to be involved in zzso in zzso zzso Here, the function and regulation of zzso were further zzso zzso of zzso led to markedly enlarged zzso and zzso traits in zzso Fresh weight of leaves was almost twice as great as in zzso zzso Likewise, seed yield of zzso individual plants was zzso greater than that of control zzso The enlarged zzso and zzso traits displayed by zzso plants were mainly due to enhanced cell proliferation and prolonged growth zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso plants, suggesting an important molecular role of zzso in regulating plant organ zzso These findings provide new insights into the formation of zzso in woody plants and suggest that zzso has potential applications in breeding high-yielding crops and energy zzso In addition, 50 zzso zzso factors, including zzso in zzso were identified by zzso sequencing, and zzso analysis was zzso This provided information that will be important in further revealing the functions of these zzso zzso
