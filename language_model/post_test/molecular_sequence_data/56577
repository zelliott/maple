Recent research on various zzso channel proteins have revealed that they can be classified into several groups of zzso from their structural zzso Among them, the zzso zzso channel zzso including zzso zzso and zzso consist of four zzso functional units of six zzso zzso Site directed zzso applied on those proteins revealed that the 4th segment works as the zzso sensor and the zzso zzso between 5th and 6th segments forms the pore structure passing zzso On the other hand, the zzso operated zzso channel zzso including zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso is composed of five zzso which are also zzso Each zzso contains a large zzso zzso domain which binds zzso and/or competitive blockers, followed by four zzso zzso The 2nd segment zzso of each zzso lines the internal surface of the channel pore as suggested from zzso studies with zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are also zzso in their structure and are thus classified as a family catalyzing zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso operated zzso channel of zzso rod zzso and zzso operated zzso channel of zzso zzso are composed of almost identical zzso which contains the remnant of the zzso sensor zzso zzso of these channel proteins may provide valuable clues to further understanding the zzso relationships at molecular zzso
