The zzso zzso zzso zzso 121 produces two zzso zzso a zzso and an zzso Although these two zzso zzso share high sequence zzso they differ significantly in the type and size distribution of zzso products zzso from zzso and in their activity zzso In order to examine the contribution of specific zzso acids to such differences, 15 single and four multiple zzso zzso were designed that affected zzso that are zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso The effects of the zzso were interpreted using the zzso structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso mostly zzso up to a degree of zzso of 15 and relatively low amounts of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso produces mainly zzso zzso and zzso with a degree of zzso zzso zzso Although most of the zzso zzso in this study behaved similarly to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso at the rim of the active site pocket in loop zzso increased the zzso activity zzso without significantly changing the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which included two zzso from the zzso loop zzso zzso zzso only, but at low zzso zzso zzso located behind the general zzso increased the zzso activity two to zzso zzso zzso located adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in synthesis of not such a wide variety of zzso than the zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that the product specificity of zzso is easily altered by protein engineering, obtaining zzso zzso with higher zzso zzso higher zzso rates and different zzso size zzso without changing the zzso linkage type in the zzso
