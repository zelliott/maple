The zzso protein zzso is zzso to a variety of proteins including Ran zzso protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins display altered zzso targeting and/or zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso from human cells and shown that it contains two zzso of 38 and 72 zzso Isolation of zzso for each zzso indicates that they are zzso to zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of catalyzing the zzso formation of a zzso linkage between zzso and zzso The addition of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in efficient transfer of the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was efficiently zzso to the protein zzso zzso As zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all zzso zzso zzso it appears that zzso zzso of zzso in zzso does not require the equivalent of an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso
