zzso zzso a zzso zzso is one of the dominant zzso species found in zzso zzso forest fragments, where it is locally specialized on zzso zzso We examined the genetic structure of zzso zzso populations from four Panamanian zzso forests using zzso zzso Using five primer pair combinations, 145 zzso were zzso zzso of which were zzso Each of the populations showed a high degree of genetic diversity zzso h ranging from zzso to zzso zzso from minimum spanning trees and Mantel tests showed little evidence for small-scale spatial structure within zzso A significant amount of total genetic variation was zzso among populations zzso zzso zzso separated by zzso to zzso of zzso a considerably greater amount than has been detected in other mushroom and zzso zzso sampled at equal or greater geographic zzso These results suggest that despite production of copious zzso capable of long distance zzso some zzso zzso may be susceptible to genetic isolation due to habitat zzso
