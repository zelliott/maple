The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso A zzso was determined by solution nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso alpha zzso cross at an angle of zzso degrees and form a small but zzso interface that lacks zzso hydrogen zzso The structure provides an explanation for the previously characterized sequence dependence of zzso zzso and demonstrates that van der zzso interactions alone can mediate stable and specific associations between zzso zzso
