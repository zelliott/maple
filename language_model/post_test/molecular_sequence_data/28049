zzso human tissue zzso zzso zzso produced by expression in Chinese zzso zzso cells, is a zzso zzso zzso which has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of zzso zzso In this study, the structures of the zzso zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso have been zzso High zzso and hybrid zzso were released from the protein by zzso H zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso were released by zzso F zzso The zzso were zzso by gel zzso zzso and zzso exchange high performance liquid zzso zzso and their structures were analyzed by composition and zzso analysis, high pH zzso exchange zzso fast atom zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso High zzso zzso were found to account for 38% of the total zzso content of zzso and consisted of zzso zzso and zzso in the ratio zzso Two hybrid zzso were identified and accounted for zzso of the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso were found to comprise zzso zzso of total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso was by alpha zzso linkages to zzso Most zzso than zzso of the zzso structures contained zzso alpha zzso linked to the zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso structures at individual zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also zzso zzso exists as two zzso that differ by the presence zzso I) or absence zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso were isolated by reversed phase high performance liquid zzso and treated with zzso zzso The zzso released from each zzso site were analyzed by high pH zzso exchange zzso By this analysis, zzso was demonstrated to carry exclusively high zzso zzso When zzso zzso carried zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the ratio zzso zzso zzso carried the same types of zzso but in the ratio zzso The zzso of zzso zzso at positions 117 and zzso were found not to be affected by the presence or absence of zzso at position zzso The relevance of the
