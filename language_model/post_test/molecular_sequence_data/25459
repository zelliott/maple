Human zzso zzso cells in culture zzso at least three related zzso that digest zzso zzso zzso One of them, termed zzso zzso 2 zzso has been zzso as an inactive zzso zzso The final product is homogeneous on zzso with Mr zzso 72,000 under reducing zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is zzso which is identical to that of the so-called zzso type IV zzso The zzso can be rapidly activated by zzso zzso to an active form of zzso with Mr zzso zzso and the new zzso generated is zzso However, following zzso zzso zzso zzso is gradually zzso by zzso Nine zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G, zzso zzso 3, and zzso were tested for their abilities to activate zzso but none had this zzso This contrasts with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The optimal activity of zzso against zzso is around pH zzso but about 50% of activity is retained at pH zzso zzso activity is inhibited by zzso zzso or tissue inhibitor of zzso but not by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen type zzso and to a lesser extent type IV zzso cartilage zzso and zzso Comparative studies on zzso of collagen types IV and V by zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso degrades type IV collagen more readily than zzso while zzso zzso type V collagen zzso zzso studies of zzso using cultured human zzso zzso zzso indicated that the production of both zzso and zzso is negligible but it is greatly enhanced by the treatment with zzso zzso whereas the synthesis of zzso is zzso expressed by these cells and is not significantly affected by the zzso This suggests that the zzso and/or pathological role of zzso and its site of action may be different from those of zzso and zzso
