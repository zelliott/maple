zzso plasmids are known to facilitate the acquisition and zzso of genes contributing to the fitness of zzso zzso Here, we report the characterization of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a plant zzso used in the United States for the biological control of fire blight disease of pear and zzso zzso of the 67 open reading frames zzso of zzso have putative functions in zzso including a type IV zzso system related to that of zzso family plasmids and a gene cluster for type IV zzso We demonstrate that zzso is zzso via zzso between zzso and strains of zzso zzso or the zzso The origin of zzso replication zzso of zzso is typical of those in zzso family zzso which are present in many zzso of zzso zzso but zzso lacks zzso a defining locus for zzso zzso and has a novel zzso zzso We selected a zzso zzso of zzso and compared it to the wild type to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance, presumably due to the zzso zzso zzso but did not influence zzso fitness of zzso on pear or apple blossoms in the zzso zzso does not appear to zzso resistance to antibiotics or other toxic zzso Based on the zzso nature of zzso and the large number of its genes that are shared with plasmids from diverse groups of environmental bacteria, the zzso is likely to serve as a vehicle for genetic exchange between zzso and its zzso on plant zzso
