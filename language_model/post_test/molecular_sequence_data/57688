The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated on the basis of a zzso zzso showing high levels of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Following analysis of two dissimilar zzso isolated from the zzso we report that zzso zzso extensive alternative zzso at two locations in the putative zzso zzso At each location a choice is made between zzso of the same size: zzso or zzso zzso zzso acids long with two zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso long with 10 zzso The function of these alternative zzso remains zzso however, zzso d contains a putative site for zzso zzso II zzso All possible combinations of zzso (a with c or d and b with c or zzso were found in zzso isolated from early zzso This is the first demonstration of alternative zzso in a zzso zzso gene from zzso
