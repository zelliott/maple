zzso disorders that disturb speech and language are highly zzso Isolation of the underlying genetic risk factors has been hampered by complexity of the zzso and potentially large number of contributing zzso One exception is the identification of rare zzso zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso syndrome zzso by impaired sequencing of zzso zzso zzso speech zzso verbal zzso zzso as well as multiple deficits in expressive and receptive zzso The protein zzso by zzso belongs to a divergent zzso of zzso zzso factors, with a distinctive zzso domain and motifs that mediate zzso and zzso zzso the most closely related member of this zzso can directly interact with zzso and is zzso in neural structures relevant to speech and language zzso Moreover, investigations of zzso zzso indicate that zzso actions of the two proteins may play important roles in vocal learning, leading to the suggestion that human zzso should be considered a strong candidate for involvement in zzso Thus, in this study, we screened the entire coding region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso changes in a panel of zzso used earlier to detect novel zzso in zzso A zzso coding change was identified in a single zzso yielding a zzso change zzso However, this was also found in a random control zzso zzso of zzso zzso changes did not find any correlation with affection zzso We conclude that zzso zzso are unlikely to represent a major cause of zzso
