We have previously shown that zzso zzso factors, regulate cell growth and zzso and zzso and zzso are able to zzso regulate zzso zzso gene zzso In the present study we show that the zzso zzso factors also play a role in regulating expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso growth arrest and zzso in response to stress signals or DNA zzso We report the presence of a single zzso in the human zzso promoter, and that the zzso gene promoter lacks zzso The zzso promoter zzso shows a very high affinity for zzso and zzso gene zzso In addition, our data show that both zzso and zzso strongly activate zzso of the zzso zzso linked to the zzso reporter zzso Our results also demonstrate how zzso and zzso specifically regulate zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso protein expression resulted in only a weak induction of the same zzso reporter zzso The zzso and zzso proteins provide a novel mechanism of zzso for zzso allowing these two zzso genes to control its expression during cell growth and zzso rather than in response to zzso zzso
