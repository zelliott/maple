We report a novel zzso point zzso zzso in the gene for zzso zzso in a patient with progressive external zzso complicated by zzso respiratory zzso zzso analysis of respiratory chain complexes in muscle zzso showed a combined complex I and IV zzso The transition does not represent a known neutral zzso and affects a position in the zzso zzso stem which is zzso in zzso leading to a zzso of this functionally important zzso In zzso analysis of an essential maturation step of the zzso transcript indicates the probable zzso of this zzso We zzso that there is a zzso relationship between the novel zzso transition and progressive external zzso with zzso respiratory failure due to a depressed respiratory zzso
