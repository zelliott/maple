The machinery that zzso zzso zzso proteins into the inner membrane and zzso their zzso zzso through the membrane is poorly zzso We have developed a genetic screen for zzso zzso zzso defective in this export zzso The screen is based on the fact that the zzso zzso zzso is exported from the zzso if it is zzso within zzso as a zzso zzso fusion zzso Since export of zzso causes an zzso zzso defective zzso can be selected as zzso Here we show that zzso in the nuclear gene zzso block the zzso of zzso zzso fusion proteins across the inner zzso zzso is a zzso integral inner membrane protein that appears to have two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a central zzso zzso zzso While an zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso was more sensitive to zzso than the wild type was, it was zzso competent and able to export zzso zzso However, deletion of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso caused a clear zzso zzso absence of zzso zzso activity, and a zzso in the assembly of zzso that appears to be due to a block of zzso zzso Since zzso was previously described as a gene affecting resistance to the zzso zzso our data support a zzso target for this zzso
