Two zzso conditions, familial British zzso zzso and familial Danish zzso zzso are associated with zzso deposition in the central nervous system and zzso The two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are degradation products of the same precursor zzso zzso bearing different genetic zzso namely a zzso zzso in zzso and a zzso zzso immediately before the stop zzso in zzso Both de zzso created zzso peptides have the same length zzso zzso zzso and the same zzso modification zzso at their zzso zzso zzso containing the classical paired zzso filaments as well as zzso components in many instances zzso with the zzso zzso In both disorders, the pattern of zzso zzso zzso is almost indistinguishable from that seen in Alzheimer's zzso These issues argue for the primary importance of the zzso deposits in the zzso of zzso cell zzso We propose zzso and zzso the zzso 13 zzso zzso as models to study the molecular basis of zzso zzso cell death and zzso formation in the zzso
