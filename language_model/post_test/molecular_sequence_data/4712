A 300 zzso zzso from zzso 6 of the white gene of zzso zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso zzso zzso One positive zzso 14 zzso insert contained zzso 2-6 of white by zzso and zzso acid sequence similarity to the white genes of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso & Mount, zzso Lucilia zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso A white zzso zzso zzso containing zzso 1, 2 and part of zzso 3 was zzso cloned and zzso An inverse zzso zzso of zzso DNA was generated, containing the zzso 1 coding region plus approximately zzso zzso of upstream zzso encompassing the putative promoter of the zzso zzso 1 was found to be zzso zzso long, zzso the first zzso zzso zzso The full length of zzso 1 was shown to be 12 zzso zzso using long zzso zzso up to 3 times the length of the longest white zzso 1 isolated to zzso
