We report here the isolation in zzso zzso zzso of an zzso protein zzso named zzso characterized by zzso zzso tandem repeats of 11 zzso alpha beta motifs zzso the structural scaffold characteristic of zzso zzso and scorpion zzso zzso zzso were only found in zzso species, suggesting that this new protein family (named zzso is specific to this insect zzso Moreover, zzso analysis suggests that zzso proteins represent a new class of proteins restricted to zzso and likely derived from zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of gene expression revealed that zzso is rapidly induced by zzso However, and zzso to what is known for most insect zzso peptides zzso zzso is mainly expressed in blood zzso Moreover, zzso zzso produced in the zzso cell line does not show any zzso zzso Altogether, these results suggest that although zzso proteins are derived from zzso they may play a different and still unknown role in zzso immune zzso
