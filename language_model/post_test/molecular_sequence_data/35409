The zzso peptides of zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso play a key role in their recognition by the specific zzso zzso zzso to launch their transfer through the respective zzso zzso thus zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso a zzso regulating the activity of zzso zzso zzso only differ by one zzso at their zzso yet each has its specific E1 for the zzso zzso It has been reported recently that zzso can cross react with zzso to enable its passage through the zzso transfer cascade for protein zzso To zzso differences in zzso recognition by zzso and zzso we carried out zzso selection of a zzso library with zzso zzso sequences based on the zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso Our results confirmed the previous finding that zzso 72 of zzso plays a zzso role in E1 zzso We also found that diverse sequences zzso zzso 72 at the zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso for zzso zzso zzso peptides derived from the zzso sequences of zzso zzso selected for zzso zzso can function as mimics of zzso to form zzso zzso with zzso and the downstream zzso zzso zzso in the zzso transfer zzso Once the peptides are charged onto the cascade zzso the full-length zzso protein is effectively blocked from passing through the cascade for the critical modification of zzso We have thus identified a new class of zzso of protein zzso based on the profiles of the zzso zzso sequences recognized by zzso
