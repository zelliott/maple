zzso zzso zzso and zzso bearing a zzso zzso group can effectively and selectively modify a zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso derivatives of zzso complementary to DNA sequences adjacent to the binding site of the zzso The zzso investigated modify not only zzso but also zzso DNA zzso The modification extent depends on the length of zzso parts of the zzso and zzso A gap between the two stretches associated with the target DNA prevents the zzso from zzso The substitution of an zzso zzso by two zzso ones only slightly reduces the modification extent with a zzso zzso A very efficient and specific modification can be achieved by using two zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The approach leads to the modification extent of up to zzso with a zzso zzso
