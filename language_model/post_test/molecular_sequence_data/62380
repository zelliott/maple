The final resolution of sister zzso cohesion during zzso and zzso divisions is zzso by zzso of zzso which zzso a zzso complex zzso The structural basis of zzso regulation is zzso zzso from different zzso share almost no sequence zzso especially within the large zzso domain that precedes the zzso domain except in zzso zzso Moreover, sequence similarity among zzso zzso which associate as regulatory zzso with zzso is restricted to the signals that promote the zzso degradation required for zzso zzso Here, we address the surprising divergence of zzso and zzso zzso The absence of an extended zzso zzso domain in zzso species is shown to be correlated with the expression of an extra regulatory zzso zzso The interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are analogous to those of the human zzso zzso domain with its zzso domain and zzso Even zzso interactions between zzso and human zzso complex components occur in zzso zzso zzso zzso structure predictions reveal zzso zzso folds in both zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of these folds with a wide range of primary sequences has likely allowed the rapid divergence of zzso zzso sequences and zzso which contact this zzso
