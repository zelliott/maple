Two zzso zzso zzso bacterial strains designated zzso and zzso were isolated from the water of a zzso artificial lake in zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that both strains could be assigned to the zzso zzso strain zzso appeared most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas strain zzso appeared most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso G zzso whereas those of zzso were summed feature 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso evidence indicates that strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
