zzso zzso zzso protein involved in the control of zzso a zzso with a molecular mass of around 160 zzso is associated with the nuclear envelope and the zzso zzso The most noteworthy zzso of zzso deletion zzso is a decrease in viability and an increased number of zzso in the surviving cells zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso zzso contains 14 zzso zzso zzso motifs that have lately been identified in a variety of zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that the zzso sequence shows nearly perfect zzso with the putative gene product of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso as well as with the zzso zzso zzso proteins with a cellular location similar to that of zzso Moreover, we found that zzso contains a potential zzso signal zzso near its zzso and a potential zzso signal zzso between zzso zzso 3 and zzso To determine whether the protein is able to bind to zzso we zzso zzso from zzso cell extract by zzso and zzso affinity zzso In northwestern zzso experiments, the zzso homogeneous protein bound to zzso and zzso zzso as well as to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the major part of zzso is membrane associated via zzso interactions and can be released from the membrane fraction under conditions that lead to a zzso of zzso Together, our findings suggest that zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso and point to a role for zzso in nuclear zzso export or in zzso transport within the zzso
