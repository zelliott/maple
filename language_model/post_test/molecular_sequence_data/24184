zzso form a zzso of zzso plasma zzso proteins of unknown structure and zzso Using specific zzso we localized tomato zzso 1 to zzso zzso leaf zzso and vascular zzso The deduced zzso protein sequence contains a predicted coiled zzso suggesting its participation in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso potato zzso contains an zzso region that forms a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso preparations of four different zzso zzso one from zzso two divergent zzso from tomato, and one from zzso zzso , demonstrated that the proteins form highly similar zzso zzso The diameters of the zzso filaments ranged from zzso zzso for potato zzso 1, zzso zzso for tomato zzso 1, zzso zzso for tomato zzso 2, and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 was detected in zzso tomato plasma membrane preparations and a population of the protein was zzso in tomato root tips to structures associated with discrete regions of the plasma zzso
