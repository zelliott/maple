The zzso products of reduced native zzso and reduced zzso zzso in which zzso is converted to zzso zzso during the zzso of zzso interchange reactions at pH 8 and 37 degrees C, were zzso On zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso acid containing 4 M zzso two zzso appeared in the zzso product of reduced zzso zzso while a single peak appeared in the zzso product of reduced native zzso From the analyses of the activity and primary and the zzso structures of the zzso the structure of the zzso from reduced native zzso was confirmed to be identical to that of the zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso product from reduced zzso zzso had the same primary structure but a different zzso structure compared to the zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso product from the reduced zzso zzso was changed to that of the zzso one by the zzso treatment under zzso zzso However, the zzso species was barely changed to that of the zzso one by incubation under zzso zzso zzso the zzso product from reduced zzso zzso was suggested to be a zzso and zzso trapped product in the zzso process of reduced zzso zzso In addition, an interaction involving the folding process of reduced zzso was discussed on the basis of the zzso analyses of the zzso zzso
