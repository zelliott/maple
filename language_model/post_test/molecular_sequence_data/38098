A sensitive and selective method for the determination of zzso in human plasma is described using zzso as an internal zzso After protein zzso with zzso acid, the zzso were isolated from human plasma by zzso extraction on Bond zzso zzso zzso The compounds were zzso on a zzso zzso column zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 5 zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso mass zzso in the positive zzso mode using the zzso zzso The lower limit of zzso was 5 zzso zzso of human zzso Linear zzso zzso were obtained over the concentration range zzso zzso zzso of human zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and the accuracy was zzso over the entire concentration zzso During the method development, the zzso efficiencies of the zzso in plasma samples originating from different sources were examined to overcome the zzso effect problems caused by zzso zzso zzso The method was successfully applied to zzso studies in human zzso
