The cloned DNA zzso of the zzso zzso gene containing the upstream region from position zzso through part of the first zzso is faithfully transcribed in zzso rat liver zzso zzso treatment of the animal zzso increases this transcription, and the increase is blocked by zzso zzso synthesis zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso This picture zzso very well with the reported zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso and zzso zzso rates in zzso under these zzso The upstream region (from position zzso was assessed for protein binding with nuclear extracts by zzso filter zzso gel zzso zzso I treatment zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso treatment dramatically increases protein binding to the upstream region, an increase once again blocked by zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso to zzso zzso and nuclear extracts restores the induced levels of zzso and protein binding to the upstream fragment, zzso Thus, zzso synthesis and zzso binding of a zzso zzso appear involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and an zzso protein may be a major factor in this zzso
