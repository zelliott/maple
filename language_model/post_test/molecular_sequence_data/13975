Human zzso band 3 zzso zzso zzso including zzso by binding these zzso zzso at its zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and there is evidence that in zzso zzso levels in zzso are regulated in part by a zzso signaling zzso The structural basis for control by zzso has been investigated by zzso studies on a complex between zzso and a synthetic zzso corresponding to the first 15 zzso of band 3 zzso The structure of this band 3 zzso zzso when it is bound to rabbit muscle zzso was determined using the zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso Two hundred zzso structures for zzso were generated by simulated zzso molecular dynamics with zzso distance restraints and excluding zzso zzso Twenty structures were further refined against a force field including full partial zzso The important zzso feature of zzso in the bound state is a folded loop structure involving zzso zzso and zzso that surrounds zzso and is stabilized by a zzso cluster with the ring of zzso sandwiched between the zzso groups of zzso and zzso zzso line broadening indicates that this loop structure binds zzso in a relatively specific manner, while terminal regions are structurally zzso To better understand zzso zzso of zzso and the mechanism of zzso control, a complex was modeled by zzso zzso into the active site of zzso and zzso the fit using restrained molecular dynamics and energy zzso The zzso loop is complementary in zzso to the zzso central core containing the zzso active site zzso zzso is zzso in nature with numerous zzso and zzso interactions involving several zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso How zzso of band 3 could disrupt zzso was considered by modeling a zzso zzso onto zzso of zzso An energetic analysis with respect to rigid zzso rotation suggests that zzso zzso is reversed primarily because of zzso zzso between zzso zzso that zzso the zzso loop formed in the zzso This proposed zzso mechanism for blocking zzso association by zzso zzso with the zzso group may be zzso to other zzso signaling zzso
