We demonstrated the presence of two zzso viruses zzso designated zzso and zzso in zzso monkeys by zzso and sequencing the entire viral coding regions from the monkey zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins shared zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso acids with zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso proteins showed that zzso and zzso resembled most zzso and zzso zzso To characterize the zzso zzso we zzso an zzso zzso with the monkey zzso zzso proteins and examined the resulting zzso zzso and zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso for their host ranges in cell lines and tissue zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells less efficiently than zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso more efficiently than differentiated ones, zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso less efficiently than differentiated zzso Three weeks after injection to the muscle of the hind legs, zzso and zzso induced zzso expression similarly, but zzso did not zzso the skeletal zzso Six weeks after systemic administration, zzso zzso DNA was detected by zzso in the liver and zzso of mice zzso with zzso in the liver, heart, muscle, zzso zzso and zzso of mice with zzso and the muscle, zzso zzso zzso heart, and stomach of mice with zzso Mouse zzso against zzso protein zzso of the three zzso neutralized the respective zzso particles in a zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are zzso distinct from each other and zzso are likely to determine their host ranges and tissue zzso that are different from zzso suggesting that zzso zzso could provide a broader choice of zzso zzso zzso for gene zzso
