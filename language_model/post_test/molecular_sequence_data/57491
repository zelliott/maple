zzso A is a zzso zzso disease caused by defects in the large and complex factor VIII zzso Recent studies examining the putative promoter, all zzso and most zzso boundaries have failed to detect zzso in half the patients with severe disease leading to hypotheses such as zzso in remote controlling regions or even in genes other than factor zzso We have amplified the factor VIII gene zzso zzso coding region and zzso signal zzso in 8 fragments from reverse transcribed zzso and zzso zzso Any zzso is then located by chemical mismatch detection and zzso by direct zzso This rapid and efficient method has been fully successful and has revealed an unusual cluster of zzso causing severe zzso Of the 28 patients we have reported, 5 had mild or moderate disease and all had a zzso zzso zzso patients were severely affected and 13 of these had different zzso zzso that were fully zzso at the zzso DNA zzso The remaining 10 patients all had zzso with zzso 22 not zzso to zzso zzso Since all zzso were normal and so were the zzso sites of zzso 22, the zzso in these patients should be in the regions of zzso 22 that were not zzso These results prove that all zzso A cases are due to zzso of the factor VIII gene where, unexpectedly, zzso 22 seems to be the target of approximately zzso of the zzso causing severe zzso zzso
