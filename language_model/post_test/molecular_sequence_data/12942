A zzso clone zzso was isolated from a potato zzso zzso zzso library using a zzso probe from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso clone contained a zzso zzso immediately zzso to the initiation zzso for the first zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso were introduced into zzso The first contained zzso fused to a zzso promoter zzso containing only zzso zzso and zzso untranslated sequences from zzso The second zzso contained zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso of the first zzso unit and thus included the zzso present in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso were activated by wounding in zzso tissue and in leaves by application of zzso zzso zzso They were also expressed zzso in the potato zzso peel zzso 1-2 zzso Both zzso were actively expressed in mature zzso zzso high levels of expression were observed in zzso zzso zzso clones containing the zzso zzso and the first zzso unit showed zzso expression levels at least 10 times higher than clones containing zzso fused to the zzso zzso
