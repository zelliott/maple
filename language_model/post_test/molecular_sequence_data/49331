zzso resistance among new cases of tuberculosis zzso is increasingly becoming a significant problem in countries with a high prevalence of zzso and with inadequate therapies for zzso zzso resistance is widely used as a marker for zzso zzso zzso therefore, a new approach to the retrospective measurement of zzso resistance without the need of a viable culture has been zzso In many developing countries culture is unavailable and diagnosis relies on clinical manifestations and the results of zzso zzso of zzso zzso We determined zzso resistance directly with DNA extracts from zzso slides by identification of zzso in the zzso gene using reverse line zzso zzso and DNA zzso Analysis of the zzso gene revealed that samples containing zzso zzso tuberculosis carried altered zzso representing zzso acid positions zzso zzso and 531 of the zzso zzso Although the sensitivities of both methods were equal zzso sequencing of the zzso gene was more accurate in identifying zzso in the core region of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene in extracts from zzso slides may be used to zzso more precisely the magnitude of zzso zzso and, more importantly, provide information on trends in the development of resistance on a global zzso The nature of zzso resistance and the zzso can be determined by analysis of zzso slides in a laboratory equipped for sequencing and zzso without the need to ship zzso zzso
