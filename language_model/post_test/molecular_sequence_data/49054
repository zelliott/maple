The two main tasks of a zzso zzso and organ zzso are separated zzso Slowly dividing cells in the zzso center act as zzso stem cells, and only their derivatives in the zzso periphery specify new zzso zzso integrity and cellular proliferation are controlled in part by regulatory interactions between genes that are expressed in specific zzso of the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have identified zzso zzso zzso of zzso that prematurely arrest shoot zzso activity with the formation of zzso lateral zzso The zzso gene zzso which encodes an zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso of zzso stem cells, in lateral organ zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of organ zzso During the development of zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso is zzso and later zzso in an altered zzso In addition, we found increased expression of zzso and zzso two genes that zzso regulate stem cell fate in zzso These findings suggest that the zzso gene product is involved in the regulation of gene expression patterns in zzso Furthermore, specific zzso of zzso in zzso stem cells affects organ polarity and outgrowth in the zzso zzso indicating that zzso itself, or a process regulated by zzso can act zzso We elaborate on the role of zzso in zzso and organ development and discuss its possible role in the process of shoot zzso
