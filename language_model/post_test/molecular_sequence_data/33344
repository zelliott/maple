zzso zzso proteins form origin recognition complexes zzso that bind to replication origins during most of the cell cycle and direct assembly of zzso complexes zzso before the onset of S zzso In the zzso zzso coli, there is a temporally similar zzso complex zzso the zzso protein zzso bound to three zzso recognition sites in the unique origin of zzso zzso At the time of zzso this zzso zzso complex (the bacterial zzso accumulates additional zzso that interacts with zzso sites in zzso forming a zzso In this paper, we investigate the functional role of the bacterial zzso and examine whether it mediates zzso zzso interactions during zzso zzso We report that zzso coli zzso is essential for zzso occupation of zzso zzso The assistance given by zzso is directed primarily to zzso weak sites and requires zzso zzso We propose that in bacteria, zzso zzso of limited length and stability emerge from single zzso sites and extend toward weak sites to facilitate their loading as a key stage of zzso zzso zzso
