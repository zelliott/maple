zzso of the zzso acid zzso beta 2 zzso beta 2) gene by zzso acid zzso is zzso by a zzso response element zzso which represents a high affinity binding site for zzso zzso acting at this site as zzso zzso zzso In zzso resistant zzso cells, zzso beta 2 induction is blocked due to expression of a truncated zzso alpha acting as a dominant negative zzso Here we show that zzso expression of zzso but not zzso can restore zzso zzso beta 2 promoter zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso beta 2 zzso in zzso cells shows, that the zzso function required to restore zzso beta 2 promoter zzso is dependent on the DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties of zzso beta 2, which are retained in a zzso zzso delta zzso lacking the F zzso By contrast, dominant repression of zzso zzso beta 2 promoter zzso by zzso beta 2 zzso is independent of the DNA binding or zzso zzso function but requires a region zzso zzso in zzso beta 2 involved in zzso with zzso These data extend previous observations on zzso of zzso and provides tools for studying the role of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso
