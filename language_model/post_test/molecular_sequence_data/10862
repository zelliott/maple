zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a broadly expressed zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as a zzso zzso in brain, but the possibility of other zzso zzso was suggested by the finding that an zzso zzso zzso zzso neutralized zzso zzso zzso outgrowth without blocking zzso zzso Here we have searched for alternative zzso zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein bound to neural and zzso derived cell lines, indicating that these lines express zzso for zzso The zzso binding activity was zzso by the loop between zzso F and G of the fifth zzso type III repeat zzso The loop included the sequence zzso which resembles zzso motifs in other zzso zzso and zzso treatment of cells reduced binding of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso This was further supported by zzso blocking experiments and by binding of zzso to immobilized zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso zzso both on the surface of cells and immobilized on zzso was blocked by the same zzso zzso that blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the zzso interaction may contribute to the biological activity of zzso
