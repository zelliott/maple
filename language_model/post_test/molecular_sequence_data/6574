Different dietary fatty acids exert specific effects on plasma lipids but the mechanism by which this occurs is zzso zzso were fed on zzso diets containing zzso enriched in specific saturated fatty zzso and effects on plasma lipids and the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso metabolism were zzso zzso and zzso caused significant rises in zzso zzso zzso cholesterol which were accompanied by significant reductions in zzso LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso expression of the zzso B zzso zzso an increased production of LDL via zzso zzso zzso and decreased removal of LDL in animals fed this zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso did not vary significantly between the zzso Compared with zzso zzso had little effect on zzso gene expression or total plasma zzso However, it caused a marked decrease in zzso cholesterol and a rise in LDL cholesterol such that overall it appeared to be zzso zzso analysis suggested a rapid zzso of much of the dietary zzso The differential changes in plasma lipids and zzso zzso levels induced by specific dietary fats suggests a role for fatty acids or a zzso zzso in the regulation of the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso
