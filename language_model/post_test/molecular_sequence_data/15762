The zzso of the zzso zzso virus zzso was analyzed for existence of repetitive DNA sequences by zzso zzso using a defined and complete gene library of the viral zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso These experiments revealed the presence of repetitive DNA elements in the zzso zzso which are located in the zzso zzso H and in the zzso DNA zzso C at the coordinates zzso to zzso zzso DNA fragment, zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso The comparative analysis of the DNA sequences of this particular region of the viral zzso with the DNA sequences of the zzso DNA zzso L zzso zzso revealed the presence of several DNA sequences within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso H which show zzso to DNA sequences of the zzso DNA zzso zzso For example, a DNA element zzso A, 91 zzso is located at zzso positions 1981 to zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso H which are complementary zzso than zzso to the nine regions of the zzso DNA zzso L zzso 1 to zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed the existence of a zzso structure zzso 65 zzso 10 zzso and loop, zzso zzso 80 zzso at the zzso coordinates zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso This indicates that an zzso repeat sequence is located at this region of the viral zzso The DNA zzso sequence of this zzso was determined zzso zzso which confirmed the data obtained from electron zzso An zzso repeat DNA sequence located at zzso positions 304 and 1011 is able to form this type of zzso zzso
