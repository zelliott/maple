zzso zzso an zzso zzso found in zzso vegetables, causes a two- and zzso zzso in reduced zzso zzso in rat liver and zzso respectively, after oral administration of 200 zzso While this dose is also associated with zzso a single 100 zzso dose or multiple lesser doses show the same effect, although somewhat reduced in zzso with no zzso zzso In an attempt to identify the mechanism of this increase, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso synthesis by examining the effect of zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Male Fischer 344 rats received 3 zzso zzso zzso 24 and 34 zzso following zzso or corn zzso The zzso zzso in zzso and pancreatic zzso was eradicated by zzso suggesting that increased synthesis was zzso The zzso step in synthesis is zzso zzso zzso zzso the limiting zzso is zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso activity and zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso were zzso When rats were treated by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased 24 zzso after treatment and zzso zzso zzso were significantly elevated 4 zzso following zzso No significant zzso in zzso zzso activity was observed, however, even 24 zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso were elevated at both 4 and 8 zzso after zzso zzso However, there was no zzso zzso zzso or activity in zzso in either control or treated zzso Furthermore, zzso had no direct effect on the activity of zzso zzso from zzso regardless of whether zzso was present or zzso These results suggest that the mechanism of zzso induction of zzso may involve early increases in zzso precursors as well as a later increase in zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso identified in these studies may hold therapeutic or zzso zzso
