zzso zzso of zzso side chains is a common zzso modification of zzso zzso which serves mostly to regulate zzso zzso The modification is zzso by type I protein zzso zzso zzso being the zzso member of the zzso zzso of zzso specificity of these zzso are poorly zzso The Nuclear zzso binding protein 1 zzso is zzso by zzso at 13 zzso zzso located in zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso We have identified a preferred site for zzso zzso in zzso and in a corresponding synthetic zzso zzso of these zzso were analyzed by zzso kinetic analysis and mass zzso The data indicate that initial zzso is directed toward the preferred zzso zzso by an zzso adjacent zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso suggests that induction of a reverse turn structure is the basis for the ability of the respective zzso zzso to enable preferred zzso of the neighboring zzso zzso and this notion is supported by zzso circular zzso zzso We suggest that the formation of a reverse turn zzso the access of zzso side chains to the active sites of zzso which are located in the central cavity of a zzso zzso zzso
