zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice were infected zzso with zzso tuberculosis zzso or vaccinated zzso with zzso DNA zzso each of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and gamma zzso zzso was analyzed in response to zzso zzso components and synthetic overlapping peptides covering the three mature zzso zzso zzso mice reacted strongly to some peptides from zzso and zzso but not from zzso whereas zzso zzso mice reacted only to peptides from zzso In contrast, zzso cells from both mouse strains produced elevated levels of zzso and zzso following vaccination with zzso zzso and zzso DNA in response to peptides of the three zzso zzso and the zzso repertoire was broader than in infected zzso Despite pronounced sequence zzso a number of zzso regions contained component specific zzso Thus, zzso mice vaccinated with all three zzso genes reacted against the same zzso acid region, 101 to zzso that was also zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice, but responses were completely component zzso In zzso mice, a zzso zzso response was detected against two zzso peptides spanning zzso acids zzso to 260 and 261 to 280 of zzso and zzso These regions were not recognized at all in zzso mice vaccinated with zzso zzso Our results underline the need for comparative analysis of all three zzso components in future vaccination zzso
