In order to study the zzso relationship of an zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso we investigated the roles of three zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso One of the three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso zzso by zzso DNA technology was zzso to a zzso or zzso zzso A zzso or Ala zzso zzso at zzso or zzso showed less than zzso but a zzso zzso at zzso showed zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso with zzso as a zzso Similar results were zzso when zzso was used as a zzso The binding constant of a zzso zzso zzso at zzso or zzso towards zzso decreased zzso but that at zzso decreased more zzso zzso we assumed that these three zzso zzso are components of the active site of zzso zzso that zzso contributes to some extent to the binding and less to the zzso and that the other two zzso zzso and one zzso group not yet identified are probably involved in the zzso We assigned the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by comparison of the zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso containing zzso in place of His with that of the native zzso and also determined the individual zzso values for zzso and zzso to be zzso and zzso zzso was not zzso in a regular way, but the apparent zzso value was estimated to be around zzso The fact that addition of zzso caused a greater effect on the chemical shift of zzso in the zzso zzso as compared with those of the other zzso zzso may support the idea described above on the role of zzso
