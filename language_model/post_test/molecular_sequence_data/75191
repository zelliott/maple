zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso found in normal lung and zzso is zzso related to zzso zzso zzso which is found in over zzso of colon zzso From a human zzso library, we previously cloned part of an zzso gene and showed that the zzso region has extensive sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso We now present the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso containing the entire coding region of zzso zzso zzso The clone was obtained from a zzso zzso 10 library made from the colon zzso cell line SW zzso the clone contains a zzso acid leader zzso 310 zzso acids for the mature zzso and zzso zzso of zzso region of the zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso sequence to the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Zimmerman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and von zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso shows that both proteins contain zzso of an zzso domain, of which there are one copy in zzso and three copies in zzso a zzso acid zzso domain with no zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain of sufficient length to anchor the zzso in the cell zzso Overall, the corresponding coding regions possess zzso sequence zzso at the zzso acid level and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Forty zzso 3' of their stop zzso the zzso and zzso zzso become zzso The zzso acid zzso region together with part of the leader zzso sequence zzso exactly to a single zzso described in our previous zzso The data presented here further demonstrate the likelihood that zzso recently evolved from zzso by gene duplication, including two zzso of the zzso domain zzso of zzso
