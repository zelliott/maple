The zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli in two different expression zzso zzso and zzso both under the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon induction with zzso the zzso zzso expressed as inclusion zzso zzso fusion protein of 21 zzso The zzso zzso expressed a zzso zzso fusion protein anchored to the outer membrane of the zzso zzso expressing the NC fusion proteins accumulated zzso and zzso (between zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso To generate novel forms of zzso zzso a set of specific zzso genes for zzso zzso NC was designed in which each zzso zzso was replaced with a subset of zzso acids implicated in zzso coordination zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These zzso NC sequences were cloned into the two zzso and expressed in zzso zzso One of the zzso proteins zzso His zzso showed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso from a mixture of 16 heavy metals zzso None of the other heavy metals present in the culture was zzso
