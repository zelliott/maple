To evaluate the influence of DNA extraction methods on the zzso diversity analysis in saline environment via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso method, glass zzso beating method and repeated freezing and zzso method were used to extract total DNA in soil samples from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone libraries were constructed by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to transform the zzso coli zzso The zzso in the library were further analyzed by zzso The unique zzso zzso clones were zzso and further used for zzso zzso 

Different zzso zzso Units zzso were obtained from DNA extracts and total 35 zzso were obtained from zzso method, 19 zzso from zzso zzso beating method and 14 zzso from repeated freezing and zzso zzso Up to zzso zzso in the three libraries constructed displayed lower similarity with the published zzso perhaps representing novel zzso The total zzso belong to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

DNA extraction methods influence the zzso zzso Each of the DNA extraction method in our study has some drawbacks and zzso so it is better to use combined DNA extracts from different DNA methods to evaluate the microbial diversity in salty zzso
