zzso zzso is a recently identified mycoplasma, isolated from urine samples collected from human zzso virus zzso zzso Its presence is significantly associated with zzso zzso The major zzso recognized during natural and experimental infections is an abundant zzso zzso which, upon zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso phase and is the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here that the zzso zzso zzso spontaneous and zzso phase variation at high frequency, leading to zzso populations of zzso even when derived from a zzso zzso This variation was found to be determined at the zzso level, and although this property is not unique among the members of the class zzso the mechanism by which it occurs in zzso zzso differs from those previously described for other zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso phase variation was due neither to a zzso gene zzso nor to point zzso within the gene itself or its zzso The zzso phase variation in the different zzso obtained was zzso with modifications in the pattern of other expressed zzso probably due to regulated expression of selected members of a gene family which was found to potentially zzso similar zzso zzso zzso zzso could be selected on the basis of their lack of colony zzso with a zzso zzso against a zzso zzso zzso strongly suggesting that the mechanisms involved in altering surface zzso expression might allow evasion of the zzso immune response of the infected zzso
