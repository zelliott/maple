zzso growth factors zzso transmit their signals through four zzso receptors that are designated zzso Alternative zzso in the zzso region of zzso generates zzso zzso with different zzso binding zzso Thus two types of zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso have been identified for zzso and zzso and the existence of analogous zzso has been zzso for zzso based on its zzso zzso However, only a single full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified so zzso Here we describe the cloning of a full-length zzso zzso zzso from a mouse skin wound zzso zzso This zzso zzso was expressed at the highest levels in a subset of zzso zzso of the skin and in zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso was expressed in zzso rat skeletal muscle zzso and used in zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso was found to bind the zzso with high zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso bound with significantly lower zzso Despite their apparently similar but low zzso zzso but not zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in these cells, demonstrating that this new zzso zzso is a functional zzso zzso for zzso
