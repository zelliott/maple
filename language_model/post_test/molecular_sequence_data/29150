Two protein zzso activities that use zzso as a zzso zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso stage of zzso zzso upon zzso on zzso zzso was zzso further through zzso zzso zzso to remove any trace of the zzso zzso zzso The optimal activity for zzso was obtained at pH zzso 25 zzso 5 zzso zzso and 75 zzso zzso The size and zzso of zzso were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso When two selective zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were used, zzso was shown to specifically zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso has a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso two zzso of zzso zzso zzso behaved as a competitive inhibitor with respect to zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso Treatment with high zzso of zzso or zzso also resulted in a significant zzso of zzso Two well-known zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso in a zzso zzso Based on the following zzso zzso the zzso strength required for zzso from zzso zzso zzso its molecular size and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high level of specificity for zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and low zzso of zzso we conclude that zzso belongs to the zzso family of protein zzso
