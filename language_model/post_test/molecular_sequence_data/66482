In the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso development is controlled by a zzso of the two zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso We have identified a zzso induced zzso zzso zzso that is required for the proliferation of zzso filaments in zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso develop structures functionally equivalent to clamp cells that participate in the distribution of zzso during cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso filaments penetrate the plant zzso but development is stalled before the first zzso division, and the zzso structures are not zzso Although zzso is immediately activated upon zzso on the zzso level, zzso zzso protein is first observed at the stage of plant penetration prior to the first cell zzso zzso expression of zzso strongly interferes with zzso gene regulation and blocks zzso filament formation and zzso cell cycle zzso We speculate that the zzso protein zzso the activity of the zzso zzso to facilitate the cell cycle progression during zzso zzso
