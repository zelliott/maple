We zzso two zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones anchored by the zzso satellite repeat zzso The two zzso consisting of approximately 200 zzso of zzso defined zzso DNA, are composed exclusively of satellite sequences and zzso that can be classified as zzso specific or zzso specific on the basis of their distribution in the zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the original zzso sequences were composed of zzso zzso that were expanded by zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso of zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso The zzso elements inserted randomly into either zzso zzso or other zzso zzso comparisons of the long terminal repeats zzso of individual zzso elements indicated that these elements zzso within the last zzso million zzso We observed that all of the previously reported zzso zzso in rice and zzso which belong to the same family as the zzso zzso also recently zzso with the oldest element having zzso approximately zzso million years zzso zzso zzso sequence motifs were found in the zzso of the zzso zzso in the grass species, suggesting that the zzso may be important for the zzso specificity of this zzso zzso
