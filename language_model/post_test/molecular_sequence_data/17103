The zzso zzso I zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso and related derivatives into the corresponding zzso In contrast with the previously characterized zzso zzso of Homo zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we recently determined that zzso coli zzso surprisingly did not display zzso but instead exhibited zzso activity with zzso To investigate whether zzso zzso defines a zzso previously zzso class of zzso zzso or whether the zzso coli zzso is an exception to the previously established zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized the bacterial zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso profiles for these additional zzso firmly establish the existence of a zzso grouping within the general category of zzso zzso This second, established class of metal zzso was formerly unidentified for this zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons indicate a more extended zzso chain in the zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso of zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The longer sequence is due in part to the presence of additional regions situated fairly close to the metal zzso in the zzso forms of the zzso With respect to sequence zzso these zzso may potentially contribute to defining the metal specificity of zzso at a structural zzso
