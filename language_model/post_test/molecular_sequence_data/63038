zzso are zzso zzso that form a symbiotic association with over 200 species of woody zzso zzso Recently, three zzso zzso were completely zzso In this study, the synonymous zzso usage patterns of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined and compared to each other and to other zzso As expected for a high zzso zzso zzso usage by zzso was highly zzso but differences were observed among the three zzso Using the zzso adaptation index zzso as a zzso zzso of gene expression level, highly expressed genes in zzso were predicted with zzso protein genes as a zzso The analysis of the predicted highly expressed genes showed that zzso strain zzso had a different profile from the other two zzso zzso zzso had fewer predicted highly expressed genes in several zzso categories including zzso transport and zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso transport and zzso and general function prediction only than zzso strains zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso had more predicted highly expressed genes in zzso and signal zzso mechanisms than the other two zzso These differences were not just a reflection in total gene numbers, but also based on percentage of genes within a zzso These results support the hypothesis that strain zzso is becoming a symbiotic specialist and the other two zzso symbiotic strains are maintaining their capacity to exist as zzso soil zzso
