The cloned zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso calcium channel that is believed to be the zzso zzso zzso found in native zzso based on similarities regarding molecular mass, tissue distribution, and zzso zzso Using a Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader zzso along with zzso to signal zzso calcium levels zzso rat zzso zzso and a human zzso zzso were zzso characterized with various zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso expressing zzso or zzso exhibited zzso increases in zzso when challenged with zzso zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso to zzso were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso and were dependent on zzso zzso zzso for 10 structurally diverse zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso highly correlated to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a subset of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was approximately zzso more potent for zzso compared to zzso zzso analysis for blockade of zzso responses by zzso was consistent with competitive zzso whereas zzso red displayed zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso was more sensitive to blockade by both zzso For both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso increased more gradually compared to other zzso zzso also displayed slow responses with zzso but showed rapid responses with zzso Thus, zzso technology can be used to readily reveal differences between zzso and zzso pharmacology with respect to zzso zzso and zzso for several zzso zzso
