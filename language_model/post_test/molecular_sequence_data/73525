ID elements are short zzso elements zzso found in high copy number in many zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso transcript, is derived from the single copy zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene has been shown to be a master gene for ID element amplification in zzso zzso ID elements are dispersed through a process termed zzso The zzso process involves a number of potential regulatory zzso These regulatory steps may include zzso in the appropriate zzso transcript stability, zzso of the zzso transcript for reverse zzso and zzso This study focuses on zzso of the zzso transcript for reverse zzso zzso zzso gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse zzso in an efficient zzso and zzso zzso This zzso ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the zzso zzso The observation that a gene actively amplified throughout zzso evolution makes a zzso capable of efficient zzso reverse zzso strongly suggests that zzso is at least one feature establishing the zzso zzso gene as a master gene for amplification of ID zzso
