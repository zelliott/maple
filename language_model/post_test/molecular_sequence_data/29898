Early development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by a process of progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso begins to assemble into zzso on the inner surface of the zzso roof at the early zzso stage and progressively forms a complex zzso zzso We have analyzed the mechanisms of zzso formation under normal and experimental conditions in zzso with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthetic peptides containing the zzso zzso cell surface recognition sequence of zzso and zzso zzso against both beta 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of beta 1 zzso We report that in living zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso injected into the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso patterns similar to those of zzso zzso This indicates regulation of zzso by the cell surface rather than by changes in the type of zzso zzso is inhibited in a zzso manner both by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso beta 1 zzso Furthermore, when injected zzso into zzso zzso or into selected zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso beta 1 zzso produce a zzso zzso of zzso formation that follows early cell lineages and cause delays in zzso Together, these data indicate that in zzso the zzso beta 1 zzso and the zzso recognition signal are essential for the proper assembly of zzso zzso in early zzso zzso
