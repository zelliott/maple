A high resolution structure of zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso has the same zzso framework as alpha zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso receptors but zzso the zzso zzso as do the alpha zzso and alpha A zzso The unique binding preference of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso interface of zzso zzso zzso makes it a valuable structural template for zzso of various zzso possessing distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso zzso with the zzso favoring zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso preference of the former originates from its second zzso zzso of three-dimensional structures of seven zzso reveals that the estimated size of the zzso pocket in zzso zzso zzso is approximately 20 A zzso zzso 20 A zzso zzso 15 A zzso
