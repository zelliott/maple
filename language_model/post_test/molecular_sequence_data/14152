The translation zzso factor zzso alpha appears to play a major role in the control of cell proliferation and zzso in higher zzso Here we report the cloning of the zzso gene zzso the zzso factor 1 alpha of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene is localized on zzso 2 from zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso and encodes a protein containing zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso a second zzso gene zzso an zzso or nearly zzso zzso could not be zzso The zzso activity of the zzso gene did not change during zzso growth, whereas a slight decrease could be detected during the zzso zzso
