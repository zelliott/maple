A gene named zzso was cloned and characterized in zzso A relationship to zzso zzso is suggested by sequence identity zzso similar zzso structure and zzso with zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso is zzso regulated with zzso during zzso and in zzso zzso zzso cells grow zzso develop and produce viable zzso We demonstrated the capacity of zzso zzso to bind zzso using the zzso overlay zzso and showed that its mobility on zzso is dependent on zzso zzso
