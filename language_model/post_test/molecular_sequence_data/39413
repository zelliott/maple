The recently described crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal a zzso zzso feature called the zzso The lid projects from the clamp domain and contacts the zzso thereby enclosing the zzso transcript in zzso zzso channel and forming the junction between the exit channel and the main channel, which holds the zzso zzso In the initiating form of bacterial zzso zzso containing zzso the lid interacts with zzso region 3 and encloses an extended zzso between zzso region 3 and zzso region 4 in place of the zzso in the exit zzso During zzso the lid may be important for holding open the zzso bubble and may help zzso the zzso from the template DNA zzso To test these ideas, we constructed and characterized a zzso zzso from which the lid element was zzso zzso zzso exhibited dramatically reduced activity during initiation from zzso and zzso zzso zzso that the lid is important for stabilizing the open promoter complex during zzso However, transcript zzso zzso zzso and, surprisingly, zzso termination all occurred normally in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso behaved differently from zzso zzso when zzso zzso DNA templates where it zzso long, persistent zzso hybrids, in contrast to efficient zzso arrest by zzso zzso
