We have observed previously that DNA zzso zzso by the type 1 human zzso virus reverse zzso is zzso for zzso zzso addition and deletion errors at zzso zzso We have also noted strong termination of zzso synthesis at these positions zzso zzso zzso zzso Roberts, zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we have tested three models to explain errors at these hot zzso zzso zzso for deletion zzso and dislocation and direct zzso for substitution zzso The approach involves introducing zzso changes within or zzso the zzso hot spots and examining the effects that these changes have on human zzso virus type 1 zzso reverse zzso error rate, error zzso and termination zzso The results obtained suggest that zzso deletion errors in zzso runs result from zzso zzso and that both direct zzso and zzso dislocation contribute to the base substitution hot zzso The data also suggest that base substitution errors at one position can be zzso by the preceding zzso or either of the next two zzso zzso error rates at zzso sites were affected by changes in the sequences zzso the runs, including zzso differences in the zzso template strand and in the zzso primer region as many as six zzso distant from the hot zzso Both increases and decreases in zzso zzso were observed, and most of these correlated with zzso increases or decreases in the probability that zzso reverse zzso terminated zzso synthesis within the zzso These data provide further support for a relationship between the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso DNA synthesis by zzso reverse zzso
