zzso A is a small zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso DNA that contains the zzso structural gene and a second open reading frame zzso in an zzso was previously cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso Roy, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Stiles, zzso zzso zzso zzso When a zzso zzso zzso containing this zzso was introduced into a zzso zzso zzso immunity but no zzso production was zzso zzso production was observed when an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of this zzso zzso revealed the presence of three zzso in an zzso upstream of and on the strand opposite from the zzso structural zzso The first zzso zzso encodes a putative protein of 149 zzso acids with no apparent function in zzso A zzso The second zzso zzso contains zzso zzso that zzso a protein zzso to members of the zzso family of zzso cassette zzso The third zzso zzso contains zzso zzso that zzso a protein with marked similarity to zzso a protein essential for the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso resulted in loss of zzso production, indicating that zzso and zzso are involved in production and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso apparatus for zzso A did not complement zzso in the zzso genes to express zzso A in zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
