The mouse zzso zzso gene is the zzso of a growing family of so-called zzso genes which zzso zzso regulators and have been identified in a variety of zzso and zzso including zzso zzso in zzso and other zzso genes result in drastic embryonic zzso indicating that zzso gene products are essential in tissue zzso zzso and zzso The zzso encodes a zzso domain of about 180 zzso zzso the T zzso Here we report the X-ray structure of the T domain from zzso zzso in complex with a zzso zzso DNA zzso We show that the protein is bound as a zzso interacting with the major and the minor grooves of the zzso A new type of specific DNA contact is seen, in which a zzso zzso is deeply embedded into an enlarged minor groove without zzso the zzso zzso interactions and an unusual zzso zzso contact to a zzso account for zzso recognition in the minor groove by this zzso Thus the structure of this T domain complex with DNA reveals a new way in which a protein can recognize zzso
