zzso play important roles in controlling zzso trafficking under normal and inflammatory zzso Sixteen zzso zzso have been identified in the human and mouse zzso while considerably fewer zzso fish zzso zzso have been zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso of trout zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and we identify a novel zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso The trout zzso proteins contain 112 zzso acids and the zzso gene is comprised of four zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in skin, zzso visceral fat, and zzso kidney zzso while low transcript levels were present in the anterior kidney and zzso zzso zzso transcript abundance increased 1 day after bath vaccination zzso and subsided to zzso levels by 7 days zzso Challenge with viable zzso zzso induced expression of trout zzso zzso up to zzso in the zzso The number of viable zzso zzso were significantly correlated with zzso gene transcript abundance zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso and fish with the highest bacterial loads had the highest zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in fish infected with low numbers of zzso zzso while diminishing in heavily infected zzso zzso zzso expression was not increased in rainbow trout infected with infectious zzso necrosis virus, suggesting that zzso may be zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso transcript zzso follows the zzso zzso response to zzso zzso and may be a relevant zzso marker of zzso
