In zzso neuroendocrine cells, zzso zzso zzso are thought to be formed by two zzso One zzso sorts the proteins to zzso directly from the plasma membrane (or a specialized domain zzso in an zzso protein complex zzso zzso A zzso zzso Another zzso operates via an zzso zzso involves zzso protein complex 3, and is zzso zzso We have previously shown that when expressed in zzso cells, zzso zzso are directed to zzso mostly via the zzso zzso zzso We have now found that two zzso zzso are involved in targeting of zzso zzso to zzso The first intermediate is the early, zzso zzso growth zzso zzso from which exit to zzso is controlled by the targeting zzso zzso and zzso located within the zzso domain of zzso The second intermediate is the late, zzso zzso growth zzso late zzso from where zzso zzso are sorted to zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Both sorting steps, early zzso to zzso and late zzso to zzso are affected by zzso In addition, analysis of double zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso indicated that zzso pass zzso through these zzso en route both to zzso and to zzso We conclude that a third site of formation for zzso the late zzso exists in zzso zzso
