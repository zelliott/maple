Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso is a newly emergent virus responsible for a worldwide epidemic in zzso The coronavirus spike proteins belong to class I fusion zzso and are characterized by the existence of two zzso repeat zzso regions, zzso and zzso The zzso region in zzso is predicted to be considerably longer than that in other type I virus fusion zzso Therefore the exact binding sequence to zzso from the zzso is not zzso In this study, we defined the region of zzso that binds to zzso by a series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the defined zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are different from previously defined binding regions, were linked together by a flexible zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso This protein was expressed in zzso coli and forms a typical zzso coiled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions between mouse zzso virus zzso and zzso spike proteins suggest a similar three-dimensional structure for the two fusion zzso Here, we constructed a zzso model for SARS coronavirus fusion core based on our zzso analysis and determined the zzso fusion core zzso We also propose an important target site for fusion inhibitor design and several strategies, which have been successfully used in fusion inhibitor design for human zzso virus zzso for the treatment of SARS zzso
