zzso zzso is the most prevalent zzso neurotransmitter in the zzso nervous zzso zzso selectively activates the type 3 zzso zzso zzso It is zzso by zzso activity on the zzso face of the plasma membrane of zzso and zzso The human gene that codes for zzso membrane zzso zzso has been shown to produce zzso activity against zzso We cloned the human zzso zzso and used it to probe a rat zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso containing a complete coding region that possesses zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence has zzso identity and zzso similarity to the zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with this zzso expressed zzso zzso activity at a level similar to that obtained from rat brain zzso The zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso data demonstrated the widespread distribution of the zzso zzso in the brain, consistent with the distribution of zzso zzso The highest levels of zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso Three transcripts zzso at 5, zzso and zzso zzso were identified in northern blots of rat brain, while in rat kidney the third transcript appeared slightly smaller than zzso zzso With use of reverse zzso zzso with zzso for the zzso end, the central region, and the 3' end of the zzso zzso the expected amplification products were obtained from rat brain zzso Spinal zzso yielded an amplification product only with zzso for the zzso end of the zzso zzso
