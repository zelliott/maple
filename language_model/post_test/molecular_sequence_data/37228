zzso zzso protein zzso zzso play an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to all kinds of zzso The most abundant and broadly expressed zzso zzso zzso is zzso which can also control the zzso zzso and survival of several cell zzso Here we show that the absence of zzso zzso with the zzso of one of its upstream zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso knockout mice and in cultured cells derived from zzso In contrast, the expression levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not affected in zzso zzso The increase in zzso protein concentration zzso with increased amounts of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells reduces the levels of zzso protein and zzso to the normal levels found in zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso zzso is more stable in zzso cells and that the zzso region of this zzso can zzso regulate the stability of the zzso reporter gene in a zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso can zzso regulate the stability of the zzso zzso and thus control the zzso concentration of one of its upstream zzso
