The zzso DNA zzso of the gene coding human zzso converting zzso zzso was examined in 109 patients with coronary artery disease zzso and 93 zzso subjects zzso living in a northern part of zzso The presence of risk factors including age, hypertension, zzso tobacco use, diabetes zzso and zzso were also zzso An zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso of the zzso gene was determined by the zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso encompassing the zzso region in zzso zzso The template DNA was isolated from peripheral blood zzso of zzso The frequency of the zzso in zzso was zzso significantly lower than that reported in Caucasians or in Japanese living in the zzso zzso The frequency of the zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso and angina zzso was zzso and was higher than that in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and II were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso except in young patients zzso 40 years of zzso with zzso and zzso groups, and zzso zzso and zzso respectively in zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Young zzso showed similar zzso in zzso gene zzso to those in zzso a pattern which differed from that seen in subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso The numbers of risk factors did not alter the frequency of zzso gene zzso among patients with zzso however, in zzso the odds ratio of zzso was significantly increased to zzso zzso zzso gene zzso may be associated with morbidity from zzso in Japanese living in northern Japan as has been noted in zzso despite the lower zzso of the zzso in the Japanese zzso
