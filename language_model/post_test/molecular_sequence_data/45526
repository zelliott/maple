The high mobility group zzso proteins of the zzso family are zzso proteins that act as architectural factors in zzso structures, which regulate zzso processes including zzso and zzso In addition to the previously identified zzso zzso the zzso zzso encodes at least two other candidate family members zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso having the typical overall structure of a central domain displaying sequence similarity to zzso DNA binding zzso which is flanked by basic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that the zzso protein is a nuclear zzso whereas the zzso protein is found mainly in the zzso In line with this finding, zzso displays specific interaction with the nuclear export zzso zzso According to CD zzso the zzso zzso of both proteins have an zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso interacts with linear DNA and binds zzso to DNA zzso whereas the zzso domain of zzso does not interact with DNA at zzso In zzso experiments with short DNA fragments, the zzso zzso domain can facilitate the formation of linear zzso but it does not promote the formation of DNA zzso zzso the zzso protein shares several features with zzso zzso whereas the zzso protein has different zzso Despite the presence of a region with similarity to the zzso domain typical of zzso zzso zzso does not bind zzso zzso In zzso our data demonstrate zzso that plant zzso proteins are functionally variable and zzso that it is difficult to predict zzso function solely based on sequence zzso
