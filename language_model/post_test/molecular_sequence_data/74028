zzso regulate their responsiveness to zzso through the zzso control of the zzso alpha zzso which encodes a component of the high affinity zzso zzso In the mouse zzso alpha gene this control is exerted via two zzso zzso a promoter zzso region, and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso functional analysis of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso demonstrated that three separate zzso sites I, II, and III, were necessary for zzso zzso these three sites demonstrate functional zzso Site III contains a consensus binding motif for members of the zzso family of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso an zzso zzso binds to site III and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso site III forms a complex with a protein zzso present in nuclear extracts from zzso cells as well as from normal zzso zzso zzso We have identified this zzso as zzso according to a number of zzso The complex possesses an identical zzso mobility to that formed by zzso zzso protein and is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso extracts provided site III is intact and both zzso and zzso proteins bind with the same relative affinities to different zzso of site zzso In addition, by introducing zzso into the core of the site III zzso motif and comparing the corresponding effects on the in zzso binding of zzso and the in zzso zzso activity, we provide strong evidence that zzso is directly involved in zzso zzso The nature of the functional zzso observed between zzso and the factors binding sites I and II remains zzso experiments presented here however suggest that this effect may not require direct interactions between the proteins binding these three zzso
