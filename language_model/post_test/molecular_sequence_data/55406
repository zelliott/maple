zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso but causes fatal systemic infections in zzso humans, cultured eels or zzso An zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be a potential zzso factor of the zzso however, a few strains isolated from a diseased zzso or shrimp were recently found to produce a zzso zzso termed zzso but not zzso In the present study, we found that these strains had lost the 80 zzso zzso region including the gene zzso zzso We also zzso zzso from the culture zzso through ammonium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso column zzso and the zzso was demonstrated to be a zzso zzso as well as those from some zzso The gene zzso was shown to constitute an zzso with a downstream gene zzso and several zzso species were found to have zzso of zzso These findings indicate that the genes zzso and zzso might be mobile genetic zzso
