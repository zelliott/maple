zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso produce zzso proteins called zzso These zzso proteins inhibit the growth of closely related zzso Here we report the identification of the zzso genes in zzso zzso The active zzso comprises two proteins that are equipped with a classical signal zzso These proteins are zzso by the cells and found to be membrane zzso zzso Gene zzso studies demonstrate that both proteins are required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute a novel class of zzso proteins without zzso zzso to any other zzso
