zzso zzso cells adhere to the core protein of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso present in zzso basement zzso We found that cell zzso was partially inhibited by beta 1 zzso zzso and almost completely blocked by a mixture of beta 1 and alpha v beta 3 zzso Furthermore, zzso was partially inhibited by a synthetic zzso containing the zzso domain III sequence zzso zzso as well as by zzso but not by zzso Both zzso contributed to the zzso of cell zzso to immobilized zzso whereas only beta zzso zzso blocked residual cell zzso to zzso core in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso A fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to a core affinity column and zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes, zzso Cell zzso to zzso was low compared to zzso core, and cell zzso to core, but not to immobilized zzso was selectively inhibited by soluble zzso and zzso zzso This zzso by zzso was also observed with zzso and zzso and, in the case of zzso was found to be independent of zzso binding to zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso cells interact with the core protein of zzso through beta 1 and beta 3 zzso that this binding is partially zzso and that this interaction is selectively sensitive to a zzso effect of zzso zzso which may act as regulatory zzso
