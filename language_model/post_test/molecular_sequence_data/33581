The zzso relationship of zzso zzso originating from the zzso zzso Spain, to other zzso zzso was investigated using the zzso zzso zzso region and the internal transcribed zzso zzso region (including zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso DNA zzso These 2 molecular markers zzso and zzso were zzso from zzso of zzso zzso originating from zzso clam zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso ITS region of the zzso zzso gene was zzso similar to that of zzso zzso Higher genetic zzso was found for the zzso zzso with zzso to zzso similarity to zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso isolate previously detected in zzso zzso from the same area was also obtained and showed zzso identity with our zzso Evidence obtained from zzso analysis of the zzso ITS and zzso aligned sequences appears to indicate that zzso zzso strains group together according to their host rather than their geographic origins within a zzso zzso zzso zzso
