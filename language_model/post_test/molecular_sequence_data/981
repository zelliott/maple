The geographically constrained distribution of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso in southeast Asian populations suggests that both viral and host zzso may influence disease zzso Although zzso zzso have been mapped within the human zzso the role of viral zzso in the focal distribution of zzso remains an zzso Here we report a molecular zzso analysis of an zzso viral zzso zzso in a large panel of zzso zzso from southeast Asia and from zzso New zzso Africa, and Australia, regions of the world where zzso is and is not endemic, zzso This analysis revealed that zzso sequences show a distinct geographic structure, indicating that the southeast Asian zzso have evolved as a lineage distinct from those of zzso New zzso zzso and Australian zzso Furthermore, a likelihood ratio test revealed that the C zzso of the zzso sequences of the southeast Asian lineage are under significant positive selection pressure, particularly at some sites within the zzso zzso zzso We also present evidence that although the N zzso and zzso region of zzso have undergone zzso the zzso region of the gene has evolved without any history of zzso Based on these zzso we speculate that selection pressure may be driving the zzso sequences in virus zzso from southeast Asia towards a more zzso zzso thereby influencing the endemic distribution of zzso in this zzso
