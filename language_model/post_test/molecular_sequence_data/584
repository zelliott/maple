A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the bottom of a mold zzso used in the process of soy sauce zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence from this strain placed it within the zzso zzso and further sequence analysis revealed that this strain has a sequence similarity of zzso to other known species of zzso The zzso zzso between strain zzso and related type strains of the zzso zzso is below zzso indicating that it should be considered a separate zzso zzso of strain zzso revealed that the major cellular fatty acid is zzso the cell wall contains zzso zzso zzso the major zzso is zzso and the major polar lipids are zzso and zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of the strain is zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso zzso and zzso data, we propose that this isolate represents a novel species of the zzso zzso and propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
