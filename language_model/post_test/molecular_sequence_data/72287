zzso alcohol zzso zzso is highly zzso in size, organization, and zzso acid zzso zzso was hypothesized to be a zzso derived from an zzso zzso in the zzso group of zzso however, several results from molecular analyses of this gene conflict with currently held notions of molecular zzso Perhaps the most difficult observations to reconcile with the zzso hypothesis are that the hypothetical replacement sites of zzso evolve only slightly more quickly than replacement sites of closely zzso functional zzso zzso and that the replacement sites of the zzso evolve considerably more slowly than neighboring silent zzso The data have been presented as a paradox that challenges our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DNA sequence zzso Here I show that zzso is actually a new, functional gene recently descended from an zzso zzso This descendant recruited approximately 60 new zzso zzso zzso is considerably more basic than zzso and is evolving at a faster rate than zzso Furthermore, though the descendant is clearly functional, as zzso from molecular evolution and population genetic data, it retains no obvious zzso zzso This probably reflects functional divergence from its zzso zzso
