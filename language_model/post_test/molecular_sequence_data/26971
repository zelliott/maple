This study reports the first successful zzso expression of zzso zzso peptides human zzso and human zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso through zzso zzso and each gene was then cloned into the expression zzso zzso which feature fusion protein zzso at the zzso The zzso plasmids were then transformed into zzso coli zzso zzso and cultured in zzso zzso which gave yields of zzso and zzso fusion proteins of up to zzso and zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to purify the soluble fusion zzso and the zzso zzso tags were zzso off by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were then obtained by zzso exchange zzso The overall recovery of zzso was 38% and that of zzso reached zzso Both zzso showed zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso coli but not against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
