We isolated a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was revealed to have a zzso zzso in the zzso gene that showed sequence similarity to a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were not observed on the zzso cell surface under the electron zzso The zzso gene was not involved in zzso or translation of the zzso gene zzso zzso the major component of thick zzso In the zzso lower molecular mass zzso peptides were detected than in the zzso The zzso zzso was not truncated at the zzso or zzso of mature zzso The reduced molecular mass may have resulted from insufficient zzso zzso The amounts of zzso zzso were remarkably reduced in the zzso and surface zzso The zzso zzso were released into liquid media without being assembled into zzso Our finding suggests that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso at the level of the zzso modification of zzso
