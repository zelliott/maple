Multiple studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso contributes to regulation of zzso zzso 3 zzso in the small zzso although the zzso for this regulation remain zzso We demonstrate here that zzso binds directly to the C zzso of zzso and exists in similar sized zzso complexes as zzso This binding is dynamic and decreases with elevated zzso The zzso site in zzso was identified zzso acids zzso and shown to be a critical regulatory domain for protein complex formation, because when it is zzso zzso binding to zzso as well as zzso is zzso An zzso zzso which binds to the zzso zzso 2 zzso contained in zzso without interrupting binding of zzso to zzso was used to probe a zzso role of zzso In the presence of this zzso zzso calcium zzso of zzso was zzso These results mirror previous studies with the transient zzso potential channel and suggest that zzso may play a common role in regulating the zzso expression of zzso zzso
