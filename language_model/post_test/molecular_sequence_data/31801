Division of labor in social insect colonies relies on a strong zzso bias that favors zzso Although the ecological and evolutionary success attained through zzso systems is well sketched out in terms of ultimate causes, the molecular and cellular zzso driving the development of zzso zzso are still far from zzso Recent zzso approaches on honey bee zzso biology revealed a set of genes that are zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso and associated with zzso zzso size in queens and massive cell death in zzso zzso these, two zzso called special attention, both being over 200 zzso in size and lacking apparent coding zzso zzso we obtained their full zzso zzso These and their secondary structure characteristics placed in evidence that they are bona fide long zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso thus named zzso and zzso zzso both map within a previously identified zzso on zzso 11, associated with zzso zzso size in honey bee zzso As zzso was zzso in worker zzso we focused on this zzso zzso zzso analysis on zzso worker zzso evidenced an expression peak coinciding with the onset of zzso cell zzso Cellular zzso analysis through zzso in zzso zzso revealed zzso spots resembling omega zzso known to regulate trafficking of zzso zzso With only four zzso known so far in honey zzso two expressed in the zzso these findings open a novel perspective on regulatory factors acting in the fine tuning of zzso processes underlying zzso plasticity related to social life zzso
