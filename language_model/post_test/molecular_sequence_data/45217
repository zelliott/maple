The aim of the study was to develop a sensitive detection method of zzso zzso contamination in cereal zzso 

A zzso method using a single closed tube was developed for the detection of zzso zzso in infected cereal zzso The zzso of the first primer pair was diluted 10,000 times compared to the concentration used for the second primer zzso Differing zzso temperatures allowed both first and second zzso chain reaction zzso reactions to be performed subsequently in the same closed zzso The detection limit was zzso zzso of zzso target DNA and allowed the detection of zzso infected seeds of wheat in a mixture with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be specifically detected in cereal samples by the highly sensitive method of zzso in a single closed zzso 

This work describes the detection of zzso zzso in cereal samples that is approximately 100 times more sensitive than previous zzso methods, involves low risk of cross zzso between samples, low costs and reduced hands-on time as compared to standard zzso zzso
