The zzso envelope of zzso consists of two zzso E1 and zzso E1 is responsible for fusion and zzso is responsible for zzso zzso An atomic structure is available for zzso but one for zzso has not been zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso was used to probe the function of different zzso of zzso A library of zzso containing 19 zzso acid insertions in the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso was zzso zzso independent zzso insertions were zzso of which more than half zzso gave rise to viable zzso The zzso zzso identify regions that accommodate insertions without zzso virus production and can be used to insert targeting zzso to direct zzso to specific zzso The defective and lethal zzso give insight into regions of zzso important for protein stability, transport to the cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
