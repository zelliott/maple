The zzso protein zzso is known to play a leading role in a complex formation with the zzso zzso and zzso As a preliminary step towards the understanding of the complex formation mechanism and the exact role of this protein zzso a comparative zzso of the zzso protein of the green zzso zzso zzso was zzso Because of the very few structural information and poor template similarities, the derivation of the model consisted in an zzso zzso procedure using the comparative zzso program zzso the following three structure validation programs zzso zzso and zzso and molecular mechanics energy refinement of the model using the program zzso The analysis of the final model reveals a scaffold of key zzso that is believed to be essential in the folding mechanism and that zzso with the zzso zzso throughout the zzso zzso Our results suggest that this protein is a typical zzso zzso Finally, the various mechanisms by which the zzso protein can zzso or binds to other zzso are discussed in light of its zzso structure and zzso
