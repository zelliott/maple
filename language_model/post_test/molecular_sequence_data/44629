As an attempt to examine the transcripts expressed in a single cell type and to unveil the physiology of guard cells at the molecular level, we generated 515 expressed sequence tags zzso from a directional zzso library constructed from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparative analysis of the zzso zzso against the National Center for zzso Information zzso protein database revealed that 133 zzso zzso have significant similarity to protein coding sequences in the zzso Among them were 35 clones related to genes that have not yet been identified in higher zzso Analysis of zzso gel blots of 14 zzso clones revealed that five clones harbor the sequences for zzso expressed most abundantly in guard cells, one of them detecting an zzso with highly preferential expression in guard zzso zzso categorization of the zzso identified zzso zzso zzso when compared with zzso leaf zzso that guard cells expressed a higher proportion of signal zzso components and a lower proportion of structural or zzso zzso as is consistent with the roles of guard zzso
