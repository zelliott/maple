zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are critical for energy zzso cell zzso and cell zzso Despite their essential function, little is known about the regulation and in zzso expression pattern of the genes involved in the de zzso zzso synthesis zzso The complete coding region of the bovine zzso zzso gene zzso which zzso steps 6 and 7 of the de zzso zzso zzso pathway, as well as bovine zzso sequences of the six other genes in the zzso producing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The genes were mapped to segments of six different bovine zzso using a radiation hybrid zzso cell zzso The gene zzso coding for the presumed zzso zzso of the zzso de zzso zzso was closely linked to zzso on zzso zzso and the other bovine locations zzso zzso at zzso zzso at zzso zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso are in agreement with published comparative maps of cattle and zzso zzso and zzso genes are known to be closely linked in human, rat and zzso Previously, an expressed sequence zzso of zzso zzso zzso corpus zzso zzso was mapped to zzso By isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso we have now identified a zzso processed zzso sequence zzso on zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso and other genes of the zzso zzso zzso were identified in several zzso species, indicating that the genes of this zzso have been susceptible to zzso The seven bovine genes are expressed at a higher level in zzso and zzso zzso compared with skeletal zzso
