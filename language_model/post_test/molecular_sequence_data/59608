The presence of zzso DNA sequence zzso of pediatric AIDS patients was investigated in a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso for the first and second zzso zzso regions of the zzso envelope zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso analysis yielded amplified DNA bands which exhibited length variations which were characteristic for each zzso The zzso products were cloned and the resulting clones demonstrated zzso of different lengths in a patient and between zzso Analysis of five clones from two different patients at the level of DNA sequencing indicates an extreme zzso in the zzso zzso DNA maximum similarity between all of the isolated clones ranged between 69 to zzso zzso between DNA sequences of the isolated clones and zzso strains of other parts of the world was also zzso The highest percentage of similarity that was found with known zzso zzso included the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequences also showed a high degree of similarity to the zzso B virus zzso The analyzed zzso sequences demonstrated the expected high degree of variation in the zzso region of the envelope gene and in some cases that the variation between zzso from the same patient may exceed the variation between the individual clones and the reference zzso zzso
