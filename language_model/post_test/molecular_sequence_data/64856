zzso surface protein zzso expression was studied during zzso in zzso and adult zzso using molecular and zzso zzso The effects of 24 zzso of insulation raising zzso temperatures to 39 degrees C on zzso expression in zzso sheep zzso were also zzso A 282 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified in total zzso extracts of sheep zzso which exhibited zzso identity at the zzso level with the equivalent region of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified only in adult zzso zzso and not in zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking round zzso nor in adult sheep brain, zzso heart, zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein was distributed predominantly on the zzso membrane and was also present on the anterior membrane of the zzso head in fresh, unheated sheep zzso zzso heating caused a zzso transient decrease in the percentage of zzso zzso zzso but did not change the pattern of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The results strongly suggest that zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso germ cells in sheep zzso and is arrayed on the membrane of the mature zzso zzso zzso heating appears to have few effects on zzso expression and distribution on zzso zzso
