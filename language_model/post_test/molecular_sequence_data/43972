zzso formation in early zzso is guided by zzso localized zzso and by zzso interactions between zzso In zzso eggs, localized molecules have been identified and some, such as zzso and zzso can specify cell fates by functioning as zzso or patterning zzso We have used differential screening to identify new zzso genes that regulate zzso zzso and we have isolated a new member of the zzso family of zzso zzso This zzso named zzso is expressed zzso and its transcripts are localized to the vegetal zzso of the zzso During early embryonic zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso primarily within vegetal cells that are zzso to form the zzso zzso expression of zzso begins at the onset of zzso within the zzso zzso of the marginal zzso zzso with its zzso expression pattern, zzso zzso in a zzso manner, a full spectrum of zzso genes that mark zzso across the zzso zzso from the blood through the zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso consistent with its vegetal zzso making zzso a good candidate for a maternal zzso of the zzso We tested whether zzso zzso is required for zzso formation by expressing a zzso zzso zzso form of zzso in zzso This treatment inhibited zzso formation and severely disrupted normal development, thereby establishing that zzso plays a critical role in embryonic zzso formation and body zzso
