The one- and two-dimensional protein patterns of zzso zzso zzso in the exponential and stationary zzso of growth were zzso zzso zzso showed that a 16 zzso protein was zzso in stationary phase as well as 2 h after an acid zzso and that it was not expressed when the bacteria reached the stationary phase in medium with limiting zzso zzso (5 or 10 g zzso in which the pH zzso was not as acid as in control cultures zzso zzso zzso 20 g zzso The results support the idea that this protein is expressed in response to the zzso environment and not in response to the growth zzso zzso PAGE showed that nine proteins were expressed only during the exponential phase and ten others only during the stationary zzso The 16 zzso band seen in one-dimensional zzso corresponded to a 16 zzso protein family observed on two-dimensional zzso gels, whose expression was increased zzso when the zzso pH reached a critical value below zzso The zzso sequences of proteins from two spots on the two-dimensional gels zzso of the 16 zzso zzso were determined and found to be zzso The zzso role of this protein family has not yet been zzso
