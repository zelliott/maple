An efficient vaccine against human zzso virus zzso must induce good cellular immune zzso To do this, it must be processed and presented by zzso cells, which are required for primary zzso zzso We have previously shown that a model zzso containing a short zzso zzso from zzso was zzso and presented in association with major zzso complex class I molecules by human zzso cells to specific zzso T zzso but the zzso zzso needed to be precisely zzso We have studied a longer zzso zzso and another zzso zzso currently being used in vaccine zzso Like the shorter zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso as assessed by zzso zzso The zzso were processed by zzso cells and presented to zzso T cells specific for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso of the Pol zzso was inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso but not by zzso This shows that it gained access to the zzso to be zzso by the zzso In contrast, presentation of the zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso but was inhibited by zzso a classical inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso activity, indicating an zzso processing zzso yielding to major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso the two zzso followed different zzso zzso both resulting in efficient presentation to zzso T zzso
