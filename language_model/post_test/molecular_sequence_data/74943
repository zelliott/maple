zzso zzso used to generate zzso zzso to proteins are of interest in the development of zzso The need to zzso them to a carrier protein for optimal zzso results in a number of problems including a possible immune response to the zzso Here we describe a new method of zzso an zzso zzso zzso referred to as multiple zzso zzso zzso which may render the need for a carrier protein zzso A zzso sequence derived from the human T cell zzso zzso zzso constant region was selected, and the zzso was zzso directly onto a branching zzso core with 8 copies of the zzso zzso linked to the core by the zzso zzso zzso The molecular weight of this structure was zzso of which only zzso represents the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso was highly zzso in mice and zzso allowing production of zzso and zzso zzso The majority of these zzso reacted with the zzso in its zzso form as well as its zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso reacted with the intact zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso that were recognized by the zzso included continuous zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso appeared to be most zzso There were no zzso to the central zzso zzso This method of direct synthesis of a zzso zzso provides accurate knowledge of the zzso and quantity of the zzso prior to zzso which is usually not the case when peptides are zzso to zzso The method is versatile because the possibility exists to zzso zzso with 16 or 32 zzso arms or to zzso zzso containing two different zzso
