Winter zzso contains both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and less active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The lower activity of zzso might be due to their lack of complete zzso motifs zzso In order to test the functional role of this putative zzso zzso zzso were introduced into the zzso or zzso regions of zzso which lack any zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso coli culture media as mature zzso proteins and zzso to zzso Surprisingly, the zzso activity decreased with the introduction of zzso zzso However, there was a corresponding decrease in zzso content as well as zzso stability and this would suggest a compromise in retaining zzso structure with the presence of zzso zzso These studies have brought new definitions of the roles of zzso motif zzso in type I zzso zzso
