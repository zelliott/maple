The zzso zzso repair zzso deals with zzso DNA zzso The tissue that receives by far the greatest exposure to zzso is the skin and we have investigated the possibility that expression of the zzso zzso repair zzso zzso may display different properties in the skin to deal with a more demanding role in that zzso zzso in a complex with zzso is the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We identified a novel zzso zzso in mouse skin that originates from an alternative upstream zzso zzso of this zzso transcript were low in embryonic skin and increased rapidly after birth, but there was no induction by zzso either in adult skin, or in a cultured zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso transcript were higher in zzso than pigmented mouse zzso but there was no difference in zzso protein levels and the expression of the zzso transcript was found to be determined by the zzso gene sequence rather than by coat zzso Using an zzso zzso the promoter for the zzso transcript was mapped to a region around 400 zzso upstream of the normal promoter, where a zzso element with known promoter activity was found in zzso but not in pigmented zzso
