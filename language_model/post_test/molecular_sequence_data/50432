We have examined the expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso by in zzso zzso to zzso from mice bearing zzso for the zzso zzso zzso alpha chain, zzso beta chain, or both zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso of transgenic mice carrying a single zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso comparable to normal zzso However, zzso zzso was zzso reduced in the zzso zzso from transgenic mice carrying both zzso zzso and zzso genes and expressing major zzso complex zzso class I zzso molecules necessary for positive selection of the transgenic zzso In contrast, zzso of transgenic mice also carrying both zzso zzso and zzso genes but expressing zzso molecules zzso that did not positively select the transgenic zzso displayed high levels of zzso zzso The low zzso zzso expression coincided with high transgenic zzso zzso surface expression and with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that binding of the zzso to self zzso molecules during positive selection zzso zzso zzso in cortical zzso and thereby prevents further zzso zzso zzso
