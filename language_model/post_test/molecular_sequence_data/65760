zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expressed on the surface of zzso that serves as the major zzso for the zzso family of zzso molecules and functions in zzso zzso and rolling on activated zzso and zzso Previous studies have implicated the highly zzso zzso domain of zzso in regulating zzso signaling of zzso zzso However, molecules that physically and functionally interact with this domain are not completely zzso Using a zzso zzso screen with the zzso domain of zzso as zzso a novel protein designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso search revealed that zzso was the human zzso for the previously identified mouse sorting zzso zzso zzso interaction between zzso and zzso was specific as indicated by zzso and motif zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso contains a zzso zzso domain that binds zzso and targets the zzso complex to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso did not zzso zzso signaling nor alter zzso zzso through zzso We conclude that zzso serves as a sorting zzso that cycles zzso into zzso with no impact on zzso zzso
