The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mimicking the zzso zzso zzso is used as a vaccine for the induction of an zzso immunity in patients with zzso zzso We tried to generate a zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso variable zzso connected by a zzso zzso as an alternative to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso mouse zzso cell line were amplified separately and assembled into a zzso gene with zzso DNA by the zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso gene was zzso into the zzso zzso zzso which allows the production of both zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso coli zzso cells were infected with zzso helper zzso to yield zzso zzso which display zzso fragments as a zzso fusion protein on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be selected by binding to the zzso zzso zzso after one round of panning and directly used to zzso zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso strain zzso was infected with an zzso zzso zzso previously screened by zzso zzso zzso zzso to express soluble zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be detected in the bacterial zzso by Western zzso and zzso The variable zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso were further zzso and compared with known zzso zzso
