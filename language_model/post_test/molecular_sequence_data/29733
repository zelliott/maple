zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is a zzso zzso involved in primary immune zzso We have investigated the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso proteins and its role in zzso zzso interactions and membrane positioning of zzso in polarized zzso zzso zzso binding zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso association between zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso This interaction was not essential for the binding of zzso to zzso Dynamic zzso zzso studies of cells demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the plasma membrane during zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso domain of zzso which lacks the consensus zzso zzso site, caused the zzso zzso of zzso A zzso zzso protein containing the zzso tail of zzso was targeted to the trailing zzso Point zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso in the zzso region of zzso significantly impaired both zzso binding and polarization of zzso zzso polarization of zzso was also impaired by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso Our results underscore the key role of specific zzso zzso within the zzso region of zzso for its zzso positioning at the trailing edge of zzso zzso
