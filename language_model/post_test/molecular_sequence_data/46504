zzso acid based affinity zzso zzso zzso offer several possible advantages over zzso as specific recognition elements in zzso zzso Besides offering improved cost and stability, zzso are ideal for rapid zzso analysis due to their low molecular weight and high negative zzso While zzso have proven zzso for zzso zzso analysis, demonstrating a fully integrated zzso zzso platform represents an important achievement toward low-cost zzso analysis, particularly for remote or resource poor settings where cost and ambient stability of zzso is a key zzso Here we perform and evaluate the suitability of zzso affinity zzso for two clinically relevant target zzso zzso using a known zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso in an integrated zzso zzso zzso Key steps of zzso mixing sample with zzso zzso buffer exchange, and zzso zzso of sample were successfully integrated zzso upstream of a zzso zzso analysis zzso This approach, utilizing a zzso membrane zzso here for zzso retention and zzso with sample, enables automated zzso for trace zzso in 10 zzso or zzso We addressed notable zzso interference from serum proteins by adding similar zzso acid competitors to suppress such interactions with the zzso zzso sensitivities were demonstrated and integrated zzso of sample provides an important means of further improving detection zzso zzso proved superior in many respects to zzso zzso particularly with regard to speed and resolution of zzso associated with specific binding to zzso
