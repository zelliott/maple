zzso mouse zzso cells were previously shown to be highly invasive when confronted with chicken heart zzso using zzso confronted zzso zzso This invasion could be inhibited by addition to the zzso of zzso fragments of a zzso zzso directed against zzso a protein associated with the surface of zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso the gene for zzso We show that it originates from zzso zzso and that zzso is a zzso zzso in this zzso We present evidence that the zzso gene is part of an zzso zzso two additional proteins which are highly similar to components of the zzso zzso transport systems of zzso bacteria, and we suggest that zzso is part of a zzso zzso transport system in zzso zzso a zzso zzso We discuss the influence of zzso and zzso zzso on contact zzso of locomotion of zzso zzso
