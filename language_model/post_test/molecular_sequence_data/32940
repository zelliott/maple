zzso is a zzso domain found in several zzso zzso Based on their zzso the zzso family members can be classified into three zzso which are represented by zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the zzso structure of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure forms a compact zzso fold zzso five zzso which best resembles the zzso zzso structure, among the known zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso structures are more similar to the zzso structure than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso lacked DNA binding activity, while those of zzso and the human zzso counterpart, zzso bound zzso The zzso in the zzso ability of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso might be due to a couple of zzso acid differences in the last zzso These results indicate that the zzso family has indeed zzso into three structural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso has further zzso into two functionally distinct zzso We also solved the structure of the zzso domain of zzso and demonstrated that it bound DNA with a similar mode to that of the zzso zzso zzso
