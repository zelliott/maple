zzso is a small zzso of zzso zzso zzso II participating in zzso and formed of two zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso are viable, with a strong sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain down to the first 57 zzso acids has no zzso growth zzso Thus, the critical part of zzso is limited to a zzso half that contacts the lobe of the second largest zzso zzso and forms a zzso motif with the zzso of the largest zzso zzso zzso has zzso to the zzso zzso factor, but zzso zzso for both proteins are indistinguishable from zzso single zzso In contrast, zzso zzso are lethal in cells lacking the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso In a zzso test, zzso physically interacts with zzso the largest zzso of zzso The interacting fragment, zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso belongs to a zzso zinc zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso This zzso is strongly reduced in zzso suggesting that zzso contributes to the recruitment of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
