Different complex structures of the pol gene have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences obtained from a group of 587 patients under treatment failure from zzso To analyze the mosaic structures of these viral sequences and to determine their zzso relationship, the zzso partial pol gene sequences of zzso zzso viruses were amplified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso relationships were determined by means of zzso zzso The analysis of the sequences showed multiple zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso reference zzso At least three different mosaic patterns were found compared to previously described zzso viruses with unequal distribution in the studied zzso The analysis also showed that zzso zzso zzso viruses with diverse mosaic structures are zzso related in their F segments and in selected B fragments with the F1 zzso and with zzso zzso viruses from Brazil, respectively, suggesting a common zzso zzso No association was observed between the prevalence of each mosaic pattern and the frequency of major zzso zzso in zzso and zzso
