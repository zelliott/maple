The complete zzso coding sequences were determined for 16 zzso isolated from zzso zzso and several wild zzso species including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis enabled the segregation of zzso into the established species bovine viral zzso zzso zzso zzso border disease virus zzso and classical zzso fever virus zzso For zzso five distinct zzso were identified, while zzso zzso and zzso were each subdivided into two zzso The virus zzso from zzso and deer as well as one zzso virus isolate belong to zzso Interestingly, the zzso from zzso and zzso are distinct from the established zzso zzso The zzso sequences from these two viruses are more similar to zzso than to the other zzso zzso zzso of the zzso evolutionary distances allowed a clear separation of the categories species, zzso and isolate only when the zzso viruses were considered as members of an additional zzso zzso Furthermore, the entire zzso coding sequences of a representative set of virus zzso covering all recognized species and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso based on the zzso region was identical with that obtained with the zzso zzso
