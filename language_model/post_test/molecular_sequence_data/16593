The zzso acid sequence of a zzso like zzso , named zzso II, isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso sequencing of the peptides which was derived from zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso II consisted of 233 zzso acids and showed conservation of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso family zzso zzso in its zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso acid, zzso was determined using zzso zzso This zzso contains zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso II was zzso zzso in sequence to zzso and zzso I from the same snake zzso and it was 67, 75, 31 and zzso zzso in sequences to zzso zzso 2, human zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso II lacked zzso zzso zzso loop, as well as its functionally important zzso zzso zzso
