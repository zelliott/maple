We isolated a zzso zzso zzso a membrane zzso protein zzso zzso virus zzso zzso protein from a zzso library of zzso cells, in which wild zzso strains were zzso zzso cells contain zzso zzso zzso products zzso different zzso tails like human zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso was zzso identical to that of human zzso zzso cell zzso expressed on zzso cells was recognized by zzso zzso against human zzso and served as a potent zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was as effective as human zzso in human factor zzso zzso zzso Thus, the high zzso zzso of zzso cells can in part be attributed to an zzso zzso that is structurally and functionally similar to human zzso
