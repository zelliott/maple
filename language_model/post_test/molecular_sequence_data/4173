A highly zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression through its ability to zzso zzso While a single component of zzso zzso or a related zzso can perform this function in zzso the other components appear to zzso the activity and specificity of the complex in zzso Here we describe the cloning of zzso a 189 zzso human zzso of zzso zzso zzso a constituent of zzso zzso By comparing zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso we define three zzso common to all family zzso A putative DNA binding domain, or zzso zzso zzso zzso may function in zzso zzso to zzso Two other zzso unique to zzso zzso zzso and zzso map to the zzso We show that zzso mediates binding to zzso gene 1 zzso a human zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso also appear capable of interacting with each zzso Using an zzso raised against zzso of zzso we detected zzso in zzso zzso complexes derived from mouse zzso
