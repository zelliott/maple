The structure of zzso regions of classes 1, II, III, zzso and zzso of canine zzso was characterized by zzso and the expression of these zzso in canine zzso was examined by zzso protection zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line was established and the altered expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences in zzso regions corresponding to classes I, II and zzso were identical to those of humans and mice, but those in classes III and zzso showed slight differences among zzso zzso revealed that classes I and zzso were widely distributed, but classes II, III and zzso were restricted to the zzso Because zzso could clearly distinguish the expression of class zzso from that of class zzso it was thought to be more useful than northern zzso for analysis of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso displayed a significant increase in class zzso as compared with zzso cells, suggesting that altered expression of class zzso was associated with zzso resistance in these cell zzso
