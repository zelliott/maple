zzso zzso in isolated zzso and binding tests have recently shown that two zzso with the sequence zzso zzso zzso isolated from skin extracts of zzso zzso and named zzso I and II, respectively, possess a higher affinity and selectivity for zzso receptors than any other known natural zzso Since much evidence supports the role of spinal zzso sites in producing zzso effects, we investigated whether analgesia might be detected by direct spinal zzso administration of zzso II zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso II and zzso a potent zzso zzso were compared at different zzso times by means of the zzso zzso The zzso II produced a zzso zzso of the zzso response, which lasted zzso zzso depending on the dose and appeared to be of shorter duration than the analgesia produced in rats after zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of infused or injected zzso II was completely abolished by zzso the highly selective delta zzso These results confirm the involvement of delta receptors in spinal zzso activity in the zzso
