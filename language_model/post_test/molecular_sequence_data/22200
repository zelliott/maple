To further understand the evolutionary dynamics of the regulatory interactions underlying development, we expand on our previous analysis of zzso and compare the structure and function of the zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our analysis shows that although the expression patterns and functional protein zzso of zzso are zzso between zzso and zzso the zzso sequences are zzso Upon closer investigation, we find that these highly zzso zzso sequences zzso the same regulatory information necessary for zzso zzso and the terminal system to drive zzso zzso The binding sites for these zzso factors differ in the zzso number, zzso and position between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and we were unable to establish zzso between binding sites from each zzso This implies that the zzso and zzso zzso sites have evolved de zzso in the 100 million years since these species zzso However, in transgenic zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is able to drive the same expression pattern as zzso zzso zzso zzso during the rapid evolution of zzso sequences individual binding sites are continually lost and gained, but the zzso output is maintained by zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso
