zzso are the major components of zzso the protein complexes that link zzso to zzso proteins zzso zzso in coated pits and zzso The plasma membrane zzso contains an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso while the zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso A partial zzso clone zzso zzso was isolated from a bovine brain expression library by screening with zzso and was used to obtain a zzso clone from a mouse brain library containing the full coding zzso The identity of the clones was confirmed by protein zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was found to be zzso to that of zzso with several stretches of identical zzso acids or conservative zzso in the first approximately 70 zzso and zzso identity zzso zzso zzso was seen between zzso and zzso Like both zzso and zzso zzso has a zzso and zzso hinge region, dividing it into zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso was constructed from the mouse and bovine zzso and zzso into zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso was carried out using an zzso which recognizes an zzso present on the zzso but not found on the zzso zzso The construct was found to have a distribution typical of zzso zzso Using this zzso system, it should now be possible to exchange zzso between zzso and zzso to try to find out how zzso are targeted to the appropriate membrane compartment of the cell, and how they recruit the appropriate receptors into the coated zzso
