The structure of the zzso region of zzso T zzso is zzso among the muscle zzso zzso and is also regulated by alternative zzso zzso This region does not contain binding sites for other thin filament zzso but zzso of its structure affects the zzso regulation of muscle zzso Here we report a truncated cardiac zzso produced during zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and protein zzso reconstruction determined that it is generated by a zzso modification selectively removing the zzso variable region and preserving the zzso core structure of zzso zzso zzso extraction of cardiac muscle fibers promoted production of the zzso truncated cardiac zzso zzso indicating a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and is known to degrade zzso Supporting a role of zzso in producing zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the level of zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment of the cardiac zzso and zzso complex specifically reproduced zzso In contrast, zzso treatment of isolated cardiac zzso resulted in zzso degradation, suggesting that this structural modification is relevant to zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso treatment of transgenic mouse cardiac zzso zzso fast skeletal muscle zzso produced similar zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso despite different zzso acid sequences at the zzso zzso With the functional consequences of removing the zzso variable region of zzso the zzso zzso modification of zzso may act as an acute mechanism to adjust muscle zzso under stress zzso
