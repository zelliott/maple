This chapter presents an overview of the application of modern zzso methods in structural studies of the DNA binding zzso zzso of nuclear hormone zzso The zzso studied so far comprise those of the zzso estrogen, zzso acid and zzso X zzso zzso zzso has allowed the zzso of the first structures of this family of zzso zinc fingers, which led to a better understanding of their role in gene zzso zzso studies provided insight in zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies, applying zzso have provided deeper insight into a diversity of issues concerning these zzso ranging from backbone dynamics and metal coordination to the interaction of these zzso with their DNA target zzso From this work a picture emerges of a class of closely related zzso proteins which, despite their strong sequence zzso exhibit interesting structural and functional differences between members of different zzso
