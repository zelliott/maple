The zzso expressed zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso 3 zzso factor is activated in response to virus infection by zzso events that target a cluster of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso end of the zzso To delineate the minimal zzso sites required for zzso zzso several point zzso were generated and tested for zzso potential and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alone was sufficient to induce type I zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso with a novel zzso zzso we show for the first time that, in zzso zzso is zzso on zzso following zzso virus infection, expression of viral zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso within the zzso zzso cluster is targeted in zzso for zzso following virus infection and plays an essential role in zzso zzso The inability of the zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso in zzso cells suggests that other major pathways may be involved in zzso zzso following zzso zzso 4 zzso
