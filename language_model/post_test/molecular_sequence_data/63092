zzso is a leading risk factor for the development of cardiovascular zzso Data from human and animal studies suggest that zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso is important for blood pressure zzso Several zzso zzso in the Japanese population have been found to be associated with zzso The product of one of these zzso zzso is zzso within the zzso terminal zzso zzso domain, the region responsible for plasma zzso The functional consequence of this zzso and its potential link to the development of hypertension, however, are not zzso In this study, we showed that zzso was a weaker inhibitor of zzso zzso signaling than zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso bound to the plasma membrane less efficiently than zzso zzso zzso is one of the basic zzso positioned to stabilize zzso zzso interaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso studies of this domain showed that the zzso zzso prevented proper zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that decreasing the zzso length and flexibility at zzso prevented proper zzso zzso association and function of zzso Finally, the zzso protein did not behave as a zzso interfering zzso Thus, our data are consistent with the notion that a zzso zzso zzso in human zzso produces a zzso zzso that may lead to altered zzso zzso zzso and contribute to the development of hypertension in affected zzso
