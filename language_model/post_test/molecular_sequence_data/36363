A zzso zzso that has been employed to inhibit zzso viral expression in chronically infected zzso cells was examined for its ability to associate with zzso zzso zzso The relationship between cellular zzso concentration and the zzso target zzso is important to the selection of an animal model, evaluation of potential side effects, and understanding the actions of a zzso useful zzso zzso zzso cells were harvested from zzso peripheral blood, bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cell zzso that bind the zzso were distinguished by zzso flow zzso employing a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to selected cell surface molecules associated with unique zzso of zzso Very little zzso binding was observed in peripheral blood zzso cells or zzso T cells, but substantial numbers of cells, primarily B cells from bone zzso and zzso accumulated the zzso The zzso zzso was increased significantly in zzso populations when the cells were zzso zzso with either zzso zzso a T cell zzso or zzso zzso a B cell zzso These data clearly demonstrate the ability of zzso zzso to bind to unique cell populations in suspension, allowing simultaneous zzso zzso analysis, suggesting that zzso zzso may be a useful bridge between in zzso molecular biology techniques and in zzso cell zzso In addition, these data provide optimism concerning the in zzso treatment of chronically infected zzso patients using zzso zzso
