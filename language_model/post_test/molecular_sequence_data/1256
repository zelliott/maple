zzso are an ancient zzso lineage that last shared a common zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso about 170 million years zzso zzso of their immune genes is allowing us to gain insights into the evolutionary processes that lead to the zzso immune zzso Here we describe the characterization of the first zzso clones zzso zzso receptors from a zzso Two zzso zzso zzso ( zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing complete zzso joining and constant regions were zzso The zzso zzso constant region shares approximately 37% zzso acid identity with other zzso zzso constant region zzso The two variable regions belong to the zzso group C, which also contains V genes from humans, mice, cattle and zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso containing the entire constant region was isolated and zzso It shares about zzso identity with other zzso zzso constant region zzso The zzso zzso belongs to zzso group A, which also contains V genes from various zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that, like in other zzso species, there is only one zzso constant region copy in the zzso zzso but at least two zzso constant zzso
