To assess the role of zzso in the maintenance of the immune privilege of the zzso zzso zzso gene transfer was used to express a zzso specific retinal zzso rat soluble retinal zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso In this study we report the stable, long term zzso of rat retinal zzso into zzso zzso to zzso was zzso by challenging the zzso zzso animals with zzso peptides in zzso and monitoring the time course and severity of experimental zzso zzso zzso The resulting data showed a correlation between the zzso of zzso zzso and the loss of zzso to zzso The development of resistance to zzso induction supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso contributes to retinal immune zzso
