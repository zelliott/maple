Most zzso zzso ranging from protein zzso factors to small zzso zzso agents, recognize duplex DNA with some degree of sequence zzso zzso this binding specificity is important for zzso molecular zzso and medicinal zzso Some information can be obtained through the study of defined DNA zzso but a full picture of a zzso binding specificity can only be obtained through zzso means, zzso vast libraries of sequences are zzso Several zzso methods have been developed for the study of zzso zzso all of which require the physical separation of zzso DNA from zzso DNA before amplification by zzso Here, we describe the novel zzso method zzso zzso Protection zzso and zzso zzso zzso selects for zzso zzso through their zzso of an zzso zzso by a type zzso restriction zzso zzso templates for subsequent zzso zzso We have used zzso to identify the preferred binding sites of zzso zzso and small molecules on duplex zzso Unlike conventional zzso methods, zzso is amenable to the study of zzso of native zzso with relatively unknown identities and zzso Thus, zzso is a powerful, zzso general method for the zzso determination of zzso specificity and a functional means of zzso zzso
