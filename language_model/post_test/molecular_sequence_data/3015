Using the zzso zzso drug zzso as a selective agent, zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso that could not make zzso zzso were zzso Four independent zzso that could not make zzso or the zzso intermediate zzso were examined more zzso These zzso contained zzso inserted in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tuberculosis gene zzso which we have named zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso restored the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is essential for zzso production and that zzso zzso in a portion of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were found in all 11 zzso that have been fully zzso and that are known to make zzso Four of these zzso (all from members of the zzso zzso coded for proteins zzso over the entire length of the zzso zzso zzso but in seven zzso two separate genes were found to code for proteins zzso with either the zzso or zzso portions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli produced a fusion protein of the molecular mass predicted from the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso as well as three other zzso proteins of significantly smaller size, which are thought to be zzso products of the zzso fusion zzso
