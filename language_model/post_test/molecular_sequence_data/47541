We describe embryonic development of the zzso silk zzso To extend the analysis further we isolated a zzso counterpart gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso When compared with the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso the identity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the presence of a single zzso zzso transcript of zzso zzso We analyzed the expression pattern of the zzso zzso transcript during zzso by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first detected in the zzso primordial cells at around embryonic stage zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso increased, and the high expression level was maintained until zzso At embryonic stage 19 the transcript was also detected in the zzso zzso region of the zzso segment from where the silk zzso zzso By the zzso stage zzso stage 23), the silk zzso was zzso and, interestingly, the zzso zzso transcript was restricted to the anterior silk zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso plays a role in the formation of the trachea and the anterior silk zzso
