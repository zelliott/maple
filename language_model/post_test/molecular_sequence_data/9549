zzso pancreatic zzso cells zzso play a pivotal role in the development of pancreatic diseases, especially chronic zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso have become a focal point of interest as zzso regulators of gene expression via their interaction with the 3' untranslated region of target zzso which results in gene zzso We examined the relative expression of zzso zzso and zzso and their target zzso zzso during zzso of rat zzso and determined their effects on zzso of rat zzso in zzso 

zzso and zzso expression levels were analyzed in zzso and activated zzso by zzso zzso In addition, the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso of activated zzso were investigated by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also analyzed by real-time zzso and Western zzso 

During zzso of zzso from the zzso stage to activated stage, zzso and zzso were zzso while zzso expression was zzso zzso zzso zzso levels by zzso and zzso administration greatly reduced zzso protein levels, and significantly induced zzso in activated zzso 

zzso and zzso could induce zzso of rat zzso by targeting zzso
