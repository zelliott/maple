Basic design features of the zzso portion in parallel alpha beta barrels in known protein structures are zzso in the context of a model of a regular zzso A formal description of the relationships between zzso twist, number of strands in the sheet and barrel dimensions is zzso and the underlying physical principles are zzso zzso suggest that the major constraints on the geometry of the zzso portion of the barrel come from the requirements to have optimal zzso interactions between zzso and to closely pack zzso acid zzso in the barrel interior so as to exclude bulk zzso In addition, we show how the zzso model and the ensuing zzso can serve to derive useful geometric and graphic tools for zzso protein design de zzso We then illustrate how these tools are used to determine that the requirement to have a closed regular zzso zzso surface zzso no particular constraints on the geometry zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the role of the zzso acid sequence in determining the observed structures remains a major zzso zzso comparisons of known alpha zzso structures (and zzso acid zzso with each other, and with zzso fragments from other protein crystal structures, reveal only a limited number of common zzso zzso These belong to characteristic alpha beta 1 and alpha beta 3 loop families previously described in alpha beta zzso and occur at least once in nearly all the alpha zzso structures zzso
