zzso zzso from 26 patients with zzso due to an epidemic strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 of whom died, revealed an zzso zzso zzso at 61 zzso There was a statistically significant correlate zzso zzso zzso between survival and zzso G to the zzso zzso The zzso was identified by sequencing positive clones obtained by screening a zzso expression library of zzso with pooled zzso from patients taken after the zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with the zzso zzso on zzso The zzso zzso was obtained by searching the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso databases, and the whole protein was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence showed zzso with ABC zzso with paired Walker A and Walker B motifs and zzso zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso mapping of the derived zzso acid sequence with zzso from patients who had recovered from zzso zzso delineated seven zzso Three of these zzso represented by peptides 1 zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso were zzso and used to isolate human zzso zzso from a zzso zzso display zzso zzso zzso against peptides 1 and 2 gave zzso reductions in organ colony counts, compared with control groups, in a mouse model of the zzso This study suggests the potential role of an ABC zzso as a target for zzso
