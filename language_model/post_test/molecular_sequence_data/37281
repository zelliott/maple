The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso show unusual sequence features when compared to the more than 35 zzso zzso sequences currently zzso We therefore analyzed the in zzso assembly of these two zzso by electron zzso using chicken zzso B2 as a zzso While zzso zzso usually appear as a rod carrying two zzso at one end, these zzso are absent from zzso zzso which lacks the central zzso region of the tail zzso The deletion of 14 zzso or two zzso from the coiled zzso rod domain of the single zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso assembled from the zzso zzso exhibit a zzso reduction of the true zzso repeat compared to that of chicken zzso B2 zzso We speculate that the zzso pattern in the zzso zzso zzso arises from a relative zzso between zzso and/or a positioning of the zzso tail domain relative to the central rod that is distinct from that observed in chicken zzso B2 zzso Here we show that a nuclear zzso can assemble in zzso into zzso intermediate filaments zzso zzso zzso in low zzso strength zzso at a pH of zzso provides a stable population of zzso zzso Some implications of this filament formation are zzso
