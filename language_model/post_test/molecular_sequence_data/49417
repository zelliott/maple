One of the most common forms of functional interaction among zzso factors is the more than additive effect at promoters harboring multiple copies of a response zzso The mechanisms that enable or control zzso at such compound response elements are poorly zzso We recently defined a common motif within the negative regulatory regions of multiple factors that operates by regulating their zzso zzso We have identified such a zzso control zzso motif embedded within the zzso zzso of zzso protein alpha zzso a key regulator of energy zzso and cellular zzso A zzso zzso zzso substitution within the SC motif does not alter zzso activity from a single site but leads to enhanced zzso from synthetic or natural compound response zzso The sequence of SC motifs zzso with the recently defined consensus zzso modification site, and we find that the SC motif is the major site of both zzso and zzso modification in zzso Furthermore, the disruption of SC motif function is accompanied by loss of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso interacts directly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and can be zzso in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso has zzso activity and enhances both zzso and zzso modification of zzso in zzso and in zzso Our results indicate that zzso modification of SC motifs provides a means to rapidly control higher order interactions among zzso factors and suggests that zzso may be a general mechanism to limit zzso zzso
