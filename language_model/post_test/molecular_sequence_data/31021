zzso zzso zzso is zzso by protein zzso C at multiple zzso Most of the zzso is incorporated in the zzso light chain although some zzso is incorporated in the heavy zzso zzso of the zzso light chain of zzso zzso is 10 times faster than the zzso of smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso light chain is first zzso at a zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso sites of the zzso light chain are estimated as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso C resulted in an additional zzso site which, on the basis of limited zzso appears to be either zzso or zzso zzso by protein zzso C causes an zzso of zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso by zzso light chain zzso zzso of zzso activity is due to a decreased affinity of zzso for zzso and no change in zzso is zzso It is shown that zzso zzso also exhibits the zzso to zzso zzso transition as judged by zzso and gel zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso is paralleled with the zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso C affects neither the zzso transition nor the zzso filament zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso is not due to the change in the zzso zzso
