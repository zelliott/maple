zzso sequences of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso were zzso to determine genetic diversity, zzso zzso positive and negative selection sites and potential changes in the predicted zzso 5 zzso A hypothetical zzso containing all selected sites was constructed to determine its zzso These sequences corresponded to zzso obtained 10 years apart zzso 18 zzso and a second set zzso zzso zzso from 2000 to zzso zzso to zzso virus zzso decreased from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso Three highly variable regions were found in zzso zzso usage was different in both sets for zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso sequences used zzso more similar to those present in highly expressed pig genes compared to the zzso zzso Twenty four sites of positive selection and 20 sites of negative selection were found in zzso most of them in zzso zzso Additional zzso in zzso of zzso was common in zzso but some sequences lack a zzso site in zzso The hypothetical zzso was only zzso similar to zzso and was less zzso Taking together these results suggest that zzso is still adapting to pig zzso
