Whereas zzso cells produce zzso by a base exchange reaction from zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso from zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and shown to have a molecular mass of 23 zzso The activity is dependent on either zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The zzso specifically transfers the zzso group from zzso or zzso to zzso but not to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene zzso the zzso was cloned by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein comprises 279 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso The primary translate zzso zzso processing to the zzso more active zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains several putative zzso regions and resembles that of the zzso zzso zzso but not those of the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso The sequence also contains the local, zzso region found in zzso catalyzing the transfer of the zzso zzso from zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso is zzso in the exponential phase, but decreases when cells enter the stationary zzso The zzso is zzso at a single zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso with a zzso decrease in zzso activity, but the primary translation product is not zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso probably due to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also by zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso whereas zzso and zzso are zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in a coordinate manner with other zzso zzso The upstream regulatory region of the zzso gene responsible for the zzso regulation was zzso An zzso zzso zzso (R zzso A or zzso plays an important role in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
