Both zzso elements and host cell proteins can significantly affect zzso zzso processing and viral gene zzso Previously, we determined that the zzso zzso zzso zzso within the terminal zzso of zzso not only reduces use of the adjacent 3' zzso site but also prevents zzso export of the zzso viral zzso to the zzso In this report, we demonstrate that loss of zzso viral zzso export is correlated with the zzso of 3' end processing by the zzso Furthermore, we find that the host factor zzso a zzso of zzso protein zzso is able to reverse the block to viral zzso export zzso by the zzso The reversal is associated with a stimulation of 3' end processing of the zzso viral zzso Our findings identify a novel activity for the zzso and zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the observations provide an explanation for how zzso an exclusively nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso of the affected zzso Our finding that zzso is also able to enhance 3' end processing of a zzso zzso raises the possibility that it may play a similar role in regulating host gene zzso
