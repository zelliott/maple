To contribute to the identification and analysis of novel zzso we undertook the study of a zzso clone in the zzso region of human zzso The cloned zzso was previously observed to have a high number of zzso zzso zzso In this zzso stretch of DNA we have identified sequence zzso to the zzso zzso gene including its potential regulatory zzso This paper describes the zzso zzso of this gene and its mapping to the zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
