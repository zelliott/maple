A zzso study was carried out on a strain, designated zzso which was isolated from a zzso zzso enriched from zzso of the Pacific zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso with the highest sequence similarity zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso whereas sequence similarities with other species were less than 93 zzso The zzso sequence similarity of both zzso and zzso genes of strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso However, the protein sequence similarities of the zzso and zzso genes of strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso trees based on these zzso genes showed that strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed a distinct lineage in the zzso The zzso zzso value between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso was 43 zzso zzso zzso could also be differentiated from zzso zzso zzso based on the repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was 49 zzso The combined zzso and zzso data showed that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
