A truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso originally identified in mouse zzso germ cells, is zzso expressed in human cancer cell lines of various zzso This alternative transcript originates in the 15th zzso of the human zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso mouse truncated zzso zzso is a strong zzso of the zzso zzso zzso both in zzso cells and in mouse zzso In the present work, we report that human zzso zzso and protein are expressed in zzso zzso cancer zzso We have identified two regions in the 15th and 16th zzso of the human zzso gene that show zzso with sequences in the zzso zzso promoter within the 16th zzso of mouse zzso We also show that nuclear factors present in zzso cells bind to discrete sequences of the mouse zzso zzso Moreover, Western zzso analysis of 23 primary prostate zzso indicated that zzso was expressed in approximately zzso of the tumors at less advanced stages zzso grade 4 to 6) and in zzso of those at more advanced stages zzso grade 7 to zzso whereas it was not expressed in benign zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for the truncated zzso amplified from both zzso cells and zzso zzso confirmed the existence in prostate cancer cells of a transcript arising from the 15th zzso of human zzso We also show that zzso zzso cells and zzso tumors have higher levels of zzso zzso than zzso zzso cells or zzso tumors, and that zzso of zzso in zzso cells caused a dramatic increase in zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso a zzso protein zzso by zzso in zzso is zzso only in prostate tumors expressing zzso Indeed, both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were observed in all of the three grade 7 to 9 tumors analyzed that expressed zzso Our data describe for the first time the existence of a truncated zzso protein in primary tumors and show a correlation between zzso expression and zzso of the zzso zzso in the advanced stages of the zzso Thus, these results might pave the way for the zzso of a novel zzso in zzso transformation of prostate zzso
