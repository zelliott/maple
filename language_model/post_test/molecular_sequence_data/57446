The zzso nuclear factor zzso B is believed to be important in the zzso of many cellular systems and mainly during zzso zzso zzso B zzso has also been implicated in the process of differentiation as a cell zzso to a more mature and functional zzso As induction of differentiation equals growth zzso we undertook this study in order to establish the role of zzso B in cell growth and zzso Thus we employed the well described zzso cellular system that expresses zzso zzso amounts of zzso B and is susceptible to zzso B induction by various biological or chemical zzso We also used known zzso of differentiation like zzso zzso and zzso that interact via their corresponding surface receptors found on zzso zzso We first studied by Northern analysis the possible correlation between zzso and zzso B precursor zzso zzso We witnessed that all three zzso were able to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso levels, events zzso in zzso with induction of differentiation as assessed by the induction of zzso surface zzso It is known that zzso is capable of inducing nuclear zzso B activity in zzso as the cells progress to a more mature zzso Therefore we examined whether the other two zzso could do the same during the time they lead the cells to a differentiated zzso If this was the case, nuclear zzso of zzso B should be obtained by the same zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
