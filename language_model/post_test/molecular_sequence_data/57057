zzso is a zzso protein that interacts with the zzso gene zzso promoter zzso We previously reported that zzso binds within the zzso zzso and zzso regions, which contain the zzso zzso In the present study, we have zzso zzso from the nuclear extract of zzso cells, a zzso cell line derived from human zzso leukemia zzso cells, using sequential zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and a DNA affinity column consisting of a repetitive synthetic zzso motif coupled to zzso zzso runs as a single protein of 75 zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and gel mobility shift competition zzso with zzso promoters revealed that the zzso motif is a positive regulatory element of zzso gene and that the motif is important for zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be involved in the positive regulation of the zzso gene zzso
