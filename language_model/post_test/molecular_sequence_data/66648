We have studied the dynamics of de zzso zzso zzso in the regulatory region of one of the zzso gene zzso during mouse development by sodium zzso zzso zzso pattern was examined at embryonic day zzso and adult in kidney and zzso while in the liver the same exercise has been done in zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and in zzso In the liver at zzso zzso all the 47 zzso sites (including a zzso island from zzso to zzso zzso at zzso regulatory region of zzso were zzso Random zzso zzso from zzso zzso and continues in 5 zzso and in the zzso In the kidney at zzso zzso 26 zzso were examined zzso the zzso island zzso and all of them were zzso but the fetal zzso had at least a few sites considerably zzso In the adult there was a low level zzso in the zzso on the other hand, in the zzso all the zzso were zzso except a few sites and certain sites were totally zzso Thus in the adult, the level of zzso was much higher than in the fetal zzso On the other hand zzso zzso revealed that the extent of expression of zzso was higher in embryonic stages than in the zzso Thus zzso is a good paradigm to support that the zzso zzso of zzso and its expression pattern show an inverse zzso
