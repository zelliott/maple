zzso requires a complex series of genetic changes often involving multiple zzso and the zzso of multiple zzso zzso We presently examined the effect of the zzso zzso gene on the zzso and zzso potential of zzso cloned rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso transformed and zzso zzso produce reduced levels of zzso (a putative zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso 1) transcripts and zzso compared with zzso zzso produce increased levels of zzso zzso zzso IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts and zzso compared with zzso zzso and are zzso and zzso in both nude mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso gene display a zzso in cellular zzso and gene expression to that of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cells zzso albeit with extended zzso zzso both zzso and zzso potential that is not related directly to the final level of zzso or zzso zzso or the zzso zzso transforming zzso Development of zzso potential is, however, directly correlated with a reduction in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso levels and an enhanced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, expression of additional zzso zzso such as the RB gene and zzso or genes associated with zzso in other model systems, such as major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is not altered in a consistent manner during in zzso transformation suppression or escape from zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso suppression of the zzso zzso is associated with a distinct program of gene expression changes zzso by altered rates of zzso and zzso zzso levels of specific zzso and zzso zzso These data support a model of zzso zzso in zzso cells that involves a direct zzso in the zzso of specific combinations of zzso genes and zzso genes that are regulated zzso in the process of tumor zzso
