zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso B on two sites, zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso respectively, inhibitor 2 on a zzso zzso and zzso zzso at sites 2 and zzso The zzso sites zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are dependent on prior zzso at site A whereas site A zzso is decreased by prior zzso at sites zzso and zzso To study the zzso recognition sites and the zzso zzso the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso B and inhibitor 2 were determined and compared to each other and to zzso zzso sites zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso containing the two zzso sites of zzso B is zzso and the sequence of the zzso zzso site of inhibitor 2 is zzso This inhibitor 2 site is identical with the site zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that at least some of the sites zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 72 of inhibitor 2, and sites zzso and 4 of zzso zzso contain a zzso flanked by a zzso zzso However, as zzso did not zzso a series of peptides containing the zzso zzso this minimum consensus sequence is not sufficient for zzso by zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
