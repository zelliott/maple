The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been solved at zzso A resolution zzso et zzso zzso The zzso forms a zzso of two identical zzso The structure shows a new zzso architecture and a novel and unique zzso zzso Each zzso of the protein forms a separate zzso zzso the requirements on the zzso interface are zzso As a consequence, the interactions between the zzso are weaker and zzso at the zzso interface are more zzso Thus, the zzso interface zzso its relevance for a zzso of plant zzso zzso and the formation of zzso becomes even more difficult to zzso
