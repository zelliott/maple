zzso editing by zzso zzso generates zzso and protein diversity through the zzso modification of single zzso in zzso zzso Few zzso zzso edited genes have been identified despite evidence that many more should zzso Here we identify zzso pairs of zzso elements as a major target for editing in the human zzso An experimental demonstration in 43 genes was extended by a broader zzso analysis of more than 100,000 human zzso We find that zzso human zzso zzso are subject to zzso editing at more than zzso sites, and our data further suggest that the vast majority of zzso zzso than zzso are targeted in zzso by the editing zzso The editing levels of zzso zzso correlate with distance and zzso between zzso repeats and vary in different zzso zzso zzso duplexes targeted by zzso editing are formed zzso whereas editing due to zzso zzso appears to be zzso We present evidence that these editing events can lead to the zzso creation or elimination of zzso signals affecting alternatively spliced zzso zzso The analysis suggests that modification of repetitive elements is a zzso activity for zzso editing with significant implications for cellular gene zzso
