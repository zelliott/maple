zzso of zzso and zzso two divergent promoters from zzso coli, depends on the synergistic action of zzso and zzso The reaction involves a common regulatory region located in between and zzso multiple binding elements for both regulatory zzso The binding of zzso and zzso to this region is known to result in the formation of a zzso structure that is responsible for zzso zzso This paper presents genetic data which together with previous results, provide compelling evidence that this zzso structure is also responsible for zzso zzso The zzso that this structure or elements zzso play in the zzso of zzso is zzso by monitoring both the occupancy of the zzso zzso sites zzso 1 and 2) and the activity of different zzso zzso in strains containing increasing amounts of active zzso A truncated zzso promoter zzso only zzso sites 1 and 2 forms a minimal zzso promoter whose activity is limited by the occupancy of these zzso One role of the zzso structure formed by zzso and zzso when bound to the entire regulatory region is to ensure high occupation of zzso sites 1 and 2, but it is not its only zzso Some elements of this structure, namely the zzso site 1, located at zzso and the zzso zzso sites, seem to play a direct role in zzso zzso besides their participation in the assembly of the zzso zzso
