zzso zzso is a zzso originally identified from medium zzso by an zzso virus transformed cell zzso zzso has been shown to increase zzso zzso from zzso and T cells, significantly enhance zzso activity in both of these cell types, and promote the development of zzso immune zzso These properties make zzso an attractive candidate for the development of various clinical protocols ranging from the treatment of viral diseases to tumor zzso The initial attempts to use zzso in the treatment of tumors demonstrated toxicity at potentially therapeutic zzso To circumvent the toxicity associated with zzso administration, the authors have developed an adoptive zzso protocol that uses zzso for a brief period during ex zzso T cell zzso They show that zzso conditioning may be achieved without altering the growth characteristics of the in zzso expanding T zzso T cells generated in the presence of zzso show a shift to a zzso dominant zzso The zzso cells are more potent killers in zzso and in zzso as assessed by zzso zzso and tumor zzso The ability to harness the potent zzso generating potential of zzso while avoiding its associated in zzso toxicity has the potential to benefit a large number of clinical trial protocols using adoptive transfer of T cells specific for tumors, zzso or zzso zzso
