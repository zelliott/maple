We have zzso the function of the open reading frame zzso zzso The deletion of this zzso from zzso III does not affect the physiology of the corresponding zzso strain enough to give a distinct zzso zzso a zzso analysis reveals high zzso between this zzso and the zzso genes zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso We have therefore tested the possibility that zzso is the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was previously shown to be zzso by its final product zzso In zzso coli this zzso is assured by the regulatory zzso Using a zzso strain carrying a complete deletion of zzso we have observed the loss of such zzso These results together with the zzso predictions show that zzso encodes the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso
