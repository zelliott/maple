zzso instability is a zzso observed in tumors cells that have defects in DNA mismatch repair zzso Most markers used for detecting zzso instability are zzso and zzso repeats, but one zzso repeat zzso has been reported to be useful for this zzso The zzso repeat is actually a complex zzso made up of approximately 14 zzso zzso plus various other zzso zzso In order to determine the nature of the instability of the this zzso we have used a zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human cells to compare the zzso rates and the types of zzso of zzso to those of the related simple repeats zzso zzso and zzso We found that the complex repeat was the most stable of the repeats examined in cells deficient in zzso the zzso was less stable, while the zzso were the least zzso In zzso cells, the relative rates were zzso the zzso repeat was the least stable, the zzso was more stable, and the zzso were the most zzso These results suggest that zzso and the pure zzso have relatively low rates of errors during zzso but that the errors in these repeats are corrected less efficiently than those in the smaller zzso Because of their high rate of instability in zzso cells, zzso and other zzso repeats appear to lack specificity for detection of tumors with defective zzso
