By using a zzso I zzso zzso we have zzso a factor by DNA affinity zzso that binds to the minimal zzso region of the zzso zzso gene and subsequently identified the protein as the core zzso zzso This zzso zzso of a core zzso as a putative zzso DNA binding protein was due to a previously unknown property of zzso to interact with DNA in a periodic zzso Moreover, we found that each of the individual core zzso but not zzso zzso or high mobility group protein 1, bound to the zzso zzso to give a repetitive zzso I footprint pattern with a zzso of about 10 base pairs, which is approximately one turn of the DNA zzso In addition, preparations containing the core zzso zzso or zzso yielded identical periodic zzso I footprint patterns on several different promoter and zzso zzso These findings suggest that there are zzso zzso interactions between zzso core zzso that result from an zzso of the overall DNA structure such as the zzso rather than a specific zzso We have also shown that zzso zzso can repress initiation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso The phenomena described here may reflect zzso interactions in zzso stretches of zzso and could be involved in some aspects of either zzso or zzso positioning of zzso Furthermore, these findings indicate that a repeated 10 zzso zzso I zzso which has previously been considered to be a property of an intact zzso can also be generated with zzso zzso It will thus be necessary to zzso the criteria applied to the analysis of zzso both in zzso and in zzso
