The zzso position of strain zzso which was isolated from coastal seawater off zzso People's Republic of China in 2007, was zzso zzso zzso comprised zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso that did not produce zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso shared zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the strain was distinct from its closest zzso zzso zzso zzso The strain grew zzso in zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso at pH zzso and between 0 and zzso zzso growth temperature zzso The strain exhibited a restricted zzso profile, with a preference for zzso zzso that is consistent with its closest zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth of the isolate at different temperatures affected the cellular fatty acid zzso zzso cultured cells contained zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso However, the major fatty acids of the cells cultured at zzso were zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequences together with data from zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterization revealed that zzso should be classified as a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
