Three new genes zzso zzso and zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The mature proteins contain zzso zzso and zzso and 364 zzso zzso zzso which are preceded by leader sequences of 21 and 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to be zzso since the corresponding protein sequences differ in only five zzso The upstream region of zzso contains a zzso box, zzso and zzso sites, as well as sites for zzso regulation by metals zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some of these elements are also found in the regulatory region of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not that of zzso is activated by zzso
