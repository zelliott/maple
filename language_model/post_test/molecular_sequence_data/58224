A highly zzso 225 zzso sequence was identified within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and its nuclear zzso and regulatory function were zzso The binding of nuclear proteins to this zzso was found to reflect the differentiation state of the cell used to prepare the nuclear extracts and three different complexes are seen with this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is present in all cell zzso zzso is present in zzso T cells and early B cells, but not mature B zzso Moreover, nuclear extracts prepared from the early zzso cell line, zzso that was treated with agents which activate zzso gene zzso have a reduced ability to form zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso with the absence of zzso gene zzso zzso is present in all stages of B cell development, however its composition changes with B cell zzso zzso within the 225 zzso element is the zzso zzso motif zzso and the zzso family member, zzso binds this sequence and zzso in zzso zzso The 225 zzso zzso showed modest zzso of expression in zzso reporter zzso containing the heavy chain zzso zzso and a light chain promoter in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells and zzso a small but zzso response to zzso in zzso zzso Thus, the 225 zzso sequence contained within the zzso zzso may function as a regulatory element for zzso light chain gene zzso
