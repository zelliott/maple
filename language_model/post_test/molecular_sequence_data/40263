zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso egg envelope involves two zzso zzso and zzso zzso swells the envelope and then zzso completely zzso zzso We determined zzso and zzso zzso sites on the egg envelope that are primarily constructed of two groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso different target sequences on the egg envelope proteins but shared one common zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso and zzso mainly the zzso repeat sequence of zzso into zzso but not the site within a zzso zzso zzso domain that is considered to be the core structure of the egg zzso The zzso of these zzso regions results in swelling and softening of the zzso zzso zzso the middle of the zzso domain of zzso in addition to the upstream of the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso This middle site is in the intervening sequence connecting two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso this site would result in the zzso of the swollen egg envelope by the disruption of the zzso structure that is thought to be formed by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
