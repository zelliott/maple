A model of the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The location and sequence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso were predicted from their zzso with those of zzso zzso and these sequences were generally confirmed as zzso in nature by using a secondary structure prediction zzso These analyses were applied to 26 sequences in 6 gene families of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consist of approximately 100 zzso acid zzso more than zzso zzso This difference was accounted for by three major areas of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso between zzso C and D and between zzso D and zzso and zzso between zzso J and zzso zzso 1 has been suggested by others as a membrane zzso zzso but the apparent insertions at 2 and 3 are novel zzso it is suggested that they may be involved in the binding of zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso zzso family appeared to show a major variation from this pattern, as zzso 2 was zzso replaced by an zzso between zzso G and H and between zzso H and zzso This may reflect the difference in electron donor proteins that bind to members of this zzso zzso zzso Other than these differences the model of zzso zzso zzso proposed maintains the general structure of zzso zzso as determined by its zzso zzso
