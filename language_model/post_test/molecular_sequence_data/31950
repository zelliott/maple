In the present study we assessed zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso We examined pH optimum of fusion, temperatures of zzso heat zzso and in zzso and in zzso replication zzso of the previously obtained influenza zzso escape zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso zzso significantly lowered the pH of fusion zzso zzso of the escape zzso located in the zzso lateral loop significantly affected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes at positions zzso zzso zzso and 156 and zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and 156 affected the zzso ability of zzso escape zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso Overall, a zzso between zzso specificity and different zzso zzso properties has been zzso We believe that the monitoring of zzso effects of the zzso zzso found in zzso escape zzso is essential for accurate prediction of zzso with pandemic zzso
