zzso acid zzso is an important zzso zzso involved in cell signaling through zzso receptors zzso It is also involved in balancing the zzso composition inside the cell, and zzso the function of zzso zzso as an intermediate in zzso zzso Because of its involvement in these important zzso zzso degradation needs to be regulated as precisely as its zzso zzso acid zzso type 6 zzso is an zzso acid zzso that zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report three crystal structures of human zzso in complex with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our analyses revealed that zzso possesses a highly zzso zzso body domain as well as a less zzso cap zzso The vast zzso zzso pocket, which is located between those two zzso is suitable for accommodating zzso and its shape is different from that of other zzso acid zzso a fact that is consistent with the observed difference in zzso zzso Our analysis of the binding of three molecules in the active site reveals the involvement of six zzso and crucial zzso in binding of the zzso zzso group and its zzso The structure also indicates a zzso channel for zzso zzso Our structural data are consistent with the fact that the zzso is active as a zzso In combination with additional zzso and zzso activity studies, our structural data provide important insights into zzso recognition and the mechanism for zzso activity of zzso
