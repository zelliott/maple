Since the early 1980s of the zzso century, there has been great progress in the development of zzso zzso zzso Some problems, however, have not yet been solved zzso Recognizing short genes in zzso and short zzso in zzso is one of such zzso The paper is devoted to assessing various zzso including those currently available and the new ones proposed here, in order to find the best zzso to solve the zzso 

The databases consisting of zzso coding and zzso sequences of human genes with length of zzso zzso zzso zzso 87, 63 and 42 zzso respectively, have been zzso Based on the databases and a standard zzso 19 zzso were zzso which include the methods of zzso models with orders of 1 through 5, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso prototype, zzso transform and 8 Z curve methods with various numbers of zzso zzso the Z curve methods with 69 and 189 parameters are the best ones among them, based on the databases constructed zzso In addition to the highest recognition accuracy confirmed by zzso zzso tests, the Z curve methods are much simpler zzso than the second best one, the zzso zzso chain model, in which 12 288 parameters are zzso We hope that the Z curve methods presented in this paper would be beneficial to the further development of zzso zzso 

The programs of various Z curve methods are available on zzso
