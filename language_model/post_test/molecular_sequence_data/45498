Recent zzso zzso studies of the zzso protein zzso suggest that loop C, found at the circumference of the zzso zzso shows distinctive zzso changes upon zzso and zzso zzso We have employed zzso exchange mass zzso to examine the influence of bound zzso on zzso exposure of zzso zzso zzso of zzso incorporation are possible for approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso covering primarily the outer surface of zzso In the zzso two regions zzso the zzso occupation site at the zzso zzso loop C zzso zzso and loop F zzso zzso show greater zzso of zzso exchange than other regions of the protein including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso antagonists, zzso zzso and zzso markedly restricts the exchange of loop C zzso zzso influencing both the rates and degrees of zzso zzso exposure of loop C and its protection by zzso suggest that in the zzso loop C exhibits rapid fluctuations in an open zzso Bound zzso restrict zzso exposure through loop closure, whereas the larger zzso restrict zzso exposure largely through zzso of zzso zzso zzso found on the complementary zzso surface at the zzso also reveals zzso selective changes in zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso do not affect zzso accessibility of loop zzso whereas certain zzso cause subtle accessibility zzso These results reveal dynamic states and fluctuating movements in the vicinity of the binding site for zzso zzso that can be influenced selectively by zzso
