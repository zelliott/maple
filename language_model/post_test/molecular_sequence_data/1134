We have found that the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor 2 zzso interacts with the beta zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor known to be involved in zzso and protein zzso The interaction between the 110 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso and the large zzso loop of the zzso beta zzso was revealed with a zzso zzso zzso The native zzso and zzso interact in the brain since both zzso from zzso extracts with either zzso or zzso zzso In zzso human embryonic kidney cell line zzso cells, zzso promotes the exit of zzso from zzso zzso Double label zzso of cultured zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso of rat brain tissue show that zzso concentrates in the zzso zzso zzso is also present in zzso structures in the zzso zzso sometimes zzso with zzso zzso is present in both zzso zzso zzso that contain zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The results are consistent with the hypotheses that the interaction of zzso with the zzso beta zzso plays a role in the zzso and trafficking of assembled zzso to the cell zzso
