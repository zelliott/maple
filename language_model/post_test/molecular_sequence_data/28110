We have established an experimental system for zzso of an individual zzso on a closed DNA zzso zzso defined as a DNA domain of a size so small as to be unable to establish zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of 128 zzso encompassing the central part of the zzso zzso zzso II promoter plus 57 zzso of a zzso was obtained by zzso under conditions that produced three zzso forms characterized by different linkage zzso These zzso were tested for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso It was observed that only zzso with linkage reduction zzso zzso zzso 1 or 2) could form a zzso as defined by protection of a zzso 2) zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso relaxed forms zzso or closed zzso could zzso
