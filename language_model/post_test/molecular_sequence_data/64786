The zzso binding protein 2 zzso is a 48 zzso zzso reported to function as a zzso zzso for a growing list of zzso zzso It was recently demonstrated that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso However, the specific zzso of zzso zzso activity and the relationship of this activity to its zzso function remain zzso The ability of a human zzso to bind and serve as a zzso of zzso has been shown to be regulated by nuclear zzso zzso Here we extend the functional characterization of zzso by demonstrating that zzso acid zzso at zzso in the zzso zzso fold both abrogate the ability of zzso to zzso and are associated with a dramatic loss of zzso zzso zzso with the known zzso activity of zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso domain and at zzso in the zzso domain result in significant loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso High resolution serial zzso deletion analysis of zzso also revealed a novel zzso repression domain that is distinct from its zzso zzso Our results suggest a model in which zzso zzso function is zzso at least in part, through the effect of zzso on zzso zzso
