zzso proteins have been identified in a wide range of organisms, including zzso zzso and zzso In this work, we have investigated specific zzso binding to plant membrane proteins zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the final zzso step, specific zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from a zzso zzso liquid zzso column at about zzso M zzso and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of the most active fraction showed a major zzso of about 60 zzso and another zzso zzso zzso Competition experiments, performed on zzso active zzso confirmed the specificity of the zzso Upon zzso zzso gel zzso zzso binding was associated almost exclusively with the zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed and used to zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso chain reaction, zzso fragments of about 1 zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso analysis performed on zzso zzso and different zzso from zzso zzso plants indicated the presence of two different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the genes zzso the zzso and zzso proteins are probably derived from differential processing of the same precursor zzso Using rabbit zzso zzso raised against these zzso affinity zzso and zzso experiments detected analogous membrane proteins in zzso and zzso zzso
