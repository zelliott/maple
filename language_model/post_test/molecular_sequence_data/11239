The zzso during flower development, of the gene zzso the zzso zzso key zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in floral zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene of interest and a zzso zzso control gene respectively, were obtained from zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso Whereas for zzso northern zzso analysis enabled the study of its expression pattern, competitive zzso zzso were necessary to zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso plants and in petals of 2 transgenic clones containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso indicated a peak of zzso and zzso transcript levels in petals at the very early stages of zzso and different expression patterns in zzso and zzso In comparison to zzso plants, zzso showed a more intense zzso pigmentation of some zzso zzso and a dramatic increase in zzso transcript concentration and zzso activity in zzso However, petals of transformed plants did not accumulate any zzso These results indicate that other genes and/or regulatory factors should be considered responsible for the lack of zzso production in zzso zzso
