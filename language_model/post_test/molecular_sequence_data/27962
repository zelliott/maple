The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is organized in two large zzso zzso each bearing a putative active zzso However, only one of these sites is probably involved in catalyzing the conversion of zzso I into zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso is equally active, zzso by the same zzso but translated from a shorter zzso zzso cloning of the human zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso codes for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso transcript zzso to the 3' half of the zzso transcript and encodes one of the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso preceded by a short specific zzso This zzso specific sequence contains zzso zzso and encodes 67 zzso zzso including the putative signal zzso followed by a zzso region, presumably zzso The zzso transcript zzso to the zzso zzso form of the zzso zzso Since the zzso domain of the zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso it is likely that it bears the active site in both zzso
