Four zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso made from zzso a volcanic rock, and their zzso positions were investigated by a zzso zzso zzso The novel strains grew over a temperature range of zzso degrees C, at pH values of zzso and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed the novel strains formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the major zzso was zzso a zzso typical of the zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acid was zzso : zzso and the major zzso acid present in the zzso zzso was zzso These observations supported the affiliation of the novel strains to the zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso the new zzso are considered to represent four novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso AB zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso AB zzso are zzso
