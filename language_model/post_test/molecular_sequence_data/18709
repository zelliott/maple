The zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso pre-existing zzso zzso In particular, both zzso release zzso zzso that are recognized by zzso zzso zzso We investigated the evolutionary history of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso to gain insight into the evolutionary origin of the zzso zzso We performed a zzso analysis zzso gene copies from zzso and zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of differentiation between copies were investigated through patterns of molecular zzso We show that two rounds of zzso preceded the evolution of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso evolution patterns indicate that the resulting three zzso gene copies experienced different selective zzso In particular, one copy maintained the ancestral function, and another specialized into perception of zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso receptors evolved from a putative ancestral zzso zzso zzso through the acquisition of two zzso zzso However, the zzso analysis shows that these zzso are actually zzso suggesting that this scenario is zzso Our study zzso the evolutionary significance of gene zzso and subsequent zzso in zzso zzso We zzso that their zzso was more likely a zzso zzso zzso than a zzso zzso zzso
