The zzso zzso is a large complex composed of 14 identical zzso zzso that requires zzso and zzso for some of its zzso We find that a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso 191 to 345 has the activity of the zzso both in zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso A in the absence of zzso and in catalyzing the unfolding of native zzso Its crystal structure, solved at zzso A resolution, shows a zzso domain with the same fold as in intact zzso We have thus isolated the active site of the complex zzso molecular zzso which functions as a zzso This has zzso zzso the presence of a central cavity in the zzso complex is not essential for those representative activities in zzso and neither are the zzso zzso The function of the zzso behavior on the binding of zzso and zzso must be to regulate the affinity of the protein for its various zzso in zzso where the cavity may also be required for special zzso
