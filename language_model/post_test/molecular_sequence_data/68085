A zzso clone referred to as zzso was previously isolated from mouse zzso zzso by differential zzso on the basis of its down regulation in zzso when compared to zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain a full length clone of zzso zzso zzso for a highly basic 25 zzso zzso that is extremely zzso in several diverse species of zzso There is a single zzso acid substitution at position 202 compared to the human zzso zzso a putative tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso in rat primary culture of zzso compared to zzso and does not decrease when differentiation is blocked by zzso alpha or zzso indicating that the decrease is correlated with expression of the differentiation zzso Finally, two zzso cell line zzso that exhibit altered growth and increased zzso have a similar level of zzso zzso when compared to the non zzso zzso parent cell zzso
