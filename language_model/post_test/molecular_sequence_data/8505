zzso zzso zzso gene transfer results in permanent gene zzso however, gene transfer requires surgical zzso (to stimulate cell zzso and has been zzso We recently used zzso zzso zzso that zzso expressed zzso from mouse zzso to induce zzso zzso in place of a partial zzso The zzso method allowed for zzso more efficient zzso zzso in zzso compared to the conventional partial zzso zzso The major problem with the zzso zzso zzso was the transient zzso of zzso into the zzso that led to zzso To circumvent this zzso the zzso protein was modified by adding zzso and zzso zzso zzso retention zzso The zzso zzso molecules expressed from zzso zzso remained in zzso were zzso active, and resulted in similar rates of zzso zzso as found with the zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso was equally capable of allowing zzso gene transfer in zzso Thus, the method of direct zzso zzso of zzso becomes clinically relevant as the technology becomes zzso
