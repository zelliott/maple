A protein responsible for zzso formation was isolated from plasma of the zzso zzso zzso by repeated zzso at low zzso strength, pH zzso The zzso here named zzso protein zzso is a zzso which consists of two zzso zzso zzso associated by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso can form stable clots in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso could clearly be zzso in zzso under reducing conditions, where the zzso zzso is zzso zzso into zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso The zzso was shown to be a zzso for zzso since two different fluorescent zzso zzso namely zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were incorporated into the zzso zzso by active zzso This indicates the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso accessible for zzso zzso The zzso acid composition and the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein was zzso
