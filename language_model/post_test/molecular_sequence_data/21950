The zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 has been shown to shunt the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso for degradation and to enhance virus release from infected zzso The exact mechanism by which the zzso protein enhances virus release is currently unknown but some investigators have shown that this function is associated with the zzso domain and potential zzso channel zzso In this study, we determined if the zzso domain of zzso could be functionally zzso with that of the zzso zzso the zzso protein of influenza A zzso We constructed zzso zzso gene in which the zzso domain of zzso was replaced with that of the zzso protein of zzso This zzso zzso gene was zzso for the zzso gene in the zzso of a zzso zzso human zzso virus, zzso The resulting virus, zzso zzso a zzso protein that had a slightly different Mr compared to the parental zzso reflecting the different sizes of the two zzso zzso The zzso was shown to replicate with slightly reduced zzso when compared to the parental zzso but electron zzso revealed that the site of maturation was similar to the parental virus zzso We show that the replication and spread of zzso could be blocked with the zzso drug zzso which is known to target the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate a dose dependent zzso of zzso with 100 zzso zzso resulting in a zzso decrease in zzso released into the culture zzso zzso did not affect the replication of the parental zzso zzso of zzso cells treated with 50 zzso zzso revealed numerous viral particles associated with the cell plasma membrane and within zzso zzso which is similar to zzso zzso lacking a functional zzso To determine if zzso was as zzso as the parental zzso virus, two zzso zzso were zzso and followed for up to 8 zzso Both zzso zzso developed severe zzso T cell loss within 1 month of zzso high viral zzso and zzso zzso consistent with zzso depletion similar to the parental zzso Taken together, these results indicate for the first time that the TM domain of the zzso protein can be functionally zzso with the TM of zzso of influenza A virus, and shows that compounds that target the TM domain of zzso protein of zzso could serve as novel zzso zzso
