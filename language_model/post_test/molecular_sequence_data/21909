zzso belongs to the family of transient zzso potential channels and is activated by cooling and cooling agents, such as zzso and zzso It is expressed in a subset of sensory zzso and is thought to be involved in zzso Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of canine zzso zzso zzso shares zzso zzso and zzso protein sequence identity with human, rat and mouse zzso zzso Similar to these zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso and zzso with strong outward zzso and little zzso zzso zzso and zzso also caused zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was activated at zzso degrees C, a temperature threshold lower than that reported for the other zzso At 22 degrees C, the zzso for zzso of zzso expressed in zzso cells by zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso determined by zzso Imaging Plate Reader zzso and zzso and 85 zzso by patch zzso zzso zzso oil also activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more potent at zzso zzso than at zzso zzso zzso zzso 53 and 124 zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso zzso and mustard zzso zzso zzso increases were similarly blocked by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso current was also inhibited by zzso zzso calcium blocked zzso in a zzso and zzso manner zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso These results constitute the first study of zzso and support the idea that zzso functions as a zzso of cold stimuli in zzso
