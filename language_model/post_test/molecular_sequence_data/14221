zzso by the interest in developing gold compounds for treating cancer, gold zzso zzso interactions are investigated by mass zzso Under the experimental conditions used, the majority of gold zzso zzso complexes contain gold in the zzso states I and zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso detect zzso charged zzso for zzso zzso zzso which are represented as zzso + a zzso + b zzso + zzso - a zzso zzso where zzso zzso 0 and e is zzso zzso data shows zzso charged zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This study reveals that zzso zzso mainly detects zzso charged zzso complexes, presumably due to the zzso zzso The electrons in the zzso plume seem to efficiently reduce zzso to zzso zzso also tends to enhance the higher zzso forms of zzso complexes regardless of the laser power zzso zzso zzso experiments of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso peptides show that the gold zzso (a soft zzso binding sites are in the vicinity of zzso (a soft zzso His (a major anchor of zzso for metal zzso zzso and the basic zzso zzso Data also suggests that the abundance of zzso peptides increases with higher gold concentration until zzso after which an increase in gold zzso concentration leads to the zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso
