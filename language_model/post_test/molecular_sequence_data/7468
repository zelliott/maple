The diversity of the B cell repertoire of C zzso knockout mice is limited by the expression of four zzso light chain zzso Among the zzso B cells, zzso 1 is expressed by the majority zzso of cells, and zzso 3 by the minority zzso while zzso 2 zzso and zzso 2 zzso are expressed in intermediate quantities zzso and zzso zzso To assess the influence of zzso pressures on the zzso zzso distribution, the proportions of the different zzso zzso were determined in various B cell zzso divided on the basis of the zzso zzso zzso and the V zzso J zzso junction sequences were studied at different steps of B cell differentiation zzso immature and mature B zzso The data show that zzso the ratio of zzso zzso junctions is determined by the nature of the zzso segments that are rearranged as can be observed in the zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso are often found in the zzso zzso B cells in the zzso and zzso zzso junctions are often zzso regardless of the nature of the cells zzso Our results, therefore, suggest that a strong probability of initiating a zzso zzso and a weak probability of giving a productive zzso junction are responsible for the zzso 1 dominance and the zzso 3 zzso zzso The intermediate proportion of zzso zzso zzso is most likely due to a probability of obtaining a productive joint that is better than that for zzso and a probability of initiating a zzso that is lower than that for zzso However, the zzso zzso cell proportion cannot be determined only by these zzso
