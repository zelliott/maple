A zzso of the human cell cycle checkpoint gene zzso has been identified and designated zzso It encodes a zzso zzso zzso identical and zzso similar to zzso Mouse and rat zzso of zzso have also been detected by a zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in many human zzso and the zzso levels observed parallel those for zzso A zzso protein complex is thought to form a zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso structure, important for cell cycle checkpoint zzso However, zzso directly interacts with zzso but not zzso or zzso whereas zzso can bind zzso zzso and another zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso cannot simply substitute for zzso in the zzso zzso is less zzso zzso than zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso but not zzso in human cells zzso zzso cell zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso have distinct but related roles in regulating cell cycle checkpoints and zzso zzso
