An increasing number of studies indicate that zzso zzso play an important role in structural plasticity associated with learning and memory zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso located at the zzso terminal of zzso It is thought to be crucial for cognitive brain zzso A deletion in the zzso gene causes severe mental zzso in zzso For a zzso zzso we produced zzso zzso zzso in a zzso expression system using myeloma zzso From the culture medium we zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and immobilized metal affinity zzso For an zzso characterization two fragments of zzso containing the natural zzso sites of zzso were used as zzso The highest zzso activity of zzso was observed in the pH range between zzso and zzso zzso zzso were required for zzso activity and an zzso strength exceeding 500 zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acids zzso the zzso bonds showed that zzso is highly specific and requires a basic zzso acid preceded by a zzso zzso on the zzso side of the zzso zzso This sequence requirement argues for a unique zzso binding pocket of zzso This observation was further substantiated by the fact that almost all tested zzso zzso zzso except zzso and zzso did not affect zzso zzso
