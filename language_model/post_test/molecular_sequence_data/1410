zzso crystal zzso proteins of zzso zzso crystallize after synthesis forming large inclusions that stabilize these toxins in the environment after cell zzso until eaten by an zzso Despite the biological importance of zzso little is known about the structural elements of zzso molecules that facilitate this zzso We identified zzso that affect zzso structure possibly through improper folding by zzso zzso substituting short peptides of a truncated zzso zzso zzso that does not crystallize into zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso consists of three zzso that contain five different blocks of zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution and zzso within these blocks suggested that the specific structure of block 2, which spans the junction between zzso I and II, was important to the relative stability of zzso and subsequent zzso zzso acid sequences of particular importance to stability in zzso block 2 were identified using three substitution zzso each spanning about a third of this zzso One that consisted of zzso zzso zzso yielded no zzso zzso whereas the other two produced characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso in this region showed zzso 268 was critical to normal stability of zzso and subsequent zzso in that a zzso zzso was less stable than zzso zzso and failed to form a characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a decrease in this zzso zzso indicating the importance of zzso 268 to the specific zzso of zzso zzso that zzso stability and normal zzso
