The adult zzso zzso zzso has two major zzso zzso B and C, which share a common beta chain but have different alpha zzso zzso B and C associate upon zzso to form a complex of the form zzso a zzso of zzso that depends on contacts between the alpha B and alpha C zzso zzso sequences of zzso transcripts for these chains have been zzso zzso were identified by analysis of the zzso acid compositions of the zzso peptides of the components and by partial zzso acid zzso These results, together with the zzso acid sequence of the beta chain zzso zzso Gray, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso permit an analysis of the structures of the alpha 2 beta 2 zzso of zzso B and zzso zzso modeling suggests possible zzso at the alpha zzso C zzso in the zzso zzso and additional alpha zzso C contacts that would form a closed ring of six alpha chain zzso that would further stabilize the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the alpha B sequence suggests that it may be a zzso chain, the zzso expression of which has shifted from zzso to zzso
