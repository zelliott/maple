zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The X zzso zzso zzso in the mouse causes partial zzso zzso zzso and has served as a model for the human zzso We show here that the zzso zzso is a zzso to zzso transition of the last zzso of the fourth zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso change produces two remarkably different zzso First, this transition causes zzso zzso zzso zzso because the involved zzso zzso plays a part in the recognition of the adjacent zzso donor zzso As a result of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is spliced zzso both at this site and at a cryptic zzso donor site 48 bases into the adjacent zzso Second, two zzso proteins are translated from these zzso From the correctly spliced zzso the transition results in a change of zzso acid 129 from zzso to zzso This zzso substitution has no zzso effect on zzso import, zzso zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso resulting from zzso is translated into a dysfunctional zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of 16 zzso acid zzso
