The zzso zzso zzso causes zzso disease of zzso zzso zzso such as canola zzso zzso We have cloned a gene zzso zzso zzso and two genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These genes are not clustered in the zzso as they are located on different zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of all three genes predict an zzso signal zzso as is common for zzso zzso zzso that degrade plant cell zzso The zzso zzso by zzso shows the highest similarity zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso 4 from zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso appear to zzso zzso and neither gene encodes a recognizable zzso domain or zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced in cultures containing zzso zzso acid or zzso and zzso is induced in zzso cellulose or zzso as shown by Northern zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso caused by cellulose and zzso but does affect zzso of zzso zzso of zzso (but not zzso or zzso is zzso during infection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and leaves using reverse zzso
