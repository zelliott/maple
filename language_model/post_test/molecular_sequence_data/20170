The Philadelphia zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso defines a subset of acute zzso leukemia zzso with a particularly zzso zzso ALL cells are derived from B cell precursors in most cases and typically carry rearranged zzso heavy chain zzso variable zzso region genes devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso is restricted to mature zzso center B cells and depends on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AID expression in 108 cases of zzso we detected AID zzso in 24 of 28 zzso zzso as compared with 6 of 80 zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso ALL cells and zzso of the zzso zzso showed that zzso expression of AID depends on zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso AID expression in zzso zzso zzso V region genes and zzso were zzso in many zzso but zzso in most zzso zzso In addition, AID introduced DNA zzso breaks within the tumor zzso gene zzso in zzso ALL cells, which was sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of AID expression by zzso zzso These findings identify AID as a zzso zzso in zzso ALL cells, which may be relevant with respect to the particularly zzso prognosis of this leukemia zzso
