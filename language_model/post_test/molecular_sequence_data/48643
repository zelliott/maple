The G zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso plays an essential role in signal transmission and response to external stimuli in zzso zzso zzso components of this zzso have been characterized in plants and simpler zzso such as zzso but their presence and role in zzso zzso zzso have not been zzso We use a comparative zzso approach using whole zzso sequences and gene expression libraries of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to search for evidence of zzso signaling zzso proteins that share sequence conservation to known zzso zzso zzso 

The majority of the core components of zzso signaling were well zzso in all four zzso with protein sequence similarity to zzso human G protein zzso and zzso and downstream zzso There was evidence for the zzso and thus a full zzso G protein only in zzso zzso zzso analysis of putative zzso zzso indicated similarity but deep divergence to the class C zzso with branches zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso regions of these putative zzso zzso sequences exhibited large variation in sequence zzso and seven of these sequences contained the necessary zzso binding domain for class C zzso zzso zzso data indicated that a number of the putative zzso sequences are expressed in zzso under various stress conditions in culture, and that many of the zzso signaling zzso including the G zzso are also zzso 

The presence of sequences in all four zzso that code for the proteins required for a functional zzso zzso zzso highlights the highly zzso nature of this zzso and suggests a complex signaling machinery related to environmental perception and response in these zzso zzso The lack of evidence for some zzso zzso proteins in one or more of the zzso such as the zzso may be due to differences in zzso zzso and zzso coverage for the four zzso The high divergence of putative zzso zzso sequences to known class C zzso suggests these sequences may represent another, potentially zzso zzso of class C zzso
