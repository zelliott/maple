A Chinese zzso zzso cell line has been established which zzso the zzso domain of human zzso zzso The zzso protein has been modified to contain a zzso zzso tag and can be zzso by zzso zzso to yield a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 130 zzso Following treatment with zzso the apparent molecular weight is reduced to 75 zzso showing that the protein is a zzso zzso zzso protein sequencing of both the reduced and zzso forms of the protein yielded identical zzso confirming that they were derived from the same zzso and identifying the site of zzso zzso of the zzso as zzso 32 in the predicted zzso acid zzso zzso treatment of the zzso and zzso forms of the protein showed that the latter was present as an zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is taking place in the zzso zzso zzso of the binding of zzso acid showed that the protein was zzso at levels of up to zzso zzso and the zzso protein has a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with 10 zzso 1 zzso for baby zzso kidney zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso protein maintained a pharmacological profile similar to that of the native zzso and the binding of zzso and zzso were unaffected by changes in zzso zzso
