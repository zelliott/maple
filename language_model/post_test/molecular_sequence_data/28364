The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the gene zzso a protein of approximately 12 zzso that is zzso from cells infected with the zzso zzso The absence of this protein from the medium of cells infected with a spontaneous deletion zzso zzso suggested that the open reading frame zzso was located within a zzso pair segment near the left end of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moss, Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso protein zzso an appropriate size in zzso translation product of zzso that zzso to a DNA segment containing an zzso zzso that could zzso a zzso zzso The similarity in the sizes of the in zzso translation product and the zzso protein was consistent with the absence of zzso zzso analysis revealed major and minor early zzso start sites preceding the zzso zzso as well as a late zzso start site with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was interrupted by replacing a segment of the zzso with the zzso coli zzso zzso When two-dimensional zzso gel zzso patterns of zzso proteins zzso from cells infected with parental and zzso viruses were zzso a spot missing from the latter corresponded in molecular weigh and zzso point with that predicted from the zzso zzso The latter analysis revealed the presence of other zzso proteins of similar molecular weight but different zzso points that also appear to map within the left end of the zzso zzso The zzso virus was attenuated as judged by the increased zzso zzso for mice but nevertheless induced zzso and zzso responses after zzso and zzso zzso Relative to the parental virus, the zzso was also more attenuated for zzso nude mice, based on their survival time after zzso
