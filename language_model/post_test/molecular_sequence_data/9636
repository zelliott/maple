The zzso gene of zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso repair of zzso breaks in zzso Here the isolation and functional characterization of the zzso zzso of the fruit fly zzso zzso zzso are zzso The putative zzso protein displays 46 to 57% identity to its zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected at all stages of fly development, but an increased level was observed in early zzso and zzso zzso To determine the function of zzso a zzso zzso was isolated by random zzso zzso flies develop zzso but the females are zzso Early development appears normal, but the eggs do not zzso indicating an essential role for zzso in zzso The larvae of zzso flies are highly sensitive to X rays and zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso is defective in zzso zzso zzso as measured by a zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are consistent with a zzso in the repair of zzso breaks and imply that the zzso gene is crucial in repair and zzso in a zzso zzso The results also indicate that the zzso repair zzso is functionally zzso in zzso
