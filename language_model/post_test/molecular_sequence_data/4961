In the zzso central nervous system, a diverse group of basic zzso zzso proteins is involved in the determination of zzso cells and, zzso in regulating zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a novel zzso of zzso zzso defined by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso In contrast to known zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes begins at the end of embryonic development marking differentiated zzso that have reached a final position, and increases as zzso development zzso In the adult, zzso genes are expressed in zzso of the zzso that have been associated with adult zzso In zzso cells, a model system to study zzso zzso zzso genes can be induced by zzso with the zzso of an zzso zzso Similarly, within 1 h after the administration of zzso acid in zzso zzso is induced in zzso throughout the rat cerebral zzso This suggests that zzso zzso proteins are also involved in the zzso changes of mature zzso zzso which are coupled to zzso zzso
