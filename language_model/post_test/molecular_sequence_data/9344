zzso and high zzso analysis for systems biology can benefit significantly from zzso chemical tools for affinity pull-down of proteins from complex zzso Here we report the application of zzso synthesis of zzso for pull-down and analysis of the affinity profile of the zzso zzso associated zzso zzso a member of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can potentially zzso these zzso zzso but, interestingly, performing the binding studies at 4 zzso allowed efficient binding to zzso without the need for zzso mimics or zzso zzso As no proven zzso zzso were available, we selected zzso zzso among known zzso zzso including the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso directly on zzso solid supports through a zzso type zzso The results show that zzso zzso to a flexible solid support bind with high affinity and specificity to zzso which is pulled down from zzso of cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso on zzso or zzso zzso is important for binding of zzso but sequences around the zzso zzso are important for the binding affinity of zzso We conclude that zzso affinity pull-down of proteins from complex zzso can be applied in zzso and systems zzso
