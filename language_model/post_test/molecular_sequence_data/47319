zzso zzso factor zzso is produced by group A zzso belonging to certain M zzso zzso zzso the zzso component of the high density zzso fraction of serum rendering it zzso which in turn leads to serum zzso zzso zzso a zzso binding surface protein cloned from group A zzso was obtained from a strain of zzso Here we show that this protein has a second functional domain responsible for zzso zzso The zzso binding region was located in the zzso end of the zzso zzso analysis showed that the remainder of the protein was required for zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso when compared with the published sequence of zzso showed zzso identity with a difference of only four zzso zzso In spite of this high zzso zzso from zzso was zzso and zzso evoked specifically inhibited only zzso produced by zzso zzso found in human serum following natural infection also inhibited the zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso protein from zzso is zzso with a high zzso zzso zzso
