Two zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso I and II were found to have apparent molecular masses of 63 and 66 zzso on zzso with zzso points of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso resembled each other in similar zzso zzso specificity for the zzso zzso linkage and immune zzso on Western blots using a zzso II zzso rabbit zzso zzso was induced by growth on zzso whereas zzso activity could not be detected under similar zzso zzso I and II were shown to be zzso zzso by neutral sugar zzso and more than zzso of zzso activity was zzso from zzso These data, in combination with other results from this laboratory zzso Williamson, zzso Sweeney and Bennett (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso showing lack of a plausible leader sequence in zzso or zzso zzso suggest an zzso zzso of the zzso To establish further the mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso the existence of a zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery of intact zzso from ground cells by zzso and zzso transport of zzso zzso of zzso of zzso In total, the above is consistent with a mechanism zzso zzso is transported into zzso zzso to be zzso by an zzso zzso
