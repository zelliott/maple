Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are generally considered as prototypes of a zzso and a zzso DNA duplex on the basis of their different zzso with respect to zzso and/or zzso zzso We have studied their gel zzso zzso in the presence of the biologically significant zzso zzso and have found that zzso causes a decrease of the gel zzso mobility of zzso DNA, but does not influence that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complexes between zzso and the two examined zzso show dramatically different zzso These findings suggest that different DNA zzso are relevant in interactions not only with zzso but also with zzso such as zzso
