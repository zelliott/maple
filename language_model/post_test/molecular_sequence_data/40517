zzso insights into the molecular structure and dynamics of a protein by zzso zzso and other zzso zzso methods relies heavily on the incorporation of zzso labels or other chemical modifications such as fluorescent groups into the protein of zzso These types of modifications can be elegantly achieved with the use of split zzso in a zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso are split derivatives of the protein zzso element zzso and catalyze the formation of a zzso bond between two zzso Recent progress in split zzso engineering provided the opportunity to also perform zzso bond formation between a protein and a chemically zzso zzso We review the current state-of-the-art in preparing zzso zzso proteins for zzso zzso and highlight the importance of split zzso zzso for the zzso of a protein from multiple zzso Furthermore, we use split zzso zzso fluorescent labeling as a framework to illustrate the general usefulness of split zzso for custom protein modifications in the realm of structural zzso We also address some limitations of split zzso technology, and offer constructive advice to overcome these zzso
