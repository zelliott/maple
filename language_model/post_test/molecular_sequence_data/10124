zzso zzso zzso several proteins which inhibit specific elements of the host immune zzso We show the zzso zzso gene in zzso and zzso zzso whose zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso are strongly zzso in zzso actually encodes a zzso soluble protein with zzso binding to virtually all known beta zzso but only weak or no affinity to the alpha and gamma zzso The viral protein completely zzso the biological activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso by competitive zzso of zzso binding to cellular zzso As all beta zzso are also shown to zzso with zzso binding to the viral zzso we conclude that this viral zzso inhibitor zzso not only interacts through a common binding site, but is likely a potent general inhibitor of beta zzso zzso Unlike many zzso zzso genes to date, which are clearly altered forms of acquired cellular genes of the zzso immune system, this viral zzso inhibitor zzso shares no sequence zzso with known zzso including known cellular zzso zzso all of which are multiple zzso zzso Thus, zzso presumably has no cellular analogue and instead may be the product of unrelenting sequence variations which gave rise to a completely new protein with similar binding properties to native zzso zzso The proposed function of zzso is zzso of the zzso zzso activities of beta zzso
