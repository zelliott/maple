A novel zzso designated as zzso was isolated from soil in zzso Island zzso A zzso study was undertaken to establish the zzso position of isolate zzso zzso zzso was found to have chemical and zzso characteristics similar to zzso The strain grew zzso at pH zzso and 28 degrees zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso forms a distinct line of descent within the radiation enclosed by the zzso zzso The cell wall of strain zzso contained zzso zzso zzso The principal zzso was zzso zzso The zzso detected were zzso zzso and some unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso was the major fatty zzso The DNA G + C content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso shares the highest sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso data presented in this study, strain zzso should be classified as a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
