zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso on a large scale using a new zzso zzso method developed by the zzso Although its melting profile suggested a loose higher order structure, presumably influenced by the apparent loss of D zzso loop interaction necessary for forming a rigid L-shaped zzso structure, its zzso capacity zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was nearly equal to that of zzso coli zzso zzso was not observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparing the zzso efficiencies of several combinations of zzso and zzso from various sources, including bovine zzso bovine and zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso it was clarified that zzso zzso was able to zzso all the above mentioned zzso species, albeit with varying degrees of zzso This broad charging spectrum suggests that zzso zzso possesses a relatively simple recognition mechanism toward its zzso zzso
