The zzso protein concentrates within discrete nuclear structures known as nuclear bodies, also called zzso or zzso which contain several proteins including the zzso zzso zzso zzso The function of these structures remains zzso We and others have shown recently that they represent specific targets for zzso and zzso zzso zzso This prompted us to investigate whether zzso like zzso might be induced by zzso and to explore the role of zzso in viral zzso Here we report that zzso zzso levels increase rapidly in response to zzso zzso This zzso of zzso transcripts is a primary zzso response since it does not require de zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene is accompanied by enhanced protein expression as revealed by zzso Both the intensity of the zzso and the number of zzso structures increased upon zzso zzso To probe the role of zzso in zzso action, we compared the zzso state established by zzso in embryonic zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso mice for zzso and from zzso control zzso The resistance to viral infection zzso by zzso was identical in both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso is not an essential zzso of the zzso effect of zzso We also noted that zzso factors are normally activated by zzso in zzso zzso
