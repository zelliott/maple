The zzso zzso in northwestern Spain, was one of the zzso affected by the zzso oil spill in November zzso The diversity of zzso zzso populations present at two beaches zzso zzso was analyzed using zzso and zzso zzso The first analysis involved the screening of an zzso gene zzso The second involved the isolation of 94 zzso strains that were able to grow on selective media by direct zzso or after serial zzso on several carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Eight zzso zzso strains were also isolated by their ability to grow zzso with zzso The calculated coverage index for zzso species was zzso when clones and zzso were considered together, and there were 29 zzso zzso The most abundant were members of the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thirty-one zzso could not be identified at the species level and were considered representatives of 16 putative novel zzso zzso One isolate was considered representative of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso results were obtained when the zzso of the cloned DNA library and the cultured strains were zzso The clone library obtained by the zzso zzso method was a useful tool for evaluating zzso communities and also for zzso studies of zzso zzso
