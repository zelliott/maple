The short sequence motif named zzso zzso first recognized repeated in tandem in the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is also found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and many other regulator zzso Embedded in the zzso zzso chain of zzso are three zzso repeated zzso zzso Because the zinc fingers of zzso are known to bind to DNA, it is probable that in the case of zzso these finger motifs also play an important, but not necessarily zzso role in the zzso binding of the protein to zzso To test this prediction we have expressed the zzso sequence of the domain containing the three zinc fingers of zzso in zzso coli as a zzso fusion zzso zzso under zzso conditions and folded in zzso This experimental approach allows us to study directly both the metal requirement and zzso properties of the isolated zzso We find that zinc is required for specific DNA recognition and, most significantly, zzso protection studies show that the isolated zzso domain is sufficient for zzso binding to zzso
