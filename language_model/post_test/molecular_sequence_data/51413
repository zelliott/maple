The effects of zzso zzso and zzso on the human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and on normal rat zzso zzso cells were zzso In all cell types, zzso (1 zzso zzso caused significant zzso and zzso changes in the levels of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso response to zzso while zzso had no zzso zzso also zzso a zzso increase in free zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso did not affect zzso zzso levels in these zzso zzso of zzso a B1 zzso zzso up to 100 zzso did not stimulate the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso response was unaffected by zzso a B1 zzso zzso while it was inhibited by zzso a B2 zzso zzso These results suggest that in zzso cells the mechanism of action of zzso involves stimulation of the zzso metabolism and increases in zzso calcium levels through zzso of B2 zzso
