zzso resistance specified by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso results from the functioning of a zzso zzso In the zzso sequence of the DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso two open reading frames were zzso The larger one, corresponding to a predicted zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso is necessary and sufficient for expression of cadmium zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence with known protein sequences suggested that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The sequence zzso is lower but significant with other zzso zzso including the zzso zzso of zzso microbes and the zzso and zzso of zzso A zzso zzso in the middle of the gene destroys the zzso zzso A detailed model for the putative zzso zzso based on zzso to other zzso zzso is presented and zzso
