zzso zzso and other zzso zzso species multiply inside zzso and human zzso by using the zzso type IV zzso zzso The zzso zzso which possesses zzso activity, and zzso which functions as its zzso are two essential components of this zzso It was previously shown that in 29 zzso species, a large zzso family zzso zzso is located upstream from a zzso zzso zzso but although zzso the zzso proteins were found to function similarly together with their corresponding zzso zzso zzso of the regulatory regions of 29 zzso genes revealed that they can be divided into three regulatory zzso the first group contains a binding site for the zzso response regulator, which was previously shown to regulate the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the second group, which includes most of the zzso zzso contains the zzso binding site and an additional regulatory element that was identified here as a zzso binding zzso and the third group contains only the zzso binding zzso Analysis of the regulatory region of two zzso zzso which included zzso in the zzso and zzso consensus zzso a controlled expression system, as well as examination of direct binding with mobility shift zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso positively regulate the expression of the zzso genes that contain both regulatory zzso The change in the regulation of the zzso genes that occurred during the course of evolution might be required for the adaptation of the different zzso species to their specific environmental zzso
