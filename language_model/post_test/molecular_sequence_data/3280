zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso T cells into zzso mice causes zzso zzso pathology restricted to the small zzso We wondered whether local zzso induced by zzso T cells can be explained by zzso differences in zzso processing of major zzso complex class I T cell zzso Our experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso of different zzso display a characteristic composition of alpha and beta chain zzso and produce distinct zzso fragments with respect to both quality and zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso show most efficient generation of the pathology related zzso T cell zzso in the small zzso Further, we demonstrate that the zzso potential to produce defined T cell zzso reflects quantities that are relevant for zzso T zzso zzso We propose zzso zzso processing by zzso zzso as a potential mechanism to control zzso immune zzso
