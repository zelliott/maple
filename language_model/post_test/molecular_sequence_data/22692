We developed a zzso zzso zzso with a formerly zzso origin of DNA zzso zzso zzso functions efficiently to support zzso synthesis of zzso DNA which zzso within zzso By characterizing zzso requirements for acting as an origin, we have uncovered several striking properties it shares with zzso the only other zzso zzso zzso zzso origin of DNA zzso zzso contains a pair of previously zzso zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso sites that are both necessary and sufficient in zzso for its origin zzso These sites have an essential zzso zzso zzso are bent by zzso and recruit the origin recognition zzso The properties shared between zzso and zzso define zzso and trans characteristics of a zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso likely reflects its evolution from cellular factors involved in the assembly of the initiation zzso
