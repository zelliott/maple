zzso zzso transport of zzso and zzso zzso across cell zzso is a basic biological process in both zzso and zzso Recent in zzso analysis has shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a group of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso constitute a unique protein family which includes putative zzso from zzso bacteria, plants and zzso The construction and functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso has previously shown that the region including zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso is critical for zzso recognition and zzso Here, we extend our studies on zzso zzso relationships by studying zzso zzso constructed within a zzso sequence motif zzso which is zzso in the putative functional region of all members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be critical for zzso recognition and zzso The results suggest that these zzso might directly or indirectly be involved in specific interactions with the zzso zzso In particular, interaction of zzso 449 with zzso groups of zzso might act as a critical molecular filter involved in the selection of transported zzso The present and previous zzso analyses in zzso suggest that specific polar or charged zzso acid zzso on either side of an zzso zzso zzso segment are critical for zzso binding and zzso
