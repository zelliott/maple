To investigate the structural basis of zzso selectivity of zzso zzso zzso channels, the zzso properties of zzso and zzso channels were studied in zzso zzso This work focused on zzso zzso which by zzso is one zzso acid away from a putative zzso ring of charge that regulates zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso to zzso reduced channel zzso and zzso to zzso or zzso increased channel zzso These results are consistent with an zzso interaction between this site and zzso zzso The zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso formed a channel that is permeable to zzso and this cannot be explained in terms of zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso reversal potential in solutions with symmetrical zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ratio of zzso to zzso was determined as zzso 33 from reversal potential zzso in zzso zzso zzso with large organic zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso can only be seen in the presence of zzso but zzso zzso can be seen in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso ratios of organic zzso indicated that the zzso zzso has an increased pore zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso channel cannot be accounted for by a simple zzso interaction with zzso zzso It is likely that zzso substitution causes a structural change that extends beyond this one zzso to influence the positions of other zzso zzso Thus protein zzso plays an important role in enabling zzso channels to distinguish between zzso and zzso
