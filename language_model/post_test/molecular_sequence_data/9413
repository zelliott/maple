The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well-known zzso Although the ability of the metabolically activated form of zzso to generate DNA zzso is well established, little is known about the cellular pathways zzso by zzso in its native zzso In this study, we zzso stable isotope labeling by zzso acid in cell culture zzso together with mass zzso to assess the zzso of protein expression in zzso human skin zzso cells upon zzso zzso With this approach, we were able to zzso zzso proteins and 137 of them were with significantly altered expression following zzso exposure, including the zzso of all zzso of the zzso zzso core zzso The zzso of the zzso core complex was also reflected by a significant increase in zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso and zzso cells upon zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso significantly the zzso increase in zzso activity in all the three cell lines, suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso may be zzso through the zzso Additionally, we found that zzso treatment altered the expression levels of other important proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso and proteins involved in zzso and zzso zzso from the present study provided novel insights into the cellular mechanisms targeted by zzso
