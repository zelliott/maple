zzso is a zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains essential zzso zzso and zzso zzso but unlike other zzso zzso zzso zzso family members, lacks zzso zzso To analyze functions of the zzso domain, we selected for zzso of zzso an zzso that results in slow growth under numerous conditions of zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acted in a partially dominant fashion to suppress the zzso zzso associated with zzso as well as its resulting defects in zzso zzso suppressed an additional zzso domain zzso zzso but not a zzso in the zzso domain or deletions of zzso or zzso zzso We find zzso zzso distributed throughout the zzso zzso is a component of the zzso complex, and in zzso cells associates with molecular zzso in complex with zzso and zzso zzso with this finding, zzso levels are reduced in a strain with a zzso zzso of zzso Further agreeing with a possible role for zzso in the folding or stabilization of zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso particularly under conditions of zzso Since an zzso zzso of zzso also suppressed zzso we propose that zzso is required for the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso into their functionally active zzso
