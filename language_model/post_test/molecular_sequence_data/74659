During the last 20 years, there have been an increasing number of reports on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso These studies have demonstrated the existence of three different structural classes of zzso zzso beta and zzso The gamma class members are potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso These zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso class of the zzso Although coming from distinct sources, these zzso zzso share main structural zzso For this reason, zzso have been considered as potential models for the development of selective zzso of zzso zzso in zzso In spite of the rich diversity of the zzso zzso in Brazil, only two zzso representatives, from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been described in Brazilian snakes so zzso Here we investigated the presence of transcripts of novel zzso in six zzso species zzso zzso commonly found in our country: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts were present in every species zzso The deduced mature proteins possessed 181 zzso acid zzso following a zzso signal zzso similar to the zzso from zzso zzso zzso taken as our model, with the exception of the deduced proteins from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In these particular cases, an zzso of zzso acid zzso was consistently zzso A zzso tree was obtained for the Brazilian zzso zzso showing four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso structural analysis and further comparisons of these novel zzso zzso with zzso from New and Old World snakes are zzso
