Packaging of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso protein into virus particles is zzso through an interaction with viral zzso zzso and results in the association of zzso with the zzso zzso Despite the specificity of this process, calculations of the amount of zzso packaged have produced vastly different zzso Here, we compared the efficiency of packaging of zzso into zzso derived from acutely and chronically infected zzso zzso We found that zzso was efficiently packaged into zzso from acutely infected cells zzso to 100 copies per zzso while packaging into zzso from chronically infected zzso cells was near the limit of detection (four to six copies of zzso per zzso zzso by an zzso zzso virus did not rescue packaging of zzso zzso expressed in the chronically infected zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expressed by zzso of zzso virus was readily packaged (30 to 40 copies per zzso zzso analyses suggest that the differences in the relative packaging efficiencies were not due to gross differences in the zzso distribution of zzso in chronically or acutely infected cells but are likely due to differences in the relative rates of de zzso synthesis of zzso Despite its low packaging efficiency, zzso expressed zzso was sufficient to direct the production of viruses with almost zzso zzso The results from our study provide novel insights into the zzso properties of zzso and offer an explanation for the reported differences regarding zzso zzso
