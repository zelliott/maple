zzso zzso can be achieved by a variety of approaches, including both random and targeted zzso In contrast to chemical zzso zzso zzso provide a molecular tag, thereby allowing rapid identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso into defined zzso locations has great utility for both gene zzso and zzso Our laboratories have explored targeted integration through the use of zzso coupled to defined zzso zzso This technology holds great promise for targeted zzso zzso by zzso integration events to regions recognized by the chosen zzso zzso zzso we provide a brief background on targeted zzso integration and detailed protocols for testing zzso zzso in both zzso cell culture and insect zzso
