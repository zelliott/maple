In higher zzso zzso can be zzso via two distinct routes including the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the primary route of degradation of zzso in most zzso except the brain in which the zzso zzso is most zzso zzso is formed from zzso via two zzso reactions and then zzso zzso to zzso At least in humans and zzso this is brought about by the zzso zzso zzso zzso localized in zzso In literature, several patients have been described with zzso zzso The underlying mechanism responsible for the impaired degradation of zzso has remained unclear through the zzso In order to resolve this question, we have now cloned the human zzso zzso zzso which codes for a protein of 390 zzso acids and contains an zzso fold compatible with its identity as a zzso Furthermore, the deduced protein ends in zzso at its zzso zzso which constitutes a typical Type I zzso signal zzso zzso
