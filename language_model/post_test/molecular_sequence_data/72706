Cell wall zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso with zzso and zzso zzso We have isolated the zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso the genes required for zzso synthesis in zzso zzso The results of Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso was expressed at a higher level than zzso in the zzso phase, while zzso expression was strongly induced upon induction of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso were shortened during the zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso more than 50% of cell wall zzso was zzso linked in zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso was affected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso Although we never succeeded in generating the zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso the zzso zzso delta zzso decreased the zzso zzso level by about zzso and also caused a more than zzso reduction of zzso without affecting zzso The zzso function of zzso was further examined by studying gene regulation in zzso zzso When zzso zzso was suppressed by using the zzso promoter, zzso zzso cells exhibited the partial zzso in cell separation and increased zzso to zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso plays important roles in zzso synthesis and budding in zzso zzso
