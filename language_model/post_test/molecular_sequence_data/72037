The zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses an zzso zzso activity that generates the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and has been extensively used for studies of zzso zzso zzso In order to identify regulatory mechanisms that control zzso expression in zzso mechanisms of zzso gene expression were investigated in zzso cells and two new, independent zzso zzso and zzso Northern and zzso protection zzso using zzso that span the coding region of a cloned zzso zzso zzso detected transcripts in each zzso zzso but not in zzso cells or other zzso zzso zzso that express a different zzso zzso zzso region sequence analysis and zzso zzso specificity comparisons with zzso human zzso and zzso showed that the cloned zzso gene is zzso to the human zzso zzso Southern analyses identified two closely related zzso genes in the Chinese zzso whose evolutionary relationships are zzso The blots showed that zzso had occurred in zzso and zzso zzso DNA, consistent with a zzso mechanism of zzso gene zzso in these zzso By contrast, zzso cell hybrid analyses revealed that zzso cells express zzso gene transcripts due to the loss of a zzso negative regulatory zzso zzso of reverse zzso chain reaction products identified unique zzso and zzso region sequences in zzso gene transcripts from each zzso zzso Northern and Southern analyses with zzso zzso showed that zzso cells express only the zzso gene (where zzso is zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso cells express only the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso hybrid cells, the zzso gene was predominantly zzso as predicted if a zzso negative regulatory factor functions to suppress zzso gene expression in zzso zzso This factor is predicted to be a cell zzso regulator of zzso gene expression in zzso
