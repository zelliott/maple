The peripheral expression of zzso zzso for zzso zzso was investigated by zzso protection zzso A zzso protected zzso was zzso Using zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends, three different zzso fragments were zzso The longer zzso corresponded to the classical zzso zzso transcripts while the two shorter fragments lacked sequences zzso for zzso motifs of the zzso domain of zzso similarly to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of adult rat zzso showed the expression of zzso zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso lung and kidney but not in the central nervous zzso Their combined expression with zzso zzso transcripts suggests that specific peripheral zzso zzso may zzso zzso binding and function in zzso zzso
