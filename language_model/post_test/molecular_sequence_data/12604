An efficient method for mapping zzso is described in which hybrid zzso derived partly from zzso and partly from zzso DNA, are obtained in zzso by zzso zzso of multiple zzso The zzso are formed in a strain in which their zzso are immediately zzso This method was developed to identify changes that disrupt zzso interactions zzso by the zzso system in zzso However, it can be extended to any system where zzso is possible, provided an zzso is available to distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso
