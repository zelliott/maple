Type III zzso systems zzso of zzso bacteria mediate direct interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso genes zzso were previously shown to be more abundant in the zzso than in bulk zzso To discriminate the contribution of roots and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso on the enrichment of zzso fluorescent zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso their frequency was assessed among zzso isolated from zzso and zzso roots and from bulk zzso zzso genes were identified by zzso targeting a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso length zzso and zzso zzso diversity of all zzso isolated, whether or not harboring zzso was described by zzso zzso zzso were significantly more abundant in zzso than in zzso roots and in bulk soil, and all were shown to belong to the zzso group of zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso gene zzso Four zzso zzso were zzso two only included zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed different genetic backgrounds as indicated by their different zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso are implicated in interactions between fluorescent zzso and AM in medic zzso
