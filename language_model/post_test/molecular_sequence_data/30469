A cloned zzso fragment, zzso to domain II of the mouse zzso B1 chain, was obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this probe zzso analysis over the course of zzso revealed a first signal of a zzso transcript at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso were obtained via a zzso fusion zzso zzso demonstrated the appearance of the zzso at about one zzso stage after the detection of the zzso At stage 12 1/2 a faint zzso zzso surrounded the developing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared in distinct locations outlining zzso zzso and neural zzso The zzso basement membrane seemed to be endowed with zzso only at the relatively late zzso zzso The observation that zzso could not be detected before stage 12 1/2 is discussed with respect to a proposed role of zzso in the zzso zzso
