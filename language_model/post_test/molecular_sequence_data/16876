zzso zzso strain zzso is a nutritionally versatile soil zzso closely related to representatives of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike these bacteria, the zzso zzso is highly competent for natural transformation which zzso extraordinary convenience for genetic zzso The circular zzso of the zzso zzso presented here, encodes zzso predicted coding zzso of which zzso have been classified based on sequence similarity to other documented zzso The close evolutionary proximity of zzso and zzso species, as judged by the sequences of their zzso zzso genes and by the highest level of zzso best hits, contrasts with the extensive divergence in the zzso content of their DNA (40 versus zzso The zzso also differ significantly in size, with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the length of the zzso zzso Genome analysis of the zzso zzso revealed genes for zzso pathways involved in zzso of a large variety of zzso Almost all of these zzso with zzso that are scattered in other species, are located in five major zzso of zzso zzso now an apparent zzso of zzso zzso within one-quarter of the overall zzso zzso zzso displays many features of other zzso soil bacteria with metabolism oriented toward the degradation of organic compounds found in their natural zzso A distinguishing feature of this zzso is the absence of a gene corresponding to zzso zzso the zzso that generally zzso the terminal step in conversion of carbohydrates to zzso for zzso by the zzso acid zzso This finding supports the view that the cycle itself is centrally geared to the zzso capabilities of this exceptionally versatile zzso
