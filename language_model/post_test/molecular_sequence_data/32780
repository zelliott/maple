Human zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso or zzso to zzso or zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is formed by 31 zzso with 4 zzso and several alternative zzso signals, but an alternative form of zzso has yet to be zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a small form of zzso zzso and it is likely to be a product of alternative zzso of zzso The alignment of DNA sequences shows that the zzso matches zzso in 2 parts, except for a deletion of 170 zzso Based on the zzso zzso organization, zzso 1 and 4 should be joined and all sequences of zzso and zzso 2 and 3 should be deleted by zzso This alternative zzso shifted the translation of the reading frame from the point of zzso The estimated molecular mass is zzso zzso and this value was confirmed by Western zzso and mass zzso after expressing the gene fused with zzso in the zzso zzso The deletion and shift of the reading frame caused a loss of zzso activity, which was confirmed by zzso zzso and also with zzso cells modified to express zzso and challenged against zzso zzso In this work we describe the identification and characterization of zzso which is the product of alternative zzso of the zzso zzso
