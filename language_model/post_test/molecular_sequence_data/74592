zzso zzso family zzso are of particular interest for creating universal zzso trees and understanding the gene flow as these zzso perform the basic and analogous zzso function of protein synthesis in all extant zzso Among them, zzso zzso zzso plays a zzso role in zzso zzso to the close relationship with zzso zzso In this study, the sequence of the gene zzso was amplified using zzso zzso domain zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the cloned zzso zzso confirmed the zzso domain sequence with zzso acid zzso which is absent in five other oral bacteria used in this study as well as in a number of other bacteria described in the zzso The zzso sequence analysis prevailed the identify elements such as zzso sequence and zzso binding zzso including zzso stem and zzso A theoretical model of zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed a highly identical active site in comparison with the bacterial zzso The zzso positioning of zzso among a group of oral bacterial species revealed that zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
