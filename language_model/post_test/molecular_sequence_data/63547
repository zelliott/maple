Although rapid zzso changes in zzso on ecological time scales are now well documented in natural zzso the effects of such changes on zzso performance capacity and the consequences on ecological dynamics at the population level are often zzso Here we show how zzso have rapidly evolved differences in head zzso bite strength, and zzso tract structure after experimental introduction into a novel zzso Despite the short time scale ( approximately 36 zzso since this introduction, these changes in zzso and performance parallel those typically documented among species and even families of zzso in both the type and extent of their zzso Moreover, these changes have occurred side-by-side with dramatic changes in population density and social structure, providing a compelling example of how the invasion of a novel habitat can zzso drive multiple aspects of the zzso
