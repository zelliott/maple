zzso of the DNA of the virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso follows a zzso zzso zzso and zzso at a unique zzso location zzso We have cloned a zzso of zzso DNA containing the zzso site flanked by reporter genes into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of such cells with zzso led to highly efficient packaging, initiated at the inserted zzso site, of zzso zzso The zzso in the packaging of this DNA was the same as observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso insert defined an 83 base pair segment containing the zzso zzso site which is sufficient to direct zzso specific DNA zzso The packaging recognition signal as defined can also be zzso by the zzso related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
