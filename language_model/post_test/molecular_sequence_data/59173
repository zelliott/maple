This report describes the sequence and structural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso It also describes an in zzso technique based on zzso for sequencing without zzso This new technique was developed because it was impossible to clone certain parts of the zzso zzso zzso DNA in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are zzso as a zzso zzso with the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There are two major differences from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso Turner et zzso zzso zzso 176 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso 140 zzso zzso the absence of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and the absence of an open reading frame named zzso whose function is zzso Two mutually exclusive zzso structures were predicted at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso could be regulated by zzso zzso under the control of zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso was obtained with a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso proteins with other known zzso zzso proteins indicates that they display highly zzso regions in zzso and zzso zzso
