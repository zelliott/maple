The structure of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution with a bound zzso marking the zzso zzso The zzso is a 150 zzso zzso zzso shares a zzso sequence motif not only with several zzso zzso and the zzso zzso but also with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the crystal structures of zzso and zzso reveals striking similarity in the active site zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso core shows considerable similarity to the fold of the active site containing part of the zzso 67 zzso zzso despite the lack of further sequence zzso These two zzso are apparently related by divergent zzso We have also determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso with the zzso analog zzso zzso comparison of the native zzso and the zzso complex reveals that the zzso of zzso a putative zzso zzso moves toward the zzso so that it forms a hydrogen bond with the metal zzso when the zzso forms a zzso bond with zzso of zzso
