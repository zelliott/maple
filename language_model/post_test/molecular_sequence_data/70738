The production of zzso against zzso zzso zzso in zzso arthritis zzso patients suggests that the immune system of these patients has been exposed to such foreign zzso The presence of zzso zzso is, however, a genetic zzso We searched for zzso sequences specific for zzso zzso and zzso copies in individuals zzso for these zzso Using a sensitive and specific zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method with zzso DNA from blood of 18 zzso patients and 5 normal controls, we found zzso sequences in 18 of 18 tested zzso zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso fragments was confirmed by sequencing and zzso zzso The zzso products contained zzso zzso parts of the zzso zzso An analysis of zzso from inflammatory tissue of 5 zzso patients detected zzso zzso sequences in 1 of 3 tested zzso zzso and zzso sequences in 2 of 2 tested zzso zzso The zzso zzso products contained sequences from normally spliced zzso zzso zzso The results also showed that the zzso zzso sequences were present in very low copy numbers, lower than the zzso 1-2 copies per zzso The origin of such a low copy number of zzso gene fragments may be explained by a zzso capture and transfer mechanism of zzso gene fragments generated by the normal zzso zzso gene zzso zzso
