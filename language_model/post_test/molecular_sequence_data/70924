A general zzso of zzso turnover has been described for zzso in which the 3' zzso tail is first zzso to an zzso zzso leading to zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso The unstable zzso zzso and the stable zzso zzso both zzso through this pathway, albeit at different rates of zzso and zzso To determine the regions of the zzso that are responsible for these differences, we examined the zzso of zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso coding, and 3' untranslated regions of these two zzso These experiments have led to the identification of the features of these zzso that lead to their different zzso The zzso zzso is unstable solely because its 3' zzso promotes the rates of zzso and zzso all other features of this zzso are neutral with respect to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is stable because the sequence context of the zzso translation start zzso and the coding region function together to stabilize the transcript, whereas the zzso zzso is neutral with respect to zzso zzso changes in the zzso start zzso context that zzso the transcript also reduced its zzso zzso This observation suggests that the nature of the translation initiation complex zzso the rates of zzso zzso and zzso
