Acute zzso can lead to chronic zzso or resolve without permanent damage to the zzso zzso gene expression was studied in a model of acute and chronic zzso to identify factors influencing the course of zzso towards healing or zzso One of the zzso expressed genes was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso Its expression was higher in acute zzso and lower in chronic zzso The zzso regulation of zzso was studied in zzso in rat zzso cells zzso zzso zzso expression increased zzso compared to the baseline after stimulation with zzso zzso for three zzso zzso expression and gel shift experiments revealed an zzso element between zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso region, with protein binding to an zzso binding site that may be involved in the regulation of zzso in zzso in an zzso feedback mechanism to the inflammatory reaction in acute zzso leading to resolution of this zzso
