The zzso is particularly enriched with zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have previously reported on the enrichment of cultured rat zzso zzso in specific zzso zzso zzso binding sites and zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now identified which cell types express the zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso using either the zzso probe zzso or two zzso directed against distinct zzso of the zzso zzso was expressed in zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso was directed against the second zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso whereas the second was directed against the zzso zzso loop zzso acids zzso The zzso was evident over both zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the various zzso zzso zzso were mostly zzso as revealed by double zzso Most interestingly, a number of zzso cultured zzso zzso were also enriched with the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso may act as an zzso to regulate zzso release in the zzso These results thus provide an anatomical basis for the zzso of zzso and zzso release by the zzso zzso in the zzso
