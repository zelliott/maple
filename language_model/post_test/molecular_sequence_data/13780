The gene zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence revealed that the gene had an open reading flame of 1,050 zzso coding a protein of 350 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso similarity to human zzso zzso and zzso two zzso acid zzso identified in human and pig zzso zzso as essential ones for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli did not zzso the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, it zzso zzso zzso having a zzso acid, when compared with those having an zzso acid at the zzso Furthermore, it could not zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso has a unique zzso specificity and zzso zzso zzso having a zzso acid at the zzso
