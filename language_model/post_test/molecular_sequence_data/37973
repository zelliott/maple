Little is known about factors which enable zzso zzso to circulate within populations of livestock and domestic zzso We have identified a DNA region which is present in zzso zzso commonly isolated from livestock and domestic zzso zzso zzso subspecies I) but absent from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso subspecies II to zzso This DNA region was cloned from zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis revealed the presence of a zzso open reading frame, designated zzso whose product's deduced zzso acid sequence displayed zzso to that of zzso from zzso zzso coli, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene was located adjacent to zzso at 52 zzso in a zzso DNA region which is not present in zzso coli zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was shed with the feces in reduced numbers and for a shorter period of time compared to its zzso zzso A possible role for the zzso gene during the expansion in host range of zzso zzso subspecies I to include zzso zzso is zzso
