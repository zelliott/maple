zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso mediates the reductive zzso between zzso acid and the zzso or zzso groups of zzso and zzso to form zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso procedure involves zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso and affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of specific activity 40 zzso were obtained from 60 g of cells, wet zzso zzso zzso gel zzso revealed a single zzso active protein band, whereas three species zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso The zzso zzso is active over a broad pH range of zzso and is stable to heating at 50 degrees C for 10 zzso zzso zzso values were determined to be: zzso zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso has a relative molecular mass (Mr zzso zzso as estimated by high pressure liquid zzso exclusion zzso and by zzso zzso gel zzso Conventional gel zzso indicated an Mr zzso zzso and a single protein band of Mr zzso 38,000 was revealed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso is composed of identical zzso of Mr zzso zzso which may associate to yield both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso protein inhibited zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of the zzso is reported, and the sequence of the first 37 zzso acids from the zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso
