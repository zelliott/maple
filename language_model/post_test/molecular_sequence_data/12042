zzso the zzso proteins that elicit zzso T cell responses is key to rational vaccine zzso While several approaches have succeeded in identifying major zzso complex zzso class I bound peptides that stimulate zzso T cells, these approaches have been difficult to extend to peptides presented by zzso class II molecules that stimulate zzso T zzso We describe here a novel strategy for identifying zzso T zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso T cells as zzso zzso we screened a zzso zzso zzso library as zzso zzso coli that were fed to zzso The zzso gene was isolated from the zzso coli clone that, when zzso by the zzso allowed generation of the appropriate zzso class II complex and T cell zzso We show that the zzso zzso is derived from a previously unknown zzso gene product with characteristics of a zzso zzso
