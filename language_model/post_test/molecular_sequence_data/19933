Major advances in our understanding of marine bacterial diversity have been gained through studies of zzso the vast majority of which appear to be gram zzso Less effort has been devoted to studies of bacteria inhabiting marine zzso yet there is evidence to suggest that zzso bacteria comprise a relatively large proportion of these zzso To further expand our understanding of the zzso zzso bacteria present in tropical marine zzso a zzso approach was applied to sediments collected in the Republic of zzso from the zzso zone to depths of 500 zzso This investigation resulted in the isolation of zzso diverse zzso bacteria spanning 22 families, including many that appear to represent new zzso zzso analysis of 189 representative zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequence data, indicated that 124 zzso belonged to the class zzso while the remaining 65 zzso were members of the class zzso Using a sequence identity value of zzso the 189 zzso grouped into 78 operational zzso units, of which 29 zzso are likely to represent new zzso The high degree of zzso novelty observed during this study highlights the fact that a great deal remains to be learned about the diversity of zzso bacteria in marine zzso
