zzso zzso express the zzso factor zzso during skeletal muscle zzso Previous studies of zzso expression in embryonic zzso zzso and its response to muscle zzso in adults have led to the suggestion that its zzso may be activated in zzso and in zzso zzso through an interaction with the motor zzso We tested this hypothesis by zzso for zzso gene transcripts in early zzso stage zzso beginning before the appearance of zzso zzso transcripts were zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso from at least stage zzso well before the differentiation of either nerves or zzso We also tested the zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso by comparing transcript levels between zzso muscles in normal larvae and muscles whose motor zzso had been prevented through surgical removal of the brain before zzso motor zzso zzso zzso demonstrated similar zzso transcript levels in the zzso muscles and zzso These results fail to support the hypothesis that zzso gene expression is triggered or is significantly zzso in zzso cells by signals from motor zzso
