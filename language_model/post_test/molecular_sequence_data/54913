Using a zzso zzso screen, we isolated a gene from zzso zzso whose product interacts with zzso a zzso zzso involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity and zzso We have designated this gene zzso based on its similarity to zzso zzso is zzso zzso in higher zzso In the absence of zzso defects in cell growth and sensitivity to zzso B are zzso When zzso is zzso the lack of zzso causes a synthetic enhancement of the growth zzso the sensitivity to zzso B and the cell cycle zzso previously reported for zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso and zzso function together in zzso and zzso zzso
