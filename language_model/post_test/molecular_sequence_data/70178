In most zzso and benign skin diseases, the normal pattern of zzso expression is zzso Among other zzso changes, the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso Because the molecular mechanisms and the nuclear regulators involved in this induction are unknown, we have characterized the zzso regulators of expression of the zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown that the zzso of zzso is strongly and specifically induced in zzso zzso by zzso growth factor zzso through the zzso element zzso In the present work, using an zzso zzso zzso we have found several nuclear protein binding sites that have been identified as an zzso site, an zzso site, the zzso and an zzso zzso The function of each site was assessed in zzso zzso using specific zzso Both the zzso and zzso sites are essential for zzso promoter zzso The site that functions as an independent zzso zzso was found adjacent to and interacting with a sequence recognized by the zzso zzso zzso This knowledge of the nuclear regulators of expression of the zzso zzso zzso provides insight into the molecular parameters that might be important in skin zzso
