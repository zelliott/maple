The use of zzso cells and zzso as a source of zzso for human patients would vastly increase the donor zzso however, both humans and Old World primates vigorously reject pig zzso due to zzso that react with the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso present on the surface of many zzso zzso We previously examined the zzso response in patients exposed to zzso zzso via zzso with zzso liver devices zzso composed of zzso cells in a support zzso We determined that zzso in zzso patients are predominantly directed at zzso zzso zzso zzso and are zzso by a small number of zzso heavy chain variable region zzso zzso zzso The studies described in this manuscript were designed to identify whether the zzso responses and the zzso genes zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso primates used as zzso models are similar to those in zzso Adult zzso zzso monkeys zzso zzso were injected zzso with zzso zzso or zzso transplanted with a zzso liver zzso zzso blood zzso and serum were obtained prior to and at multiple time points after exposure, and the immune response was zzso using zzso to evaluate the levels and zzso of circulating zzso and the production of zzso libraries to determine the genes used by B cells to zzso those zzso 

zzso produced following exposure to isolated zzso and solid organ liver zzso were predominantly zzso by genes in the zzso family, with a minor contribution from the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso library screening and gene sequencing of zzso libraries identified the genes as most zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso One of the genes most similar to zzso zzso has not been previously identified, and encodes zzso at later time points zzso zzso of zzso clones revealed increased usage of the monkey zzso zzso most similar to human zzso and the onset of zzso 

The small number of zzso genes zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso primates and humans is highly zzso zzso monkeys are an appropriate zzso model for testing novel zzso such as those developed using zzso drug design to target and zzso zzso to zzso zzso
