zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso coli zzso are important zzso pathogens that increasingly are becoming resistant to multiple zzso Here we describe two zzso zzso zzso zzso from a human zzso zzso and zzso zzso from a bovine zzso zzso that impart resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and both contain zzso class 1 zzso with an identical zzso deletion in their zzso zzso Complete sequence analysis showed that zzso and zzso are essentially identical except for a zzso zzso fragment, present in the backbone of zzso but absent in zzso and several zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso genes involved in zzso stability during zzso a putative zzso gene and three imperfect zzso zzso sequence identical to regions within these zzso imperfect repeats was identified in zzso precisely where the zzso zzso zzso is missing, suggesting it may be zzso zzso shared between the plasmids include a complete zzso zzso a unique zzso system, zzso stability and maintenance zzso a novel putative zzso zzso zzso and an zzso transfer system including a unique zzso Both plasmids carry a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso class 1 zzso zzso a zzso gene cassette zzso resistance to zzso and 24 zzso of the zzso segment followed by zzso which encodes resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is linked to a truncated zzso zzso resistance to zzso via a region containing the zzso zzso zzso of the 5 zzso direct repeats zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso events played a key role in the formation of this complex zzso resistance gene zzso Comparative sequence analysis of these closely related plasmids reveals aspects of zzso evolution in zzso zzso coli from different zzso
