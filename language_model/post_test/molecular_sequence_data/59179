A series of zzso has been constructed to express the human T cell zzso V beta zzso under the control of the hybrid zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso promoter was achieved chemically by using zzso zzso zzso in a bacterial strain that harbors the zzso zzso or zzso by using the zzso zzso gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso expression zzso based on zzso zzso zzso expression of human zzso virus zzso gene in zzso zzso Gene 70, zzso Several of the plasmids tested also contain the zzso coli zzso zzso II zzso signal sequence for protein zzso In addition, the gene 10 leader sequence from zzso zzso and a zzso localized upstream of the V beta zzso coding sequence were tested for their potential effect on protein zzso These elements increased protein yield zzso when zzso was induced by zzso but had no zzso effect on protein yield when zzso was induced zzso The highest protein yield was obtained when V beta zzso was expressed either from zzso zzso containing the zzso signal in strain zzso or from zzso zzso that lacks the signal zzso in the zzso deficient strain zzso zzso zzso zzso Both plasmids contain the zzso zzso the zzso promoter, the two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and a zzso selection zzso zzso of V beta zzso using zzso beta zzso in strain zzso in a 5-liter zzso under controlled growth conditions yielded over 25 zzso V beta zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso gene yielded zzso zzso beta zzso which exhibits complete repression of the zzso promoter at 30 degrees zzso This stringent regulation of the zzso zzso zzso promoter, the elimination of zzso the inclusion of the zzso resistance zzso and the high level of protein yield should render this expression system broadly useful for the high level production of zzso proteins in zzso coli, for both basic research and human therapeutic zzso
