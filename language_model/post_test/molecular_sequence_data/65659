zzso modifications of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determine its functional state, and defects in these modifications are linked to muscular zzso and zzso A prominent feature of zzso zzso is a precursor zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso attached zzso and zzso We investigate here the structural zzso and functional significance of this zzso We show that zzso of zzso elicits a conspicuous change in its zzso zzso zzso that zzso this zzso result in increased capacity to bind zzso in part, due to enhanced zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso expression system demonstrates that zzso takes place in the zzso zzso providing a suitable regulatory point for later processing zzso zzso and zzso analyses reveal that the zzso occurs within a full SEA zzso urchin, zzso zzso module with traits matching those ascribed to zzso Thus, zzso of zzso constitutes a control point for the zzso of its zzso properties, with therapeutic implications for muscular zzso We provide a structural model for the zzso domain that is validated by experimental analysis and discuss this zzso in the context of zzso protein and SEA domain zzso
