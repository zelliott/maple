A zzso positive zzso zzso method was developed to explore zzso genes in common between zzso strains of zzso zzso a zzso able to produce zzso zzso The zzso technique is based on the same principles of suppression zzso zzso zzso although with the former no driver DNA is required and two tester zzso zzso are zzso at high zzso The aim was to obtain genes associated with zzso zzso zzso The genetic diversity within zzso similar strains of zzso was investigated by comparing the results of the standard zzso protocol to the zzso approach by zzso zzso zzso allowed the recovery of DNA libraries that were mainly specific for each of the two zzso strains zzso Several candidate sequences were found by zzso to be in common between both the zzso zzso The zzso technique performed using zzso zzso libraries proved to be a powerful tool to identify DNA sequences possibly transferred zzso between two zzso strains that may be zzso in zzso zzso The approach presented in this study represents a novel and valid tool to study the genetic basis for secondary zzso production in zzso
