zzso patterning is thought to be a zzso process involving zzso of the limb fields, establishment of defined signaling centers that globally inform cells of their position, interpretation of zzso signals, and regulated growth and differentiation of the limb zzso Great progress has been made over the past few years in identifying the molecular players that control limb outgrowth and zzso in particular, how the limb axes are zzso However, the molecular mechanism for determination of the zzso and functional differences between forelimbs and zzso has remained zzso The recent identification of a series of zzso zzso factors has now provided excellent candidates for such upstream regulators of limb identity, and has allowed new insights into the regulatory network of making a hand or a zzso
