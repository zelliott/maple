The species zzso zzso includes a quite complex group of pathogens that cause a variety of diseases in zzso Best studied strains of this species are those of the subspecies zzso also referred to as zzso zzso zzso which cause zzso in zzso Less completely understood are bacteria assigned to other subspecies, zzso zzso and zzso or those that cannot be assigned to a recognized zzso These strains are referred to collectively as zzso zzso zzso and cause diseases distinct from zzso primarily affecting zzso In the course of a study to investigate the suitability of the gene product of zzso as a zzso zzso we discovered several zzso strains of zzso zzso in which the zzso gene was interrupted by an zzso sequence zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses indicated that nearly all zzso strains (27 of 29) examined carry many copies of this zzso which we named zzso zzso characterization of this IS element revealed it to be a member of the zzso family, zzso zzso Aside from the presence of zzso in several zzso zzso the zzso sequence of zzso was virtually identical to that found in typical zzso This finding suggests that zzso might be a major source of genetic diversity among zzso strains which, unlike typical zzso are genetically zzso The presence of zzso in zzso strains may also help explain the host zzso of zzso strains of this zzso Using information on the zzso sequences of zzso from zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso were designed to selectively amplify zzso DNA from most zzso zzso
