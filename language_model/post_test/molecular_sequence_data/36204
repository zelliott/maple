We have studied the zzso upstream sequences required for the zzso regulation of the zzso gene zzso the intermediate filament zzso zzso Although zzso is regarded as the intermediate filament protein of zzso zzso it is also produced in most cultured zzso The human zzso zzso cell line, zzso belongs to the zzso It contains no zzso and the complete upstream promoter region is inactive in this particular cell zzso By using transient zzso of zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cells, and subsequent zzso zzso zzso we were able to show the presence of two negative control regions zzso a double zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that these elements exert their effect irrespective of orientation and position, suggesting that they are zzso In zzso zzso zzso gel mobility zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso factors interacting with both zzso zzso The zzso effect was particularly pronounced in zzso cells, although zzso proteins are present in zzso cells as zzso
