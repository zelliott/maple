We have isolated zzso clones and deduced the complete zzso acid sequence of a large zzso protein zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso The human gene zzso this zzso zzso zzso beta (or zzso zzso has been localized to zzso zzso zzso beta is composed of a large zzso domain, a single zzso domain, and a zzso portion with two tandem zzso zzso We have also cloned a zzso of zzso beta lacking zzso zzso acids from the zzso domain but with intact zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso region of the zzso domain of zzso beta contains a stretch of zzso zzso acids with striking zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments from a human zzso cell line indicate that the apparent molecular mass of the core and zzso forms of zzso beta are approximately 250 and 300 zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that zzso beta is strictly expressed in the central nervous zzso In zzso zzso was used to further zzso the expression to different regions of the adult brain including the zzso cell layer of the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso layer of the anterior horn of the lateral zzso zzso zzso beta represents the first zzso zzso zzso whose expression is restricted to the nervous zzso The high level of expression of zzso beta transcripts in the zzso and zzso zones of the embryonic mouse brain suggests the importance of this zzso zzso in the development of the central nervous zzso
