The limited zzso pattern of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso with zzso were analyzed and the zzso sites on the alpha zzso zzso were zzso The alpha zzso zzso in the zzso gamma S bound form was zzso into a major 38 zzso fragment, whereas alpha zzso was progressively zzso into 38, 23, 21, and 15 zzso zzso The beta gamma zzso zzso was not very sensitive to zzso zzso with zzso The gamma zzso zzso was not zzso and only a small portion of beta zzso was zzso into several zzso In order to determine which zzso zzso of alpha zzso still contained the zzso terminal region, zzso was carried out using zzso previously zzso at zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso was mainly associated with the alpha zzso zzso and a 15 zzso zzso The 23 and 21 zzso fragments were not zzso Analysis of zzso terminal sequences of 38, 21, and 15 zzso zzso bands allowed the identification of the major zzso zzso zzso had two zzso sites in the zzso terminal region of alpha zzso at zzso and zzso zzso removed zzso zzso acid zzso from the zzso zzso of alpha zzso generating two peptides zzso zzso which zzso in gel zzso zzso also zzso at zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of alpha zzso gamma S was resistant to zzso but alpha zzso and the 38 zzso fragments of alpha zzso produced the 23 and 21 zzso fragments, respectively, and a 15 zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
