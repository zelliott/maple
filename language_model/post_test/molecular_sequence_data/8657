Two zzso of zzso zzso were transformed with the gene zzso tobacco mosaic virus zzso movement protein zzso zzso accumulated largely in a zzso fraction containing cell wall components and as a soluble zzso The protein migrated in zzso gels with an zzso of zzso significantly faster than zzso zzso approximately zzso accumulating after expression in transgenic zzso zzso coli or zzso zzso cells, or after virus zzso in zzso The zzso from zzso zzso infected with zzso for 14 days zzso with that from zzso coli, but that from zzso zzso infected for 49 days was of the smaller zzso The use of zzso specific for the zzso or zzso of zzso showed that in zzso zzso zzso was zzso processed at the zzso a region essential for zzso zzso The failure of these plants to complement a zzso zzso zzso indicated that processed zzso was zzso although the processing was not so rapid that it prevented the development of systemic infections with wild type zzso The absence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was not essential for movement protein function and suggested that this species may use zzso zzso of the zzso as an alternative strategy to tobacco for zzso zzso
