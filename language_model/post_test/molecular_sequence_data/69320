zzso binds to zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso gave this zzso zzso This established the position of this zzso within zzso as beginning with the zzso tentatively designated zzso Neither the zzso sequence nor the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ginsberg, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was contained in this zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and binding of zzso to activated zzso The zzso bound to immobilized zzso The zzso zzso zzso directly bound to zzso zzso with zzso zzso 4,600 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso but was not blocked by either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the additional zzso binding zzso to zzso are present on zzso This additional binding zzso on zzso may prevent zzso formation by interfering with the interaction of zzso with zzso
