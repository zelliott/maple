The zzso family proteins zzso zzso and zzso are serum response factor zzso zzso and potent zzso zzso zzso studies have indicated important zzso functions for zzso family proteins primarily in regulation of cardiac and smooth muscle zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso databases, we identified a zzso zzso factor expressed specifically in the skeletal muscle zzso zzso and sequence alignments indicate that this gene is the zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso Sutherland zzso Oh J, zzso zzso Olson zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso domain proteins zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso of zzso function in the zzso zzso by using zzso constructions or zzso zzso results in a dramatic reduction in expression of skeletal muscle marker zzso zzso of zzso in whole zzso or embryonic tissue zzso zzso zzso expression of muscle marker zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with the zzso regulatory factors zzso and zzso to activate zzso of skeletal muscle zzso An essential function for zzso in regulation of zzso development in the zzso zzso has not been previously zzso
