Most of the research on the zzso phenomenon of DNA zzso has been performed with zzso and zzso zzso on DNA zzso in zzso zzso a key test zzso in aquatic zzso is completely zzso Through zzso zzso effects of transient chemical exposure could be transferred to zzso generations, which could have a major impact on ecological risk assessment zzso In this study, we determined if zzso zzso occurs in zzso magna and if this can be influenced by exposure to toxic zzso zzso of human DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in the partially available zzso magna zzso Using an zzso zzso of zzso Sites zzso technique, two zzso fragments were discovered in zzso magna zzso No zzso was found for these zzso The zzso and the zzso magna origin of the fragments were confirmed with Southern zzso This zzso zzso technique was then applied to DNA of zzso magna which were exposed to 180 zzso zzso for two zzso Exposure resulted in a significant decrease in zzso The same zzso fragments with the same band intensity were observed in DNA of both zzso and exposed zzso As such, it could not be demonstrated that zzso exposure altered DNA zzso However, the presence of DNA zzso in zzso magna shows that potentially zzso effects may occur in this zzso
