zzso group zzso proteins are a special set of repressive zzso factors involved in zzso modifications of zzso They form two functionally distinct groups of zzso active zzso zzso repressive complex 1 zzso and 2 zzso The zzso complex is an important yet poorly characterized zzso zzso zzso machine responsible for maintaining zzso silent states of genes through zzso zzso zzso zzso The Ring domain containing zzso of zzso also have zzso zzso that interact with zzso zzso which have been implicated in zzso and zzso zzso In this work, we present a high resolution structure of the zzso domain of zzso revealing a zzso zzso fold with a distinct zzso surface zzso On the basis of crystal structure and zzso analysis of this domain we show that the zzso surface is responsible for interaction with zzso members of the zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest a mechanism by which zzso serves as an zzso that mediates binding between the members of the zzso complex and the zzso
