zzso factor zzso also called zzso zzso 3 zzso is a member of the zzso gene family and is produced by zzso zzso zzso While the understanding of its effects is growing, very little is known about the structural and functional properties of native zzso Here, we demonstrate that native zzso isolated from goat zzso is a zzso structure with full biological activity, and is zzso expressed and zzso by zzso zzso Using a series of zzso steps, native zzso was highly zzso as a single zzso peak as revealed by zzso zzso analysis provided zzso sequence coverage and revealed a distinct zzso structure consisting of the zzso zzso and zzso deduced previously from the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was six zzso acid zzso longer than zzso Native zzso exhibited full zzso in zzso cells expressing the zzso for zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso was zzso by zzso cells through the zzso zzso into blood and body zzso We zzso therefore, that goat zzso is zzso zzso from zzso cells as a zzso zzso structure with full biological zzso
