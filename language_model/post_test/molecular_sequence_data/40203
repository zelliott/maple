zzso surveillance was implemented in zzso eastern India in 2005 to identify the circulating zzso and characterize their genetic zzso zzso and zzso zzso were collected from zzso with zzso illness zzso Of zzso zzso cases identified at two referral hospitals during October zzso 2009, 309 zzso were positive for zzso A by real time zzso of which 110 zzso were zzso as zzso and 199 zzso as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso sequences of the zzso gene for zzso and zzso strains showed that a subset of strains zzso WHO recommended contemporary strains by 1-2 zzso The zzso zzso strains clustered in zzso II, zzso zzso with zzso but were distant from the corresponding vaccine strains (New zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and 2007 zzso strains zzso clustered either zzso zzso or zzso like zzso zzso whereas 2008 strains zzso and 2009 strains zzso were similar to the zzso vaccine strain zzso More zzso zzso were found in zzso or zzso genes of zzso than in zzso zzso No zzso zzso zzso resistance was observed in any of the strain during zzso however in 2009, drug resistant marker zzso was present in seasonal zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of genetic characterization of circulating zzso A strains from zzso The results also highlight the importance of continuing zzso surveillance in developing countries of Asia for monitoring unusual strains with pandemic potential and zzso zzso zzso zzso
