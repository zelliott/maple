To determine if zzso zzso zzso might contribute to the zzso observed in zzso disease zzso we zzso the amount of the common zzso zzso zzso pair deletion zzso in zzso and zzso of HD patients and zzso controls by the serial zzso chain reaction zzso zzso deletion levels were analyzed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso HD zzso zzso had an zzso greater mean zzso deletion level than zzso controls, and HD frontal zzso had fivefold greater zzso HD zzso lobe and zzso deletion levels were comparable with control zzso These results support the hypothesis that HD is associated with elevated cortical zzso zzso
