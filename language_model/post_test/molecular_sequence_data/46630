The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso proteins are involved in the regulation of zzso cellular zzso We isolated the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzed its expression during zzso development, and performed a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the two major zzso zzso forms in zzso the alpha and beta forms, there is only one zzso zzso zzso in zzso Our analysis indicates that the occurrence of the alpha and beta forms of zzso zzso preceded the divergence of lineages leading to birds and zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso may have evolved directly from the common zzso of both zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso the zzso zzso alpha genes are predominantly expressed in neural zzso The expression analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene shows predominantly neural expression similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso alpha form, suggesting that the ancestral expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso was zzso In addition, the chicken zzso zzso zzso gene also shows zzso zzso which indicates that the neural expression was retained in both early zzso alpha and beta zzso and that a novel function associated with ubiquitous expression may have evolved uniquely in zzso These results reveal a likely scenario of functional divergence of the zzso zzso genes after zzso of the ancestral zzso A similar pattern of evolution, in which one of the duplicated genes retained a role similar to that of the ancestral one while other genes were recruited into novel roles, was also observed in the analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene families, the gene retaining the ancestral role shows a lower rate of sequence evolution than its counterpart, which was recruited for a novel zzso
