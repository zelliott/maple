Human zzso zzso proteins contain three zzso zzso recognition motifs zzso Previous reports demonstrated that a single zzso of the proteins is not sufficient to bind to the zzso stretch in the 3' untranslated region of zzso and that the zzso zzso consisting of the first two zzso is necessary for the zzso The present study was designed to examine the potential contributions of the first two zzso when binding to a zzso zzso zzso of the internal or terminal zzso acid zzso of the first zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein completely abolished zzso zzso However, removal of any region of the second zzso zzso except for the eight zzso acid zzso which zzso to the potent fourth zzso structure of zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso of the eight zzso acid zzso to zzso enhanced the zzso binding as well as the entire zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso can be compensated for by the binding function of zzso The present study also showed that the zzso of zzso acid at 42 for zzso acid and zzso at 44 for zzso in the first potent zzso structure of zzso as were seen in another zzso protein zzso markedly affected the zzso zzso
