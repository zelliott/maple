The gene coding for the zzso zzso regulated zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso 3 rat zzso library and completely zzso The gene spanned zzso base pairs and contained nine zzso zzso and downstream DNA of zzso and 825 base pairs, respectively, was also zzso and the zzso start site was identified by both zzso mapping and primer zzso A typical zzso box was found just upstream of the start zzso however, no zzso box was zzso Other repetitive sequences were identified including a partial zzso sequence upstream of the gene and a long stretch of 160 alternating zzso in the second zzso This latter repetitive element is found in many zzso zzso By use of a panel of zzso zzso cell hybrids, the zzso gene was localized to mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is zzso activated within 1 day after birth and reaches a zzso level of expression at 6 days of zzso Using restriction zzso sites generated from the gene sequence data and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we found that this zzso zzso during early development is zzso with specific zzso only at the zzso end of the zzso zzso Interestingly, other zzso zzso in the middle of the gene became zzso as rats aged from 1 to 10 weeks, at which time no changes in gene expression zzso
