zzso is a synaptic zzso zzso protein of unknown zzso Here we show that a repeated sequence in the zzso tail of zzso mediates the formation of a protein complex containing the zzso zzso The formation of this complex requires a high zzso zzso suggesting that it occurs zzso at the sites of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso complex from brain extracts is promoted by zzso of zzso membrane protein 2 from zzso This finding suggests that zzso only associates with zzso in zzso after zzso membrane protein 2 zzso enters the zzso zzso zzso binding releases zzso from zzso possibly serving to regulate zzso zzso during zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso recycling by recruiting zzso to the zzso zzso
