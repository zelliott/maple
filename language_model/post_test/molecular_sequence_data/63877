Previous linkage analyses of zzso aneurysm zzso have proposed several genetic zzso zzso however, some zzso remain zzso The objective of this study was to confirm these zzso in a Japanese population using zzso and zzso association zzso We set zzso single zzso zzso markers in previously suggested zzso zzso and conducted an association analysis in 29 cases and 35 controls from a small community in zzso zzso zzso was carried out using the zzso 10 K mapping zzso and the association analysis was performed using zzso zzso zzso The result was confirmed in a replication cohort consisting of 237 cases and zzso controls from all over zzso Only one zzso zzso at zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso both in zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso This association was confirmed in the replication cohort zzso for zzso association, zzso for zzso zzso Our findings confirm zzso to be a zzso locus for zzso zzso
