zzso immunity relies on specific recognition of viral zzso to mount a zzso defense against viral zzso zzso recognition zzso in intrinsic immunity genes are expected to evolve rapidly as host genes adapt to changing zzso resulting in a signature of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from rats was discovered to be an intrinsic immunity gene that can restrict zzso leukemia virus, and certain zzso and zzso Here, we used an approach combining molecular evolution and cellular zzso zzso to address whether zzso also acts as a restriction factor in zzso and to pinpoint which protein zzso may directly interact with the zzso We find that zzso has evolved under positive selection throughout zzso zzso zzso positive selection is only found in the zzso zzso zzso domain present in a longer human zzso zzso This zzso domain was not present in the previously identified and tested rat zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that the longer zzso of zzso that contains the zzso domain is a stronger zzso of zzso leukemia virus expression and zzso forest virus zzso Our study thus finds that human zzso encodes a potent zzso activity against zzso The striking zzso between our evolutionary predictions and cellular zzso zzso strongly zzso such a combined approach to study intrinsic immunity zzso
