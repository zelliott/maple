Progress through the zzso cell cycle is regulated by zzso zzso protein zzso In rice zzso zzso zzso two zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso In this study, we report on the zzso zzso expression of these zzso Using partially synchronized suspension cells from rice, we found that zzso was expressed zzso throughout the cell zzso The zzso transcript level was elevated in zzso and S zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts increased steadily through zzso and dropped off rapidly in zzso as is typical for zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso gene product acts in zzso and that the zzso hormone zzso zzso that zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso rice zzso zzso zzso phase progression through increased expression of zzso and zzso phase progression through increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene from rice has zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso family of protein zzso which have been shown to zzso and thereby activate zzso protein zzso in animals and zzso In partially synchronized suspension cells, zzso zzso levels were elevated in zzso and S zzso In zzso rice zzso zzso transcript levels were elevated in the zzso and part of the zzso zzso These results are consistent with a role for zzso in regulating zzso phase zzso
