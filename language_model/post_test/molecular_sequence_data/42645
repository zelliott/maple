In order to evaluate the usefulness of the zzso chain reaction zzso for diagnosis and monitoring of zzso zzso pneumonia zzso in specimens obtained from zzso techniques, zzso or induced zzso were collected from 30 patients who were tentatively diagnosed as having zzso and administered intravenous zzso Using appropriate criteria, 13 of these cases were diagnosed as having zzso 12 cases were diagnosed of other pulmonary diseases, and five cases were omitted from the study according to the exclusion zzso zzso was performed using zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in nine of the 13 defined cases zzso of zzso and in none of 12 zzso cases zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was detected in only one case by microscopic examination using zzso zzso zzso the sensitivity of zzso was significantly higher than that observed with the stain zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso samples were also obtained from eight cases during the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso as judged by zzso varied from three to 38 days zzso zzso zzso after the start of the zzso zzso zzso shedding in zzso correlated with the time between initial clinical symptoms and initiation of the treatment zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso but not with the tension of zzso at the time of zzso This preliminary study demonstrates that zzso allows early diagnosis of zzso and that close monitoring with zzso specimens can be performed by zzso
