A molecular approach to type a new zzso zzso zzso characterized by its unusual association with the public zzso zzso referred to as zzso has been zzso zzso disclosing zzso identity with zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso Based upon zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso the following procedure was zzso zzso and 3' zzso were designed by zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso 2 zzso 1 zzso The zzso primer discriminates with zzso -C genes and zzso while the 3' primer detects the sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso and discriminates it from the zzso zzso The combination of this pair of zzso specifically zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso for zzso was performed using a combination of two zzso labeled zzso zzso identifying positions zzso and zzso in zzso zzso To resolve ambiguous zzso patterns, an additional set of zzso was zzso The specificity of this zzso amplification procedure was investigated on 150 zzso DNA zzso Among them, we obtained 94 amplified DNA products which were tested with eight zzso zzso zzso the following B zzso could be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA samples gave similar zzso pattern providing a clue to the identity of these zzso This zzso zzso and two zzso procedure represents a simple zzso strategy which can also be applied to type many other zzso zzso
