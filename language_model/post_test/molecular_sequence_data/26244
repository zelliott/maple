A zzso zzso chain reaction zzso procedure was used as a new screening strategy for the detection of human zzso zzso zzso in cervical scrapes omitting prior DNA zzso Sample preparation consisted of a zzso step followed by boiling the cells before the zzso mixture was zzso This zzso was as efficient and zzso for zzso DNA amplification as DNA zzso By using crude cell suspensions, a zzso of the samples with the general zzso zzso method zzso was performed to detect a broad spectrum of zzso and still zzso zzso types at the zzso zzso zzso scrapes by zzso were subjected to zzso 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, and 33 zzso zzso zzso to identify the zzso zzso zzso This direct zzso method was tested on a large group of cervical scrapes zzso zzso zzso from women visiting a zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with zzso data obtained by a method using modified filter in zzso zzso and zzso in which the zzso was mainly used to confirm zzso zzso A substantially higher zzso prevalence rate was found by direct zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is a zzso sensitive, and reliable detection method for zzso in cervical zzso The easy performance on crude cell suspensions makes this strategy zzso for large zzso zzso
