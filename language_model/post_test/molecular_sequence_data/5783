Maple syrup urine disease zzso is an zzso zzso disorder caused by defective function of the zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso of any of three genes for component proteins result in the clinical zzso Two discrete zzso zzso for the E1 beta zzso of the zzso component in a zzso with zzso are defined and parental origin of each zzso zzso The maternal zzso an A to T zzso at zzso 526 in the coding zzso zzso an zzso to zzso change at position 126 zzso The paternal zzso zzso contains a C to T transition at zzso 970 introducing a stop zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed a zzso reduction in the E1 zzso protein and an absence of the zzso truncated protein in zzso zzso Both zzso proteins could be zzso imported into zzso and processed in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso proteins provided new information on the role of E1 beta in the activity of zzso In zzso the E1 zzso protein associated into zzso complexes indistinguishable from those formed with the wild type E1 beta zzso However, zzso activity of these complexes in zzso cells was zzso zzso of wild type zzso zzso comparisons with other zzso zzso zzso suggests the zzso substitution could interfere with interactions of the protein with the zzso causing zzso The truncated E1 zzso protein is unstable and not found in zzso from the patient derived zzso
