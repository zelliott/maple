The controlled and specific zzso of zzso tumor zzso in cancer cells represents an important therapeutic strategy to block tumor growth and subsequent zzso Other than zzso delivery of tumor zzso zzso there are no therapeutic tools able to specifically zzso tumor zzso genes that are silenced in tumor zzso zzso we describe a novel approach to specifically regulate dormant tumor zzso in aggressive cancer zzso We have targeted the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso which is silenced by zzso and zzso promoter zzso in aggressive zzso zzso zzso is a multifaceted zzso regulating tumor cell zzso through zzso of cell growth, zzso and zzso We have constructed artificial zzso factors zzso made of six zzso zzso zzso targeted against zzso pair zzso unique sequences in the zzso zzso The zzso were linked to the zzso domain zzso and delivered in breast tumor zzso We found that the designed zzso specifically interact with their zzso targets in zzso with high affinity and zzso One zzso was able to zzso zzso in cell lines that comprise a zzso promoter silenced by zzso zzso zzso we found that this zzso was a powerful zzso of zzso and was able to knock down tumor cell invasion in zzso Moreover, this zzso was able to suppress zzso growth in a zzso breast cancer model in nude zzso Our work suggests that zzso could be used in cancer zzso as novel molecular switches to zzso dormant tumor zzso
