We sought to identify genes with altered expression during human breast cancer progression by applying zzso comparisons of normal and tumor zzso cell lines with increasingly zzso zzso The gene zzso a new zzso zzso was found to be zzso in tumor zzso zzso expression and zzso activities of zzso in tumor cells result in the formation of zzso zzso zzso that can be used for the better understanding of the disease process and are applied for tumor diagnosis and zzso zzso zzso patterns of the zzso zzso in particular, is a target zzso for zzso of breast and other zzso 

Total zzso from multiple normal zzso zzso cell strains and tumor cell lines were compared by differential display and the differential expression of selected zzso was confirmed by Northern zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso and linkage specificity of zzso was examined using various zzso and zzso proteins as zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene was assigned by zzso cell hybrid zzso 

A human zzso gene was identified by differential display as being zzso in breast tumor cell lines as compared to normal zzso zzso cell zzso and the corresponding full-length zzso zzso was zzso The zzso protein of 374 zzso acid zzso contained the zzso and zzso two zzso regions zzso in all functional zzso zzso zzso is an active zzso zzso with Gal beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso Gal beta zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was mapped to the long arm of human zzso 17 at zzso a region that is zzso deleted in human breast zzso However, Southern analyses indicated that zzso is usually not zzso rearranged in breast zzso Northern analyses showed that the gene was widely expressed in normal human zzso as well as in normal breast and prostate zzso cell lines, but significantly zzso or absent in corresponding tumor cell zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso expression of zzso zzso in tumors could be a feature of the zzso zzso In breast zzso the zzso zzso is zzso and contains shorter zzso as compared to the normal zzso Because zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso cloning and characterization of its zzso specificity will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso patterns of zzso and the formation of zzso zzso in human breast zzso
