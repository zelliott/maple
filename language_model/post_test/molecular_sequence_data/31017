From the studies presented above, it is obvious that fatty zzso is a common modification among proteins involved in cellular regulatory zzso and in certain cases zzso analyses have demonstrated the importance of zzso fatty acids in the functioning of these zzso Indeed, certain properties provided by fatty zzso make it an attractive modification for regulatory proteins that might interact with many different zzso particularly those found at or near the plasma zzso zzso In the case of zzso fatty zzso zzso the fatty zzso zzso allows tight binding to the plasma membrane without the need for zzso zzso through the zzso For example, consider the tight, zzso interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso whereas its zzso counterpart is completely zzso zzso for the zzso zzso which associate zzso with the membrane in the absence of fatty zzso while zzso increases their affinity for the plasma membrane and their biological zzso zzso zzso also permits zzso membrane association in some cases, particularly for several zzso zzso thus zzso plasticity on their interactions with various signaling zzso zzso Finally, although this has not been demonstrated, it is conceivable that zzso fatty acid may allow for rapid mobility of proteins within the zzso Several questions remain to be answered concerning requirements for fatty zzso by regulatory zzso The identity of the putative zzso zzso will provide important clues as to the pathways in which normal zzso functions, as well as into the process of transformation by zzso zzso zzso The possibility that other fatty zzso proteins associate with the plasma membrane in an analogous manner also needs to be zzso An intriguing observation that can be made from the information presented here is that at least three different families of proteins involved in growth factor signaling pathways zzso both zzso and zzso members, suggesting that selective fatty zzso may provide a means of determining the specificity of their interactions with other regulatory zzso Further studies of fatty zzso proteins should yield important information concerning the regulation of zzso signaling pathways zzso during growth and zzso
