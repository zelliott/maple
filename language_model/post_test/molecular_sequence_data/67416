Isolation and full sequence analysis of zzso zzso which carries the zzso zzso 

zzso resistance zzso zzso plasmids were isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing was achieved by a zzso zzso The total sizes of these plasmids zzso and zzso were 6900 zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and they were zzso identical to each zzso The genes zzso and zzso for zzso replication were organized similar to the corresponding genes in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso but the gene zzso for zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso gene was part of a mobile zzso cassette element in the zzso 

Two plasmids were assumed to be the same zzso and this identification of a zzso zzso gene from the two different strains zzso a possible diffusion of these resistance zzso in an aquaculture zzso 

This is the first finding of the zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso
