zzso of zzso consist of the major structural protein zzso the minor structural proteins zzso and zzso and the viral zzso associated with zzso An additional structural zzso zzso is present in avian zzso zzso zzso As it had been reported that expression of zzso zzso in insect cells did not result in the formation of zzso particles zzso the zzso for particle formation were zzso To this end, zzso influenza viruses were created to zzso the structural proteins of zzso in chicken zzso cells, zzso for zzso zzso zzso expressed individually or zzso with zzso did not result in zzso zzso both proteins zzso in the zzso Transport of zzso or the zzso complex, into the nucleus was facilitated by the zzso of zzso and resulted in the formation of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso nuclear zzso signal of zzso virus 40 zzso was transported to the nucleus and assembled into zzso These results support a model of zzso zzso assembly in which complexes of the structural proteins zzso zzso (or zzso and zzso formed within the zzso are transported to the nucleus using the nuclear zzso signal of zzso (or zzso there, zzso formation is induced by the nuclear zzso
