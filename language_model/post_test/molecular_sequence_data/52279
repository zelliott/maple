A zzso zzso of the normally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso possesses functional zzso I and II zzso and zzso but lacks normal light harvesting zzso because zzso is absent and zzso zzso proteins are almost entirely zzso The zzso responsible for the zzso zzso has been zzso it is a base substitution which results in the creation of a termination zzso within the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rod zzso proteins are present in zzso and, despite the absence of core zzso at least zzso of the PC is associated with rod zzso zzso At 77 K, light absorbed by PC of zzso elicits zzso zzso comparable to that of wild type cells but produces greatly diminished zzso zzso The results indicate that the assembly of rods is independent of zzso and that light energy absorbed by rods can be transferred principally and directly to zzso This energy transfer pathway, which may also be present in wild type, may have a regulatory role in maintaining the balance of input of zzso energy into zzso versus zzso during zzso
