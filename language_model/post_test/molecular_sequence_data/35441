A new zzso was identified from a zzso survey of plant viruses in the zzso Prairie zzso zzso zzso County, Oklahoma, zzso Thin zzso zzso virus zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso sequence encodes six proteins of 44, zzso 8, zzso 26, and zzso whose genes are similar in size and location to those of zzso mosaic virus zzso and zzso mild mosaic virus zzso zzso transcripts made from zzso of the 2005 isolate were used for initial host range zzso Of the 11 tested zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso producing zzso infections, and zzso zzso was not zzso zzso and zzso alignments indicate that zzso is more closely related to zzso than zzso zzso alignments and structure predictions indicate that zzso and zzso have zzso eight structural elements previously predicted or analyzed for zzso The initial zzso zzso also contained zzso related to zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of putative thin zzso cryptic virus were zzso These represent the first sequences for a putative zzso zzso
