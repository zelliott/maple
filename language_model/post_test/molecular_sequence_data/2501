A rat brain zzso library has been constructed in a zzso zzso expression zzso and used to isolate genes that can function in zzso to suppress the zzso effects of zzso a zzso form of the zzso gene analogous to an zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso One zzso zzso was cloned and its genetic and zzso properties were zzso A zzso product would share zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso protein over an extended zzso We have shown that the zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso
