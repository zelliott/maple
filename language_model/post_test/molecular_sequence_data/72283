zzso zzso of the element zzso has been studied in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso gene was detected with a dominant eye color marker carried by the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and in the germ line were higher in flies zzso for the zzso than in zzso or zzso zzso of a X zzso zzso of zzso into new zzso sites occurred in zzso of males expressing zzso suggesting that this system is usable for gene tagging and zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso donor sites after zzso showed precise restoration of the original target sequence in approximately zzso of events in zzso and the presence of zzso or partially deleted elements in the remaining zzso Most zzso consisted of the four terminal bases of the zzso flanked by the zzso target zzso zzso of a zzso donor site that was directly cloned after zzso showed a characteristic zzso mismatch zzso in the center of the zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of the zzso presumably representing excised zzso zzso could be detected only in the presence of zzso A model for zzso repair after zzso zzso is discussed in which staggered cuts are first produced at the ends of the zzso repeats, the broken zzso ends are joined, and the resulting zzso is subsequently zzso The model also suggests a simple mechanism for the production of the target site zzso and for zzso of the zzso ends during zzso
