Although specific zzso play a critical role in the active phase of zzso their zzso are largely zzso We previously identified zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso for zzso related to zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso Now we have used a zzso system to characterize zzso that cleave the nuclear zzso during zzso zzso zzso during zzso requires the action of a second zzso zzso which exhibits zzso of zzso and a profile of sensitivity to specific zzso that is distinct from the zzso zzso Thus, multiple zzso zzso are required for zzso events in these zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso blocks nuclear zzso prior to the packaging of condensed zzso into zzso zzso Under these conditions, the nuclear DNA is fully zzso to a zzso zzso Our studies reveal that the zzso zzso and the fragmentation zzso function in independent parallel pathways during the final stages of zzso zzso Neither zzso alone is sufficient for completion of nuclear zzso Instead, the various activities cooperate to drive the zzso of the zzso
