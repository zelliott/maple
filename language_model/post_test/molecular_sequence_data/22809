We report the isolation of the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso regulator associated with the focal zzso zzso previously described as a putative zzso zzso gene of acute zzso zzso and zzso syndrome, and demonstrate its promoter activity in reporter gene zzso Two putative zzso sites are identified of which one was sensitive to zzso zzso The suppressed zzso expression could be restored in zzso cell lines by treatment with a zzso agent and an inhibitor of zzso zzso In contrast to normal zzso which tested negative for zzso promoter zzso 11 of 29 zzso bone zzso samples from patients with acute zzso zzso or zzso syndrome were zzso
