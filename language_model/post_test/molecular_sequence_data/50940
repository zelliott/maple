To study the zzso properties of the zzso zzso gene zzso 

Earlier reports suggested that zzso protein is zzso and has zzso zzso These properties were examined using an in zzso translated zzso 

A DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso was transcribed in zzso under the control of zzso zzso The generated zzso zzso zzso zzso was translated using a rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with a specific zzso zzso to zzso zzso activity of the translated product was evaluated using zzso and zzso 

Translated zzso zzso was found to zzso a major protein of 27 zzso with two other products, of 25 and 29 zzso Using zzso immune complexes for the zzso reaction, a protein of 46 zzso that reacted with the zzso zzso zzso was found to be strongly zzso in the presence of zzso This zzso zzso activity on a zzso cellular zzso was dependent on zzso 

The in zzso zzso gene product was found to be associated with zzso of a zzso cellular protein present in rabbit zzso zzso The zzso protein has been linked to suppression of the replication of certain zzso zzso Identification of cellular targets of zzso activity could help to zzso the mechanisms for this zzso zzso
