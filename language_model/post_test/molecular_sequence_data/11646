A novel DNA zzso technique called zzso is zzso The zzso technique is based on the selective zzso amplification of restriction fragments from a total digest of zzso zzso The technique involves three steps: zzso restriction of the DNA and zzso of zzso zzso zzso selective amplification of sets of restriction fragments, and zzso gel analysis of the amplified zzso zzso amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer zzso The selective amplification is achieved by the use of zzso that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the zzso zzso the restriction zzso Using this method, sets of restriction fragments may be zzso by zzso without knowledge of zzso zzso The method allows the specific zzso of high numbers of restriction zzso The number of fragments that can be analyzed zzso however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection zzso Typically zzso restriction fragments are amplified and detected on zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA zzso technique for zzso of any origin or zzso
