We report the discovery of a zzso of zzso human zzso zzso zzso designated zzso that is intact in the pol region which is deleted in the vast majority of zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso elements contain critical functional zzso in their pol region that other zzso elements zzso We estimate that the zzso zzso of humans, apes, and Old World monkeys contain 50 to 100 copies of zzso elements and 800 to 1,000 deleted zzso The major amplification of deleted elements appears to have occurred after the divergence of Old World and New World zzso since we have obtained evidence that a few intact zzso zzso but no deleted forms, are present in zzso zzso Using the zzso chain reaction coupled with a direct screen for open reading zzso we have isolated fragments from four zzso elements amplified from human DNA that contain an open reading frame throughout a region of pol that is disrupted by diagnostic zzso in all other zzso sequences that we had previously zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso transcripts are expressed in the human zzso cell line zzso Together, the results presented here suggest that a small functional zzso of zzso elements is present in the human zzso
