zzso cells have been found to express zzso class II molecules in zzso and are able to perform class zzso zzso zzso The precise zzso zzso of these molecules in zzso cells has been a matter of zzso We have analyzed the polarized targeting of human zzso class II molecules and the associated zzso chain zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The class II molecules are located at the zzso surface and in zzso zzso both when expressed alone or together with zzso zzso is located in zzso zzso and can zzso through the zzso plasma membrane zzso We show that the zzso tail of zzso contains information for zzso targeting as it is sufficient to redirect the zzso protein zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We find that the two zzso motifs zzso and zzso in the zzso tail of zzso are individually sufficient for zzso sorting and zzso targeting of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso sorting information is located within the 10 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso As several different signals mediate zzso sorting of the class zzso complex, a polarized distribution of these molecules may be an essential feature of zzso presentation in zzso zzso
