A zzso zzso sugar beet zzso was cloned from a library constructed from zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso had an open reading frame zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso included only one of four regions which were zzso in the zzso family of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from the analysis of the zzso contained the sequences of the zzso peptides and the active site region zzso of sugar beet zzso The primary structure indicated relatively high zzso in the range of zzso to zzso to those for other zzso The highest zzso was found in barley zzso
