Because heat shock proteins have been shown to play a critical role in protecting cells from zzso and other types of zzso zzso it was of interest to determine what effect age and caloric restriction have on the ability of cells to regulate the expression of heat shock protein 70 zzso the most prominent and most zzso zzso of the heat shock zzso zzso restriction is the only experimental manipulation known to zzso aging and increase survival of zzso The ability of zzso isolated from zzso zzso to zzso and old zzso to zzso male Fischer zzso rats fed ad zzso or a caloric restriction diet zzso of the content of the ad zzso zzso to express zzso was determined after a mild heat shock zzso degrees C for 30 zzso We found that the induction of zzso synthesis and zzso levels by heat shock was 40 to 50% lower in zzso isolated from old rats than in zzso isolated from young zzso Using in zzso zzso we found that essentially all zzso from the zzso and old rats expressed zzso in response to heat zzso therefore, the age-related decrease in the induction of zzso expression was not due to an age-related zzso of cells that do not respond to heat zzso zzso of zzso zzso stability and zzso zzso demonstrated that the age-related decline in zzso expression arose from a decline in zzso zzso Interestingly, the age-related decline in the induction of zzso expression was reversed by caloric zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso zzso levels, and nuclear zzso were significantly higher in zzso isolated from old rats fed the caloric restricted diet than in zzso isolated from old rats fed ad zzso The levels of the heat shock zzso factor in nuclear extracts isolated from zzso zzso were measured in a gel shift zzso zzso of the heat shock zzso factor to the heat shock element decreased with age and was significantly higher in zzso extracts isolated from old rats fed the caloric restriction diet than in those from old rats fed ad zzso Thus, our study demonstrates that the ability of zzso to respond to zzso and express zzso decreases significantly with age and that this decrease occurs at the zzso zzso In addition, caloric zzso which zzso aging, reversed the age-related decline in the induction of zzso zzso in zzso
