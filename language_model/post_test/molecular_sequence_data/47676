zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso increases during long term zzso or zzso learning in zzso In the marine zzso zzso persistent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I occurs during long term zzso We have raised an zzso to a zzso from zzso zzso I zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso This zzso recognizes zzso zzso I only when it is zzso at zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso increase the percentage of zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the pool of zzso that is zzso at zzso zzso in zzso is resistant to both membrane zzso and zzso Replacement of zzso zzso with zzso increased the affinity of zzso zzso I for zzso suggesting that zzso of this site may reduce the ability of zzso zzso I to zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso We propose that zzso of this site is important for removal of zzso from the membrane and may be a mechanism for negative feedback of zzso zzso
