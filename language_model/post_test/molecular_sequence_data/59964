zzso proteins constitute an expanding family, members of which carry two zzso motifs named the zzso and the zzso repeat zzso The zzso member, zzso zzso constitutes the ring canals in the egg chamber in association with zzso However, zzso and zzso functions of the members of this family remain largely zzso 

We identified the zzso gene zzso a zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein had zzso zzso acid zzso and was most similar to zzso zzso Loss of zzso function caused growth arrest at an early zzso stage, most likely at the beginning of zzso The zzso deletion zzso appeared normal in zzso movement and pumping action for the initial two to three days after zzso but it failed to convey foods effectively to zzso and could hardly increase in body zzso zzso using zzso and reporter gene expression indicated that zzso was expressed almost exclusively in the zzso zzso zzso cells during late zzso and at all zzso stages zzso 

zzso zzso zzso protein is essential for the zzso development, probably performing a function required for feeding in the zzso zzso zzso cells, which are supposed to zzso materials aiding zzso
