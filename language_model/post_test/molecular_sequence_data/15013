zzso in the zzso horn of the spinal zzso are increasingly recognized as being crucial in the zzso of pain hypersensitivity after injury to a peripheral zzso It is known that zzso zzso zzso cause the release of zzso zzso factor zzso from zzso which is necessary for maintaining pain hypersensitivity after nerve zzso However, there is a critical gap in understanding how zzso of zzso zzso leads to the release of zzso Here, we show that stimulating zzso with zzso evokes a zzso release of zzso from zzso an early phase occurs within 5 zzso whereas a late phase zzso 60 zzso after zzso zzso zzso with the late phase of release is an increased level of zzso within the zzso Both zzso of zzso release and the zzso within the zzso are dependent on zzso zzso The late phase of zzso release and zzso but not the early phase of release, are suppressed by zzso zzso and translation, indicating that zzso of zzso causes an initial release of a pre-existing pool of zzso followed by an increase in de zzso synthesis of zzso The release of zzso is abolished by zzso zzso zzso zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso Furthermore, we find that the zzso release and synthesis of zzso are dependent on zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Together, our findings provide a unifying mechanism for pain hypersensitivity after peripheral nerve injury through zzso increase in zzso and zzso of zzso leading to the synthesis and zzso release of zzso from zzso
