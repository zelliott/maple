The three zzso complex factors zzso zzso Net and zzso form a zzso of the E zzso zzso domain zzso zzso Their characteristic property is the ability to form a zzso zzso complex with the serum response factor zzso over the serum response element zzso of the zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms that zzso the function and regulation of these factors have been extensively studied and the zzso are a paradigm for the study of zzso regulation in response to zzso zzso through the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso As final zzso of multiple zzso pathways and components of protein complexes on immediate early zzso they represent key elements in the complex and dynamic regulation of gene zzso This review zzso the zzso structural and zzso studies that have led to the understanding of the functional zzso of the zzso zzso complex formation, zzso regulation, protein partners and target genes in cell zzso Finally, the emerging studies of the biological roles of the zzso in zzso will be zzso
