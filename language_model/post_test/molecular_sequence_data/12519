zzso a zzso expressed on the surface of activated T cells, is essential for T zzso zzso responses in zzso We cloned and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso flank region of the human zzso gene promoter and determined its zzso start zzso When used in reporter gene zzso this DNA segment zzso promoter activity in response to T cell zzso zzso promoter function in zzso was inhibited by zzso A, as is expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso At least zzso zzso of the zzso flank region was required for promoter zzso Two putative binding sites for the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins were identified at zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso with respect to the zzso start zzso Both sites contributed significantly and independently to promoter activity in response to T cell zzso Additionally, when incubated in zzso with nuclear protein zzso from activated human zzso T cells, both of these sites zzso bound the zzso family member, zzso These results suggest that zzso via binding to at least two zzso is essential for the induction of zzso gene expression in response to T cell zzso
