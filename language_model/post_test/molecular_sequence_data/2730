A gene for zzso zzso inhibitor zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso coli zzso zzso using two zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene was localized on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso zzso was determined by the zzso sequencing zzso The zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso coding region derived from the zzso sequence determination corresponded exactly to that from protein sequencing zzso The zzso sequence analysis showed the presence of a putative signal zzso zzso 31 zzso acids preceding the mature zzso zzso The major zzso start point was identified to be 60 zzso upstream from the putative initiation zzso for translation by the primer extension zzso The zzso to zzso region upstream from zzso start point was quite zzso to that of zzso promoter of zzso zzso The overall G + C content of this zzso zzso was zzso On the other hand, an extremely high G + C content zzso was found at the third letter of zzso in the zzso coding zzso
