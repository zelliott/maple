The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is considered to play a key role in zzso zzso We have reported previously that zzso zzso contains two zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso two highly similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper we report the characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso A zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso was cloned using a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the two zzso zzso are zzso zzso The zzso zzso accumulates zzso in zzso whereas the previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in roots and zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso start zzso located 123 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso used in the translation of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the upstream zzso zzso generates a novel zzso zzso zzso with an zzso extension of 41 zzso acid zzso which has all the characteristics of a zzso transit zzso The functionality of the zzso zzso extension as a zzso transit zzso was demonstrated by its ability to direct a passenger protein to zzso zzso in zzso and by in zzso import experiments using zzso plant zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso reported to contain a zzso transit zzso
