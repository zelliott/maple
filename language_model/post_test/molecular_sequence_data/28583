We describe the construction of a zzso zzso fragments library which zzso in a single cloning step, a synthetic human light chain variable region zzso with a diverse set of heavy chain variable regions, from a mouse zzso with the prostate specific zzso zzso Despite zzso zzso selection from this library rendered two different single chain zzso zzso fragments, specifically recognizing zzso The human zzso used as a general partner for mouse heavy zzso was constructed by linking the zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso segment, both of which are prominently involved in human zzso zzso Our approach offers a fast and simple way to produce zzso zzso while keeping the advantage of zzso animals for high affinity zzso
