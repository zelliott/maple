zzso DNA of 27 strains of zzso fetus was analyzed by Southern zzso with a probe of the zzso region of zzso The probe zzso with 23 strains that produced type A zzso These strains had more than six zzso zzso In Southern blots of zzso zzso DNA separated by zzso gel zzso one zzso from 19 strains and two fragments from 4 strains zzso These data indicate that multiple zzso zzso are localized to a limited region on the zzso DNA of zzso fetus and thus suggest the possibility of developing a typing system using this zzso
