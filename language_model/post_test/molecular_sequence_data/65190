Exposure to zzso zzso in the presence of light zzso the production of zzso that gives severe damage on zzso apparatus as well as many cellular processes in zzso and zzso The effects of zzso zzso on global gene expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso were determined by DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly induced by treatment of zzso zzso for 15 zzso commonly under conditions of normal and high zzso One of these zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator, is located zzso next to another induced zzso zzso in the zzso We deleted zzso and compared the global gene expression patterns of this zzso to that of wild type under zzso zzso It was found that zzso was zzso to the greatest extent, while many other genes including zzso but not zzso or zzso were zzso to lesser extent in the zzso zzso disruption of zzso which encodes a putative type 2 zzso indicates that it is essential for zzso zzso growth in both liquid and solid media in high light and on solid medium even in low zzso zzso was prepared as a zzso zzso protein and shown to specifically bind to the zzso region between zzso and zzso The binding was enhanced by zzso and abolished by hydrogen zzso We concluded that the zzso zzso zzso plays a regulatory role in the induction of a potent zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso
