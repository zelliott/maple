zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso known to zzso the compatible zzso zzso zzso which is commonly found in zzso zzso and some zzso zzso Unlike the zzso pattern of zzso observed in zzso in zzso zzso zzso accumulates zzso The synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso was tracked from zzso and zzso but the zzso sequence of the zzso failed to reveal any of the genes known to be involved in this zzso The native zzso was zzso and its zzso sequence was used to identify the corresponding gene zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The gene encodes a highly divergent zzso zzso zzso without relevant sequence zzso to known zzso zzso In order to understand the specificity and zzso mechanism of this novel zzso it was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and zzso The zzso thus obtained belonged to the zzso space group zzso and contained two protein molecules per zzso zzso The structure was solved by zzso using a mercury zzso
