zzso patterning in the nervous system of zzso zzso depends on zzso signals that derive from the organizer region (the zzso lip in zzso and the zzso in birds and zzso and zzso from the zzso and floor zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso a member of the zzso head zzso factor family, is expressed selectively by these cell groups in zzso zzso and may be involved in regulating neural zzso We report here that in early rat and mouse zzso the embryonic zzso the zzso the zzso and the floor plate express two related zzso factors, zzso alpha and zzso zzso which also function in the control of liver cell zzso Early embryonic zzso express zzso forms of zzso beta which derive from the use of zzso alternative zzso Within the organizer region and zzso zzso beta and zzso alpha have distinct zzso patterns of expression and appear in partially overlapping zzso The early expression pattern of zzso zzso beta in the zzso zzso and zzso neural plate cells is similar to that of zzso in zzso zzso There does not appear to be a zzso zzso in zzso This prompted us to isolate and analyze the expression of the zzso zzso beta zzso In zzso zzso zzso beta is expressed in the zzso lip, zzso zzso and floor zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso the onset of zzso zzso beta expression in neural tissue occurs after neural tube zzso Thus, the combined expression patterns of zzso and zzso beta in frogs is equivalent to that of zzso beta in rats and zzso Within neural zzso the onset of expression of these regulatory genes define successive stages in the differentiation of floor plate zzso The results reported here show that closely related members of the zzso head gene family are expressed by zzso zzso cell groups involved in neural induction and patterning and suggest the involvement of these genes in the development of the zzso zzso
