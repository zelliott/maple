zzso of newly arising zzso zzso zzso frequently contain a high proportion of cells with additional zzso zzso zzso in the same gene zzso The ancillary zzso appear to have arisen at a rate greatly above zzso To better estimate this rate it is necessary to allow for any selective advantage zzso by the ancillary zzso We have previously measured their effect on growth rate of established zzso strains in the presence of zzso In the present work a pair of single and double zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been employed together with the zzso zzso to model the situation soon after such zzso first zzso zzso when the cell still contains zzso zzso protein (the zzso gene zzso When these zzso under the control of an zzso promoter and carried on a zzso were expressed in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso the double zzso zzso permitted much faster cell growth than the single zzso zzso In the presence of zzso and with zzso on a zzso bacteria with a double zzso zzso gene grew faster than those with a single zzso zzso zzso If these results can be zzso to a bacterial cell in which an zzso zzso has just occurred, the ancillary zzso should be able to zzso a selective advantage during a limited period when zzso zzso protein is still present, both in the absence and in the presence of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
