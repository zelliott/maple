The zzso zzso sequences of 18 species of zzso zzso were 153 zzso in length and had a G + C content of zzso zzso differences in zzso sequence among the zzso zzso were low zzso but the extent of the sequence differences between the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and 2 species of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso gene may provide useful zzso information with respect to the relationships of the different orders within the zzso zzso
