We have tested three human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the envelope zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso for the ability to neutralize primary zzso zzso from the genetic zzso A through F and from group zzso Each of the zzso broadly and zzso neutralized zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso also neutralized strains from outside the B zzso with the same breadth and potency that they showed against zzso zzso The other two zzso were able to neutralize a significant proportion of strains from outside the B zzso although there was a reduction in their efficacy compared with their activity against zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso correlated with their possession of the zzso motif in a segment of zzso near the zzso zzso The other two zzso and zzso recognize zzso binding sites on zzso and so no comparison between genetic sequence and virus zzso was zzso Our data show that a vaccine based on the induction of zzso immunity that is broadly active across the genetic zzso is not impossible if zzso that express the zzso for zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso can be zzso Furthermore, if the three zzso and zzso produce clinical benefit in zzso trials in the United States or Europe, they may also do so elsewhere in the zzso
