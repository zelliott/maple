In the green zzso zzso zzso zzso as in higher plants, the expression of the genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso I zzso and zzso II zzso is regulated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals zzso and zzso The zzso clock ensures that the zzso in the levels of the different cab zzso is continuously kept in phase with zzso zzso cycles and is zzso by the middle of the zzso On the other hand, light controls the zzso of the zzso We report here the cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which identifies a zzso zzso and whose expression is regulated quite differently from the cab zzso zzso We show: zzso that in zzso synchronized zzso cells zzso zzso zzso is subject to dual regulation that involves zzso regulation by light and an zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso is fully expressed several hours before the cab zzso zzso and that the latter accumulate zzso zzso that blocking the electron flow through zzso using zzso prevents cells from accumulating cab zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso that the zzso of zzso zzso is abolished by blocking zzso protein zzso suggesting that these regulatory mechanisms are zzso by zzso zzso
