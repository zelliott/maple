The functional and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been studied with special reference to the action of zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso acid sequences of the zzso segments of the zzso and zzso have been zzso The present results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso display a low affinity for zzso which appears to be modulated in zzso by zzso zzso rather than zzso The zzso effect for zzso binding to zzso and zzso zzso is higher than for zzso and bovine zzso being similar to that of human zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso appears intermediate between that of human and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso suggest that both zzso are in a zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso The reduced effect of zzso on the functional and zzso properties of zzso and zzso zzso agree with zzso acid differences in the zzso segment of the zzso zzso the deletion of zzso and the replacement of zzso present in human zzso and zzso present in horse zzso by zzso The molecular mechanism modulating the basic reaction of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso may be linked to specific zzso needs related to the high-altitude zzso of these two zzso
