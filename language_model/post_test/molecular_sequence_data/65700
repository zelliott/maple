Plant zzso are a large family of naturally occurring circular proteins that are produced from linear precursors containing one, two or three zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the free zzso and zzso to produce the circular peptides has not been zzso Here, we investigate production of the zzso zzso zzso B1 from the precursor zzso from the African plant zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso mass zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso only produces mature zzso zzso whereas transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced both linear and circular zzso zzso peptides were not produced when a highly zzso zzso zzso at the zzso processing site of the zzso domain was replaced with an zzso or an zzso zzso or when the zzso zzso zzso motif was zzso We propose that there are two processing pathways in zzso one to produce the mature zzso and the other to produce linear zzso that ultimately cannot be zzso
