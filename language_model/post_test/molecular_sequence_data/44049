zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to study the solution zzso of zzso zzso a small zzso toxin found in the zzso of zzso cone zzso and its zzso zzso zzso lacks zzso bonds but contains many zzso acids zzso a zzso modified zzso Our results show that zzso adopts an zzso zzso in zzso solution even in the absence of zzso zzso replacements diminish both zzso and function of zzso The zzso content of zzso is higher than most natural zzso peptides of this length in zzso zzso The sequence of this small toxin incorporates several known elements that stabilize zzso structure in zzso zzso zzso form several salt bridges that stabilize zzso zzso of zzso
