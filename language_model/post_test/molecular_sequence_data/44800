Bone zzso is a common event in prostate cancer, and it is known that some of the bone zzso proteins zzso are expressed in prostate cancer cells, while no study on the expression of their zzso zzso has been zzso Here we report cloning and sequence analysis of the human zzso zzso We also zzso the expression of transcripts of three types of the zzso genes in human zzso and prostate cancer cell zzso The zzso zzso was present in various zzso but the highest level was found in the zzso Moreover, the amount of zzso zzso was significantly low in prostate cancer zzso after zzso withdrawal and was also low in prostate cancer cell zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso message was zzso by zzso stimulation in the zzso cell line which expresses the zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso levels of zzso and zzso were not significantly different among zzso and zzso prostate zzso It was also suggested that human zzso and zzso might have different biological functions in the zzso although their sequences were zzso identical in the zzso zzso zzso
