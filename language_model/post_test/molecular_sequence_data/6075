I zzso zzso zzso both zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso complexes that contain either the zzso or zzso zzso These zzso functions of I zzso zzso proteins are regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso We have mapped the zzso zzso sites of zzso the avian I zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso region that contains four zzso zzso zzso or point zzso that significantly alter the overall zzso charged character of this region abolish association of zzso with zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in this region zzso the association of zzso with zzso proteins in zzso and abolish zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso for the zzso zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso region is not required for zzso zzso of nuclear zzso of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso of nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso proteins are zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso of I zzso zzso proteins will be an important aspect of the zzso feedback loop that zzso zzso control of zzso gene zzso
