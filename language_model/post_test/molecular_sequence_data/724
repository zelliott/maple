zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play important roles in bacteria by regulating the cellular concentration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belong to a family of zzso barrel fold zzso that contain a functional active site loop zzso 6) for zzso binding and zzso By examining the two zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso from zzso zzso we found that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso was significantly altered by zzso in the loop 6 zzso The impact of the zzso ranges from apparent zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso activity of zzso was affected by mutating the putative zzso site zzso in the zzso domain, with the zzso exhibiting a significantly smaller zzso constant zzso than that of the zzso zzso zzso exchange by mass zzso revealed that the decrease in zzso zzso with a change of zzso accessibility in the loop 6 zzso We further examined zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, which is one of the proteins that contains a zzso incompetent zzso domain with a highly zzso loop zzso We demonstrated that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso domain toward zzso could be recovered by restoring loop zzso On the basis of these observations and in conjunction with the structural data of two zzso zzso we proposed that loop 6 not only mediates the zzso of zzso domain but also controls zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso in the bacterial zzso revealed that about half of the zzso zzso harbor a zzso loop 6, indicating that the zzso in loop 6 may represent a divergence of function for zzso zzso during zzso
