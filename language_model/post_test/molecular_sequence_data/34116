zzso zzso zzso with high levels of zzso plasticity and wide geographic distribution, are a challenging group for zzso and zzso As a useful tool for molecular species zzso DNA zzso might offer significant potential for oyster identification and zzso This study used two zzso fragments, zzso c zzso I zzso and the large zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess whether oyster species could be identified by zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso among species were estimated by the zzso analyses of both zzso and then zzso zzso and zzso genetic zzso were zzso Species forming zzso zzso in the molecular zzso were identical for both genes even when the closely related species were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso overlapped with zzso zzso However, average zzso and zzso genetic zzso for zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, indicating the existence of a zzso zzso These results confirm the efficacy of species identification in oysters via DNA zzso and zzso zzso
