The zzso protein zzso marks the response of mouse zzso to one of several stimuli zzso bacterial zzso or zzso zzso that trigger the expression of zzso activity when these cells have previously been primed for tumor cell killing by zzso zzso The results reported here identify this marker protein as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification was based on four findings: zzso zzso like the zzso zzso was associated with cellular zzso zzso the sequence of zzso acids in the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso was zzso identical to the predicted zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso raised against the zzso region of the zzso gene product recognized zzso in zzso and zzso zzso which blocks induction of zzso zzso inhibited the induction of both zzso synthesis and zzso activity in zzso Several regulatory roles for this protein in the zzso process are zzso
