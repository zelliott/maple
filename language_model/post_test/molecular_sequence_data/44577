The neural cell zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and involved in path finding and outgrowth of zzso in zzso zzso cells express two major zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, in response to zzso Using this cell system, we determined the zzso time of both zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso zzso time of zzso is similar in the presence and absence of zzso whereas the zzso time of zzso is increased in the presence of zzso Furthermore, we zzso protein expression of both zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso and found a decrease of zzso protein expression in course of zzso zzso
