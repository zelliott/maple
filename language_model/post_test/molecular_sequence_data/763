zzso zzso zzso bacteria and zzso acid can induce disease resistance in zzso which is based on zzso of zzso In this study, we examined the differences and similarities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso acid prime for enhanced deposition of zzso zzso after infection by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is regulated by zzso zzso which depend on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced resistance by zzso and zzso acid against the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso are controlled by distinct zzso zzso zzso As zzso and zzso acid prime zzso and zzso zzso respectively, we subsequently investigated the role of zzso zzso A quantitative zzso zzso screen for putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor genes revealed distinct sets of zzso zzso zzso analysis of a selection of these genes showed that they can serve as specific markers for zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes identified a putative zzso that is strongly zzso in promoters of 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study shows that zzso of zzso is regulated by different zzso depending on the inducing agent and the challenging zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso is associated with the enhanced expression of zzso zzso
