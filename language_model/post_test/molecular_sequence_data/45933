The basic protein fraction of tissue extracts from 40 edible plants inhibited zzso protein synthesis and released zzso from zzso zzso DNA, thus having zzso zzso zzso This suggested the presence of zzso proteins zzso in the plant zzso This indication was further strengthened by the presence of the two activities after a partial zzso zzso of three zzso including that from zzso zzso zzso which had very low zzso From the extract of zzso zzso zzso the most active one, a zzso of zzso Da was zzso which had the properties of a zzso in that zzso it inhibited protein synthesis by a rabbit zzso zzso with zzso zzso giving 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso and zzso cells with zzso in the 100 zzso range, zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso zzso all values being comparable to those of other zzso The zzso zzso zzso gave a weak zzso only with an zzso against zzso 32, but not with zzso against other zzso and had zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
