zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso pigmentation and zzso To study this zzso effect at the molecular level, we used the tomato zzso gene as a probe to isolate a zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso The deduced sequence of zzso exhibited zzso identity with zzso protein and contained a short, highly zzso zzso zzso High levels of zzso expression were detected in zzso zzso and young stem zzso When detached zzso were grown in zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was strongly induced by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso was inhibited by zzso acid zzso The expression of the gene was also induced by zzso in detached young stem zzso zzso was not essential for zzso zzso expression in zzso but enhanced its zzso In zzso on the other hand, zzso inhibited the effect of the zzso The results of the present work support the possible role of zzso in zzso zzso and stem zzso
