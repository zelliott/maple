zzso zzso are zzso involved in protecting cells from zzso damage arising from zzso radical or zzso oxygen species produced from zzso Examples of zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso metal have been zzso Recently, a zzso containing one Ni atom per zzso was zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso deduced from the zzso sequence of the structural gene zzso from zzso zzso is reported and has no zzso with other zzso X-ray zzso zzso studies coupled with zzso of the Ni center show that the Ni in the oxidized (as zzso zzso is in a zzso site composed of three zzso zzso one zzso and one other zzso or zzso This unique coordination environment is modified by the loss of one zzso (or zzso donor zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso activity was determined by pulse zzso and a value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per Ni was zzso The rate is pH sensitive and drops off rapidly above pH zzso The results characterize a novel class of metal center active in catalyzing the zzso chemistry of zzso and, when placed in context with other zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso is a prerequisite for zzso zzso sites in zzso
