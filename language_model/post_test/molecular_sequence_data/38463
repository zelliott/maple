zzso zzso engagement can zzso T cell zzso and promote the induction of immune zzso However, the strategy of attenuating T cell zzso by engaging zzso has been limited by sharing of its natural zzso with the zzso protein zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed and expressed on the cell surface to promote selective engagement of this regulatory zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso at their surface bound soluble zzso but not soluble zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso on artificial zzso reduced the proliferation and zzso production by resting and zzso bulk T cells as well as zzso and zzso T cell zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso on the same cell surface as the zzso zzso was essential for the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of components of the zzso zzso signaling apparatus was similarly dependent on zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on the same zzso These findings support a zzso role for zzso function in the modification of the zzso zzso zzso Using T cells from zzso and zzso zzso transgenic mice, negative regulatory effects of selective zzso zzso were also demonstrated during the stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso T cells by zzso zzso Together these studies demonstrate that selective zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso results in attenuated T cell responses only when zzso with the zzso during T zzso interaction and define an approach to harnessing the zzso potential of zzso zzso
