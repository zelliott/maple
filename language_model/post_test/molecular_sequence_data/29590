zzso proteins zzso share less than zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with conventional zzso and have roles in diverse zzso processes in the zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was explored for possible zzso gene family zzso Eight potential zzso gene sequences were found dispersed on three of the five zzso zzso zzso and zzso are protein zzso of their similarly named counterparts in other zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of two classes of nuclear zzso previously characterized in animals and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso appear to be novel proteins that are not closely related to any known animal or zzso zzso and may be plant zzso The complex zzso zzso gene structures each contain from five to 20 zzso zzso transcripts were identified and characterized for zzso through zzso but not for zzso and transcripts representing two zzso zzso were found for zzso The seven expressed genes are predicted to zzso proteins ranging from 146 to zzso zzso acids in zzso Relative to conventional zzso and the other zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are expressed at very low levels in all zzso zzso zzso and zzso each have distinct transcript expression patterns in zzso roots, leaves, flowers, and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were shown to be most highly expressed in zzso The likely involvement of plant zzso in zzso zzso branching of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are briefly zzso
