The zzso zzso zzso is important in hormone synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso activity, as reflected by zzso zzso was increased by zzso (1 zzso or zzso (10 zzso in primary cultured human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that incubation of these cells with zzso or zzso for 24 h increased the abundance of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso and zzso increases, respectively, in the amount of zzso protein after 48 zzso suggesting that elevated levels of zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso in human zzso We then studied the levels of zzso zzso and protein in zzso zzso tissue and found that the amount of zzso zzso in zzso tissue from individuals with zzso disease zzso zzso 5) was zzso times that in normal zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso The abundance of zzso zzso was significantly correlated with that of zzso zzso or zzso zzso but not with that of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and normal zzso tissue zzso The amount of zzso protein was also increased zzso in zzso zzso tissue compared with that in normal zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso may thus contribute to the development of zzso zzso
