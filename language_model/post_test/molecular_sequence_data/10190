The zzso class II zzso and zzso restrictions of zzso recognition were analyzed with T cells from a zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso all directed against the single zzso zzso zzso were tested with zzso zzso zzso cell lines as zzso zzso The most striking finding has been, that several DR zzso restricted clones recognized the zzso in the context of both zzso but not of unrelated zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso restricted clones responded in the context of one parental zzso zzso Most DR zzso clones produced zzso but not zzso whereas most zzso and zzso clones produced zzso We zzso that the confinement of DR zzso only to the parental zzso was established possibly during zzso maturation of T cells and that the proportions between zzso and zzso T cells may play a role in the zzso zzso influences on host resistance to infections and other immune zzso
