zzso alpha zzso is a nuclear hormone zzso protein zzso on the opposite strand of the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso This unusual zzso arrangement may have a regulatory role, but the conservation of human and zzso zzso zzso acid sequences suggests that the protein itself has an important function, potentially as a zzso zzso zzso However, despite its relationship to the zzso zzso bound poorly to zzso binding zzso To determine its zzso specificity in an unbiased manner, zzso was zzso in zzso coli, zzso and used to select specific zzso from libraries of random zzso DNA zzso We found that zzso binds to a unique site consisting of a specific zzso zzso sequence adjacent to a zzso zzso zzso contacts this entire zzso zzso zzso which is the longest zzso element specifically recognized by a member of the zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso in either the zzso or zzso zzso regions abolished specific zzso The binding specificity of zzso zzso was nearly identical to that of zzso and zzso truncated zzso This binding was not enhanced by zzso X zzso zzso or other nuclear zzso none of which formed zzso with zzso zzso also appeared to bind to the selected site as a zzso Furthermore, zzso activates zzso through this binding site even in the absence of zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso zzso whose properties differ dramatically from those of classical nuclear hormone zzso including the zzso zzso on the opposite strand of the same zzso zzso
