We have reported previously that zzso with a bacterial zzso protein containing the two zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso zzso protected mice against challenge with this malaria zzso zzso plasmids containing sequences coding for the individual zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso have now been zzso The fusion protein containing the combined zzso zzso was recognized by zzso zzso and was zzso producing high zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, fusion proteins containing the two individual zzso zzso reacted poorly with the natural zzso and their zzso as well as a simple mixture of them, induced low levels of zzso zzso despite producing high levels of zzso zzso zzso raised to the zzso proteins recognized the 230 zzso zzso Groups of mice zzso with the different zzso proteins were challenged with zzso protection was observed in the group which had received the zzso protein containing both zzso but not in those groups zzso with the individual zzso either alone or as a zzso These results suggest that there are important structural zzso formed by the two zzso together, which are not present in either of the individual zzso alone, and which are responsible for the zzso of the protein or are the target of protective zzso
