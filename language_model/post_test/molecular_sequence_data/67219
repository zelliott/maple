zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso have the sole zzso zzso for zzso site recognition zzso site zzso but these zzso are at different positions near the zzso zzso On the other hand, many bacterial zzso zzso have two zzso zzso at the same positions of both zzso and zzso To zzso whether these zzso are involved in zzso site recognition, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These proteins showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso In each zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of zzso caused more significant reductions in activities and binding abilities to the zzso containing an zzso site zzso than those corresponding to zzso of zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of zzso is the zzso zzso site zzso and that corresponding to zzso of zzso is the auxiliary zzso
