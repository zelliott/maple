The zzso H activity of reverse zzso carries out three types of zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA 3' zzso Given the strong association between the zzso domain of reverse zzso and a DNA 3' primer zzso we asked whether the distance from the primer zzso is paramount for positioning DNA 3' zzso zzso or whether preferred sequences and/or a zzso window are important as they are for zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the reverse zzso of human zzso virus, type 1 zzso and zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso we determined the effects of zzso distance, and zzso end structure on DNA 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our analyses showed that DNA 3' zzso zzso share the same sequence preferences as zzso zzso zzso zzso but the sites must fall in a narrow window between the 15th and 20th zzso from the recessed end for zzso reverse zzso and between the 17th and 20th zzso for zzso zzso with an zzso zzso end recessed by 1 zzso or 2-3 zzso bases on a longer DNA could accommodate both types of zzso zzso but further recession of the zzso zzso end excluded DNA 3' zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso the inclusion of the zzso zzso enhanced DNA 3' zzso zzso at the 17th and 18th zzso These data demonstrate that all three modes of zzso zzso H zzso share sequence zzso that may be useful in designing zzso to identify zzso of zzso zzso zzso
