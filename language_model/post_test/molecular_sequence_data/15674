zzso editing in flowering plant zzso alters 400 to 500 zzso from C to zzso changing the information content of most zzso and some zzso So far, none of the specific or general factors responsible for zzso editing in plant zzso have been zzso Here, we characterize a zzso gene that is involved in zzso editing of three specific sites in different zzso zzso in zzso zzso editing sites zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso repeat zzso zzso acid identities altered in zzso from zzso zzso in comparison to Columbia, lower the activity at these editing zzso single zzso acid changes in zzso plants zzso zzso zzso These variations most likely modify the affinity of the editing factor to the affected editing sites in zzso and in the zzso zzso Since lowered and even absent zzso editing is tolerated at these sites, the zzso acid changes may be silent for the respective protein zzso Possibly more than these three identified editing sites are addressed by this first factor identified for zzso editing in plant zzso
