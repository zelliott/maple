The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso can be simulated in zzso by reducing the inactive oxidized zzso with zzso Since the gross structure and the zzso state of the zzso are unaffected by the state of zzso the zzso zzso cannot be attributed to zzso zzso zzso In order to identify zzso zzso cross bridges that might be candidates responsible for the zzso reaction, zzso zzso experiments were performed, substituting zzso for up to four exposed zzso zzso zzso were expressed in freshly transformed zzso cells and zzso to zzso As indicated by the zzso behavior (by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso part of the zzso chain are involved in the zzso zzso of the activity of the wild type zzso A zzso of the zzso lacking the zzso 45 zzso confirms this zzso zzso mobility and zzso prove the wild type zzso and its zzso to be zzso differences refer to the packing of the zzso and zzso portions of the zzso in its oxidized and reduced zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso depending on the zzso conditions and the mode of zzso After elimination of the zzso zzso bond, zzso zzso profiles are no longer observed, suggesting a slow zzso zzso in the zzso portion of the wild type zzso to be zzso in the course of reductive zzso For the wild type, this finding can be zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso
