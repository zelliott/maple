Patients with zzso have characteristic cardiovascular zzso abnormal arrangement of their visceral zzso and zzso patterning defects that result from abnormal zzso patterning during zzso Loss of function of the zzso factor zzso causes zzso zzso and isolated zzso heart zzso and represents one of the few known zzso causes of zzso heart zzso The birth zzso of zzso zzso is significantly higher in zzso but our previous work indicated that zzso within zzso did not account for the male zzso zzso cross species comparative sequence alignment was used to identify a putative novel fourth zzso and the existence of a novel alternatively spliced transcript was confirmed by amplification from zzso embryonic zzso and subsequent zzso This transcript, termed zzso encompasses zzso 1, 2, and 4 whereas zzso encompasses zzso 1, 2, and zzso The resulting protein zzso are zzso and 456 zzso acid zzso respectively, sharing the first 407 zzso zzso the last two zzso acids in the fifth zinc finger DNA binding domain are altered in the zzso zzso indicating a potential functional difference that was further evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso and both zzso are localized to the nucleus in zzso Both zzso can zzso activate a zzso binding site reporter, but only zzso zzso activates upon zzso with zzso suggesting that the zzso are functionally zzso zzso 109 familial and sporadic male zzso cases did not identify zzso zzso in the newly identified fourth zzso and larger studies are necessary to establish the importance of the novel zzso in human zzso
