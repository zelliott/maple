The zzso complex is involved in several aspects of gene zzso including zzso zzso zzso repression and zzso We determined the zzso crystal structure of a zzso core complex of the zzso zzso Not module zzso the zzso arm of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso have extended regions that wrap around zzso and around their zzso zzso the Not zzso The Not boxes resemble zzso folds and interact with each other with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the interactions within the zzso complex has severe effects on growth in zzso The zzso complex forms a composite surface that binds zzso zzso in zzso with a site at the zzso Not zzso The results suggest that the Not module forms a versatile platform for zzso zzso
