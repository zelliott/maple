zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two closely related zzso zzso families that are present in zzso and zzso zzso They catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso This review examines the structure of medium chain zzso zzso as a representative of the zzso family, with respect to the zzso mechanism and its broad chain length zzso Comparing the structures of four other zzso zzso provides further insights into the structural basis for the zzso specificity of each of these zzso In addition, the structure of zzso zzso zzso II from rat liver is compared to that of medium chain zzso zzso and the structural basis for their different zzso half reactions is zzso
