zzso is an important zzso in human zzso mainly because of its role in the transport of zzso fatty acids across the inner zzso zzso zzso coli uses zzso as a terminal electron zzso during zzso zzso zzso present in our large zzso break down zzso that is not absorbed in the small zzso One part of this zzso zzso is zzso and can be zzso for zzso of large amounts of zzso pure zzso which is used medically for the treatment of a variety of human zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso coli protein zzso which is a member of the recently identified zzso zzso A zzso zzso family and zzso the transfer of the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso forming zzso and zzso This is the first protein from the zzso zzso zzso to be structurally zzso The structure of zzso reveals a spectacular fold where two zzso are zzso to form an zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso buffer zzso zzso is bound in a large pocket located primarily in the small domain, and we propose that this pocket constitutes the binding site for both zzso zzso participating in the zzso transfer zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso a domain movement that closes the active site of the zzso This is the first observation of a domain movement in the zzso zzso zzso family and can play an important role in zzso zzso binding to initiation of the zzso zzso
