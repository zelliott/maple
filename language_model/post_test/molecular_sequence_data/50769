zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression by zzso and by zzso has been studied in immature zzso and adult zzso rat zzso Positive zzso of these forms by both agents markedly declines with the age of the zzso However, zzso zzso although zzso extinguished in the adult zzso still responds to zzso zzso The regulatory mechanisms underlying the differential behavior of zzso in the immature and adult animals have been further investigated by analyzing the early changes in the zzso zzso rates and the subsequent zzso zzso in the liver in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were constructed and characterized for this zzso The use of a unique zzso zzso zzso identified in this work, made possible the selective determination of the zzso rate of this gene by zzso zzso as a function of zzso development and zzso zzso Parallel determination of the zzso concentration in the liver by dot zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso essentially through zzso regulation in immature animals, while in adults it is suggested to act mainly at a zzso zzso
