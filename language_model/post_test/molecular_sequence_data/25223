The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 late genes from the A3 promoter requires the viral protein zzso This protein is a zzso zzso which binds to a region of the A3 promoter located between zzso zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso zzso at the N zzso of protein zzso have been constructed and their function zzso The binding of these deletion zzso to the late A3 promoter has been analyzed by gel zzso and zzso I zzso zzso The results indicate that the N zzso of protein zzso could be involved in its binding to the A3 promoter, suggesting that it may not be a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso
