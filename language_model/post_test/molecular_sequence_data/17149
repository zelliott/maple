Small heat shock proteins are induced by various zzso We here report the differential zzso responses of the zzso genes in the zzso The zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso responded to zzso while zzso and zzso which share the promoter regions with zzso and zzso respectively, did zzso For comparative zzso analysis, we identified ten zzso genes in the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The comparison of the promoter sequences revealed a new zzso sequence block, zzso that was required for the zzso zzso response, but not for other stress responses such as heat or zzso We propose a working model for the zzso promoter usage between two genes sharing the promoter zzso We also discuss a possible application of the zzso promoter for conditional gene zzso
