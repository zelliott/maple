We review recent results on the complete structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We compare the three crystal forms in which this zzso packs zzso groups zzso zzso and zzso and provide a preliminary zzso characterization of the newly identified zzso zzso The availability of different crystal forms for this zzso allows the analysis of the packing zzso and the zzso interactions that determine this zzso We observe the pivotal role played by the protruding stalk composed of zzso zzso and zzso in the lattice zzso Aided by zzso zzso laser light zzso we have initiated the zzso characterization of the zzso expressed and zzso zzso zzso a necessary step towards the understanding of zzso role in zzso zzso
