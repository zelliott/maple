The zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso is known for its ability to zzso and accumulate high levels of zzso acid zzso under stress zzso In order to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the increased zzso of zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso for its structure and zzso zzso zzso sequence and comparison of the zzso product with zzso from various sources established that zzso contains nine zzso and encodes a deduced product of zzso zzso acids zzso related to zzso zzso A zzso protein of 50 zzso was zzso in crude zzso zzso zzso extension experiments mapped the zzso end of the zzso zzso 159 zzso upstream from the putative translation start zzso Both primer extension and Northern analysis showed the existence of one transcript of zzso The level of zzso zzso increased in cells producing zzso under stress conditions zzso carbon and low nitrogen levels in the zzso suggesting that zzso regulation of zzso might be involved in the overproduction and zzso of zzso by zzso cells under stress zzso The possibility that additional mechanisms are responsible for this phenomenon is zzso
