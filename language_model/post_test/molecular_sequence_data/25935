We have recently reported that the zzso changes in the zzso and regulatory properties of zzso leaf zzso zzso are attributed to the regulatory zzso zzso of this zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso target zzso was zzso in zzso by a zzso leaf zzso zzso and the zzso regulatory site zzso was zzso from a zzso digest by zzso affinity and zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation analysis by zzso protein sequencing technology revealed that the zzso acid sequence of this zzso zzso is zzso This zzso which zzso exactly to zzso 13-21 in the deduced primary sequence of the zzso leaf zzso is far removed from recently identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the primary zzso Comparative analysis of the deduced zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso acid metabolism zzso zzso zzso suggests that the motif of zzso is an important structural requirement of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
