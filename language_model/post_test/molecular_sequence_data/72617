zzso a zzso gene with zzso to zzso on the X zzso was recently identified as the candidate gene for zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned mouse and human zzso zzso zzso part of the zzso untranslated region, the protein coding region, and the entire 3' untranslated region, determined the tissue distribution of zzso zzso and characterized the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso Using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso protection zzso we found that zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in human fetal and adult mouse zzso and long zzso With zzso from zzso mouse bone, an zzso product was generated with zzso but not 3' zzso primer pairs and a protected zzso zzso zzso was detected with zzso but not 3' zzso zzso by zzso protection zzso Analysis of the zzso product derived from zzso bone zzso revealed an zzso zzso transcript with retention of zzso sequence downstream from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected on Northern blots of zzso zzso zzso from zzso bone, while a zzso zzso transcript of approximately 7 zzso was apparent in normal zzso Southern analysis of zzso DNA from zzso mice revealed the absence of zzso bands with zzso zzso from the 3' region of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso transcript that is expressed predominantly in bone of mice and humans and that a large deletion in the 3' region of the zzso gene is present in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
