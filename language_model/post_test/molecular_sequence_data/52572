zzso zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso are members of a family of zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso maturation of a number of different zzso and zzso Although sharing more than 50% zzso in their zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit differences in zzso specificity and zzso to zzso In addition to these differences, zzso unlike zzso and other members of the family, specifically binds the neuroendocrine protein zzso In order to identify zzso responsible for the specific properties of the zzso zzso domain, we compared its primary sequence with that of other zzso This allowed us to distinguish a zzso sequence at positions zzso We constructed two zzso zzso in which zzso 242 and 243 and zzso zzso were replaced with the corresponding zzso of zzso Studies of in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso production of zzso from zzso and in zzso zzso of a zzso artificial zzso by zzso zzso did not reveal profound zzso On the other hand, both zzso zzso exhibited a considerably reduced ability to bind to zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso by the potent natural inhibitor zzso CT zzso was almost completely zzso Taken together, our results show that zzso zzso do not play a significant role in defining the zzso specificity of zzso but do contribute greatly to binding zzso and are critical for zzso with the zzso CT zzso
