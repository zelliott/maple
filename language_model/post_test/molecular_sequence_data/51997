zzso zzso from zzso 21 and 13 are almost identical in sequence and cannot be distinguished from each other by zzso zzso A general method based on zzso zzso is described here, allowing the discrimination of zzso DNA sequences from each of these two zzso after detection by Southern zzso zzso The zzso conditions were developed using zzso hybrid zzso The method was tested in zzso zzso by using the zzso bands from a Southern zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso origin of these bands, previously determined by linkage analysis, was confirmed by this zzso
