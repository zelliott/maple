The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso member 6 gene zzso is situated on zzso zzso near the region indicated in several zzso linkage zzso In a previous study a significant association was found between a promoter zzso within the zzso gene and zzso disease zzso To further investigate the zzso region, 34 zzso within 180 zzso were first zzso in an exploratory set of 121 zzso zzso cases and 152 controls in order to establish the extent of linkage zzso zzso and the major zzso in the zzso This analysis showed that the zzso was clustered in two large blocks within each of which a limited number of zzso represented most of the zzso zzso tagging markers were chosen and zzso in an additional 204 late onset zzso cases and 177 zzso Tests of association were performed for single markers for zzso status and for a quantitative measure of cognitive ability zzso State zzso zzso zzso within cases zzso The previously associated marker, located in the promoter of zzso now gave significant association with cognitive status in the Scottish zzso zzso samples zzso zzso zzso with the strongest signals being evident in the zzso carrier zzso thus providing a second independent positive result for this zzso The same marker was also significantly associated with cognitive performance in the Swedish zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso providing a third independent zzso Association analysis was also performed using the major zzso in the region, employing both zzso status and zzso zzso The zzso analysis did not give further significant zzso These results together with previous data suggest that a promoter marker in zzso plays a moderate but zzso role in zzso zzso
