zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical affinity predictions were used to gain molecular insight into zzso zzso Four low molecular weight zzso were zzso at their putative binding sites and molecular dynamics zzso simulations were performed for zzso zzso and the free energy of binding was calculated by the linear interaction energy zzso The number and the contact surface area of stabilizing zzso aromatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions appears to reflect the affinity differences between the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso in three different binding positions and MD simulations were performed for zzso zzso The MD zzso were used for molecular zzso surface area analysis of the three binding zzso zzso zzso scanning of the average zzso complexes after MD revealed zzso at the zzso interface giving the main contribution to the free energy of zzso The calculations indicated that zzso interacts with zzso via the rigid active site loop, but that also contact sites outside this loop contribute significantly to the free energy of zzso
