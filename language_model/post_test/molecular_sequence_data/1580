zzso zzso present in the zzso nitrogen zzso zzso of zzso zzso grown in North and South India showed maximum similarity to zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso patterns and zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso from North India and South India showed identical zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso patterns with zzso and zzso but zzso revealed zzso between the North Indian and South Indian zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences revealed similarity of North Indian zzso with an zzso zzso strain isolated from zzso zzso in Taiwan, whereas South Indian zzso showed closer zzso with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences from both North Indian and South Indian zzso with that of the related zzso revealed their closer affinity to zzso suggesting that zzso genes in the zzso might have been acquired from zzso via lateral transfer during zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso members of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso preparation of zzso zzso zzso showed strong a positive signal with zzso zzso zzso whereas a weak positive zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso grown zzso in minimal medium with and without zzso In spite of the expression of zzso zzso under zzso conditions, zzso reduction was not observed under zzso conditions even after prolonged zzso
