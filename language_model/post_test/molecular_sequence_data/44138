zzso screening of a zzso zzso zzso library led to the identification of clones producing an 18 zzso zzso zzso This protein reacted in Western blots with a zzso zzso against zzso proteins of zzso zzso and with a zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso expressing zzso revealed an zzso of 504 zzso zzso a zzso with a typical zzso signal recognition zzso Another zzso was found upstream of zzso with zzso to the zzso protein of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso of zzso a second ORF, of 321 zzso was found zzso zzso a protein with a signal zzso and with no zzso with proteins of known biological zzso After the stop zzso of zzso a zzso zzso sequence was detected which is part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso showed zzso with all known zzso from zzso bacteria, especially in the zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso cells in zzso and with zzso coli cells expressing zzso which had an zzso zzso zzso an indication that production of the protein zzso the division zzso
