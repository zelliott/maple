We have used the zzso reverse zzso reaction of viral core particles from duck liver to zzso the mechanism of zzso of duck zzso B virus zzso replication by the zzso analog zzso zzso As is the case in human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso acts as a chain zzso for the DNA zzso zzso The results of several different experiments support this conclusion, which explains the potent activity of zzso against the zzso In isolated zzso core zzso zzso inhibited the reverse zzso in a manner that resembled competitive zzso with respect to zzso However, the zzso of zzso was not linear on a zzso plot for the highest zzso of zzso and the lowest concentration of zzso This anomaly would be expected if binding to the zzso site was followed by DNA chain zzso zzso that used only the linear part of the curve yielded a Ki of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of core particles incubated in zzso with zzso was not reversed by removal of the free zzso zzso zzso the reverse zzso activity in a zzso zzso The zzso of the chain termination reaction was calculated at zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar competitive zzso and irreversible zzso were also obtained on the zzso DNA zzso from viral particles from serum, suggesting that zzso also acts as a chain zzso of the zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
