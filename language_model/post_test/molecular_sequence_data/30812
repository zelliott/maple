zzso zzso zzso gene expression is liver specific and zzso by zzso and via the zzso signaling zzso In zzso and other zzso cells the gene is subject to negative control by the zzso zzso zzso locus zzso We identified a zzso zzso that is zzso by zzso Two distinct sequence motifs are absolutely essential for function of this zzso a zzso response element zzso which is the target for repression by zzso and a zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso is generated by the combination of these two essential zzso which are fully zzso In zzso zzso indicates that zzso acts by affecting protein binding at the zzso A direct antagonism between zzso and the zzso signaling zzso suggests that zzso plays a role in control of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
