zzso zzso proteins have descended from a group of proteins involved in cellular zzso zzso zzso protein structures are found across all plant zzso and in the zzso and zzso We investigated whether conservation in the coding region sequence is paralleled by common gene regulatory zzso zzso and zzso gene promoters of three zzso diverse plants were zzso by transient and transgenic expression in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso factors zzso and zzso which are central regulators of seed maturation zzso interact with zzso of zzso promoters from zzso related zzso The promoter of a zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso protein exhibits strong zzso activity in both zzso and zzso The existence of zzso zzso indicates good conservation of regulatory pathways controlling gene expression in zzso spores and in zzso and zzso seeds, reflecting the concerted evolution of coding and regulatory zzso
