Recently we investigated the influence of classical and emerging antibiotics on the zzso of zzso zzso including in our studies zzso a potent novel inhibitor of zzso zzso The protein synthesis pattern under zzso treatment changed so dramatically that a direct comparison to the control pattern was zzso zzso channel imaging revealed that zzso treatment caused the majority of newly zzso proteins to accumulate in spots different from the ones usually observed, indicating a more zzso zzso zzso Two strategies were used to investigate the nature of the charge zzso In the first place, protein patterns of a conditional zzso zzso zzso under zzso and zzso conditions were zzso zzso several protein pairs excised from two-dimensional zzso gels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso growing zzso zzso and the zzso treated zzso were investigated with zzso laser zzso and zzso zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso zzso for the existence of zzso zzso Under zzso conditions the zzso protein pattern resembled that of the zzso The loss of zzso zzso activity under zzso conditions led to the same zzso shift observed for zzso treatment in the zzso zzso zzso on 11 protein pairs proved that the remaining zzso zzso zzso was indeed responsible for the charge zzso Eight of these protein pairs were also present on zzso gels of zzso growing zzso zzso where the more zzso still zzso protein species represented the smaller zzso
