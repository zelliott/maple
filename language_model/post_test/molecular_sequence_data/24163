From a zzso hot pepper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso factor that contains a single zzso DNA binding zzso zzso was most closely related to tomato zzso zzso both of which belong to the novel zzso class IV typified by the zzso zzso signature zzso while it had a limited sequence identity zzso with zzso zzso and tobacco zzso zzso gel zzso zzso revealed that zzso expressed full-length zzso was able to form a specific complex with both the zzso box and zzso zzso with its binding affinity for zzso being stronger than for zzso When fused to the zzso DNA binding domain, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could function individually as zzso in zzso This suggests that two separate zzso of zzso may play distinct roles in zzso zzso In particle zzso experiments, zzso activated the zzso of reporter genes containing the zzso element in tobacco zzso In hot pepper plants, the zzso level of zzso zzso was markedly induced by multiple environmental factors, such as pathogen infection, zzso mechanical wounding and high zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in partially improved tolerance against the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso and salt stress zzso zzso zzso zzso various zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso tobacco zzso Thus, it appears that zzso is functional in tobacco cells, where it zzso the zzso of some zzso and zzso to trigger a subset of stress zzso Here, the possible biological zzso of zzso is discussed, especially with regard to the possibility that zzso has multiple functions in the regulation of zzso and zzso gene expression in hot pepper zzso
