The controller zzso proteins of a wide variety of zzso zzso systems are thought to regulate expression of the zzso zzso gene by a genetic switch that ensures that zzso precedes zzso zzso Previous DNA zzso experiments with zzso have located the binding site upstream of the C and R genes in the zzso zzso system, and the structure of zzso has recently been zzso Here, we provide evidence that the binding site can accommodate either one or two zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso binding site is adjacent to the zzso zzso site required for the interaction with zzso zzso zzso however, zzso binding of a second zzso blocks this zzso zzso DNA binding site sizes for zzso and zzso formation were determined to be ca 21 zzso and 34 zzso zzso The zzso and affinities of relevant zzso complexes have been zzso by zzso zzso and zzso using native and zzso promoter zzso zzso models of the zzso and zzso complexes have been constructed that are consistent with the zzso zzso Our results suggest a mechanism for both positive and negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso at moderate levels of zzso the protein binds to the promoter as a zzso and stimulates zzso by the interaction with zzso As the levels of zzso increase further, binding of the second zzso competes with zzso thus zzso zzso of its own zzso and hence that of the zzso
