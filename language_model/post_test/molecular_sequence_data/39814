Very recently, zzso zzso in the genes zzso transforming growth factor beta receptors I zzso and II zzso have been reported in zzso zzso aneurysm syndrome zzso In addition, dominant zzso zzso have been identified in zzso syndrome type 2 zzso and familial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the past, zzso of these genes were associated with zzso and several human zzso Here, we report a total of nine novel and one known zzso sequence zzso in the zzso and zzso genes in nine of 70 unrelated individuals with zzso zzso who previously tested negative for zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso To assess the zzso impact of these sequence zzso in zzso analyses were performed by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by means of a zzso zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that in all but one of the patients the zzso effect of at least one sequence zzso is highly probable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, and zzso zzso A in zzso and zzso zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso C in zzso These deleterious zzso occurred de zzso or zzso with the disease in the families, indicating a zzso association between the sequence zzso and clinical zzso Since zzso zzso found in patients with zzso disorders cannot be distinguished from zzso zzso zzso reported in tumor samples, we emphasize the importance of segregation analysis in affected zzso In order to be able to find the zzso that is indeed responsible for a zzso zzso we also propose that genetic testing for sequence zzso in zzso and zzso should be zzso by zzso screening of the zzso zzso
