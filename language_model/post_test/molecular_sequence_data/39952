zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that removes zzso from zzso The active site of the zzso was recently proposed to include zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso via a transition state zzso We explored the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso digest pattern of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso modified two areas of the zzso One zzso zzso zzso in a zzso region previously proposed to possess zzso activity, was zzso by zzso Another zzso zzso zzso was detected only after treatment with zzso and was in an zzso region, overlapping a zzso area containing an adjacent zzso zzso No zzso modification of this zzso could be zzso zzso of this zzso after treatment with zzso was accompanied by the simultaneous inability to detect the nearby zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso recently shown to be essential for zzso zzso To determine which of the first two peptides might also be important for zzso activity, zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in almost complete zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused little zzso of zzso zzso Together, these data extend the region of the active site zzso and give independent evidence to support the idea that zzso zzso zzso through formation of a transition state analog that resides in the active site of the zzso and in doing so alters its zzso and ensuing zzso digest zzso
