A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the beach soil of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and colonies were zzso circular with entire edges and had a glistening zzso The isolate grew zzso at zzso zzso and did not require zzso for zzso zzso zzso could not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso but zzso assimilated zzso Major fatty acids were summed feature 7 zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence studies showed that strain zzso belonged to the family zzso class zzso and was most closely related to type strains of members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Signature zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence also suggested that strain zzso was affiliated with the zzso zzso Low zzso zzso values zzso indicated that strain zzso represented a distinct species that was separated from other type strains in the zzso zzso On the basis of evidence from a zzso study, it is proposed that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso represents the type strain of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
