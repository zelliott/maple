An zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from zzso soil zzso zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso occupied a distinct zzso position in the zzso species zzso showing highest similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of similarity to strains of other zzso species ranged between zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso was the major zzso in the zzso The major cellular fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso The polar zzso profile of strain zzso showed the presence of zzso an unidentified zzso three unknown zzso and two unknown polar zzso The zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso and zzso tests clearly distinguish the novel strain from closely related species of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso
