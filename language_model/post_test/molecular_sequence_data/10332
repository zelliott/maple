There is increasing evidence that tumor expressed genes induce immune responses in cancer zzso To identify zzso expressed zzso we established a zzso expression library which was screened with zzso zzso Out of 20 positive zzso clones eight share high sequence zzso as determined by sequence zzso These eight clones can be grouped into three classes which differ in length and which are characterized by specific sequence zzso The longest open reading frame was found to be zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso termed zzso expressed zzso 6 zzso Using five sequence specific primer pairs, zzso hybrid panel mapping revealed locations of the three classes on several human zzso including zzso 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 13 and zzso The mapping results were confirmed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed consistent expression of all classes in several zzso and additional zzso using the same set of primer pairs as for zzso zzso The expression data were confirmed by northern zzso zzso For the predicted zzso acid sequence zzso revealed a zzso to a human zzso zzso which was previously isolated by an zzso directed against zzso zzso properties of the zzso protein include an zzso zzso domain, a zzso region and two zzso zzso indicating protein binding and zzso zzso
