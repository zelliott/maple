X and Y sex zzso from the zzso plant zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso preparations on zzso zzso zzso were zzso using an zzso zzso laser zzso and isolated sex zzso were then recovered on excised fragments of zzso zzso Sex zzso associated DNA sequences were amplified using the zzso zzso primed zzso chain reaction zzso and pools of zzso products were used to investigate the zzso organization of the zzso zzso sex zzso The zzso locations of cloned sex zzso repeat sequences were zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and data complementary to laser zzso studies were obtained by zzso in zzso zzso In zzso these studies demonstrate that the X and Y sex zzso of zzso zzso are of very similar DNA composition and also that they share a significant repetitive DNA content with the zzso The evolution of sex zzso in zzso is discussed and compared with that in another zzso species, zzso zzso
