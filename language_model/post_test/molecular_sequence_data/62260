By analyzing expression profiles of human zzso stem cells incubated in zzso supplements, we identified and characterized a novel human zzso zzso zzso interface located zzso zzso that is likely to play a significant role in the process of zzso The deduced zzso product consists of 766 zzso acids with a zzso EMI domain at the zzso zzso Western zzso detected zzso expression in a variety of zzso cell zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso days zzso revealed relatively high levels of zzso protein in zzso cells of developing zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso gene plays an important role in skeletal zzso
