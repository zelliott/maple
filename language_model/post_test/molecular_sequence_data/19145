Heat shock protein 40 zzso acts as a zzso with zzso to promote protein zzso protein transport and zzso The human zzso family contains more than 40 members, some of which can exist as zzso in the zzso However, little is known about the protein zzso responsible for their zzso and the functional relevance of this zzso modification remains zzso Here we show that zzso is an in zzso and in zzso zzso for the zzso protein zzso protein zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso form complexes in cells and this interaction is accomplished by the zzso regions of both zzso zzso can zzso zzso at several zzso in zzso Studies with specific zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso in zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso modestly stimulates the zzso zzso activity of zzso complex and enhances the repression of heat shock factor 1 driven zzso by zzso
