Many zzso especially membrane and exported zzso are stabilized by zzso zzso bridges between zzso zzso without which they fail to attain their native functional zzso The formation of these bonds is zzso in zzso bacteria by zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, the activity of zzso has been shown to be necessary for many zzso dependent on exported zzso including zzso invasion, and zzso survival of various zzso The zzso system in zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso meningitis, has not, however, been zzso In a previous work where genes specific to zzso zzso and not present in the other zzso zzso were isolated, a zzso zzso gene was brought to light zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 93, zzso zzso of this zzso however, did not result in deficits in the zzso commonly associated with zzso A search of available zzso data revealed that the zzso contains three zzso genes zzso proteins with different predicted zzso locations, zzso a soluble zzso zzso and two zzso zzso Cell zzso experiments confirmed the zzso in the inner membrane of the latter two, which include the previously identified zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the deletion of any single zzso was compensated by the action of the remaining two on bacterial growth, whereas the triple zzso was unable to grow at 37 degrees zzso zzso however, the combined absence of the two zzso zzso led to a zzso of sensitivity to reducing agents and loss of functionality of the zzso Although in many species a single zzso zzso is sufficient for the correct folding of various zzso in the zzso a zzso zzso is required for a wild type zzso zzso even in the presence of a functional zzso zzso
