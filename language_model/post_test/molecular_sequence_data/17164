zzso is a small zzso zzso in zzso coli that was identified by its ability to bind tightly to the zzso zzso zzso This study reports the role of zzso in zzso the cellular response to zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso and co-workers have shown that a block in the metabolism of zzso zzso causes transient growth zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso synthesis was induced by a zzso zzso zzso analogue and was necessary for relief of the toxicity of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient to cause a rapid loss of zzso zzso probably reflecting degradation of the message zzso by zzso zzso The zzso gene was renamed zzso for sugar zzso zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by a novel zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso which has a putative zzso domain and a zzso domain similar to those found in certain transport zzso Our results suggest that under conditions of zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso causing degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in decreased production of zzso transport machinery, thus limiting further zzso of zzso zzso
