The zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso gene zzso is responsible for zzso male zzso and zzso sensitivity in the Texas zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sensitivity to two zzso zzso toxins zzso zzso is zzso by the interaction of zzso and T toxins to form pores in the inner zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso mimics the effects of T toxins on isolated zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in culture and in zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae with a zzso zzso In insect cells, zzso forms zzso structures in the membrane and zzso T toxin or zzso zzso Adding T toxin or zzso to zzso cells producing zzso causes zzso of plasma zzso In addition, zzso is toxic to insect cells grown in culture without T toxins or zzso even a zzso zzso form of zzso is lethal to cell zzso zzso expressing zzso are lethal to zzso zzso larvae, at times zzso comparable to those obtained by injecting a zzso expressing an insect zzso This result suggests that zzso could be useful as a biological control agent for insect zzso Our data indicate that zzso has two independent mechanisms for zzso one that is zzso by T toxin and zzso and one that is independent of these zzso Similarly, male zzso and toxin sensitivity in zzso zzso may be due to independent zzso
