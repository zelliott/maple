The structure of protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution by refinement against single crystal X-ray zzso data with additional constraints provided by zzso zzso This highly zzso protein consists of two zzso separated by a zzso connecting zzso zzso aromatic and positively charged zzso acid zzso on the surface of each domain are likely to be directly involved in binding 23 S zzso zzso The shape of the zzso with its two widely spaced zzso sites, suggests that it may serve as a zzso zzso most likely playing a role in zzso assembly and/or maintaining the zzso active zzso of the zzso zzso The combined use of X-ray and zzso data in the refinement procedure was essential in defining the zzso domain of the zzso which was relatively poorly determined by the X-ray data zzso In addition to resolving the ambiguities in defining the zzso core and zzso zzso with the zzso domain, this combined zzso analysis provides the first detailed and accurate view of the zzso zzso zzso zzso data also showed that the zzso domain is stable in solution, indicated by zzso zzso that are protected from zzso zzso The lack of definition of the zzso domain in the X-ray structure is therefore likely due to packing disorder within the crystal rather than structural zzso This combined zzso analysis provides a useful model as to how X-ray and zzso data can be practically and logically combined in the determination of the structure of a single protein zzso
