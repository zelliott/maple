zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso in zzso ethanol before zzso with zzso in order to characterize the peptides active at the zzso The total zzso and the different zzso obtained after zzso were analyzed by zzso to separate the peptides according to their gradual order on a zzso zzso In each case, zzso peptides were recovered in the creamed phase and characterized by mass zzso and zzso After zzso zzso short peptides were identified at the zzso layer as fragments zzso zzso zzso and zzso linked to zzso by a zzso zzso It indicates that the zzso distribution of the zzso acids in the sequence of the fragments is more relevant to zzso than the length of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced larger zzso peptides which were also recovered in the creamed phase of the emulsion and zzso
