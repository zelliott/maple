We have zzso a previously unknown zzso zzso zzso from human zzso lung zzso from a patient with zzso zzso zzso was identified by its zzso binding to lung zzso protein D zzso and by its molecular mass of 340 zzso in the reduced state on zzso gel zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the 10,000 zzso g zzso of the zzso fluid by zzso and gel zzso zzso On zzso zzso showed an apparent molecular mass of 290 zzso in the zzso zzso On gel zzso under zzso conditions, the apparent molecular mass of zzso was zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso was shown by zzso with zzso zzso which reduced the apparent molecular mass of zzso under reducing condition to about 300 zzso zzso zzso acid sequence data showed the presence of zzso type zzso zzso and zzso zzso were raised against zzso and their zzso were confirmed by Western zzso The zzso were used for zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso where it was found on the surface of and within zzso zzso zzso binding between zzso and zzso took place at zzso zzso strength, required the presence of zzso and was not inhibited by zzso The binding between zzso and zzso also required the presence of zzso but this interaction was completely inhibited by zzso The same binding pattern was seen between zzso and zzso human zzso composed of the zzso neck region and three zzso recognition zzso These findings indicate that the binding between zzso and zzso is a zzso interaction rather than a zzso interaction and that the binding to zzso takes place via the zzso recognition domain of zzso We conclude that zzso is a new member of the zzso zzso and likely to be a truncated form of a zzso for zzso
