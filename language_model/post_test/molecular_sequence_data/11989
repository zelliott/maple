We have examined the response of the human zzso resistance zzso zzso downstream promoter to various zzso of human zzso in a reporter zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso reporter activity driven by the zzso downstream promoter zzso pairs zzso to zzso relative to the major zzso initiation zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso cell zzso A 123 zzso segment of DNA zzso to zzso relative to the major zzso initiation zzso and a 193 zzso segment zzso to zzso have been isolated from the zzso downstream promoter which, like the full promoter, are zzso controlled by zzso zzso However, a 135 zzso segment zzso to zzso of the promoter is activated by zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso and zzso Thus some zzso of zzso are able to activate zzso from the 3' region of the zzso downstream promoter, an activity that characterizes these zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso
