The zzso zzso gene is expressed in a zzso manner, predominantly in zzso cells but also in airway zzso cells and zzso We demonstrate in this report that the zzso zzso DNA of the zzso gene contains sequences which zzso its activity in a variety of zzso cell lines but not in two zzso cell zzso The element has characteristics of a zzso zzso since it functions in both zzso The main activity of the zzso has been mapped to the first 900 zzso of zzso zzso DNA, which contains nine binding sites for a nuclear factor present in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso These binding sites have similar sequences and multiple copies of the binding sites zzso zzso zzso when attached to a minimal lox promoter zzso The zzso zzso DNA also contains a cluster of three binding sites for the zzso family of zzso zzso
