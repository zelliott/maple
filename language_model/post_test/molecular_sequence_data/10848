The zzso and repair of DNA by zzso zzso involves the creation of Holliday zzso which are zzso by a class of zzso zzso to generate zzso duplex DNA zzso Only two cellular zzso zzso have been identified to date: zzso in zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso We have identified a protein from zzso zzso which has zzso sequence identity to zzso The zzso protein has been cloned and zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso protein has been shown to be a Holliday zzso zzso zzso has a high degree of specificity for the structure of the zzso zzso to which it binds as a zzso The zzso exhibits a sequence specificity for junction zzso that differs from both zzso and zzso and it zzso fixed junctions at the point of strand zzso The conservation of the mechanism of Holliday junction zzso between two organisms as diverse as zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that there may be a common zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso plants, zzso and possibly higher zzso
