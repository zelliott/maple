In an effort to develop potent zzso and zzso drugs, a series of new zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed and zzso against zzso models of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso built using zzso zzso software and refined by molecular dynamics for 2 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of these zzso models by zzso zzso and zzso programs revealed that these models are highly zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso designed by substituting different chemical groups on zzso rings replacing zzso zzso in zzso with five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso molecules showed good binding affinity towards mouse zzso Further, zzso studies of zzso zzso derivatives are likely to have superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies against site directed zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed the effect of zzso of zzso Drug zzso and activity zzso for these zzso showed that these molecules act as best drugs at very low zzso
