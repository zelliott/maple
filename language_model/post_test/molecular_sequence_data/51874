The accurate synthesis of proteins is crucial to the existence of a zzso In zzso several genes that affect the zzso of translation have been identified zzso omnipotent zzso zzso and zzso We have found that the dominant omnipotent zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso by two similar zzso but only the zzso copy of the gene is able to fully complement the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Both copies of the zzso genes contain zzso Unlike the zzso of other duplicated zzso protein genes which are highly diverged, the duplicated zzso genes have two nearly identical DNA sequences of 25 and 31 zzso in length within their zzso The zzso protein has significant zzso to the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso is zzso by one of the zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso coli which are the functional equivalent of omnipotent zzso in zzso Thus, zzso and zzso demonstrate functional as well as sequence conservation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are most similar in their central zzso acid zzso Interestingly, the zzso resulting from the zzso zzso and the segment of the zzso protein involved in binding to the zzso zzso are within this most zzso zzso
