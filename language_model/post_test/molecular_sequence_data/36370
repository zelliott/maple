The zzso specificity and general properties of a Lewis zzso gene associated zzso isolated from human milk have been examined at the penultimate zzso stage involving affinity zzso on zzso zzso and after a subsequent gel zzso step on zzso zzso Both preparations transferred zzso to the zzso position of zzso in Type 1 zzso beta zzso zzso and the zzso position of zzso in zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and both used Type 1 zzso compounds when the terminal zzso acid was present in zzso zzso The striking difference between the two preparations was in their zzso with Type 2 zzso beta zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso the apparent zzso values for the zzso preparation with zzso zzso Type 2 zzso were considerably zzso zzso of the terminal zzso with zzso acid in zzso linkage decreased the zzso values for zzso zzso but no zzso incorporation of zzso was observed into zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso irrespective of the presence of zzso acid in the terminal zzso
