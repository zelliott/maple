zzso zzso zzso the agent of zzso is a slow growing zzso that causes important economic losses mainly due to lower weight gains and drastic decrease in milk zzso zzso zzso vaccines are not completely protective and induce zzso type hypersensitivity zzso reaction that cannot be differentiated from those of naturally infected zzso New potent zzso vaccines that allow discrimination between infected and vaccinated animals are needed to improve the control of this zzso We have identified, expressed and zzso a hypothetical zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We also characterized the zzso of this zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a high production of zzso zzso and NO and a low production of zzso by zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso resulted in lower zzso zzso and higher NO production in zzso zzso A similar level of proliferation of zzso cells exposed to zzso was found in zzso groups zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso responses in mice zzso were observed only in mice zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso clearly induced a significantly higher zzso zzso production of all classes tested and decreased the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso characteristics that make this zzso a potential component in the development of a future zzso vaccine against zzso
