Animals in each zzso of the zzso zzso exhibit a similar process by which they form a zzso central nervous system zzso However, little is known about spatial relationship among the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso constitute a major animal group in the zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the expression patterns of zzso and zzso related genes of the zzso zzso zzso in the developing zzso zzso These zzso genes exhibited zzso expression patterns that are zzso similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso as characterized by the expression of these genes supports the division of the zzso zzso zzso suggested by the previous zzso zzso Furthermore, conservation of the expression pattern of the zzso genes suggests that such zzso occurred in the zzso of a putative common zzso of zzso
