An in zzso genetic system was developed as a rapid means for studying the specificity zzso of zzso zzso This system was used to investigate the origin of the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso domain responsible for binding to zzso small nuclear zzso was locally zzso and displayed as a zzso library on zzso zzso zzso selection identified four zzso zzso in the zzso region that are important for specific binding to zzso hairpin zzso One of these zzso zzso disproportionately affects the rates of binding and release and appears to play a critical role in zzso the protein onto the zzso Interestingly, a protein zzso that binds more tightly than zzso emerged during the selection, showing that the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso has not been zzso during zzso
