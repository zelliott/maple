The human red and green zzso are specified by genes on the long arm of the X zzso zzso In individuals with normal color vision, the locus was proposed to consist of a single red zzso gene upstream of one or more copies of green zzso zzso The presence of a single red zzso gene in the array was confirmed by demonstration of only one retinal zzso transcript coding for the red zzso In individuals with multiple green zzso zzso it is unknown whether all genes are zzso We analyzed the sequence of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso of individuals with multiple green zzso genes in comparison with the corresponding zzso DNA zzso The data showed that only a single green zzso gene is zzso We therefore suggest that a locus zzso element, already known to be located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of the red zzso zzso allows zzso of only a single copy of the green zzso zzso probably the most zzso zzso This finding provides an explanation for the zzso presence of zzso zzso hybrid genes in individuals with normal color zzso Such hybrid genes are usually associated with defective color zzso We suggest that zzso zzso hybrid genes produce defective color vision only when their position in the gene array allows expression in the retinal cone zzso
