The zzso zzso is the major gene involved in the complex zzso of zzso disease zzso or zzso zzso showing zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the sporadic zzso Several zzso zzso and zzso have been described in association with the disease, suggesting a role for this gene in zzso zzso also in the absence of zzso in the coding zzso Finally, the presence of a functional zzso in zzso 1 has repeatedly been proposed to explain such zzso Here we report a zzso study conducted on 97 Italian zzso sporadic patients and 85 population matched controls, using 13 zzso zzso distributed throughout the zzso from the zzso promoter to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses have shown increased zzso between the zzso and 3' portions of the gene and an zzso in the cases zzso of two zzso sharing a common zzso combination that extends from the promoter up to zzso zzso We propose that these two zzso zzso derive from a single founding zzso extending up to zzso 19 and successively rearranged in correspondence with a high zzso rate region located between the zzso and zzso portions of the zzso Our results suggests the possibility that a common zzso zzso zzso in linkage zzso with such zzso is located further downstream than the previously suggested zzso encompassing zzso zzso
