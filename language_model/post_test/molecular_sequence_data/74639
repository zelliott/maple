With only 19 zzso zzso zzso is the smallest known zzso that has a defined zzso binding zzso zzso binds zzso zzso at a zzso ratio with high affinity and exclusive zzso As an abundant binding target, zzso is a major zzso and accounts for about zzso of the zzso content in zzso cellular zzso zzso is zzso to the surface of zzso cells and also becomes accessible in zzso cells because of compromised plasma membrane zzso Given the unique zzso properties of zzso and the availability of zzso in acute cell death, the goal of this study was to develop and evaluate zzso as a novel molecular probe for imaging zzso 

zzso is zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and labeled with zzso using a coordination chemistry involving zzso zzso The retention of zzso activities was confirmed using competition zzso with zzso zzso The blood zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were measured in zzso Finally, zzso binding to acute cell death in zzso was demonstrated using a rat model of acute zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso and confirmed using zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso was zzso and confirmed by mass zzso The zzso efficiency was zzso zzso purity was zzso and specific activity was 54 zzso The zzso was zzso with zzso liquid zzso zzso before zzso The specific zzso of zzso in zzso cells, compared with that in viable control cells, was enhanced by more than zzso This binding was competitively diminished in the presence of zzso zzso but not by zzso consisting of other zzso zzso zzso injected zzso has favorable zzso and zzso zzso it quickly zzso from the circulation via the zzso system, with a blood zzso of less than 4 zzso in zzso The zzso and gastrointestinal zzso were very zzso zzso is completely zzso in zzso and the intact agent is recovered from the zzso Combined with a fast clearance and low zzso background, the avid binding of zzso to the zzso zzso quickly becomes conspicuous shortly after zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso 

zzso is a stable, zzso zzso zzso with favorable in zzso imaging zzso It is a strong candidate as a molecular probe for zzso imaging and warrants further development and zzso
