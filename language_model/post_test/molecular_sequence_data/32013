zzso zzso are zzso compounds for which current methods of elimination are zzso thus zzso is considered as a promising zzso Here we provide the structural and zzso characterization of the recently identified zzso isolated from zzso zzso dubbed zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and exhibits an unusual zzso resistance and some zzso degrading zzso 

The X-ray structure of zzso has been solved at zzso zzso zzso The zzso is roughly zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso typical of the zzso zzso Several structural zzso such as an extended zzso surface and an zzso zzso bridge, common features in zzso zzso are consistent with its high zzso zzso Additionally, we provide the zzso characterization of zzso against a wide range of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso possesses a broad zzso activity spectrum, since it zzso various zzso zzso and a zzso Because of its zzso zzso activity, and given its intrinsic zzso zzso is an interesting candidate for the development of an zzso zzso Its X-ray structure shed light on its active site, and provides key information for the understanding of the zzso binding mode and zzso
