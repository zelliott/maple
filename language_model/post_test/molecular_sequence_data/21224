In this study, zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso 2) was isolated, zzso and zzso from rainbow zzso A zzso zzso was isolated and found to contain a single initiation site zzso from the most zzso end, an open reading frame of zzso and a single putative zzso site zzso from the most 3' zzso The zzso protein contains zzso zzso acids and contains seven zzso zzso Based on structural analysis, the protein was identified as a zzso 2 zzso These data support the emergence of a zzso zzso family early in the course of zzso evolution, zzso with or perhaps prior to the divergence of zzso zzso The distribution of zzso 2 zzso in zzso was determined by quantitative real zzso zzso zzso 2 was most abundant in the brain (where it was detected in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso skeletal muscle, and liver, but it also was present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and various regions of the gastrointestinal tract zzso stomach, zzso zzso 2 zzso was most abundant in the brain, muscle, and zzso In zzso the zzso body and liver with increasing zzso of zzso zzso 4, zzso resulted in increased expression of zzso 2 zzso These findings contribute to the understanding of the evolution of the zzso family and provide insight into the roles of zzso 2 in zzso
