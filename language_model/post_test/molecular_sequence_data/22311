The zzso anonymous protein zzso is an essential zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso displays adhesive motifs on the zzso portion, whereas its zzso tail connects to zzso via zzso thus driving zzso zzso and host cell zzso The minimal requirements for the zzso binding to zzso were scanned here and found to be shared by different human zzso including the zzso syndrome protein zzso family zzso In zzso and in zzso binding of zzso members to zzso was characterized by zzso deletion zzso zzso and zzso zzso As in the case of zzso the binding of zzso to zzso is competitively inhibited by the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso but not other unrelated zzso zzso compete for the binding to the zzso in zzso Together, our results define a zzso zzso binding motif in the zzso family members and suggest that zzso zzso the zzso and zzso dynamics of zzso zzso These findings along with the presence of similar zzso binding motifs in additional human zzso some of which indeed interact with zzso in pull-down zzso suggest zzso zzso roles for this zzso
