The zzso of proteins containing zzso zzso requires zzso for their correct zzso For instance, the zzso zzso protein zzso aides in the zzso targeting of newly zzso members of the zzso low density zzso zzso zzso gene family, which contains zzso arranged clusters of zzso zzso In the chicken, an zzso relative with eight such repeats is expressed as two different zzso zzso forms in cell zzso fashion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Schneider, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To learn more about evolutionary aspects of zzso its role in zzso of these different zzso zzso zzso and other potential functions, we have extended our studies on the avian zzso family to zzso zzso zzso determination of tissue expression at both the transcript and the protein level, stable expression in zzso cells, and binding studies with chicken zzso revealed that zzso zzso have retained many features of the zzso zzso However, structural details, zzso the well defined internal zzso repeats in the chicken zzso have been somewhat diluted during zzso Interestingly, chicken zzso was found to correlate positively with the expression levels in zzso cells of the larger zzso zzso of the zzso repeat zzso but not with those of the smaller zzso expressed only in germ zzso This is compatible with the possibility that zzso may play a role in zzso biology that could be zzso its function in assisting zzso Chicken zzso in crude extracts of the stable zzso zzso cells is able to bind to zzso relatives in zzso blots without requirement for prior zzso of the zzso Thus, in conjunction with the avian model of massive zzso transport to germ cells, these cells provide a novel comparative system amenable to investigation of the biological functions of zzso
