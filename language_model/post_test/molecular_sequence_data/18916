Fruit zzso in tomato zzso zzso is a complicated development process affected by both zzso hormonal and genetic regulators and external zzso Although the role of zzso a member of the zzso domain family, in zzso tomato fruit zzso has been established, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain zzso To explore further the role of zzso zzso factors in fruit zzso we characterized a new tomato zzso domain zzso named zzso which shows high zzso in zzso and at the onset of fruit zzso Various stress treatments including zzso zzso zzso and low temperature significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso expression of zzso by zzso interference zzso in tomato resulted in delayed fruit zzso suppressed zzso breakdown and decreased zzso synthesis zzso mainly through reduced expression of zzso zzso genes of zzso and reduced zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso tomato fruits also displayed significant zzso of multiple zzso zzso indicating that zzso functions as a positive regulator of fruit zzso by affecting zzso synthesis and zzso zzso Moreover, we also noted that zzso could not be induced by zzso and may function upstream of the zzso regulator zzso and positively regulate its zzso zzso zzso zzso further revealed that zzso could interact with both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso and zzso processes are regulated by zzso in the fruit zzso regulatory zzso
