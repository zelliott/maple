The zzso are a family of proteins that are thought to mediate cell to cell interactions between zzso During the sequencing at an zzso locus associated with a mental zzso syndrome in some studies, we discovered a portion of the human zzso of the rat zzso zzso We now report the structure and the expression of that zzso The gene spans approximately zzso and contains eight zzso Unlike the rat zzso it codes for at least two zzso and at least one of which is expressed outside the zzso Interestingly, the putative promoter for the gene zzso the last zzso of the neighboring zzso gene and is located less than zzso from an zzso element in which a zzso associated with mental zzso is zzso These findings suggest a possible role for the zzso gene in mental zzso and that the role of the gene in humans may differ from its role in zzso
