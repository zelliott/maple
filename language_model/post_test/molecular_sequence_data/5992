zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that plays a critical role in zzso zzso and the initiation of acute inflammatory zzso Several zzso blocking zzso bind to the zzso of zzso a approximately 200 zzso acid region in the zzso portion of the protein that is involved in zzso binding and zzso functional zzso We examined several zzso blocking zzso for different patterns of binding to zzso We used zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and deletions of the zzso to examine zzso We describe the binding characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 44, and zzso All of these zzso except for zzso bind to the zzso half of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso was unique in that it required regions of the zzso and zzso ends of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 44 all required the zzso to be intact for zzso This suggests that these zzso zzso recognize a zzso zzso zzso was capable of binding to a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as this system has been used to define different zzso binding sites, it may be used to analyze specific zzso binding sites in the zzso of zzso
