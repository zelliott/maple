zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso the zzso agent for the most severe form of malaria, has shown remarkable similarities to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso zzso characterized in zzso and other zzso zzso sequence analysis and identification of critical zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso interactions predict zzso structure for zzso The zzso active zzso zzso was characterized as a zzso The zzso is localized primarily in the zzso zzso To gain molecular insights into zzso relationships and to understand the zzso structure of zzso zzso were generated by zzso to the potential zzso interacting zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which snapped the salt bridges between the zzso and resulted in lower zzso state, did not affect zzso properties of the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso were active equally as the zzso zzso The studies reveal structure of zzso as a zzso of zzso The zzso state of zzso was not essential for zzso functions of the zzso but may be an evolutionary adaptation for zzso zzso to support its role in zzso zzso an important zzso function for survival of the malaria zzso
