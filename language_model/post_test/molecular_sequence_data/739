Very few obligatory relationships involve viruses to the remarkable exception of zzso zzso associated with tens of thousands species of zzso zzso that develop within the body of zzso zzso zzso zzso injected along with zzso eggs into the host body, act by manipulating host immune zzso development and zzso thereby enabling zzso larvae to survive in a potentially harmful zzso zzso production does not occur in infected zzso of zzso zzso but is restricted to specialized cells of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso enclosed in the particles encodes almost no viral structural zzso but mostly factors used to manipulate the physiology of the zzso zzso We recently zzso the viral nature of zzso associated with zzso zzso by characterizing a large set of zzso genes residing permanently in the zzso zzso Many of these genes zzso structural components of the zzso particles and their expression pattern zzso with particle zzso They constitute a viral machinery zzso a large number of core genes shared by zzso and zzso Thus zzso do not appear to be zzso zzso but instead complex zzso devices carrying DNA for the delivery of zzso genes into zzso zzso This highlights the fact that viruses should no longer be exclusively considered obligatory zzso and that in certain cases they are obligatory zzso
