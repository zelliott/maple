zzso zzso II stimulates zzso growth of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso Accompanying this growth is the induction of the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the synthesis of the zzso growth factors, such as zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate further that zzso II also zzso the synthesis of basic zzso growth factor zzso a potent zzso for zzso To examine how these factors interact to zzso the growth response of zzso to zzso II, we used zzso zzso to determine the relative contribution of these three zzso Treatment of zzso zzso smooth muscle cells with specific zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso and zzso 1 efficiently inhibited the zzso of these zzso Our results demonstrate that in these zzso zzso 1 affects a key zzso action, modulating the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso exerts only a minimal effect on DNA zzso An imbalance in these signals activated by zzso II may result in abnormal zzso growth leading to the development of vascular zzso
