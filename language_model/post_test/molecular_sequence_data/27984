The primary structure of zzso and zzso suggested that zzso was derived from zzso by the combination of a genetic exchange with zzso and a point zzso To investigate the evolution of the zzso cross zzso group, the zzso gene was cloned and the primary structure was zzso zzso is identical to zzso except in the alpha 1 zzso The alpha 1 domain of zzso except zzso zzso acids is identical to that of zzso which was suspected to be an intermediate gene between zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso has evolved from zzso in two zzso an in zzso replacement of the alpha 1 domain with zzso and genetic exchange with one of the zzso zzso These three genes and zzso are zzso to share a common zzso As zzso class I molecules of a zzso zzso group zzso have limited zzso we suspected they might have evolved from a common zzso In fact, the structures of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso demonstrate that they differ by only two zzso zzso Both zzso are in the zzso region of the alpha 1 domain and suggest that zzso could be derived from zzso by the combination of a genetic exchange with zzso and a point zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and is zzso related to zzso while zzso zzso and zzso is related to zzso zzso is zzso closer to zzso than to zzso zzso we have cloned a zzso gene of zzso and determined its structure to study further the evolution of the zzso zzso
