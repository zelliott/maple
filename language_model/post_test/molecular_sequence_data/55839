A novel zzso gene was isolated from a strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso A new zzso chain reaction zzso technique with a set of several zzso primer pairs specific to the zzso gene was used to screen a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified several DNA fragments ranging from 100 zzso to 1 zzso for zzso zzso strains containing a zzso zzso zzso fragments amplified from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA differed from the fragments amplified from other zzso zzso indicating strain zzso contained a novel zzso zzso To isolate crystal genes zzso to zzso an zzso gene library was zzso with a zzso zzso of the zzso coding region of the zzso gene cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A putative toxin gene was isolated from a zzso that zzso strongly to the zzso zzso zzso of the putative toxin DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids whose predicted molecular mass was zzso zzso Comparisons of the toxin gene sequence with sequences of other cry genes indicated that this gene is a zzso of zzso We propose to designate this gene zzso In zzso coli, the zzso gene produced a protein of approximately 130 zzso toxic to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
