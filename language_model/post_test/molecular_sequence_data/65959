We cloned a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso from a marine zzso the Japanese zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso contained signal zzso zzso heavy chain, zzso zzso light chain, and zzso in the order from the zzso An exposure to zzso significantly increased the levels of plasma zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in zzso Neither plasma zzso nor zzso zzso zzso levels were affected by the exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in males increased at 1 day after zzso administration of zzso but decreased in the subsequent 5 zzso However, plasma zzso levels remained high for 5 days after administration, suggesting that the zzso period of plasma zzso is longer than that of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a suitable indicator of zzso exposure to zzso chemicals in the environment, whereas plasma zzso is useful to detect consecutive zzso
