Two groups of subspecies of the door snail zzso zzso are distributed in a mosaic pattern in the Southern zzso Some subspecies that zzso resemble zzso zzso occur at exposed rocks at higher zzso whereas other subspecies live on more humid rocks at lower zzso This pattern can be explained by two alternative zzso Either the zzso or zzso subspecies have a common origin and represent zzso of an early colonization wave that survived the ice ages in isolated mountain zzso within the zzso or the geographically isolated zzso subspecies evolved through parallel adaptation of zzso populations to life on exposed zzso In this study, the first hypothesis could be supported by several lines of zzso zzso of amplified zzso length zzso zzso data indicated a common origin of the zzso subspecies of the zzso zzso and of the zzso subspecies of the zzso and zzso zzso whereas an zzso analysis detected only few zzso markers that might be under zzso High zzso zzso distances between subspecies suggest that the divergence of the subspecies predates at least most of the zzso The zzso of the zzso subspecies are concentrated in mountain areas that were not zzso during the Last zzso zzso The genetic differentiation and the isolated distribution areas of the zzso subspecies indicate that they survived in five separate mountain zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso populations from different valleys indicates a low-altitude zzso
