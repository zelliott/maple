We studied zzso zzso levels to synthetic peptides zzso E11 and zzso from zzso nuclear zzso zzso protein sequence in zzso of patients with zzso arthritis zzso in zzso and in zzso factor zzso positive zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly elevated in zzso zzso compared with both zzso negative and zzso positive zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were lower than those in zzso zzso zzso followup samples of patients with zzso had slightly decreased levels of zzso and zzso zzso compared with samples taken within 6 months of the disease zzso zzso zzso levels did not differ significantly between any of the groups zzso Thus, elevated levels of zzso to 2 of the zzso containing zzso peptides were associated with clinical zzso
