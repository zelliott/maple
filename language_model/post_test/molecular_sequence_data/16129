A zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso of mouse cells has been cloned and zzso The zzso sequence contains an open reading frame sufficient to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso which is close to the apparent size of the largest species of DNA zzso found in mouse zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso protein sequence shows striking similarities to bacterial type II DNA zzso zzso and appears to represent a zzso zzso zzso The zzso portion of the zzso may be involved in regulating the activity of the zzso zzso domain, since zzso directed against a zzso sequence located within this region zzso zzso activity in zzso A zzso base DNA zzso zzso was found to be expressed in all mouse cell types tested, and cell lines known to have different zzso zzso patterns were found to contain DNA zzso proteins of similar or identical sizes and de zzso sequence zzso The implications of these findings for an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of zzso patterns are zzso
