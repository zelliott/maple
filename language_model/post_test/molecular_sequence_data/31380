A zzso zzso zzso that specifically recognizes a zzso zzso was used to isolate a zzso insert that codes for the zzso zzso zzso sequencing of this zzso as well as a longer zzso zzso zzso shows that they are composed of zzso zzso + zzso tandem repeating zzso The coding strand was determined and codes for a zzso zzso repeat zzso A comparison of the highly zzso repeat unit with the deduced zzso zzso acid sequences demonstrates conservation of specific zzso of the repeat consensus within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso probe with zzso extracted from a variety of primary and zzso human tumors yields relatively high levels of hybrid with the breast zzso as compared to lower hybrid levels with zzso from other zzso zzso zzso extracted from breast tissue adjacent to the tumor or from benign breast tumors, demonstrates low or zzso levels of zzso zzso Southern blots with the zzso repeat shows that the tumor zzso is highly zzso and contains a variable number of tandem repeats zzso The zzso nature of the gene was confirmed by probing Southern blots with unique zzso sequences that are physically linked to an isolated gene zzso that also contains the tandem repeat zzso Mouse cells zzso with this gene zzso produce tumor zzso that is readily detected by zzso zzso zzso The zzso forms seen in 10 different primary human tumors demonstrate zzso zzso with the various zzso species zzso These studies are extended to the protein forms detected by zzso analyses that show both a correlation of the expressed tumor zzso species with the zzso forms as well as significantly increased expression in breast cancer zzso The above studies unequivocally establish the zzso of a zzso gene coding for an zzso tumor zzso in human breast cancer zzso
