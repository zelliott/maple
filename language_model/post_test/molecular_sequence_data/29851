The structures of the zzso zzso of zzso which is a taste zzso zzso isolated from miracle zzso berries of zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso were released from the protein by zzso zzso zzso The reducing ends of the zzso chains thus obtained were zzso with a fluorescent zzso zzso and the mixture of zzso derivatives of the zzso was separated by high performance liquid zzso zzso on an zzso zzso More than five kinds of zzso zzso were separated by the one zzso zzso The structure of each zzso thus isolated was analyzed by a combination of sequential zzso zzso and another kind of zzso with an zzso zzso Furthermore, high resolution zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso were carried zzso It was found that 1) five zzso obtained are a series of compounds with zzso common structural core, zzso beta zzso zzso alpha zzso Man beta zzso beta zzso zzso 2) a variety of zzso structures are significant for two zzso sites, zzso and zzso and 3) two new zzso B and D, with unusual structures containing zzso zzso were zzso zzso see zzso
