The zzso tumor zzso gene fat encodes a large zzso that regulates growth and a form of tissue organization known as zzso cell polarity zzso Fat regulates growth via the zzso zzso pathway, which controls expression of genes promoting cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is highly zzso and is implicated in the regulation of zzso growth and cancer zzso zzso studies suggest that Fat activity is regulated by binding to another large zzso zzso zzso The tumor zzso discs overgrown zzso zzso I zzso also regulates zzso activity and zzso The zzso nature of how zzso zzso and zzso interact to regulate these pathways is poorly zzso Here we demonstrate that Fat is zzso to generate 450 zzso and 110 zzso fragments zzso and zzso zzso contains the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of Fat binds zzso and is zzso by zzso at multiple zzso zzso we show Fat forms zzso and that Fat zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso in zzso We propose that Ds regulates zzso zzso of Fat and zzso proteins to control Fat signaling in growth and zzso
