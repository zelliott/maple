We have genetically engineered the zzso zzso the zzso double zzso and the zzso triple zzso of the zzso zzso in extension of previously published work on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in which zzso had been exchanged for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso All these zzso carry modifications in the DNA binding zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso to zzso and characterized by zzso zzso All zzso have a very similar secondary structure zzso However, whereas the zzso zzso is not impaired in its capacity to form a zzso the zzso and zzso zzso have a very much decreased propensity to form a zzso or zzso depending on concentration as shown by gel zzso and zzso zzso This finding may explain the results of zzso focusing experiments which show that these two zzso have a considerably more basic zzso than expected for a protein in which an zzso zzso acid was replaced by a neutral zzso Furthermore, while zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso in an irreversible manner upon heating to 60 degrees C, the zzso zzso process as shown by circular zzso zzso is fully zzso with the zzso double zzso and the zzso triple zzso All zzso zzso zzso described here have a residual zzso activity with zzso zzso since zzso coli cells zzso the zzso proteins can only survive in the presence of zzso zzso The detailed analysis of the zzso activity and specificity of the zzso zzso proteins is the subject of the accompanying paper zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso paper in this zzso
