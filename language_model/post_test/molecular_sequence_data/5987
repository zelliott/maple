Human zzso factor zzso zzso which is one of the regulators of complement zzso zzso prevents complement zzso on zzso cell zzso resulting in a functional discrimination between self cells and invading zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and has been identified at the molecular level only in zzso We have isolated guinea pig zzso zzso clones from a zzso library and identified six different zzso All zzso the same four short consensus repeat zzso with zzso zzso acid sequence identity to human zzso but show zzso in the zzso zzso Alternative zzso of two optional zzso generates zzso zzso and zzso forms of guinea pig zzso and differential usage of zzso sites in the single zzso composed of internally zzso sequences generates variable zzso zzso Multiple zzso were expressed zzso in all zzso and cells zzso Similar zzso in the zzso region has been reported in human membrane zzso protein zzso another membrane inhibitor of the RCA zzso There seems to be a common ancestral sequence in zzso and zzso consisting of a zzso region, but obviously zzso occurred zzso indicating the importance of zzso of the zzso region for the effective regulation of complement zzso
