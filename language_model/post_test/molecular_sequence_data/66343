The gene zzso zzso associated protein A zzso is clustered with three zzso zzso zzso within the zzso island of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a zzso transcript of zzso 700 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso However, using the more sensitive zzso it was shown that zzso is zzso with the downstream zzso genes forming a zzso zzso This initial transcript is subsequently processed to give rise to a 700 zzso zzso transcript with a zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso and zzso transcripts have an average zzso of zzso zzso identical to that of the five zzso zzso zzso located upstream of the zzso zzso It is speculated that the need for differential gene expression arises from the different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the surface of the cell wall, whereas zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso The zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso two short zzso zzso zzso These zzso are zzso coupled to zzso and zzso in which the start zzso zzso the stop zzso of the preceding zzso
