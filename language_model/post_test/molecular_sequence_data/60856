A class C zzso from a clinical isolate of zzso zzso strain zzso with improved zzso activity for zzso zzso antibiotics has been analyzed by X-ray zzso to zzso A zzso Relative to the zzso zzso zzso this natural zzso contains a highly unique tandem repeat zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso 8000 in zzso zzso in space group zzso with cell dimensions a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, and c zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, and the model has been refined to an zzso of zzso for all zzso data from 8 to zzso zzso zzso of model bonds and angles from ideal values are zzso A and zzso degrees, zzso zzso of zzso atoms in the zzso and zzso zzso results in an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in a loop containing zzso and in the zzso loop region zzso where the three zzso zzso are zzso Possibly as a result of this disorder, the zzso of the opening to the zzso binding zzso as measured from the zzso zzso to two zzso containing zzso and zzso on the other side, is zzso A wider than in zzso It is suggested that zzso flexibility in the expanded zzso loop, and its influence on adjacent protein structure, may facilitate zzso of zzso zzso by making the zzso intermediate more open to attack by zzso Nevertheless, backbone atoms in core zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only zzso A zzso from atoms in zzso A rotation of a potential zzso base, zzso relative to zzso at pH 8, is consistent with the requirement for a lower than normal zzso for this zzso
