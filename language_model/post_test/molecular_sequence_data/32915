zzso fluid zzso is a potential source of zzso for many disorders which may occur during zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the place of two-dimensional gel zzso zzso technologies to compare zzso in both normal and pathological zzso zzso zzso difference gel zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as two-dimensional gel zzso and silver zzso followed by image analysis were zzso zzso expressed proteins were identified by mass zzso This approach was used to study zzso of normal zzso obtained at 17 weeks of gestation and at term, as well as zzso from fetuses presenting with zzso zzso zzso Finally, the potential of two-dimensional zzso was assessed by studying the protein profile of plasma containing zzso proteins in a model of premature zzso of the zzso zzso Our results clearly show that two-dimensional zzso technologies still have place for analyzing biological zzso such as zzso
