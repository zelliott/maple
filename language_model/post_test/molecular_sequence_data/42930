zzso zzso and a shortened synthetic zzso with the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso are specific zzso zzso which in a zzso manner inhibit zzso formation as well as zzso propagation both in zzso and in zzso In comparison to the zzso lower zzso zzso of zzso affected doubling of zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso activity or zzso zzso zzso in zzso In the rat wire zzso zzso model, a 50% zzso effect may be brought about with doses of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso However, doubling of bleeding times is caused, on average, by zzso of between zzso and zzso zzso zzso or approximately zzso zzso of the zzso Treatment groups included animals revealing significant zzso of bleeding times as well as zzso Despite the zzso longer impact on zzso after application of zzso the extent of mean bleeding time zzso is identical to that of the zzso
