zzso cells lacking a functional zzso gene show progressive zzso of the terminal zzso zzso repeats and a parallel increase in the frequency of cell zzso Although the majority of the cells in an zzso culture die, a minor zzso survives the potentially lethal consequences of the zzso zzso We show that these zzso survivors arise as a result of the amplification and acquisition of zzso elements (and their deletion zzso by a large number of zzso zzso even when the primary zzso for zzso replication is zzso an alternative backup zzso can restore zzso function and keep the cell zzso
