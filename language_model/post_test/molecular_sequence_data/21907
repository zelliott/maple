In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are replaced by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso of zzso is widespread among bacteria, but it also occurs in a few zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso We zzso two genes for zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and found evidence for zzso in zzso zzso and other zzso where this zzso was thought to be zzso The zzso and zzso genes may be related to one another, but those of zzso and perhaps zzso are distinct and more closely related to bacterial zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso is more widespread in zzso than previously thought, zzso from the zzso coexists with zzso more often than previously thought and may be spread by lateral transfer of genes for zzso zzso from zzso
