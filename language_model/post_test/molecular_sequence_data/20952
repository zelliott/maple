The characterization of candidate zzso is a critical step in obtaining insight into adaptation and zzso of zzso In this study of two zzso tropical (to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we characterized both coding and zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso a locus which exhibits zzso differences among temperate and zzso populations of the North American zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso in length in zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with coding regions zzso zzso zzso in both zzso A high level of sequence zzso existed between species for both coding and zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso acid sequence zzso All six known functional sites within the zzso protein sequence zzso were zzso between the two zzso zzso Ten simple sequence repeat zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso and zzso and thirty putative zzso elements zzso were identified within zzso 1, 2, 5 and 6 of both zzso zzso Five single zzso zzso zzso were also identified within zzso containing zzso zzso Such zzso are implicated in several complex human conditions and/or diseases (as demonstrated by extensive zzso association zzso This novel characterization serves as a platform to further examine how zzso species may respond to changes in their native temperatures, which are expected to increase by up to 6 degrees C over the next zzso
