During bone and zzso zzso the crystal nucleation and growth processes are considered to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso which forms a template for zzso initiation and zzso zzso and controlled reaction between type I collagen and zzso zzso proteins are necessary for well defined zzso crystal zzso However, the process by which collagen surfaces become zzso is not zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is an zzso zzso protein expressed during the initial stages of zzso zzso formation in bone and zzso Here we show that zzso bound specifically to type I zzso with the binding region located at the zzso region of type I zzso zzso mapping identified two zzso clusters in zzso responsible for interacting with type I zzso The collagen binding property of these zzso was further confirmed by zzso zzso zzso electron zzso analyses have localized zzso in the gap region of the collagen zzso zzso zzso further demonstrated that zzso accelerated the assembly of the collagen zzso in zzso and also increased the diameter of the zzso collagen zzso In zzso zzso studies in the presence of calcium and zzso zzso demonstrated zzso deposition only at the zzso zzso zzso Thus specific binding of zzso and possibly other zzso proteins on the collagen zzso might be a key step in collagen zzso organization and zzso
