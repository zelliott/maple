The binding activity of a novel zzso gene promoter zzso protein zzso to the zzso sequence of the rat zzso gene promoter region was zzso The expression of zzso zzso was seen in the liver zzso of male and female zzso The sexual difference of this expression was not zzso Liver zzso zzso expression was not changed with increasing age zzso weeks zzso and its expression was not altered by zzso or zzso Nuclear factor zzso zzso has been identified to be a zzso factor in stimulating the rat zzso gene promoter activity zzso and zzso zzso J Cell zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso proteins were used gel mobility shift zzso zzso could not bind to zzso motif of the sequence between zzso and zzso which has been defined as a functional promoter element zzso zzso was specifically bound to the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was not bound to the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso or rat liver nuclear zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso zzso was not altered in the presence of zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso is expressed zzso for zzso change in rat liver, and that zzso the protein does not directly bind to the zzso motif in rat zzso gene zzso
