zzso tolerance in zzso is disrupted by zzso in zzso a zzso protein zzso which is required for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Five zzso zzso were isolated by selecting for zzso of zzso zzso and mapped to the zzso zzso zzso the plasma membrane zzso One zzso zzso which has the single zzso acid change zzso zzso zzso at a highly zzso site within the zzso domain of the zzso was analyzed in detail to determine the mechanism of zzso zzso After exposure to zzso in the culture zzso zzso influx in the zzso zzso was reduced zzso relative to control, consistent with a similar decrease in zzso zzso zzso of zzso from intact cells was relatively unchanged in the zzso zzso However, selective zzso of the plasma membrane revealed that zzso cells retained up to zzso of zzso zzso within a slowly exchanging zzso We show that zzso a novel gene zzso to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso in zzso and contributes to the zzso zzso of zzso
