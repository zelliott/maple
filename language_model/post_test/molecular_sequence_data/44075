The human zzso dominant zzso disorder zzso muscular zzso zzso is associated with deletions within a complex tandem DNA repeat zzso on zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanism underlying this association of zzso with DNA zzso is unknown, and, thus far, no gene has been identified within the zzso We isolated a gene mapping 100 zzso zzso to zzso zzso Region Gene zzso but were unable to detect any zzso in total or zzso zzso levels of zzso in zzso zzso Human zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso with the region of mouse zzso 8 containing the gene for the zzso zzso zzso a possible mouse zzso of zzso We report the cloning of the mouse gene zzso and show that it maps to mouse zzso zzso Using a cross segregating the zzso zzso and the European Collaborative zzso zzso we showed that zzso maps zzso to the zzso locus and to the zzso and zzso zzso
