The zzso locus plays a central role in zzso phenomena, where the synaptic pairing of zzso carrying genes with which zzso interacts influences the expression of these zzso To explore the possible functions of the zzso gene product in this process, we have determined the DNA sequences both of a zzso of zzso zzso DNA capable of rescuing zzso zzso zzso and of a near full-length zzso clone derived from the zzso zzso zzso These data show that the zzso gene is interrupted by two small zzso and suggest that the majority of zzso sequences are contained within an zzso of another zzso unit of opposite zzso A large region of the predicted zzso product is comprised almost exclusively of zzso and zzso zzso A domain near the N zzso of this zzso which is sufficient for zzso DNA zzso is highly charged, as is the zzso region of the zzso A zzso of the zzso In zzso which is associated with a zzso zzso is found within sequences zzso the zzso product, and would produce a truncated zzso The zzso zzso zzso is correlated with a zzso deletion of sequences determining the untranslated zzso leader of the zzso messenger, but may also remove the initiating zzso zzso resulting in a zzso protein with an altered N zzso
