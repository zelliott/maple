zzso region 1 zzso of the zzso C virus zzso zzso was directly zzso from 12 chronically infected patients who had not responded to zzso zzso zzso Due to the zzso nature of zzso circulating zzso serum samples from four patients showing different evolutionary characteristics were further zzso zzso samples from each patient were taken before, soon after and zzso months after a 6 month zzso zzso zzso from each sample was zzso cloned and the clones zzso For each patient, a zzso analysis of the clones was performed and zzso complexity and genetic distances were zzso The zzso acid sequences and predicted zzso profiles were zzso The zzso samples of the different patients presented dissimilar genetic zzso zzso For three of the patients, we showed that, regardless of the complexity or diversity of the viral populations before treatment, they evolved towards genetic diversification following selective zzso Once the environment became stable, the entire population tended towards zzso The fourth patient represented a case where different components of the zzso zzso for long periods without zzso We propose zzso that the evolution of zzso of zzso is more likely to be directed by selection of clearly different zzso zzso of zzso zzso than by a continuous mechanism related to the successive zzso of point zzso The prevalence of a zzso shift mechanism was revealed by the cloning analysis during the follow-up period of the evolutionary zzso
