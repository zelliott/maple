zzso have the largest number of zzso zzso genes of all species so far studied but have a single gene for zzso which occurs in two zzso forms that differ in hinge zzso zzso also have constant region genes for C zzso and C zzso but lack a gene zzso to that which encodes zzso in zzso and zzso despite the otherwise high degree of sequence similarity of all other zzso zzso genes with those of zzso zzso have zzso 20 zzso zzso a single zzso and perhaps a limited number of zzso zzso zzso zzso show preferential zzso and zzso usage and may use gene conversion as a mechanism for expanding their zzso zzso Despite the close similarity of their zzso gene sequences to humans, zzso belong to the group of animals that includes zzso chickens and cattle when classified on the basis of B cell zzso This group, unlike zzso and humans, have a single zzso family, use zzso zzso early in life (rather than bone zzso throughout life) to diversify their zzso repertoire and probably all use gene zzso It is proposed that zzso may serve a function in repertoire development in zzso and humans which is unnecessary in the zzso zzso The diversity of zzso and zzso genes among species justifies the quest of veterinary zzso to define the system for their species of interest rather than making extrapolations from mouse and human immune zzso
