In the zzso seminal plasma zzso proteins bind to zzso lipids containing the zzso group and mediate the zzso effects of zzso zzso during zzso residence in the female zzso zzso We report the characterization of zzso and zzso proteins of zzso and zzso seminal zzso zzso seminal plasma proteins zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso belong to the same family as the bull zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso We have determined the zzso acid sequence and zzso modifications of zzso zzso zzso It contains 105 zzso acids arranged into a mosaic structure consisting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by two zzso organized zzso zzso type II zzso zzso displays zzso zzso acid sequence similarity with its zzso and bovine zzso However, in their respective seminal zzso the zzso and the zzso proteins associate into zzso zzso complexes, whereas zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso zzso In addition, zzso appears to be identical to the recently described zzso zzso regulator of zzso seminal fluid zzso Our results tie in with the hypothesis that zzso proteins from different zzso species may display distinct biological activities, which may be related to zzso aspects of zzso zzso
