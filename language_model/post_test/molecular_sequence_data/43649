zzso zzso syndromes are a group of rare genetic disorders that compromise zzso zzso A subset of these disorders, the zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso is zzso inherited and has been shown to involve zzso within the muscle zzso zzso zzso We have identified three new zzso zzso and a further familial case of the alpha zzso zzso Single channel recordings from zzso and zzso human zzso expressed in zzso zzso demonstrate that each zzso zzso channel zzso zzso The novel zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso are in different functional zzso of the zzso alpha zzso Whereas alpha zzso is in the zzso region, like five of six previously reported zzso zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso are in zzso zzso alpha zzso lies within the short zzso sequence between zzso and zzso and identifies a new region of muscle zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso although located close to alpha zzso which has been shown to increase zzso binding zzso appears to alter channel function through a different molecular zzso Our results demonstrate zzso in the zzso indicate new regions of the zzso involved in zzso zzso gating and highlight the potential role of zzso outside the zzso regions in altering channel function in other zzso channel zzso
