zzso of zzso zzso the first zzso complex of the zzso respiratory chain, is one of the most frequent causes of human zzso zzso A relatively small percentage of human complex I zzso is associated with zzso DNA zzso zzso characterization and zzso analysis of the structural complex I genes in 19 complex zzso patients, in whom common zzso zzso have been zzso has so far revealed five patients with zzso in evolutionary zzso zzso zzso In order to complete our knowledge about the expected 36 structural nuclear complex I zzso we characterized the zzso and the zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso fraction of the zzso zzso we screened all zzso of this fraction for the presence of zzso in those 14 patients of our initial patient cohort in whom the underlying genetic cause had not been zzso zzso no zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso that would explain the complex I zzso in our zzso Other strategies are needed to unravel proteins involved in the zzso of the complicated cellular network of zzso until correct zzso of complex zzso
