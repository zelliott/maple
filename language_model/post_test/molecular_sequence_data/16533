zzso of zzso requires two highly related zzso named zzso and zzso that share identity in the nature and positioning of their structural zzso Despite their zzso the zzso are functionally zzso and we therefore sought to identify any structural features specific for zzso or zzso We performed zzso analysis, and we identified a region resembling a zzso domain zzso that exists only in zzso and that we named the zzso domain zzso zzso of the zzso rendered zzso zzso inactive and unable to induce zzso activity, and zzso of only the zzso zzso inhibited tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso The zzso could not be functionally replaced within zzso by zzso or the corresponding region of zzso whereas deletion of the equivalent section of zzso did not affect its zzso activity against zzso or its zzso by zzso zzso We identified five zzso zzso among the larger family of zzso proteins and zzso and zzso scanning revealed that the zzso at position 353 zzso is absolutely critical for zzso zzso zzso Most zzso the zzso zzso was zzso active but, unlike zzso zzso formed a stable complex with the zzso zzso zzso Our findings therefore establish the zzso as a critical functional domain specific for zzso that might play a role in zzso zzso from zzso
