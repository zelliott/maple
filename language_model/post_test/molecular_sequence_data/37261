In the heat shock response of zzso cells, zzso zzso proteins zzso control the expression of the major heat shock zzso the zzso and zzso zzso by binding the zzso zzso zzso repeat of zzso zzso zzso Studies on two critical but yet unresolved issues related to the structure and function of zzso were performed using mainly the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These two critical issues are zzso identifying the region at which zzso binds to the zzso element and zzso determining whether zzso can play the role of a zzso We identified the position of a zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso zzso which is typical of zzso zzso and indicated that two zzso in the zzso motif are crucial for the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we compared the zzso of the zzso complexes derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso which grow at vastly different ranges of zzso The zzso profiles of their zzso complexes were quite consistent with the difference in the growth temperatures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and, thus, suggested that zzso can function as a zzso to detect temperature changes in zzso
