Milk composition traits exhibit a complex genetic architecture with a small number of major quantitative trait zzso zzso explaining a large fraction of the genetic variation and numerous zzso with minor zzso In order to identify zzso for milk fat percentage zzso in the German zzso zzso population, a zzso association study zzso was zzso The study population consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso were available for zzso zzso zzso in the form of estimated breeding values zzso for zzso were used as highly zzso zzso A zzso zzso approach was used to account for population zzso The zzso identified four major zzso regions explaining zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Besides two previously known zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso and zzso respectively, we uncovered two additional zzso regions on zzso zzso and zzso zzso encompassing zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso metabolism in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso revealed 50 zzso zzso for five of them were zzso for the entire study zzso Two zzso affecting potential zzso factor binding sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were highly significantly associated with the zzso zzso Our results provide evidence that zzso of regulatory sites is an important aspect of genetic variation of complex traits in zzso
