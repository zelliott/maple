The zzso zzso channel zzso gene family has been implicated in zzso zzso transport within various zzso zzso We report here the zzso zzso and cellular characterization of a new member of this gene family termed zzso zzso was isolated from extracts of zzso zzso as a component of a zzso complex consisting of several known zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We cloned human zzso and generated zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso zzso shares zzso overall identity with human zzso zzso zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso has a distinct pattern of expression compared with zzso and zzso zzso analysis of extracts from zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso are enriched in isolated zzso zzso whereas zzso is zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are concentrated within the zzso region of the zzso whereas zzso is distributed throughout the zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso and zzso play distinct roles in zzso transport and that zzso interacts with the cortical zzso zzso in polarized zzso zzso
