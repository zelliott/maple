We have examined the expression profile of selected zzso zzso zzso in 11 human zzso Among zzso full-length zzso clones zzso as zzso transcripts in the zzso database, we chose 150 clones for further analysis based on their gene structure and zzso zzso zzso profiling using quantitative zzso and Northern zzso zzso revealed that the majority of the selected zzso exhibited tissue zzso zzso are predominantly expressed in a restricted subset of zzso The absolute zzso of representative zzso revealed that the majority of zzso are expressed as low abundance zzso A comparative zzso analysis revealed that only zzso of the selected zzso have mouse zzso Since the expression patterns of the human zzso having no mouse counterparts remain to be similar to those of the mouse zzso the expression patterns of the selected zzso may be zzso between human and zzso
