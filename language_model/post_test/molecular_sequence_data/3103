zzso of nine zzso zzso of zzso zzso with decreased salt tolerance zzso allowed the identification of eight gene zzso required for adaptation to high external zzso Most of the genes also were involved in adaptation to zzso media and were required to overcome the toxicity of zzso According to their possible functions, genes identified could be classified into three zzso The first group included two genes involved in regulation of gene zzso such as zzso the sensor element of the bacterial zzso zzso regulatory system involved in regulation of nitrogen zzso and zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso The second group included genes related to zzso zzso or maturation of zzso such as zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso which encodes a molecular zzso and a zzso zzso probably zzso a zzso zzso involved in the maturation of zzso zzso Genes related with cellular zzso and maintenance were in the third group, such as a zzso zzso a zzso zzso likely involved in zzso zzso and zzso specifying an zzso protein involved in zzso zzso Another gene was identified that had no zzso to known genes but that could be zzso in other zzso When zzso on zzso zzso growing under zzso conditions, all zzso zzso displayed severe symbiotic zzso zzso and zzso zzso were impaired in zzso and the remaining zzso formed zzso with very reduced zzso zzso The results suggest that bacterial ability to adapt to zzso and salt stress is important for the zzso zzso function inside the zzso zzso and provide genetic evidence supporting the suggestion that zzso face severe environmental changes after their release into plant zzso
