The orphan zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and its activity is zzso by another orphan zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this repression by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed the necessity of three zzso motifs in zzso for interaction with and repression of zzso In zzso pull-down experiments confirmed that zzso interacts with zzso and also with zzso zzso The target specificity of the zzso motifs was indicated by the observations that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fly zzso zzso zzso through their zzso binding zzso with all the zzso motifs in zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso did zzso zzso activities of the receptors whose DNA binding zzso zzso were replaced by the zzso zzso were zzso by zzso to various levels, which correlated with the strength of zzso zzso acid zzso revealed that zzso and zzso zzso interact with zzso motifs containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso of zzso motifs in zzso based on their zzso acid sequences play an important role in regulation of orphan zzso
