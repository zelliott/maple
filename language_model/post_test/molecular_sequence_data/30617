The zzso which is now called zzso zzso has emerged as a major systemic alarm signal produced by essentially every injured tissue in response to almost every kind of zzso The hallmark of zzso gene regulation is its induction in many different zzso by zzso zzso bacterial products, virus infection and by zzso of any of the three major signal zzso pathways zzso zzso and zzso Many of these zzso act largely through a 23 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Different zzso zzso multiple zzso modified forms of zzso (six protein species in the size range 23 to 30 zzso and additional forms of size greater than or equal to 45 zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso a variety of host zzso mechanisms that are aimed at limiting tissue zzso Thus, zzso elicits major changes in the zzso zzso and zzso status of the host zzso the zzso zzso plasma protein zzso zzso enhances plasma protein gene expression not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso are observed in body zzso during acute and chronic infections, zzso and zzso zzso The nature of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, the different signal zzso pathways involved in the regulation of particular liver genes by zzso the association between zzso levels in body zzso and clinical outcome and between zzso zzso and specific disease states remain to be explored in zzso
