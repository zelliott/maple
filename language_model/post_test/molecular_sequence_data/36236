Type 2 helper T cell zzso clone has been reported to zzso zzso zzso 4 and zzso in response to the specific zzso presented by zzso zzso zzso In the present report, we zzso zzso analogue of an zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and tested its ability to inhibit zzso production from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence of 100 zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso biologically using zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso B cells, zzso When zzso zzso zzso was added to the culture, zzso production from zzso was suppressed by zzso The same zzso of zzso inhibited neither the zzso proliferation of zzso nor the zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso These results suggest that this zzso is useful for zzso the production of zzso zzso without affecting other functions of zzso zzso
