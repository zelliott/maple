The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene has been zzso The zzso deduced from the DNA sequence contains zzso zzso acids and has a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments located the zzso start point and possible zzso termination zzso The zzso and zzso acid sequences for the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso genes were zzso The zzso sequences show zzso identity, and the zzso acid sequences show zzso zzso In zzso zzso there is an absence of zzso sequences between the translation termination site and the proposed zzso termination site that are present in the zzso coli zzso A zzso sequence is found in both organisms extending from 79 to 117 zzso upstream of the consensus zzso sequences of the zzso zzso This zzso sequence shows zzso to a sequence preceding the zzso zzso zzso gene determined to bind the zzso regulatory zzso
