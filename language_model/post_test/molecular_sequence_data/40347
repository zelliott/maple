Since the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has not previously been investigated by zzso methods, this approach was applied to two most common zzso zzso (red zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Model samples included grapes, initial must, middle zzso must and must in the zzso zzso The cultured zzso were characterized by length zzso of zzso zzso two region using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and some were identified by zzso The microbial DNA extracted directly from the samples without zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The use of universal zzso zzso led to detection of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of highest intensity and present in all the samples corresponded to zzso zzso Other species demonstrated by both approaches included zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso enological zzso was suggested on the level of minor genetic variations of the known species and probably not accounting for novel zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso over zzso zzso in the samples was zzso This is the first zzso study of zzso zzso and the first time zzso zzso profiling was used on zzso microbial zzso
