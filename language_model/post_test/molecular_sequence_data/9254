zzso acids zzso are complex zzso of zzso acids found in weathered crude oils and oil zzso and are toxic, corrosive and zzso However, little is known about the zzso and mechanisms involved in zzso zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso with zzso zzso zzso gene sequence identity to zzso zzso which zzso synthetic zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso was readily oxidized with almost complete degradation zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by day zzso Cell counts increased fourfold by day 14 but decreased after day 14 for both zzso and zzso At day 14, zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso Additional zzso produced during zzso degradation were identified by mass zzso of derivatives as zzso acid and zzso zzso suggesting that strain zzso used omega zzso of zzso to zzso the zzso zzso to produce zzso acid, as the primary route for zzso However, strain zzso also produced this zzso through initial omega zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso followed by zzso of the zzso acid zzso In conclusion, an isolate belonging to the zzso zzso zzso highly zzso aromatic zzso via two different zzso
