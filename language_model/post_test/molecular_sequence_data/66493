In addition to zzso of zzso zzso D zzso catalyze the head group zzso The molecular basis of this zzso potential, which strongly varies for zzso from different sources, is unknown zzso Recently, the genes of two zzso zzso from white cabbage have been zzso and expressed in zzso coli, yielding the basis for zzso zzso In the present paper, three sequence characteristics of the zzso zzso that zzso to the often used zzso isolated from cabbage leaves have been zzso for their importance in zzso as well as zzso activities: zzso the two zzso zzso zzso the C zzso and zzso the eight zzso zzso All these regions or zzso acids are highly zzso in zzso plant zzso Based on multiple zzso predictions of secondary structure and comparisons of zzso profiles, 35 zzso zzso were created and zzso All positions tested proved to be very sensitive towards zzso acid exchanges with respect to zzso activity in the absence of zzso as well as to the ratio of zzso and zzso activities in the presence of zzso A significant increase of total activity and zzso activity could be obtained by the zzso zzso and zzso
