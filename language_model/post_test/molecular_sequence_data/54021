Cloning procedures aided by zzso searches of zzso databases have accelerated the pace of discovery of new zzso but zzso database searching remains an involved and onerous zzso More than zzso million human zzso sequences have been deposited in public databases, making it difficult to identify zzso that represent new zzso Compounding the problems of scale are difficulties in detection associated with a high sequencing error rate and low sequence similarity between distant zzso We have developed a new method, zzso zzso searches with a domain identification zzso that filters candidate zzso Application of this method in a large-scale analysis of 100 zzso domain families has led to the identification of zzso representing more than 1,000 novel human zzso zzso The zzso publicly available zzso representing these genes are a valuable resource for rapid cloning of novel human zzso zzso For example, we were able to identify zzso of at least 106 new small zzso of which 6 are likely to belong to new zzso In some cases, further analyses of zzso DNA led to the discovery of previously unidentified full-length protein zzso This is exemplified by the in zzso cloning zzso of a gene product sequence using only zzso and zzso sequence zzso of a new type of zzso with two zzso zzso
