Four G zzso cloned from zzso zzso coli zzso were examined for binding to zzso and various zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed virtually identical binding patterns to Gal alpha zzso zzso while zzso differed slightly and zzso markedly with respect to the effect of zzso groups on the zzso Their zzso patterns confirmed the existence of three zzso zzso While the zzso zzso bound to zzso cells from man zzso but not to those from the dog zzso zzso the reverse was true of zzso These binding patterns were largely explained by the absence or presence of appropriate zzso zzso although the inability of the zzso zzso to bind zzso II cells was attributed to an inappropriate presentation of their zzso zzso The high prevalence of zzso zzso observed among zzso dog zzso zzso coli zzso together with the determined zzso composition of human and dog kidney target zzso suggest variation in zzso specificity as a mechanism for shifting host zzso and that this variation has evolved in response to the topography of the host cellular zzso The zzso half proposed for the predicted zzso acid sequences of the four G zzso and the corresponding zzso of one of the dog zzso coli zzso varied considerably among the three zzso groups of zzso but only little within each zzso
