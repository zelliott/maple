zzso zzso is a zzso DNA binding zzso Random zzso and a selection for zzso activity have been used to identify the contacts between zzso zzso that are crucial for maintenance of a zzso folded zzso To obtain equivalent contacts in a zzso system, a zzso zzso was designed and constructed in which the zzso zzso that forms the zzso interface was replaced by a zzso The engineered zzso has a folded structure similar to wild type, is significantly more stable than wild type, and exhibits novel zzso binding zzso
