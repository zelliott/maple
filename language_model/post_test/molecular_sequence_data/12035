The indirect zzso zzso chain reaction (in zzso zzso combines the potential sensitivity of the zzso chain reaction zzso with the high specificity and zzso preservation of in zzso zzso zzso This study describes a method for the amplification of small, specific zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso base pairs zzso within large zzso zzso tissue zzso A zzso glue surrounds the section, creating a well which contains a relatively large volume of zzso reaction solution without a covering mineral oil zzso this zzso zzso preservation, permits the evaluation of large zzso and allows both zzso steps and up to 40 cycles of in zzso zzso to be performed, whilst progressively concentrating the reaction solution by evaporation during zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso DNA probe with specificity for zzso with or without prior in zzso zzso amplification, both for samples on slides zzso and zzso and in suspension zzso zzso on slides were evaluated by both blinded studies and image analysis, comparing the intensity of signal zzso zzso zzso and the numbers of positive cells detected zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso in suspension were zzso by blinded studies on zzso and by gel zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso amplification was achieved in this high copy zzso
