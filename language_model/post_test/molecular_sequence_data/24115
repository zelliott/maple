We consider a zzso zzso fast experiment to identify important zzso constraints in folding small zzso proteins of about zzso zzso zzso In this experiment, proteins are expanded mechanically along a path of zzso increase in the free space around zzso The pathways are often consistent with folding scenarios reported in zzso experiments and most accurately describe obligatory or mechanic folding zzso The results suggest that certain zzso zzso in proteins lead to zzso zzso favorable channels down their free energy zzso
