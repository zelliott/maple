zzso plays an important role in the evolution of many zzso such as zzso or zzso Despite substantial prior work, there is still a pressing need for efficient and effective methods of detecting zzso and analyzing zzso zzso 

We introduce zzso a novel fast method that, given a multiple sequence zzso scores the cost of obtaining one of the sequences from the others by zzso and zzso The zzso comes with an illustrative zzso tool for locating zzso zzso We analyze the sequence alignment with respect to all choices of the zzso alpha weighting zzso cost against zzso zzso The analysis of the resulting cost curve yields additional information as to which sequence might be zzso On random zzso zzso is comparable in its power of detecting zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso For specific relevant zzso scenarios zzso significantly zzso zzso
