zzso zzso such as zzso zzso are zzso zzso that initiate zzso formation on tooth zzso An isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso in an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of zzso of zzso zzso a putative maturation factor of nitrous oxide zzso Located downstream are two zzso zzso and zzso predicted to zzso two putative zzso zzso zzso These three genes are zzso forming a putative zzso stress response zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso of zzso measured by the zzso activity of the zzso zzso was zzso dependent and enhanced when grown under zzso conditions or in the presence of zzso zzso reverse zzso revealed that zzso zzso levels were increased approximately zzso and zzso fold in zzso cells grown on plastic and glass, respectively, when compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso fold in cells grown under zzso zzso conditions and zzso fold in cells grown under zzso zzso zzso Two zzso immediately adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was also significantly increased in cells grown under zzso and zzso zzso conditions when compared to zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression was increased in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso These genes may be part of an island that deals with zzso response, some of which may be important in zzso zzso zzso zzso
