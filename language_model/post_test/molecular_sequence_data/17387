zzso zzso zzso is capable of degrading zzso aromatic zzso zzso to ring zzso zzso This study identified and characterized a putative zzso degradation zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A putative regulatory protein zzso was zzso zzso with five tandem zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso containing these genes was cloned into zzso coli and converted zzso to zzso zzso to the zzso region were detected in a number of zzso zzso zzso isolated from various geographical zzso The zzso differs from those of other zzso bacteria in both the placement and orientation of the regulatory zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains no zzso gene and none was identified within a 37 zzso region containing the zzso This study is the first report of a zzso degradation zzso in zzso zzso
