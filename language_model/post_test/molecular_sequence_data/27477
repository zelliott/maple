zzso targeting in zzso cells is vital for cell survival and zzso zzso signal peptides guide proteins to the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso and initiate zzso into the zzso zzso Here, we review the status of signal zzso architecture and prediction with an emphasis on exceptionally long signal zzso which often escape the notion of the currently available prediction zzso We benchmark publicly available prediction methods for their ability to correctly identify exceptionally long signal zzso A set of 136 zzso zzso signals served as reference zzso The best prediction tool detected only zzso A potential reason for the poor performance is the domain architecture of long signal zzso whose structural peculiarities are insufficiently considered by current prediction zzso To overcome this zzso we motivate a general domain view of long signal zzso which becomes zzso when both the overall length and secondary structure of long signal peptides are taken into zzso This concept provides a structural framework for identifying and understanding multiple targeting and zzso zzso
