Clear cell zzso zzso usually arises in the lower zzso of young adults and is typically associated with a zzso zzso resulting in the fusion of zzso zzso with zzso a gene zzso a member of the zzso zzso element binding protein zzso family of zzso zzso zzso arising in the gastrointestinal tract is rare and its zzso and molecular features are not well zzso 

We report a novel zzso fusion of zzso to zzso a gene at zzso zzso another zzso family member highly related to zzso detected in three women with gastrointestinal zzso All three cases contained an identical zzso fusion transcript that was shown by reverse zzso In two of the cases tested, zzso gene zzso was also confirmed by zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso junction fragments were isolated by long-range DNA zzso 

zzso all three tumors lacked zzso zzso By zzso there was a strong and diffuse zzso protein zzso whereas all zzso markers were zzso zzso two of the cases lacked zzso The zzso transcript of zzso was absent in two cases, and only zzso expressed in the third zzso The zzso gene expression data available in one case showed lower expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso compared with four zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso may define a novel subset of zzso that occurs zzso in the gastrointestinal tract and shows little or no zzso zzso Thus, evidence of zzso lineage or differentiation is not a necessary feature of zzso with gene zzso involving zzso family zzso
