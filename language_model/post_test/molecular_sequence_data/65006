zzso biological studies confirmed that two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of distinct genetic origin are expressed in human zzso zzso is zzso and expressed widely, whereas zzso is zzso and specific for neural and zzso zzso A selective zzso of zzso has been reported in patients with zzso zzso We have identified an zzso acid zzso involved in the different zzso stability of human zzso zzso At 45 degrees C zzso zzso heat zzso proceeded faster for zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso however, showed much slower heat zzso processes in the presence of 1 zzso zzso or 3 zzso zzso Virtually most of the zzso activity remained up to 100 zzso at 45 degrees C after treatment with zzso and zzso in zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were not affected by addition of zzso or zzso In human zzso zzso the zzso site is zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso at the zzso site by cassette zzso abolished the heat zzso of zzso with a similar zzso of zzso The zzso at several other sites zzso zzso and zzso having differences in zzso acid sequence between the two zzso zzso did not show any change in the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso plays an important role in the different zzso stability of human zzso zzso
