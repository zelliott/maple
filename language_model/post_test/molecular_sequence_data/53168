Genes zzso zzso in 15 reference strains of zzso zzso zzso from the United Kingdom National Collection of Type zzso and in one recent clinical isolate were zzso All the strains zzso zzso but their levels of resistance to zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso ranging from 2 to zzso zzso The zzso zzso which encodes a zzso B zzso was detected in only six reference strains and in clinical isolate zzso The gene from zzso had zzso zzso identity with the published sequence of zzso (from strain zzso zzso and was designated zzso A distinct zzso zzso designated zzso was cloned from the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had an open reading frame of 750 zzso with zzso zzso identity to zzso and zzso and zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso including the putative signal zzso This zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected in one other reference strain besides zzso zzso but the genetic basis of the zzso activity detected in the other seven reference strains was not zzso Thus, neither zzso nor zzso was ubiquitous in the strains of zzso zzso zzso indicating that the reference strains may represent more than one bacterial species, each with its own intrinsic zzso Further zzso studies of zzso zzso are necessary to resolve this zzso zzso zzso are environmental organisms and occasional opportunist zzso They apparently represent a zzso of diverse zzso which potentially spread to zzso bacteria of greater clinical zzso
