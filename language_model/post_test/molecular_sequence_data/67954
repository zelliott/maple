We performed a comparative zzso analysis of protein expression profiles in 4 zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso cell line was used as a zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 50 were selected for further validation by zzso using a zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess their zzso value in this zzso Both zzso 1 and zzso zzso 50 were zzso in zzso zzso compared with normal liver zzso Of the 301 zzso cases, zzso of zzso 1 in 103 zzso was associated with an age-related effect in young patients zzso zzso zzso and the absence of zzso in zzso vessels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 50 correlated with zzso type, with 180 zzso of moderately or poorly differentiated tumors zzso zzso zzso being higher, and was associated with the presence of zzso in zzso and vascular vessels zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso The high expression of zzso zzso 50 and the low expression of zzso 1 correlated with reduced survival by zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the impact of zzso 1 and zzso zzso 50 expression on patient survival was an independent predictor in zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso altered expression of zzso 1 and zzso zzso 50 may be used as zzso markers in zzso
