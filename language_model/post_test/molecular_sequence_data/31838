zzso filaments from many muscles are activated by zzso of their regulatory light chains zzso zzso analysis of relaxed zzso thick filaments shows that the zzso of the interacting free and blocked zzso heads are in different zzso This and other data suggested a zzso mechanism in which zzso of the free head is exposed and zzso zzso by protein zzso C, whereas the blocked head is hidden and zzso on zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso the zzso free head followed by the zzso blocked head, both at zzso Our goal was to test this model of zzso Mass zzso of quickly frozen, intact muscles showed that only zzso was zzso in the relaxed zzso The location of this zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso using zzso specific for zzso or zzso zzso In the relaxed state, zzso were labeled by zzso but not by zzso whereas in rigor, labeling was similar with zzso This suggests that only zzso is exposed in the relaxed state, while in rigor, zzso is also zzso In the zzso motif of relaxed zzso only the free head zzso are exposed, suggesting that the zzso zzso is on the free heads, consistent with the proposed zzso
