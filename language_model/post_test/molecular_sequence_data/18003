We designed a zzso zzso zzso system which consists of three zzso strands zzso zzso these zzso and their zzso and examined zzso and properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complexes were measured and the signals were assigned by comparison with the zzso of some model zzso zzso of a complex containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso I) revealed that the zzso group of the third zzso zzso in the loop 1 zzso plays an important role for maintaining both the activity and loop zzso
