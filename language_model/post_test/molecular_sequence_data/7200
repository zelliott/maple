zzso are positively charged zzso zzso that were originally isolated from zzso Later on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from pig zzso While insect zzso are highly potent against both zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso is as active as insect zzso against zzso but has reduced activity against zzso zzso To gain insight into the mechanism of action of zzso and the molecular basis of its zzso zzso the zzso and its zzso incorporated analogue (at the zzso position found in insect zzso zzso were zzso and labeled on their zzso zzso with fluorescent zzso without significantly affecting their zzso zzso Fluorescence studies indicated that the zzso of zzso is located on the surface of zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso binds zzso zzso zzso zzso better than zzso PC zzso which zzso with its ability to zzso the former better than the zzso The shape of the binding zzso suggest that zzso like insect zzso binds zzso in a simple, zzso zzso However, resonance energy transfer zzso zzso revealed that, unlike insect zzso zzso does not zzso in the membrane even at relatively high zzso to zzso zzso The zzso of zzso binding to zzso suggests that amount of zzso sufficient to form a zzso causes zzso zzso In spite of the incorporation of the zzso zzso in zzso the analogue has reduced zzso activity, which zzso with its reduced zzso structure and its lower zzso and membrane zzso activity with zzso zzso Taken together, our results support a mechanism in which zzso zzso the structure of the bacterial membrane by zzso binding of zzso zzso to the zzso surface of the bacterial membrane and zzso disintegrating the bacterial membrane by zzso the zzso packing in the zzso These results, combined with data reported for other zzso zzso suggest that the organization of zzso zzso within zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso
