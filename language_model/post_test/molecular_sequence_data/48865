A zzso zzso bacterial strain that developed large zzso zzso at the ends of zzso on zzso zzso was isolated from bamboo forest soil in zzso According to the results of a zzso zzso study, our isolate had typical characteristics of members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis also indicated that strain zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso being most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso values, which differentiate the new strain from the most closely related species, were significantly below 70 zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was zzso The diagnostic zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso Following an evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso studies, the isolate is proposed to represent a novel species to be named zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
