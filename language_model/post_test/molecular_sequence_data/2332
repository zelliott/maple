A zzso hairpin duplex containing the zzso terminal repeat sequence of zzso virus type 2 zzso DNA was used as a zzso in gel zzso zzso to detect putative proteins that specifically interact with the zzso hairpin DNA zzso Nuclear proteins were detected in extracts prepared from human zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso type 2 that zzso with the hairpin duplex but not in nuclear extracts prepared from zzso zzso or zzso type zzso zzso zzso The binding was specific for the hairpin duplex, since no binding occurred with a zzso DNA duplex with the identical zzso zzso Furthermore, in competition experiments, the binding could be reduced with increasing zzso of the hairpin duplex but not with the zzso duplex DNA with the identical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the binding was sensitive to zzso with the zzso whereas the zzso hairpin duplex was resistant to zzso with zzso zzso The zzso sequence involved in the protein binding was localized within the zzso terminal repeat of the zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso These nuclear proteins may be likely candidates for the pivotal zzso zzso required for replication or resolution (or zzso of zzso zzso hairpin zzso of the zzso zzso
