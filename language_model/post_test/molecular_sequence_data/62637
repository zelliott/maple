The zzso at the active zone zzso is thought to define the site of zzso zzso of zzso We have recently identified a novel zzso protein from rat brain which we have named CAST zzso structural zzso CAST forms a large molecular complex with other zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso at least through direct binding to zzso Here, we have identified a rat protein that is structurally related to CAST and named it zzso zzso zzso analysis of rat brain shows that zzso is also tightly associated with the zzso density zzso Like zzso zzso directly binds zzso and forms a zzso with zzso In primary cultured rat zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso to the vicinity of the zzso membrane of zzso in mouse zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso is a rat zzso of the human protein zzso zzso has also recently been identified as zzso and zzso zzso the original CAST is tentatively re-named zzso These results indicate that zzso is a new component of the zzso and, together with zzso may be involved in the formation of the zzso zzso
