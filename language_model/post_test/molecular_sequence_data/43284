zzso is a zzso of bacterial zzso and zzso zzso a member of the group of mismatch repair genes whose products bind to mismatched regions of zzso zzso We analyzed expression of zzso in normal human zzso by the zzso chain reaction coupled with reverse zzso and found two novel types of alternatively spliced zzso that were expressed in normal human zzso One lacked zzso 13, and the other lacked a portion from the second zzso of zzso zzso to the second zzso of zzso zzso In the latter transcript, intro 12 started with zzso and ended with zzso zzso zzso which did not meet the zzso zzso Both types of transcript resulted in zzso which generated truncated zzso proteins lacking the main part of the highly zzso zzso The biological significance of the alternative zzso remains to be zzso
