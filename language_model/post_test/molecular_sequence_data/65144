The zzso calcium sensor zzso family of zzso proteins regulates a number of different processes in zzso and zzso zzso The first of these proteins to be zzso zzso was shown to exhibit a zzso switch zzso its zzso zzso group is zzso in the zzso form and is exposed on zzso binding to allow the protein to become zzso It has subsequently been shown that certain other family members also exhibit this mechanism in living zzso In contrast, zzso does not show the zzso switch and is zzso even at low zzso zzso We have used sequence comparison combined with information from structural analyses to attempt to identify candidate zzso within the zzso proteins that determine whether or not the zzso switch operates in cells and have tested their functional significance by zzso The results show that zzso possesses zzso within its N zzso that lock the zzso group in an exposed zzso In addition, other structural aspects within the zzso zzso are required to allow the switch to zzso We have determined a key role for zzso within the motif zzso in zzso in keeping the zzso group exposed and allowing the protein to be zzso zzso
