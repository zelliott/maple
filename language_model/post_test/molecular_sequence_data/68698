Two distinct regions in the replication origin, zzso of zzso coli are separately distorted upon initiation complex formation by the zzso protein zzso The zzso region in the left part of zzso and the start site region in the right part of zzso Chemical modification of zzso DNA was observed at both regions whereas zzso recognition of DNA zzso specifically occurred in the start site zzso We show that the zzso phasing of binding sites for zzso protein in zzso is important for origin zzso An zzso or deletion of one zzso turn between the two zzso binding sites does not alter the efficiency of replication zzso whereas all modifications of distance by less or more than one zzso turn result in zzso of zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso in the zzso region as well as in the start site region are not affected in the distance zzso irrespective of their functionality in zzso We propose a specific compact zzso structure for the initiation zzso
