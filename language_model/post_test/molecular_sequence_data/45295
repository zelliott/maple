Plant zzso zzso channels mediate zzso zzso from guard cells during zzso closure and from root cells into the zzso for zzso allocation of zzso zzso zzso the gating of these channels depends on the zzso zzso zzso although the zzso carrying the current are derived from inside the zzso This zzso dependence zzso a sensitivity to the zzso zzso concentration zzso that ensures that the channels mediate zzso zzso only, regardless of the zzso prevailing zzso We investigated the mechanism of zzso gating of the zzso channel zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso affecting the intrinsic zzso dependence of gating were found to cluster in the pore and within the sixth zzso zzso zzso identifying an zzso gating zzso deep within the zzso zzso the zzso sequence to the crystal structure of the zzso zzso channel zzso from zzso zzso suggested interaction between the zzso gating domain and the base of the pore zzso a prediction supported by zzso at this zzso These results offer a unique insight into the molecular basis for a zzso important zzso process in zzso
