A zzso library was constructed from zzso zzso derived from zzso a zzso zzso cell hybrid, containing as its only human contribution an zzso zzso zzso This library was screened with zzso zzso derived from zzso and zzso with a zzso similar mouse cell zzso From a screen of zzso zzso seven clones were isolated which zzso more strongly with zzso derived from the zzso hybrid than with the mouse only cell zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that four of the seven clones originate from the human zzso three of these contain repeat zzso and one, zzso is devoid of zzso zzso identifies a zzso zzso transcribed from the human X zzso mapping to the region zzso or zzso and is an abundantly and zzso expressed zzso A near, or full-length clone of zzso zzso was isolated and zzso the zzso translation of this sequence encodes a basic protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso
