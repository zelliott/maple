A central goal in membrane biology is to understand how channel proteins work in terms of their underlying protein zzso zzso channels are zzso (or zzso zzso protein zzso organized around a central zzso zzso The two key functional elements are the zzso channel, the actual polar zzso that permits the selective passage of zzso zzso per second across the zzso core of the membrane zzso zzso and the zzso the structure that detects the stimulus and couples it to the opening or closing zzso of the zzso The current excitement in membrane protein science emerges from structural information that is providing clues about the molecular zzso of zzso molecular cloning and sequencing has led to the zzso of the primary structures of several zzso of zzso and zzso zzso channel proteins have been zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with full retention of zzso the properties of many channel proteins have been characterized at the single-channel zzso zzso or zzso transcripts have been expressed in zzso as functional zzso specific zzso sequences predicted by molecular modeling to form the channel lining have been zzso by zzso methods and proved to be channel zzso in zzso zzso These advances are beginning to delineate general principles about the molecular design of this class of proteins that are essential for cellular zzso and signal zzso
