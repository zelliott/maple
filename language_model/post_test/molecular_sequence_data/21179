Transformation requires specialized proteins to facilitate the binding and zzso of zzso The genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are required for transformation and to assemble a structure, the zzso in the cell zzso No role for the zzso has been established and the functions of the individual zzso genes are zzso We show that among the zzso zzso only zzso is absolutely required for DNA binding to the cell zzso zzso an integral membrane zzso protein plays a minor role in the initial binding step, while an unidentified protein which communicates with zzso must be directly responsible for binding to the zzso We show that the use of resistance to zzso to measure zzso zzso reflects the movement of transforming DNA to a protected state in which it is not zzso associated with the zzso and presumably resides outside the cell zzso in the zzso or associated with the cell zzso We suggest that zzso is needed for the acquisition of zzso resistance as well as for the binding of DNA to the cell zzso Finally, we show that the zzso is required for DNA zzso and we offer a revised model for the transformation zzso
