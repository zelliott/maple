zzso zzso are found in all zzso and are zzso in a zzso that starts with the transfer of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso This reaction is carried out by a protein complex, three of whose zzso in humans, zzso zzso and zzso have sequence and functional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso contains two further zzso zzso and zzso We report that the essential zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strains were created, in which zzso could be depleted by zzso zzso expression using the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso virtually abolished in zzso zzso synthetic activity, indicating that zzso is necessary for zzso synthesis in zzso Further, depletion of zzso in an zzso zzso background prevented the formation of the zzso zzso zzso that normally accumulate in this late-stage zzso assembly zzso zzso is therefore required for zzso synthesis in zzso Because zzso encodes a protein involved in zzso zzso we designate the gene zzso Potential zzso counterparts are also zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
