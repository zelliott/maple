In zzso function of the molecular zzso zzso is zzso and requires the full-length zzso Our earlier studies predicted a second zzso zzso site in zzso By applying direct zzso approaches, we mapped two zzso sites and unveiled the zzso zzso site as the first example of a cryptic zzso zzso site, which is opened by occupancy of the zzso zzso We identified an zzso zzso motif in the middle domain of zzso similar to other zzso family zzso This motif is adjacent to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso we found a selective zzso zzso competitor, zzso that strengthens the zzso complex leaving the zzso complex zzso zzso may provide a pharmacological tool to dissect zzso and zzso zzso binding of zzso A model is proposed on the interactions of the two zzso zzso and the charged region of zzso
