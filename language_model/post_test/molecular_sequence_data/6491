Two zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso or zzso and zzso (also described as zzso or zzso are found in tandem at zzso zzso These genes are designated as candidate tumor zzso genes because they zzso proteins that function as negative cell cycle zzso (The zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso complexes that are required for progression through the cell zzso zzso genetic studies have revealed that deletion of the zzso and zzso genes occurs frequently in cancer cell lines and in certain zzso zzso 

We evaluated the frequency of zzso and zzso gene zzso in a zzso cohort of human transitional cell zzso zzso and we explored potential associations between zzso in these genes and tumor stage and/or zzso 

zzso tissue and normal tissue from 110 patients with transitional cell zzso of the urinary zzso were zzso The status of the zzso and zzso genes in these zzso was determined by Southern zzso and zzso with zzso zzso by coupled zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso and by sequencing DNA fragments produced during zzso zzso between zzso in the genes and tumor stage and/or grade were evaluated using the zzso zzso exact zzso 

zzso deletion (both zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso genes was observed in 11 and nine zzso tumors, zzso Eight of the 11 tumors exhibiting complete loss of the zzso gene also displayed zzso deletion of the zzso zzso Exclusive loss of either gene was detected in only three zzso zzso deletion (one zzso lost, also referred to as loss of zzso zzso of the zzso and/or zzso genes was observed in eight zzso zzso of the two genes was indicated in three additional zzso No point zzso were identified in either zzso The overall frequency of zzso in this cohort of zzso tumors was approximately zzso for each gene (in 20 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso of 109 zzso tumors for the zzso gene and in 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 100 zzso tumors for the zzso zzso A statistically significant association between zzso gene zzso and zzso tumors of low stage zzso zzso zzso and grade zzso zzso zzso was zzso a significant association between zzso gene zzso and tumors of low stage zzso zzso zzso was also zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso especially zzso zzso zzso appears to be a common event in zzso zzso
