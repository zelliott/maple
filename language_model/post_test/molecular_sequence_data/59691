zzso zzso zzso based on zzso sequence were used to amplify the region spanning zzso 2 of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this region from individual clams showed highly zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso was found to include a number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso repeats which were found to be zzso with respect to the types and numbers of repeats zzso Two separate zzso zzso regions were located near each end of this zzso The repeat at the 3' end consisted of an unusual example of a zzso zzso at the position of the zzso tract usually involved in zzso zzso Thirteen individual cloned zzso 2 zzso derived by zzso amplification from pooled zzso DNA, were zzso without finding two identical zzso All of the zzso clones contained zzso zzso
