zzso which are important for zzso zzso are composed of long, repetitive DNA sequences associated with a variety of zzso zzso We characterized the organization and structure of rice zzso and adjacent zzso regions on the basis of zzso and sequence zzso The length of the rice zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso as revealed by both zzso in zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso Physical maps of the zzso ends were constructed from a zzso zzso This facilitated sequencing of the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The resulting sequences contained zzso zzso zzso repeats, which indicates that the physical maps partly covered the zzso regions of the respective zzso zzso These repeats were organized in the order of zzso from the zzso region, except in zzso zzso in which seven zzso copies also existed in tandem zzso Analysis of the zzso regions revealed the occurrence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of single zzso within the repeat sequences at the junction between the zzso and zzso The sequences of the zzso regions of the seven zzso ends were zzso in zzso A total of zzso genes were predicted in the zzso zzso In addition, repetitive sequences derived from various kinds of zzso were zzso No significant evidence for zzso zzso could be detected within or among the zzso zzso These results indicate that the rice zzso ends are zzso in both sequence and zzso
