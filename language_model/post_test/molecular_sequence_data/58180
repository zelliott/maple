Selective zzso of zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso within zzso core particles requires recognition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso located at the zzso end of zzso zzso By zzso plasmids expressing zzso zzso bearing zzso sequences fused to zzso we have mapped the minimal region of zzso to the zzso 94 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso probing of the zzso secondary structure in this region (by using either in zzso transcripts or zzso extracted from zzso core zzso reveals a zzso structure containing a lower zzso a zzso zzso an upper stem with a single zzso U zzso and a zzso zzso The functional role of this structure in zzso was explored by examining the effects of zzso in zzso on zzso of zzso in zzso These studies reveal that zzso in the lower zzso base pairing but not specific primary sequence is required for zzso zzso there is no requirement for base pairing in the lower portion of the upper zzso but base pairing elsewhere in this stem contributes to packaging zzso zzso the presence of the zzso zzso but not its primary zzso is important for zzso and zzso specific zzso sequences in the loop and in regions of the upper stem are critical for zzso zzso
