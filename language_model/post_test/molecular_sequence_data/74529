Although the maintenance mechanism of late long-term zzso zzso is critical for the storage of long-term memory, the expression mechanism of synaptic enhancement during zzso is zzso The autonomously active protein zzso C zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a core zzso maintaining zzso Here we show that zzso maintains zzso through persistent zzso factor zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso trafficking of zzso receptors zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso cells causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso this synaptic enhancement is zzso through zzso interactions but not zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso may act through zzso to release zzso receptors from a reserve pool held at zzso sites by protein interacting with zzso 1 zzso because zzso zzso interactions mimic and zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso directs zzso trafficking, as measured by zzso increases of zzso receptors in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso this trafficking mechanism reverses established zzso and persistent zzso at zzso that have undergone synaptic tagging and zzso Thus, zzso maintains zzso by persistently zzso zzso zzso trafficking to favor zzso zzso into zzso zzso
