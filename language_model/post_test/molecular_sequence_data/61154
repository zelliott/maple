In zzso zzso all zzso obtain identical zzso by zzso of the zzso 39 zzso of a small spliced leader zzso to appropriate zzso sites in zzso Although this process involves zzso small nuclear zzso zzso it is thought that zzso do not contain a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We show here that a zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a novel small zzso that displays several features characteristic of a zzso zzso including zzso a zzso cap and additional zzso zzso zzso a potential binding site for common core proteins that are present in other zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso I zzso Because zzso zzso do not appear to contain zzso zzso we argue that this previously zzso zzso species is a good candidate to be a zzso zzso zzso
