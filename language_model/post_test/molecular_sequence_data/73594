zzso zzso protein zzso share structural features in the zzso untranslated region implicated in the control of their zzso A zzso zzso at the zzso end, is considered the common zzso element, but the control requires also the integrity of the zzso downstream zzso These sequences interact in zzso with zzso which may represent the zzso factors for a common zzso The protein that binds the zzso tract has been identified as La and its binding in zzso depends on interaction with a protein zzso In the present study, by zzso zzso and zzso analysis we have identified the protein that interacts with the region downstream of the zzso tract as the zzso zzso cellular zzso acid binding protein zzso The interaction of this protein with the zzso region of various zzso protein zzso suggests a zzso zzso The binding of zzso to the target region requires the assistance of a zzso factor, that zzso after complex zzso Some evidence suggests that this may be the same factor that assists the binding of La to the zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso Considering that zzso and La come in contact with two typical regions of the zzso zzso essential for regulation, their interaction with the assisting factor may exert a modulating activity on the zzso control of zzso protein zzso
