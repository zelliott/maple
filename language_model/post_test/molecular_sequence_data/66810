zzso and zzso are prevalent and essential gastrointestinal zzso zzso peptides zzso However, these defensive peptides are not infallible because certain zzso can overcome their protective zzso Furthermore, impaired zzso synthesis has been linked to the occurrence of Crohn's disease zzso a chronic inflammatory zzso zzso Recently, defective bacterial sensing through zzso and zzso has been related to reduced zzso production, CD predisposition and zzso to enteric zzso zzso we propose that microbial sensors at the gut interface monitor the levels of these zzso zzso which might function as zzso signals to zzso tolerance and alert zzso Further work is required to clarify how gastrointestinal zzso are regulated and to assess their role in maintaining zzso zzso and triggering zzso zzso
