The zzso green zzso zzso has remarkable capability to survive in some extreme environments such as nitrogen zzso which makes zzso be a proper model for mining novel genes on nitrogen zzso or zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso with zzso acid identity of zzso to other zzso zzso zzso was isolated and characterized from zzso zzso zzso comparison with other zzso revealed that zzso occupied an independent zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso cells under nitrogen zzso confirmed that zzso increased its zzso level in zzso zzso zzso study and functional analysis in a zzso zzso coli zzso proved that zzso was a zzso and functional zzso zzso In order to investigate the potential application of zzso in higher plants, the transgenic studies of zzso in zzso zzso were carried zzso zzso showed that the transgenic lines expressed the zzso gene and demonstrated obviously enhanced root length zzso fresh weight zzso at two zzso of nitrate zzso stem length zzso leaf size zzso and zzso number zzso in contrast with the zzso zzso Furthermore, the transgenic lines had higher total nitrogen content zzso total zzso activity zzso and soluble protein concentration zzso than the wild zzso These results indicated that the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in higher biomass and the improvement of the zzso nitrogen use zzso
