We isolated and characterized a zzso zzso zzso from dog zzso zzso activity extracted at high zzso strength from zzso zzso in nude mice was separated from zzso activity by gel zzso and rapidly zzso by sequential zzso zzso interaction and zzso zzso The zzso zzso had an Mr of zzso by both zzso gel zzso and zzso gel zzso and a single zzso sequence by automated zzso zzso Like zzso from rat and human mast cells, the zzso zzso exhibited a high zzso zzso zzso employing zzso the best of several zzso zzso zzso It was inhibited by zzso zzso and soybean zzso zzso but not by zzso distinguishing it from the otherwise closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso 25 zzso of zzso zzso were found to be 72 and zzso identical to the corresponding sequences of zzso from rat zzso and zzso mast cells, zzso they were also closely related to human zzso G and to zzso sequences from mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained an zzso sequence which is common to all zzso zzso zzso zzso to date from four zzso zzso this feature zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
