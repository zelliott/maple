The zzso stress response in zzso coli is controlled by the alternative zzso factor, zzso zzso activity is uniquely induced by the zzso of outer membrane protein precursors in the zzso space, and leads to the increased production of several zzso including the zzso zzso zzso that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular integrity under stress zzso zzso and zzso experiments show that zzso activity is under the control of three zzso zzso (for regulator of zzso zzso zzso immediately downstream of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to a zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso is predicted to be an inner membrane zzso and the zzso zzso domain binds to and zzso zzso zzso in zzso indicating that zzso acts as an zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to a slight induction of zzso indicating that zzso is also a negative regulator of zzso zzso is a zzso protein and was found to zzso with the zzso domain of zzso indicating that zzso probably exerts negative activity on zzso through zzso zzso of zzso in contrast, has no effect on zzso activity under zzso zzso Under induction conditions, strains lacking zzso and/or C show zzso induction of zzso activity, indicating either the presence of multiple pathways regulating zzso activity, or the ability of zzso alone to both sense and transmit information to zzso
