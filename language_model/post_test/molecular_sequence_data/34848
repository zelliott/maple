The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso from the fungus zzso zzso was analyzed using mass zzso zzso First, zzso was characterized by an accurate zzso mass of zzso zzso of the zzso measured using zzso and by a zzso value of zzso determined by zzso zzso zzso revealed a clear zzso mass fingerprint after zzso zzso which did not provide any relevant hit when searched against a zzso protein database and was different from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso with zzso zzso coupled to liquid zzso allowed zzso reading of six zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso and seven sequence tags zzso zzso zzso which were used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be largely zzso to a hypothetical protein zzso zzso zzso code zzso from zzso zzso zzso A4 with a theoretical zzso mass of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso of copper zzso zzso The protein zzso is only little zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso identity, 49 % zzso
