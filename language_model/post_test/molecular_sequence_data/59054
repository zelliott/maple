Most cell types in zzso zzso exit from the zzso cell cycle before terminal zzso We show that the zzso gene is required to arrest the zzso cell proliferation at the correct zzso stage during zzso zzso zzso encodes an inhibitor of zzso zzso complexes with similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed beginning late in the zzso phase preceding the terminal division zzso zzso zzso unable to express the inhibitor fail to arrest cell proliferation after zzso 16 and progress through an extra division zzso zzso premature zzso expression in transgenic zzso results in a precocious zzso zzso
