zzso zzso was cloned by functional zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso using an avian liver zzso expression zzso The derived zzso acid sequence is zzso to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso which zzso the same two steps in zzso zzso as the zzso from zzso Avian zzso zzso also shows regions of extensive sequence similarity to the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso This zzso suggests a similar mechanism for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is intriguing because chickens do not zzso the zzso cycle in nitrogen zzso This is the first report of the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and it zzso a route to isolate the corresponding human gene which has been suggested to be defective in zzso zzso
