zzso cells respond to a lack of zzso acids by zzso a zzso program with the zzso factor zzso as one of the main zzso When cells are faced with zzso zzso stress, a quite different zzso response is mounted, the heat shock response, which is zzso by zzso Here, we show that zzso acid deprivation results in the zzso of zzso In zzso acid deprived cells, active zzso loses its DNA binding activity as demonstrated by zzso and zzso A sharp decrease in the transcript level of zzso target genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is also zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was also zzso In cells cultured with limiting zzso zzso activity also zzso Lack of zzso acids thus could lead to a lower zzso capacity and cellular zzso We show that the zzso sensing response unit of the zzso gene contains an zzso binding site, but we could not detect binding of zzso to this site in zzso zzso of either an zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso or an zzso zzso unable to bind DNA zzso had only a minor effect on the transcript levels of zzso acid deprivation responsive zzso
