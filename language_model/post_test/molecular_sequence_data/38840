Members of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso rapidly mediate signaling across the synaptic zzso zzso analysis and limited experimental studies have yielded a zzso model containing four zzso zzso labeled zzso to zzso and a large zzso zzso zzso zzso This model persists to date despite some recent structural studies that suggest it may be zzso In this study, the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso by limited zzso coupled to mass zzso Of particular note, accessible zzso sites within the putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso fragments within the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain were also zzso This report presents several key details incorporated in a new zzso model and is the first direct experimental evidence that a subset of the zzso regions are too short to be zzso zzso rather, these regions are proposed to be a mix of zzso and zzso This report is also the first to exploit the capability of mass zzso to probe critically the zzso of a class of membrane proteins of unknown zzso
