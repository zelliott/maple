zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso for zzso which plays an important role in acute inflammatory zzso We aimed to develop a sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and established 18 clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were evaluated in terms of their zzso zzso and five clones were selected and used for the comparative study of various combinations of zzso in sandwich zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso was also used in this zzso One zzso pair, which showed relatively high sensitivity and which was not severely zzso with blood zzso was selected and the zzso conditions were zzso by choosing the appropriate buffer for sample dilution and by directly labeling the second zzso with zzso The zzso zzso using zzso zzso as first zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as second zzso could detect as low as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by in total 2 h zzso without being affected by body fluid zzso The zzso was specific to zzso showing no zzso with other zzso or various zzso family proteins which share some zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso As an example of its application to clinical zzso plasma samples from patients with septic shock were zzso The results showed that zzso patients contain significantly higher levels of plasma zzso compared to normal zzso When analyzed by zzso zzso zzso in zzso plasma was zzso in a molecular weight zzso region corresponding to the zzso zzso The zzso established here is expected to be effectively used for further investigations on the relationship between zzso and various zzso
