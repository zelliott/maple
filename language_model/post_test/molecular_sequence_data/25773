The structural properties of the complex formed by zzso and zzso IX zzso zzso were studied to probe the influence of zzso coordination on the native zzso fold and the zzso binding site zzso Standard two-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso methods were applied to identify zzso and protein zzso A pronounced spectral resemblance between zzso and zzso zzso was noticed that could be exploited to assign a number of zzso by nuclear zzso zzso zzso IX was determined to bind in the same orientation as the zzso Most zzso in contact with the prosthetic group were found in the zzso zzso Several zzso structure features were also characterized near the protein zzso It was concluded that the zzso interactions are capable of organizing the binding site and the unfolded region of the zzso into the native zzso zzso
