zzso is able to recognize and bind sites of DNA damage and, in some way, damage to cellular DNA activates a zzso response leading to zzso arrest or zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to generate zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso We now show that the zzso product has zzso activity and is able to cleave between zzso 23 and 24 of full-length zzso to generate a novel product, zzso This activity was inhibited by zzso an zzso zzso zzso 23 and 24 lie within the zzso binding domain of zzso and the possibility that zzso may be resistant to feedback regulation by zzso is zzso zzso interaction with zzso induced two further zzso products of zzso generated by zzso zzso and designated zzso and zzso In zzso generation of a zzso zzso product of zzso zzso similar in size to zzso correlated with zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells exposed to either zzso or zzso The possible significance of the various zzso zzso products in relation to the cellular response to DNA damage is zzso
