zzso of class I zzso molecules on target cells by killer cell zzso receptors zzso blocks natural zzso and zzso cell zzso of zzso cells and zzso dependent zzso of T zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso requires zzso of the zzso tail of zzso and subsequent recruitment of an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso To better understand the molecular mechanism of the zzso zzso signal zzso we developed an in zzso zzso system using a zzso zzso fusion protein of zzso zzso tail zzso and zzso T cell zzso We identified a target zzso of zzso by comparing the zzso of major cellular zzso following in zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso in the presence and absence of the zzso in this zzso model zzso The zzso was zzso zzso by zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso recruited zzso Interestingly, we observed that among major zzso zzso in zzso zzso exhibited a dramatic decrease in zzso when the zzso was mixed with zzso T cell zzso However, zzso exhibited no decrease in zzso when zzso or zzso was depleted or deficient in this reaction mixture, suggesting that the zzso recruited by the zzso zzso directly mediate the zzso of zzso The zzso model system could be used to reveal the detailed molecular interactions in the zzso signal zzso
