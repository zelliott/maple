zzso zzso zzso is a zzso component of zzso complexes catalyzing zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso that codes for 497 zzso acids and translates to a zzso protein in zzso zzso at and around the zzso binding zzso zzso active site and the zzso interface domain involved in zzso binding are highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of protein sequences from the zzso class of zzso zzso family of zzso suggests that in spite of the zzso nature of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in sequence and structure, zzso shares a common zzso with zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is more related to zzso zzso zzso than to other zzso All members, except zzso seemed to be zzso Plant zzso seemed to have arisen differently and are more closely related to zzso than to bacterial and zzso zzso Earlier speculation on the nature of origin of zzso in zzso is not supported by zzso zzso A possible structural relationship of zzso zzso to other zzso zzso such as the neurotransmitter zzso and channels, is zzso
