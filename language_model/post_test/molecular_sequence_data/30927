We zzso the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to zzso the transcripts of the zzso open reading frames of human zzso type 16 zzso Total zzso was isolated from 14 cervical zzso zzso nine cervical zzso zzso and from human zzso transformed with different zzso zzso In all specimens two spliced transcripts were zzso zzso analysis of the cloned zzso products showed that both transcripts were generated by zzso out an zzso in zzso from zzso zzso 226 to 409 in one transcript and from zzso 226 to 526 in the zzso The major transcript present in all zzso specimens had the smallest zzso in zzso The zzso zzso described here is the method of choice for zzso zzso and donor sites in tissue specimens where a limited amount of zzso is zzso zzso obtained with transformed cells revealed no difference in zzso whether zzso was controlled by its zzso promoter or by a zzso promoter, the zzso zzso virus long terminal zzso
