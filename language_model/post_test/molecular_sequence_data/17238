Two principal groups of receptors zzso with human zzso and zzso and were identified and zzso at the zzso level in the zzso fish zzso zzso An additional group zzso with zzso was also identified and partially zzso In zzso gene zzso of each of the zzso zzso and zzso appears to have zzso The zzso of the tree surrounding the zzso zzso and other isolated zzso sequences indicates that the zzso events for these six genes clearly preceded the zzso event leading to the zzso and zzso and is probably zzso Overall, the combined pattern of gene expression for each pair of duplicated genes mirrored the expression in other zzso However, within each pair of zzso further zzso had occurred, with each demonstrating differential tissue distribution profiles suggesting they that may be responsible for the divergent action of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene regions showed zzso zzso with human zzso zzso and also zzso zzso zzso X, indicating that the putative ancestral human zzso 3 region may be equivalent to zzso X in zzso zzso
