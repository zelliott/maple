To address the evolution of human zzso virus type 1 zzso within a single host, we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso regions of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples were collected over a period of 3 years from six zzso subjects (three typical zzso zzso and three slow zzso zzso all with a comparable length of infection except zzso The evolutionary analysis of the zzso zzso sequences performed on zzso molecular clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso highlighted a series of differences between zzso and zzso In particular, zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso and zzso showed lower zzso similarity than those from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA clones from zzso showed higher zzso and zzso zzso divergence than those from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher zzso pressure was generally zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the increase in the genetic distance of DNA and zzso sequences over time was paralleled by an increase in both synonymous zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso but only in zzso zzso in zzso Several individual peculiarities of the zzso evolutionary dynamics emerged when the zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions of both zzso and zzso were evaluated zzso These peculiarities, probably reflecting zzso features of selective constraints and their continuous zzso are documented by the dynamics of zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso
