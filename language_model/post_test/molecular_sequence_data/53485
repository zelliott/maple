We obtained specimens from 128 zzso zzso identified from 1995 through 1998 in a prospective cohort study of zzso zzso injecting drug users zzso in Bangkok, zzso zzso data indicated that zzso transmission accounted for nearly all zzso zzso DNA from the zzso zzso region was zzso and zzso analyses determined that 102 zzso of the specimens were zzso E and 26 zzso zzso B zzso All zzso B strains clustered with strains often referred to in previous studies as Thai B or zzso The zzso zzso distance zzso within zzso E strains was low zzso zzso and zzso comparisons with a zzso zzso E strain, zzso showed limited divergence zzso zzso The zzso B zzso showed greater zzso divergence zzso zzso and were significantly divergent from the zzso B strain zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso E strains had significantly lower mean zzso loop charge than did zzso B strains zzso zzso zzso and, on the basis of analysis of zzso acid zzso were predicted to be predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso B strains had a higher mean zzso loop charge, and a smaller proportion zzso were predicted to be zzso zzso This study demonstrates that most incident zzso infections among Bangkok zzso are due to zzso E zzso with a narrow spectrum of genetic zzso The characterization of incident zzso strains from 1995 to 1998 will provide important baseline information for comparison with any breakthrough infections that occur among zzso in Bangkok who are participating in an zzso vaccine efficacy trial initiated in zzso
