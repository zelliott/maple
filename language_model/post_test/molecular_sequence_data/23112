zzso are not only the structure bases of zzso higher order structure but also have much biological zzso In this study, the whole sequence of about 100 zzso in length from zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso in which human zzso gene is zzso was analyzed by two zzso computer programs, zzso and zzso A strong potential zzso was predicted in the last and largest zzso of zzso The predicted 2 zzso zzso we refer to zzso was further analyzed through zzso methods in zzso and in zzso The results showed that the zzso could be associated with nuclear zzso from zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso Further reporter gene analysis showed that in the transient zzso the expression of reporter gene linked with reversed zzso was zzso slightly, while in zzso integrated state, the zzso reporter both linked with reversed and zzso zzso was enhanced greatly in zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso maybe has the capacity of shielding integrated zzso gene from zzso position zzso Through combination of computer program analysis with confirmation by zzso methods, we identified, for the first time, a 2 zzso zzso attachment region like sequence in the last zzso of human zzso
