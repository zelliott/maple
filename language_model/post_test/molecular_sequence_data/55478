The behavior at zzso zzso of two zzso versions of human zzso protein zzso has been characterized in comparison with that of native zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Both native and zzso proteins promoted zzso zzso of zzso zzso to a limited extent, but zzso very rapid formation of films from different zzso zzso containing both zzso and zzso zzso Once at the zzso the zzso zzso exhibited zzso structural zzso consistent with changes in the orientation of the zzso zzso segment, which were not observed in the native zzso zzso zzso of zzso films suggest that the zzso zzso forms promote expulsion at high pressures of a higher number of zzso molecules per mole of protein than does native zzso A more dynamic zzso of the zzso segment in zzso zzso forms is likely also responsible for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso films as observed by zzso zzso Finally, both native zzso zzso and the zzso zzso versions facilitate similarly the repetitive zzso dynamics of zzso films, which were able to reach zzso surface pressures with practically no zzso along multiple zzso or dynamic zzso
