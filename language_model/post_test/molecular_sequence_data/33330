During the latter stages of development in zzso fruit, water flow through the zzso declines markedly and the requirements of zzso and further expansion are fulfilled primarily by the zzso We evaluated the hypothesis that zzso of water transport through the zzso results from disruption or zzso of zzso and berry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso was measured in developing fruit of grape zzso zzso zzso 20 to 100 d after zzso zzso and compared with observations of zzso anatomy by light and zzso electron zzso and expression of six plasma membrane intrinsic protein zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a significant increase in whole berry zzso and zzso zzso in the latter stages of zzso zzso zzso which was associated with deposition of gels or zzso in many zzso zzso zzso zzso in the expression of some zzso zzso corresponded to lower whole berry zzso 60 to 80 zzso and the increase in zzso beginning at 80 zzso correlated with decreases in the expression of the two most predominantly expressed zzso zzso Although zzso the increase in berry zzso was not great enough, and occurred too late in development, to explain the decline in zzso flow that occurs at 60 to 75 zzso The evidence suggests that the fruit is not zzso isolated from the parent plant by zzso zzso but, rather, is zzso zzso by water delivered via the zzso
