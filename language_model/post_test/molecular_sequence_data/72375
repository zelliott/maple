The smallest region of deletion overlap in the patients we have studied defines a zzso zzso syndrome zzso minimal critical region zzso of approximately 250 zzso within zzso A de zzso constitutional balanced zzso has been identified within the zzso The patient has some features which have been reported in individuals with zzso zzso facial zzso mental zzso long slender digits and zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso of his zzso and shown that it interrupts the zzso heavy zzso gene zzso within the zzso The zzso of the zzso partner is in a repeated region zzso to the zzso cluster on zzso zzso zzso it is unlikely that the patient's findings are caused by interruption of sequences on zzso The zzso 22 zzso zzso the 3' coding region of the zzso gene and leads to a truncated transcript, strongly suggesting a role for this gene in the features found in this zzso Further, the patient's partial zzso zzso suggests that additional features of zzso may be attributed to other genes in the zzso Thus, zzso for more than one gene in the zzso may be zzso for zzso
