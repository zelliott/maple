We have made significant improvements to a zzso system for the cloning and manipulation of large bacterial zzso regions based on zzso zzso between directly repeated zzso sites during zzso Using two suicide capture zzso carrying zzso zzso regions, zzso sites are zzso on either side of the target zzso Using a zzso zzso helper zzso the region between the zzso sites is zzso into an zzso coli recipient strain, where it is zzso and maintained as a zzso zzso zzso The cloned target region is zzso in multiple ways to accommodate downstream zzso The target region is flanked with Gateway zzso sites for zzso into other zzso and by rare zzso zzso restriction sites for zzso The zzso target can also be inserted at a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso or maintained as a zzso zzso for zzso or zzso expression zzso We have used the zzso capture technique to clone and complement zzso zzso zzso regions up to 140 zzso in size and have created zzso zzso strains with various combinations of zzso zzso We believe this system will greatly aid the cloning and genetic analysis of zzso islands, zzso gene zzso and large open reading zzso
