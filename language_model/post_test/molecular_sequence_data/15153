zzso zzso which is known to be the zzso agent of zzso in freshwater and marine fish, has two zzso zzso Typical strains exhibiting zzso are isolated mainly from freshwater fish and Japanese zzso zzso strains exhibiting zzso are isolated mainly from marine fish, with the exception of Japanese zzso zzso zzso was performed to identify zzso differences between these two zzso Two fragments which showed zzso to potential zzso factors were isolated from zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a component of zzso We zzso DNA sequences of about 5 zzso containing these fragments and identified two partial ORF, and zzso zzso for other components of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences showed remarkably low zzso to components of zzso reported in the typical zzso zzso strain zzso Furthermore, the organization of these zzso was different from the gene cluster of the typical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may therefore be associated with different zzso in typical and zzso zzso zzso zzso
