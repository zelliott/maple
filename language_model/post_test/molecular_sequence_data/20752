zzso reproduction among insects may arise spontaneously, as a result of infectious agents or zzso between zzso distinct zzso zzso which may be the result of zzso or zzso (also associated with zzso is often connected with zzso However, all studied zzso of zzso were zzso rare zzso stages have been observed in a few of them what could suggests in their zzso besides the zzso zzso also zzso may zzso We studied the level of zzso in Internal zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso among individuals of zzso form of zzso zzso High frequency zzso of zzso in zzso sequences may indicate a hybrid origin of the zzso It is possible that this zzso form arose via a zzso event between zzso distinct lineages of bisexual zzso zzso known only from Georgia and Turkey, or between this species and one of the closely relatives from the zzso zzso Although result of zzso zzso test did not show significant zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso in the network was detected one zzso Most probable explanations for existence of that loop in zzso form and for origin of rare zzso which were detected in zzso zzso is gene zzso It is supported by recently zzso studies indicating rare zzso stages during the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso
