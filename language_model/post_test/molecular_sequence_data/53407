zzso are attached to zzso zzso and zzso and serve as underlying zzso that provide functional zzso such as zzso zzso zzso repeats are zzso by the alternate addition of zzso zzso and zzso Gal by zzso zzso zzso and a member of the zzso zzso gene zzso In the present study, we first found that zzso in zzso are most efficiently zzso by zzso and zzso We also found that zzso acts less efficiently on zzso containing increasing numbers of zzso repeats, in contrast to zzso which exhibits no significant zzso In zzso zzso zzso extension of core 4 branches was found to be zzso most efficiently by zzso and zzso in contrast to core 2 branch zzso which requires zzso and zzso zzso extension of core 4 branches is, however, less efficient than that of zzso or core 2 zzso Such inefficiency is apparently due to competition between a donor zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso since a core zzso zzso contains both Gal and zzso zzso These results, taken together, indicate that zzso synthesis in zzso and core zzso and core zzso zzso is achieved by zzso and distinct members of the zzso gene zzso The results also exemplify intricate interactions between zzso and specific zzso which play important roles in how zzso are zzso in different zzso zzso
