Members of the zzso zzso are distributed worldwide as zzso of marine zzso zzso birds, and zzso The family contains 10 zzso with approximately zzso zzso zzso are characterized by having a zzso trunk with a bulbous zzso zzso zzso zzso long zzso and 4 zzso cement zzso The zzso position of several zzso within zzso has been controversial when considering zzso and ecological zzso The zzso coding gene zzso zzso representing species of 5 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1950, zzso zzso 1932, zzso zzso 1911, and zzso Meyer, zzso were zzso to determine the zzso relationships among 2 particular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso likelihood and zzso analyses showed that zzso is a zzso zzso and that 3 major zzso are zzso Our results provide support for the idea that zzso represents an independent zzso zzso in the case of zzso there is no conclusive evidence that they are not members of zzso The analyses also confirm that zzso is zzso suggesting that the zzso represents a complex of species that should be zzso and reclassified using zzso zzso and molecular zzso Our observations suggest that zzso zzso hosts for the 2 zzso under zzso were independently zzso at least twice during the evolutionary history of the zzso
