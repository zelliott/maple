Group I zzso zzso via two consecutive zzso reactions in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis has established that a zzso core of about 120 zzso is zzso in all known group I zzso This core is generally not sufficient for activity, however, and most zzso group I zzso require zzso peripheral elements to stabilize the complete three-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso properties of group I zzso make them excellent systems for unraveling the structural basis of the zzso interactions responsible for promoting the zzso of complex zzso 

We present zzso and experimental evidence for the existence of three additional zzso base pairings between hairpin zzso within peripheral components of zzso zzso and ID zzso Each of these new long range zzso called zzso zzso and zzso involves a terminal loop located in domain zzso Although zzso 2 of zzso and ID zzso share very strong sequence zzso their terminal zzso interact with zzso 5 and 9 zzso zzso and domain 6 zzso zzso Based on these zzso zzso comparative sequence analysis, and published experimental results such as zzso protection patterns, we propose zzso models for two entire group I zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the large zzso precursor zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso ID zzso found in the zzso b gene of zzso zzso 

zzso models of group I zzso belonging to four different zzso are now zzso They all emphasize the modular and zzso organization of the architecture of group I zzso and the widespread use of zzso between terminal hairpin zzso for stabilizing the folded and active structures of large and complex zzso zzso
