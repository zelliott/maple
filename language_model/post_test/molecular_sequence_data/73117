zzso from all identified and zzso zzso Swedish and Danish patients zzso zzso zzso exposed to the implicated batches underwent zzso C virus zzso and sequencing of the core region and zzso region 1 of zzso zzso amplification was also done on 15 zzso batches of zzso 

Twelve patients were infected with zzso zzso and surprisingly, two with zzso zzso Analysis of the core region showed identical sequences in four patients and the only consistently positive zzso Five patients shared another zzso whereas three other zzso zzso patients each zzso unique zzso The two zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region confirmed identity within each group with great zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed mixed infection in one patient whose exposure was confined to a single zzso 

The few batches implicated presumably were contaminated with several zzso
