A full-length zzso of the Type I zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso acid zzso in the total zzso was determined by zzso zzso using a zzso library constructed from zzso zzso of the skate Raja zzso The zzso region of the skate zzso chain consisted of zzso zzso acid zzso - the same as other zzso collagen alpha chains from higher zzso zzso on zzso temperatures of Type I zzso from the skate, rainbow trout zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso revealed that the number of zzso and zzso in the zzso chains could be directly related to the zzso stability of the zzso The expression property of the skate zzso chain zzso and zzso analysis with other zzso zzso chains suggested that skate zzso chain could be a precursor form of the skate Type I collagen zzso zzso The present study is the first evidence for the primary structure of full-length zzso chain in an zzso
