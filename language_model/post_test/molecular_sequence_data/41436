zzso zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for human diseases including zzso and typhoid fever and its zzso sensing system is currently being zzso zzso zzso modeling and binding site analysis of zzso zzso a putative zzso sensor of the zzso family and responsible for zzso zzso zzso revealed a high structural zzso of their active site with three other zzso family proteins zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso The results show that all the zzso family proteins harbor three zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso for formation of hydrogen bridges and zzso zzso for the zzso interactions zzso to their position in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in addition to the above zzso zzso zzso zzso also plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso binding with its AHL auto zzso and the complex is found to be stronger because of the interactions between nitrogen atoms of zzso with the zzso oxygen in the zzso ring of zzso The specific binding patterns would be helpful in guiding both zzso studies as well as design of specific zzso to overcome zzso zzso zzso
