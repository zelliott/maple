The aim of this study was to improve understanding of several factors related to the ecology and environmental risk of zzso infection in northern zzso Small zzso and zzso adult ticks were collected at several sites, and specimens were tested for the presence of zzso species, primarily by zzso zzso zzso from some zzso and ticks were initially cultured in zzso medium to isolate zzso but none were zzso However, comparison of partial zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and outer surface protein A zzso gene sequences from zzso amplified from small zzso and ticks confirmed the presence of several zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected among lone star ticks zzso zzso at four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were detected in all small zzso species tested and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in a cotton mouse and cotton rats and in zzso zzso zzso The study findings extend the known geographic zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small zzso to new sites in zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains in zzso lone star ticks at two sites in Florida suggests that zzso zzso should still be considered a possible zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
