zzso peptides based on the regions of zzso virus middle zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso that bind zzso zzso are shown to activate this zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of the peptides required to activate the zzso are at least zzso higher than the zzso zzso of these peptides for the individual zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso peptides are more effective than zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that a fraction of the cellular zzso zzso has zzso zzso with relatively low affinity for zzso and that binding of zzso to these zzso causes zzso Thus, zzso zzso may be involved not only in recruiting the zzso but also in regulating zzso
