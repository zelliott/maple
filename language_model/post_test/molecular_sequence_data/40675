zzso zzso report a novel zzso Da zzso modification corresponding to an zzso zzso of peptides possessing the zzso motif of zzso The zzso occurs spontaneously during sample preparation for bottom-up zzso zzso zzso from the two well-known zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso it is dependent on pH instead of zzso The data set from our recent study on large-scale zzso peptides revealed a sequence requirement for the zzso event similar to the well-known zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso analysis using synthetic peptides confirmed that the zzso forms between the zzso and its neighboring zzso zzso and the reaction shares the same zzso intermediate with the zzso zzso zzso As a result, we, here, propose a molecular mechanism for this specific zzso
