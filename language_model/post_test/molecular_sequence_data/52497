In the zzso fungus zzso zzso a zzso zzso occurs in the zzso of several strains isolated at various locations in the northeastern United States and zzso The zzso of this zzso is a zzso circular zzso DNA that has no zzso sequence zzso with the zzso zzso DNA of zzso a standard virulent laboratory strain of zzso zzso The circular nature and zzso characteristics of the zzso were deduced from the zzso size of zzso DNA molecules as detected by one- and two-dimensional zzso the nature and alignment of restriction fragments, and the lack of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso location of the zzso was deduced from its zzso with zzso zzso zzso transmission in sexual zzso zzso from the zzso of the donor strain during its horizontal transfer between zzso compatible strains through zzso zzso and zzso zzso usage zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a long open reading frame that is transcribed and potentially encodes a unique zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso similar to those zzso by the zzso and zzso circular zzso plasmids of zzso In this zzso of zzso the zzso motif characteristic of zzso DNA zzso is replaced by zzso zzso motifs related to those that are characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso have been located in the zzso portion of the zzso A comparison of zzso zzso and zzso cultures indicates that zzso is an infectious agent that effects a reduction in the zzso of some, but not all, strains of zzso zzso
