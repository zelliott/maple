We recently zzso the zzso processing zzso named viral envelope zzso zzso zzso that converts human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso precursor zzso to zzso and zzso from the human zzso T cell line, zzso clone 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, we deal with the inhibitor specificity and calcium requirement for zzso zzso processing in cultured zzso cells and human zzso zzso zzso of zzso in these cells infected with zzso zzso virus zzso the zzso gene was not affected by zzso calcium depletion induced by the calcium zzso zzso and zzso or by zzso calcium zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso but was specifically inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was also inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso But zzso zzso processing was inhibited only by zzso low molecular mass zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation induced by cell surface zzso was also inhibited by permeable zzso of zzso Taken together, our results indicate that calcium zzso may not be essential for zzso zzso processing and so zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso virus may be processed mainly by a zzso that does not require calcium zzso such as zzso in these zzso
