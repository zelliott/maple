zzso against the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected extensively in immune people living in malaria endemic areas of zzso It has been shown earlier that specific zzso raised against the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein inhibit zzso zzso growth in zzso To study the properties of the rest of the zzso the remaining zzso zzso acids on the zzso of the zzso protein were expressed as a zzso fusion protein zzso zzso raised against zzso identified the 38 zzso zzso protein on a zzso Western zzso zzso An zzso zzso using both the zzso and zzso fusion proteins showed no zzso with malaria patient zzso samples, but showed extensive reactions with the immune zzso zzso against both the zzso and zzso zzso were raised in rabbits and different zzso strains of zzso zzso from zzso mice showed zzso when presented with zzso protein zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso in zzso in a concentration dependent zzso The zzso did not show any significant effect on the growth of zzso zzso but specifically inhibited zzso of red zzso zzso and sexual stages showed surface zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These properties strongly indicate zzso as a possible target for zzso zzso
