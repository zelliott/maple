The zzso gene zzso conditions zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso on tomato zzso carrying resistance gene zzso zzso zzso of the fungus that circumvent zzso resistance show various single point zzso in the coding region of the zzso zzso Similar to expression of the zzso zzso expression of the various virulent zzso zzso is specifically induced during zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso however, did not detect zzso zzso in zzso plants infected by the different virulent zzso indicating that these zzso are zzso To analyze whether the zzso zzso still possess specific zzso activity, the zzso zzso were expressed in zzso plants by using the potato virus X zzso expression zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the development of spreading zzso eventually leading to plant death, whereas the various zzso derivatives induced symptoms ranging from severe necrosis to no zzso at zzso We conclude that instability of the zzso zzso that are produced by virulent strains is a crucial factor in zzso of zzso zzso
