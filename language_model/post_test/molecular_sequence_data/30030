We report the complete zzso sequence of the zzso element zzso from the vicinity of the alcohol zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso (an endemic Hawaiian zzso The complete element is about 1650 zzso zzso long, has zzso zzso inverse imperfect repeats at it's ends, and contains a large open reading frame potentially zzso a 192 zzso acid zzso We demonstrate that zzso belongs to a class of zzso elements which includes zzso from zzso zzso Barney from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso All of these elements share significant sequence zzso are approximately 1600 base pairs long, have short inverse terminal repeats zzso contain open reading frames zzso with significant sequence identity, and appear to insert specifically at zzso sequences generating target site zzso
