The zzso family of zzso membrane proteins shows a level of evolutionary conservation unique among membrane zzso They are present in nearly all the zzso zzso of zzso bacteria and zzso with the exception of several species with small zzso On the basis of experimental studies with the zzso regulator zzso from zzso and the zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso the zzso are thought to be zzso zzso zzso whose signaling function is zzso in zzso and zzso 

zzso tree analysis carried out using several independent methods for tree constructions and the corresponding statistical tests suggests that, despite its broad distribution in all three zzso the zzso family was not present in the last universal common zzso of extant life zzso Instead, we propose that zzso evolved in bacteria and have been acquired by zzso and zzso through several independent horizontal gene zzso In zzso two zzso ancient acquisitions apparently gave rise to the two major zzso typified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evolution of the zzso family in zzso proceeded by multiple zzso and functional diversification through the addition of extra zzso zzso and other zzso in different zzso relative to the zzso core that harbors the zzso zzso 

Although the zzso presence of the zzso family in bacteria, zzso and zzso appears to suggest that this protein is part of the heritage of the last universal common zzso zzso tree analysis indicates a likely bacterial origin with subsequent dissemination by horizontal gene zzso This emphasizes the importance of explicit zzso analysis for the reconstruction of ancestral life zzso A hypothetical scenario for the origin of zzso membrane zzso from membrane zzso is zzso
