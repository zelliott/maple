The transforming growth factor beta zzso products of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have been implicated in the control of growth and differentiation during zzso We have isolated a mouse zzso zzso that encodes a zzso structurally related to zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicate that the zzso protein belongs to a family of zzso gene products within the zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso were determined in zzso and zzso isolated at various stages of zzso A zzso zzso increases throughout development and into adulthood in many zzso and in zzso zzso cells zzso into zzso in response to zzso acid and zzso The zzso acid zzso and patterns of expression suggest that, like the zzso gene product, zzso plays a role at various stages of zzso
