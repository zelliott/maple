A series of studies were performed to determine whether zinc finger peptides could efficiently repress zzso from zzso zzso II promoters in zzso and to determine how such repression might depend on the position of the zinc finger binding site with respect to those of the zzso box or the zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared with zzso binding sites inserted at various positions, and the activity of a reporter gene was measured in zzso zzso We found that the zzso containing the three zinc fingers of zzso could efficiently repress activated zzso when bound to a site near the zzso box zzso zzso or when bound to a site near the zzso element zzso zzso zzso was even more effective when the zinc finger zzso was bound to both of these sites zzso zzso Novel zinc finger peptides that had been selected via zzso display also served as zzso of activated transcription, but repression with these proteins was somewhat less efficient than with the zzso zzso
