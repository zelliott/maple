The bacterial pathogen zzso zzso is found naturally in brackish coastal waters but can be greatly concentrated by zzso organisms such as zzso Numerous experiments in which zzso zzso zzso cells are added to oysters in an attempt to measure zzso and zzso have been zzso In nearly all cases, results have shown that zzso bacteria are rapidly taken up by the oysters but ultimately zzso while naturally present zzso populations in oysters are resistant to zzso In this study, oysters harvested during winter months, with low zzso zzso zzso were incubated in zzso supplemented with strains of zzso zzso that were either zzso or zzso distinct from the background zzso These zzso cells were eliminated from the oysters, as previously seen, but other zzso already inhabiting the oysters responded to the zzso zzso zzso by rapidly increasing in number and maintaining a large stable zzso The presence of such an zzso zzso population would be expected to prevent colonization by zzso zzso zzso cells, thus explaining the rapid zzso of these added zzso
