Like its zzso in higher zzso the U2 zzso in zzso zzso is transcribed by zzso zzso II and is not zzso Instead, an zzso zzso structure located downstream of the U2 zzso coding sequence and transcribed as part of a 3' extended precursor serves as a signal for zzso zzso We have identified three zzso that have zzso defects in U2 zzso zzso zzso In these zzso the synthesis of the major zzso is also affected and zzso zzso precursors accumulate at the restrictive zzso Two of these zzso contain the same zzso transition within the zzso zzso whereas the third contains a zzso outside the zzso zzso indicating that at least two genes are zzso The zzso gene is zzso with the zzso zzso and can rescue the zzso zzso and the defects in zzso and zzso zzso if zzso In zzso zzso an zzso III zzso can cleave a synthetic U2 precursor within the signal for zzso formation, generating a product that is a few zzso longer than mature U2 zzso In addition, U2 precursors are zzso and trimmed to the mature size in extracts made from zzso zzso zzso zzso However, extracts made from zzso zzso cells are unable to do so unless they are supplemented with zzso zzso zzso Thus, the 3' end of zzso zzso U2 zzso is generated by a processing reaction that requires zzso and an additional zzso and can be zzso from zzso in zzso
