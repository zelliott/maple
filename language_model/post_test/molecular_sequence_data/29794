Recent evidence suggests that the prion protein zzso is a copper binding zzso The zzso region of human zzso contains four sequential copies of the highly zzso zzso sequence zzso spanning zzso zzso This region selectively binds zzso in zzso In a previous study using zzso design, zzso and CD zzso we showed that the zzso segment within each zzso comprises the fundamental zzso binding unit zzso et zzso zzso zzso 40, zzso Here we present the first atomic resolution view of the copper binding site within an zzso The crystal structure of zzso in a complex with zzso reveals equatorial coordination by the zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso along with an zzso water bridging to the zzso zzso Companion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments performed on a library of zzso peptides indicate that the structure of the copper binding site in zzso and zzso in solution is consistent with that of the crystal zzso Moreover, zzso performed on zzso zzso and an zzso analogue demonstrates that the identified structure is maintained in the full zzso zzso zzso It has been shown that copper stimulates zzso zzso The identified zzso linkage is unstable below pH approximately zzso and thus suggests a zzso molecular mechanism by which zzso detects zzso in the zzso zzso or releases zzso zzso within the zzso The structure also reveals an unusual complementary interaction between zzso zzso units that may facilitate molecular recognition between prion zzso thereby suggesting a mechanism for zzso signaling and perhaps conversion to the zzso zzso
