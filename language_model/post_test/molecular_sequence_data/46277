zzso zzso factors play crucial roles in organ and cell differentiation in organisms ranging from zzso to zzso Most of the work on plant zzso proteins focused on their roles in floral development whereas less information is available on their function in fruit zzso We cloned three distinct tomato zzso using a zzso approach, zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors and whose zzso mostly accumulate in tomato flowers and zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso 5 and 6 belong to the zzso zzso When zzso expressed in tobacco leaves or in human cells, zzso 5 and 6 are targeted to the cell zzso As the zzso target genes of these putative zzso factors are unknown, the zzso activity of these proteins was characterized in a zzso system and we showed that, when fused to a zzso domain, they repress the zzso of zzso reporter zzso Since zzso zzso control zzso zzso activity and since a putative zzso zzso binding site was present in zzso 5 and 6, we tested the potential interaction between these factors and zzso zzso Surprisingly, in this zzso system, zzso 5 and 6 zzso with zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that, like zzso zzso plant zzso zzso activity might be regulated by zzso controlling zzso zzso
