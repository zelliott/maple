The native zzso zzso process of natural zzso a highly aromatic and charged zzso hormone involved in various zzso functions, was investigated mainly using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso combined with electron zzso zzso kinetic features of zzso zzso were confirmed for the zzso case, together with new insights into key interactions involved in the further zzso assembly of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso associated zzso and zzso zzso zzso droplets resulting from the zzso of the zzso In particular, the key role of aromatic zzso in both zzso and the association of the zzso into higher order structures could be zzso It is proposed that the zzso propensity of the zzso zzso is relevant to the current hypothesis of the biological function of hormone zzso zzso hormone storage inside zzso zzso
