Fluorescent zzso allow researchers to image and zzso protein activity and small zzso signals in living cells with high spatial and zzso zzso zzso zzso sensors are coded by a DNA sequence and hence constructed entirely out of zzso zzso These zzso typically zzso light-emitting zzso such as derivatives of the green fluorescent protein zzso and have been developed for a wide range of small molecules and zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso can be genetically targeted to distinct locations within cells, such as zzso and zzso This feature zzso zzso of how protein activities and cellular signals are modulated in different regions of the zzso zzso in the dynamic range and zzso of sensors have enabled high zzso screening for molecules that act as zzso or zzso of protein zzso
