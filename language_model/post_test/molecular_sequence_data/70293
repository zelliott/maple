The zzso zzso cell produces an zzso zzso protein zzso that binds testosterone and zzso with high zzso The zzso gene also encodes plasma sex zzso zzso zzso which is produced by the liver of most zzso Unlike the human, adult rats and mice do not express zzso A zzso rat zzso DNA zzso was found to contain the entire coding regions of zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso To aid in identification of the promoter and zzso regions of the zzso zzso we developed transgenic mice that express the rat zzso The zzso DNA was zzso into the zzso of zzso mice zzso which were transferred to the zzso tract of zzso zzso Three of the offspring were identified as carriers of the rat gene by Southern zzso and these founders were bred with normal mice to establish zzso transgenic zzso Northern zzso analysis, zzso and sequencing of the zzso products from the adult transgenic mice revealed extremely high levels of the rat zzso zzso in the zzso but no zzso rat zzso zzso in liver, kidney or zzso zzso extension experiments showed that the correct transcript zzso start site is zzso in the zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso DNA zzso contains an zzso capable of directing zzso gene expression in the zzso This zzso should prove useful for the targeting of specific gene products to the mature zzso cell in transgenic zzso
