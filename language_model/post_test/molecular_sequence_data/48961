The two zzso zzso zzso receptors were identified because of their ability to bind zzso soluble acid zzso in the zzso and transport them to the zzso zzso During the past decade, we have started to understand the structural features of these receptors that allow them to do this job, and how the receptors themselves are sorted as they pass through various zzso zzso But trafficking of acid zzso is only part of the zzso Evidence is emerging that one of the receptors can regulate cell growth and zzso and that it functions as a zzso zzso
