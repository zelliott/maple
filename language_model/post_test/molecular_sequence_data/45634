Single chain zzso of the zzso zzso were engineered by zzso the genes of the individual zzso into one zzso In zzso human zzso zzso the zzso terminal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso beta zzso serves as an effective zzso to enhance the zzso of the zzso compared to zzso lacking the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso species lack a zzso domain that zzso the use of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso in many zzso Here we used the bovine zzso as a model to examine the impact of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso as zzso and of a previously untranslated zzso sequence zzso from the bovine zzso gene on the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This cryptic zzso zzso zzso was incorporated into the bovine zzso reading frame by deletion zzso zzso analogous to these that presumably occurred in primates and zzso We genetically engineered single chain zzso in which the beta and alpha zzso zzso were linked directly or via the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso sequences and expressed them in zzso zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso were expressed and zzso but unlike the zzso the zzso appears as devoid of zzso zzso The incorporation of the zzso or zzso zzso enhanced by about zzso the rate and efficiency of zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso as estimated by induction of steroid production in immortalized zzso cells expressing the rat zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso were about equally zzso as judged by their zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso maintains zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso when applied as a zzso in zzso bovine zzso zzso that these zzso features are preserved when the domain is incorporated into zzso single chain zzso The study suggests that the zzso and zzso zzso are advantageous for the zzso of zzso bovine zzso and also demonstrates strategies for the design of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
