We performed in zzso selection of zzso in order to identify zzso motifs recognizing zzso zzso located at the 3' end zzso and at the zzso end zzso IV of the internal zzso entry zzso of the zzso C virus zzso We selected zzso constituted by an internal loop complementary to the zzso zzso loop, flanked by zzso zzso regions, able to form complexes with a zzso of 70 zzso at 37 degrees C under zzso conditions close to zzso zzso The complex involves selective zzso loop zzso loop zzso zzso Similar structurally organized zzso were independently identified against domain IV and were shown to also give rise to such zzso zzso zzso loop interaction could constitute a new recognition motif allowing specific zzso or zzso zzso zzso
