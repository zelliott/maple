In this study, the zzso gene zzso as zzso was identified and characterized from grass carp zzso zzso The complementary DNA zzso of zzso contained an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso acids zzso The deduced zzso protein contained all known functional zzso identified in other zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso is abundantly expressed in brain, zzso head zzso liver, zzso heart, muscle and zzso In the zzso zzso kidney zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was significantly zzso at 24 h zzso P zzso zzso after grass carp zzso zzso infection, and its zzso expression level was also zzso induced to a high level zzso P zzso zzso at 2 h zzso of synthetic zzso zzso zzso salt zzso In zzso analysis further showed that the expression of zzso zzso in the liver was induced to a significantly high level at 12 h zzso P zzso zzso and then dropped to normal level at 72 h zzso with zzso The zzso expression pattern of zzso in the zzso tissue was similar to that of liver tissue upon zzso zzso These results collectively implied that the identified zzso was an zzso gene responding to viral infection both in zzso and in zzso and the data would shed light on the interaction between zzso interference zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
