The work reported here describes zzso zzso zzso in two internally eliminated sequences zzso that are deleted during development in zzso a zzso zzso zzso at one end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These two zzso are located in the proximity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and are among the ten zzso that have been fully zzso out of an estimated total of zzso Three hundred zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are retained in the zzso Both the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso and C zzso that occur in different strains are eliminated during zzso Thus, a drastic change involving over half of the deleted sequence and 300 zzso of zzso sequence does not zzso zzso elimination of the zzso zzso which may indicate a lack of requirement for specific sequences on the zzso side of the zzso The zzso zzso is a composite of three sequence zzso a unique segment and two other sections containing members of different repeat zzso One of these, a zzso zzso repetitive zzso is zzso similar to another zzso zzso sequence that constitutes the C zzso a sequence present in the middle of the zzso zzso in some zzso but not in zzso zzso the C zzso sequence is likely to have been part of a mobile unit, even though it has no obvious features of a zzso However, sequences similar to the C zzso are present in about 100 copies in the zzso The results suggest that zzso may zzso at least in part, of relatively short zzso of repeated sequences that are the source of zzso zzso among strains of zzso zzso
