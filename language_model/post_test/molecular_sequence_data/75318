To evaluate the role of zzso production in the zzso of zzso zzso we have undertaken the analysis of the zzso region containing zzso the gene coding for zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso to zzso coli, was shown to express zzso O, by zzso with a specific zzso against zzso zzso The presence of zzso on the zzso was demonstrated by DNA zzso with a probe previously shown to contain part of zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso has been zzso The deduced protein sequence reveals the presence of a putative zzso signal zzso the zzso form of zzso O would have 504 zzso zzso in agreement with the molecular weight of zzso zzso O zzso The protein sequence is highly zzso to those of zzso O and zzso A zzso of 11 zzso acids zzso in the three proteins contains the unique zzso known to be essential for zzso zzso By zzso zzso the zzso O gene was detected in all zzso zzso strains tested, even in the zzso type zzso The gene was absent in other species of the zzso zzso
