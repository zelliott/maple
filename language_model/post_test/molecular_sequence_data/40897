A major obstacle in the zzso zzso of the abundance of bacteria associated with plants is contamination with plant zzso which zzso the use of universal zzso bacterial zzso in quantitative zzso zzso We present here a zzso method that allows a zzso determination of the degree of zzso and zzso contamination in DNA samples from plant zzso It is based on differential zzso of zzso zzso and bacterial small zzso zzso gene zzso with the restriction zzso zzso and zzso Using this method, we demonstrated for zzso lettuce plants that even a gentle washing zzso designed to recover the microbial community and its zzso from the leaf surface, resulted in substantial contamination with zzso zzso This finding cautions against the use of universal primer pairs that do not exclude zzso DNA from amplification, because they risk zzso of bacterial population zzso In contrast, contamination with zzso zzso zzso was minor in the lettuce zzso These findings were confirmed by real-time zzso using primer sets specific for small zzso zzso genes from bacteria, zzso and zzso Based on these results, we propose two primer pairs zzso and zzso which between them offer an indirect means of faithfully zzso bacterial zzso on plants, by deduction of the zzso zzso count from that obtained with zzso which zzso both bacterial and zzso DNA but excludes zzso In this manner, we estimated the number of total bacteria on most leaves of zzso lettuce to be between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso which was 1-3 orders of zzso higher than the number of zzso units that were retrieved from the same leaf surfaces on zzso zzso
