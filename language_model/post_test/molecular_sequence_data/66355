Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying molecular motor function are still poorly zzso Key to the mechanisms is the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso changes of the motor zzso To investigate this zzso we have conducted combined quantum zzso mechanical simulations of zzso zzso a zzso simple motor that zzso zzso along zzso DNA zzso Our results reveal a close similarity in zzso site structure and reaction zzso to those of zzso and these similarities include a zzso relay mechanism important for efficient zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso that is key to the zzso of the chemical reaction to protein zzso zzso By means of in zzso zzso studies, we identified the zzso zzso as being crucial for the zzso of zzso zzso to the actual zzso zzso Based on the present result for zzso zzso and previous findings for zzso we propose a general mechanism of zzso molecular motor zzso
