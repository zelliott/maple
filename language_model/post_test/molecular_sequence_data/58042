Chicken zzso upstream zzso factor zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso are orphan members of the zzso zzso zzso and exhibit ubiquitous and zzso tissue distribution, zzso The gene for rat zzso zzso zzso an zzso cycle zzso is mainly expressed in the liver and is under the control of the promoter and the zzso upstream zzso both of which are zzso Two sites of the promoter region and two sites of the zzso region of the zzso zzso as well as the zzso promoter site, were recognized by both zzso and zzso showing that these two factors have closely related binding zzso Since zzso activated expression from the zzso promoter in zzso analysis, this factor appears to participate in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso the expression from the zzso promoter, whereas it activated expression from several other zzso zzso zzso plays a dual regulatory role depending on the promoter zzso zzso of a zzso promoter by a ubiquitous zzso and zzso by a related zzso zzso is potentially an important mechanism for zzso zzso of a zzso
