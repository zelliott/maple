zzso initiation of the zzso gene in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso and primer extension zzso occurs 73 base pairs zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protects 43 zzso of DNA, from 35 zzso upstream zzso to 8 zzso downstream zzso of the zzso zzso initiation site, from zzso by zzso I and zzso zzso An A + T rich region, with a sequence which zzso to the consensus sequence for promoters of stable zzso genes in zzso is found at the same location zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso It appears therefore that a zzso sequence is also an element of promoters which direct zzso of zzso genes in this zzso
