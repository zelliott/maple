zzso receptors are zzso G zzso receptors that mediate slow synaptic zzso in the central nervous zzso Whereas zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is essential for functional zzso how zzso coordinate the assembly of these critical receptors remains to be zzso Here we have identified zzso a novel zzso zzso protein that associates specifically with the zzso zzso in zzso tissue culture cells, and zzso zzso is expressed in the brain and exhibits a zzso distribution in cultured zzso zzso zzso binds different zzso species including the zzso regions of both the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and also associates with zzso in cultured zzso zzso of zzso expression via small zzso interference technology results in enhanced zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso without affecting the level of zzso Together our results suggest that zzso functions to regulate the cellular levels of zzso zzso zzso which may have significant effects on the production of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso our observations provide an added level of regulation for the control of zzso zzso expression and for the efficacy of zzso synaptic zzso
