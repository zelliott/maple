Increased expression of zzso A is associated with both zzso and zzso in blood vessel zzso zzso zzso cells derived from spontaneously zzso rats zzso were found to express significantly more zzso A in culture, both at the protein and zzso level, than zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso as well as their tissue zzso were not zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso A promoter zzso linked to a zzso reporter demonstrated up to zzso more activity when zzso into zzso cells versus zzso zzso The promoter region between zzso and zzso previously termed zzso contributed up to a zzso increase in zzso promoter activity in both cells, but contributed only zzso of the promoter activity in zzso cells compared to zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, a second region between zzso and zzso termed zzso contributed zzso of the total activity of the zzso zzso promoter zzso Both zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso blots demonstrated differences in zzso binding factors in nuclear extracts derived from the two cell zzso zzso zzso cells thus represent a new model system to study the regulation of zzso A zzso which itself may contribute to the abnormal vascular structure seen in the zzso
