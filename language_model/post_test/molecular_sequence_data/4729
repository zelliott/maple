The interaction of zzso forms of zzso an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso has been used as a model system for zzso analysis to demonstrate the potential problems resulting from the zzso zzso zzso zzso To avoid complications due to zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments and zzso zzso zzso were zzso When immobilized by zzso zzso the zzso zzso fragments were found to have an artificially reduced affinity for zzso compared to the results obtained using zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso and from solution equilibrium zzso The zzso zzso fragments, on the other hand, were able to retain their zzso binding affinity when immobilized zzso through free zzso zzso These data, in combination with the known sequences of the two zzso suggested that zzso zzso through one or more zzso zzso close to or within the zzso region of the zzso zzso domain was responsible for the reduced strength of the interaction with zzso These results emphasize the need to use zzso zzso strategies when accurate kinetic zzso are zzso
