Soon after they segregate from the neural tube, trunk neural crest cells disperse on two zzso and temporally distinct zzso Only crest cells that migrate early and zzso give rise to zzso of the peripheral nervous zzso It is also known that neural crest zzso populations require appropriate environmental cues early in development in order to generate zzso and for the subsequent survival of differentiated zzso We examined whether zzso zzso a survival factor for zzso of peripheral zzso is also involved in the regulation of zzso by neural crest zzso First, we found that zzso and zzso neural crest cells on the zzso migration zzso of zzso Day zzso zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso multiple zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as do cells in the neural tube and zzso zzso On zzso a zzso of zzso in nascent sensory zzso express zzso zzso Second, we demonstrate that zzso zzso is only expressed in neural crest cell populations that possess zzso zzso Third, we show that the presence of zzso during the initial development of cultured neural crest cells, is required for zzso by a zzso of zzso neural zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso of zzso neural crest cells expresses functional zzso receptors and requires the timely availability of zzso for their development before reaching their final embryonic zzso We suggest that zzso zzso exists in the identity and requirements of neural crest cell zzso that harbor zzso zzso We also suggest that the zzso expression of zzso receptors by the zzso zzso may, in fact, play a role in the exclusive development of zzso zzso precursors on the zzso zzso by limiting the availability of zzso on the lateral zzso
