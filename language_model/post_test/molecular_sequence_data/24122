zzso zzso constitute a family of zzso zzso zzso peptides produced by zzso and zzso zzso cells, playing an important role in innate host zzso Following comprehensive zzso searches, here we report the discovery of complete zzso of the zzso gene family in the human, zzso zzso and mouse with new genes identified in each zzso The human zzso was found to zzso a cluster of 10 distinct zzso genes and zzso expanding 132 zzso continuously on zzso zzso Such zzso zzso are also zzso in the zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed formation of two distinct clusters with zzso zzso forming one cluster and zzso enteric zzso forming the other zzso zzso zzso of genes is evident in zzso species but not in the zzso zzso distinct zzso of zzso also exist in each species, with most zzso containing multiple zzso In addition, natural selection appears to have acted to diversify the functionally active mature zzso region but not signal or zzso zzso We concluded that zzso zzso genes may have evolved from two separate ancestors originated from zzso The current zzso of the zzso gene family in each species are primarily a result of repeated gene zzso and positive diversifying selection after divergence of zzso species from each other, except for the zzso zzso which were evolved prior to the separation of the zzso zzso We argue that the presence of zzso divergent zzso of zzso in each species may help animals to better cope with different microbial challenges in the ecological niches which they zzso
