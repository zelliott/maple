An zzso probe was used to isolate a clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a sheep seminal zzso zzso zzso The protein predicted from zzso acid sequence contains zzso zzso acids including a zzso acid signal zzso Thus, the mature zzso deduced from the zzso compares favorably in molecular size to the zzso protein determined by gel zzso A putative zzso region and potential zzso addition sites for zzso zzso can be zzso from the zzso acid zzso zzso sequence similarities exist between zzso zzso and several other zzso zzso The putative zzso sites, zzso domain, and sequence similarities with functionally related zzso have been incorporated into a model for the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso
