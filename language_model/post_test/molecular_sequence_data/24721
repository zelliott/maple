zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso originally isolated from zzso zzso Both the ring structure and the zzso zzso structure of AM are essential for its zzso zzso We have developed an zzso which recognizes the ring structure of human zzso Using this zzso we have characterized the molecular form of AM in bovine adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that three major zzso of zzso AM existed in the adrenal zzso The zzso corresponding to Mr 1500 Da was further zzso to zzso The zzso was determined to be AM zzso which has one zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of bovine AM and its precursor were deduced from the analyses of zzso zzso bovine AM zzso The synthetic AM zzso produced zzso strong zzso responses in zzso rats in zzso The zzso activity lasted about one minute, and a dose dependent increase in heart rate was also zzso The present data indicate that AM zzso is a major component of zzso AM in bovine adrenal zzso and shows zzso zzso
