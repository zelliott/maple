zzso virus zzso is classified as a zzso of the zzso Murray Valley encephalitis virus zzso however, despite preliminary reports of zzso and ecological similarities with zzso zzso has not been associated with human zzso Here, it was shown that zzso is at least zzso less zzso than zzso after peripheral zzso of zzso Swiss zzso mice, but zzso demonstrates similar zzso In addition, it was shown that zzso is partially attenuated in mice that are deficient in zzso zzso responses, in contrast to zzso which is zzso lethal in these zzso To assess the zzso relationship between these zzso a panel of zzso zzso was tested for the ability to bind to zzso and zzso in zzso Although the majority of zzso zzso recognized both zzso confirming their zzso zzso several discriminating zzso were zzso Finally, the entire zzso of the zzso strain of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso zzso identity between zzso and zzso confirmed previous reports of their close zzso Several zzso and zzso acid deletions and/or zzso with putative functional significance were identified in zzso including the abolition of a zzso zzso site in the envelope protein and the deletion of the terminal zzso zzso found in all other members of the zzso These findings confirm previous reports that zzso is closely related to zzso but also highlights significant zzso genetic and zzso divergence from zzso zzso the data suggest that zzso is a distinct species within the zzso Japanese encephalitis zzso
