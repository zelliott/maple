zzso growth zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso are two zzso zzso which are believed to play a role in the evolution of idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso We have evaluated the effect of these two substances on the expression of receptors for collagen zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and on type I collagen in human lung zzso Two zzso zzso differing in zzso zzso expression were obtained by zzso human lung zzso in medium containing fresh human serum and heated zzso serum and separating them based on zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso Am J zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The cells, referred to as zzso and NL cells, respectively, were exposed to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The levels of zzso were assessed by in zzso zzso and Northern analysis, and protein levels compared after zzso gel zzso and Western zzso NL cells exposed to zzso and zzso contained zzso and zzso times as much zzso zzso respectively, whereas in zzso cells zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso The zzso zzso levels increased to a lesser extent in both zzso These increases were not reflected in protein levels of zzso and zzso which were similar to or less than zzso Both zzso and zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso levels in both zzso Overall, zzso caused a greater increase and the degree of response by zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso was higher than NL zzso These results indicated that zzso and zzso zzso the zzso levels for zzso and collagen and that they do not affect zzso zzso levels zzso They also indicated different zzso of human lung zzso respond differently to inflammatory zzso
