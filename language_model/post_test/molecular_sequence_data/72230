The zzso zzso protein is an essential component for the degradation of zzso zzso by zzso A in zzso zzso in the human gene coding for the zzso zzso protein cause the AB zzso of zzso a condition that is clinically indistinguishable from zzso zzso To understand better factors affecting the expression of the zzso zzso protein gene zzso in mouse zzso we have determined its zzso organization and analyzed its promoter zzso zzso is about 14 zzso has four zzso and the zzso zzso region contains a zzso box, zzso binding sites, zzso zzso sites, and a pair of zzso zzso A zzso zzso upstream from the initiation zzso was shown to have promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso between the elements present in zzso and zzso promoters might in part explain their similar expression patterns in mouse zzso The different levels of zzso zzso protein zzso in liver, zzso brain, and zzso are not zzso to the use of different zzso start sites, because a single start site was found 50 zzso upstream from the initiation zzso in each these zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated variation in the zzso zzso protein zzso expression during mouse zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso 11, where it zzso with zzso
