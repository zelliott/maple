zzso zzso zzso among others, the two structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso c in zzso zzso This zzso is believed to occur through the binding of the protein to the dissimilar upstream zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso present upstream of zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we describe a novel promoter zzso zzso which results from a zzso deletion located about 160 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso This deletion includes a sequence identical to the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a sequence identical to the zzso part of the zzso zzso is also present 60 zzso downstream of the 3' half in the zzso zzso suggesting that a spatial organization of the promoter might lead to the zzso in zzso of an active zzso zzso Interestingly, we find that in the presence of the zzso zzso which zzso this potential zzso the zzso complex is zzso diminished and the zzso of zzso is insensitive to the zzso zzso zzso
