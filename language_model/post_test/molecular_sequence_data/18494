Two novel zzso designated strains zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso in China and their zzso positions determined by a zzso zzso Key zzso and zzso properties of the two strains were consistent with the description of the zzso zzso The zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the two strains should be classified in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso showed it to be most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of strain zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a combination of zzso zzso results and some zzso characteristics indicated that the two strains can be distinguished from each other and their zzso closest zzso Thus, strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The type strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
