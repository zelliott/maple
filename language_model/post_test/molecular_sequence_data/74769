We have recently reported the isolation of three new members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso the CT zzso zzso peptides zzso We now report the sequencing and characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are identical and have strong structural zzso to zzso identified to date from other zzso As with other zzso zzso zzso binds to and activates the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso in combination with the zzso zzso proteins zzso By contrast, zzso zzso does not activate any of these zzso zzso zzso infusions of zzso zzso to normal conscious sheep induced zzso reduction in plasma total zzso levels zzso and corrected zzso levels zzso associated with increases in plasma zzso zzso zzso reduced both plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso and plasma zzso activity zzso There were no significant effects observed on zzso or zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This newly identified zzso has been shown to share the structural and biological features of zzso known to zzso In zzso studies confirm that zzso zzso reduces plasma zzso levels in zzso presumably via a zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso did not stimulate any combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso numbers of zzso determined in this study are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
