Recent work has demonstrated that the unique zzso editing reaction which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso producing an zzso stop zzso in the modified zzso zzso transcript, is modulated in zzso in the rat liver by zzso hormone zzso We now report the results of studies undertaken to examine the effects of two synthetic zzso zzso and zzso on zzso B gene expression together with their effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were previously shown to exhibit similar binding to the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and 38% of native zzso but differing zzso (18 and less than zzso of native zzso zzso zzso zzso editing, determined by differential zzso of zzso chain reaction amplified zzso B zzso demonstrated zzso unmodified zzso zzso zzso in control and zzso animals and this proportion was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso despite a reduction in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso altered zzso B zzso editing zzso zzso zzso and no zzso zzso synthesis was zzso in zzso Additionally, both zzso zzso produced a zzso to zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso similar to the effects of native zzso zzso produced no zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso abundance and neither zzso zzso zzso or native zzso produced a change in zzso C III zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
