A zzso chain reaction zzso method is described for typing of zzso of the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 30 zzso zzso were distinguished by zzso of zzso amplification products of zzso zzso 2 with zzso zzso and zzso zzso All restriction zzso patterns, with the exception of one zzso pattern, were consistent with restriction sites that were found among 14 previously zzso zzso zzso The zzso typing method was evaluated on zzso zzso DNA samples collected from animals of 10 cattle breeds, 48 of which were typed in the Fourth International zzso Workshop for zzso and zzso by conventional restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis using zzso and zzso DNA zzso Thirty-one zzso zzso containing 23 zzso zzso were identified among the 48 workshop animals zzso Using zzso 11 zzso zzso were identified in 18 workshop animals for which zzso zzso were not zzso zzso typing of additional animals revealed five new zzso zzso of which three contained a zzso located three zzso deletion in the identical position as found for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of zzso in a functionally relevant domain of the zzso gene and should be useful for studying the evolution of zzso zzso in cattle and other zzso
