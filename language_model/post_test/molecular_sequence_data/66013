In zzso zzso and in zzso analyses were used to characterize zzso a zzso accessory zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso and assess its potential ecological function under zzso and symbiotic growth zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of an zzso zzso system, a zzso family zzso replication module and open reading frames zzso type IV zzso system, zzso and zzso zzso proteins and several copper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of growing in 200 zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the closely zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso could not grow at copper zzso exceeding 100 zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes were zzso distinct from those typically found in other zzso species, and were most related to zzso genes from zzso zzso The induction of the zzso zzso genes during zzso was significantly lower than the two zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was used for a comprehensive analysis of the diversity, abundance and genetic composition of accessory plasmids in other zzso zzso zzso were detected in 11 of 46 zzso geographically diverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso isolated from the United States, China and zzso zzso size was heterogeneous, ranging from 75 to 330 zzso with only two strains zzso and zzso harboring plasmids with identical zzso zzso zzso None of the plasmids zzso zzso or zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that while plasmids having ecologically significant functions may be detected in zzso zzso zzso they lack genes necessary for zzso with zzso
