There is increasing evidence for zzso zzso containing multiple imprinted genes and for zzso disruption of zzso in certain zzso In a majority of zzso tumors zzso there is an abnormal zzso pattern of expression at three imprinted zzso zzso zzso and zzso clustered on zzso zzso We previously described zzso expression of zzso 40 zzso downstream of zzso Here we map two additional zzso the first zzso a zzso expressed zzso zzso and the second zzso the fast zzso of skeletal muscle zzso zzso in the 55 zzso of DNA downstream of zzso zzso zzso is spliced and zzso but lacks long open reading zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso and adult human zzso and zzso shows persistent expression in zzso The rat zzso of zzso is highly zzso and lies within 85 zzso of zzso in a region of rat zzso 1 which also contains zzso and zzso Parallel expression of zzso and zzso in different adult skeletal muscle types suggests that these genes may share an zzso These data outline multiple zzso zzso downstream of zzso which escape functional zzso in zzso The zzso zzso of this region may facilitate a search for an zzso domain zzso
