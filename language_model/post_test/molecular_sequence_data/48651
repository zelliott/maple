zzso zzso zzso is one of the common zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso It remains controversial, however, whether zzso itself plays a direct role in the development of zzso Although zzso core, zzso and zzso proteins were reported to display zzso activities in cell culture and experimental animal systems, their clinical impact on zzso development in humans is still zzso In this study we investigated sequence zzso in the core zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in 49 patients who later developed zzso during a follow-up of an average of zzso years and in 100 patients who did not develop zzso after a 15-year zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso at position 70 of the core protein zzso ), zzso at position zzso plus zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso ), and six or more zzso in the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso were significantly associated with development of zzso zzso analysis identified zzso , zzso zzso , and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso as independent factors associated with zzso zzso analysis revealed a higher cumulative zzso of zzso for patients infected with zzso zzso with zzso , zzso zzso or both than for those with zzso plus zzso zzso zzso In most cases, neither the zzso at position 70 of the core protein nor positions zzso and zzso of the zzso protein changed during the observation zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso are more closely associated with zzso development compared to those with zzso plus zzso zzso zzso
