Two zzso zzso from soybean were isolated by screening an expression library using an zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the two zzso were found to be zzso zzso The zzso zzso by the two zzso designated zzso and zzso contain a zzso active site, as found in other zzso zzso was expressed as a fusion protein in zzso coli and shown to possess zzso interchange zzso Unlike other zzso zzso these two soybean zzso contain a putative zzso domain in their zzso zzso To determine zzso location, the zzso was fused with a reporter zzso at its zzso and expressed in transgenic tobacco zzso The fusion protein was zzso with plasma membrane markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating the plasma membrane location of zzso When the reporter zzso was inserted between the start zzso and the zzso domain in the zzso the fusion protein was found in the soluble zzso possibly due to disruption of the zzso domain by the highly zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that soybean zzso is a plasma zzso zzso which is most likely anchored to the membrane through the zzso zzso zzso It is known that plant plasma zzso contain various proteins with zzso interchange zzso The soybean zzso reported here are the first group of such proteins to be characterized at the molecular zzso However, the biological function of the plasma zzso zzso remains to be zzso
