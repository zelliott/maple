The most distinctive variation in the zzso composition of zzso in vascular land plants is that between the two main groups of seed zzso Thus, whereas zzso zzso zzso are typically composed of zzso zzso units, zzso zzso zzso are largely composed of similar levels of G and zzso zzso zzso However, there are some studies that suggest that certain zzso zzso are unable to zzso zzso alcohol, and a zzso alcohol shuttle has been proposed for zzso S units during the zzso of zzso With this in mind, a screening of the presence of S zzso in zzso (including woody species and zzso was zzso zzso to what might be expected, the zzso washing zzso from zzso zzso of 25 zzso zzso and shrub species, belonging to both zzso and zzso all showed both S zzso activities and basic zzso zzso zzso with regard the zzso point, to the zzso zzso basic zzso zzso the only S zzso that has been fully zzso These results led to the protein database in the search for zzso between zzso zzso and a true zzso S zzso the zzso zzso zzso The findings showed that certain structural motifs of S zzso are zzso within the first 15 million years of zzso history, because they are found in zzso from the two major lineages of flowering plants, zzso and zzso of note being the presence of these zzso in zzso and zzso which represent the first stages of zzso zzso These zzso studies also suggest that zzso zzso apparently constitute the most zzso zzso of the plant zzso family zzso
