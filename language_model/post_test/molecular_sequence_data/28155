The complete zzso sequence of the gene for a zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso c) was zzso The zzso gene consisted of zzso zzso and coded for a zzso zzso The zzso gene product contained a putative 38 zzso acid signal zzso resulting in a zzso mature zzso A potential promoter sequence and a putative zzso sequence preceded the open reading zzso Two internal repeating zzso acid sequences were present in the zzso One repeating region located in the zzso region was rich in zzso and the other located in the central region was rich in zzso Southern zzso analysis under the less stringent condition zzso up to zzso base zzso revealed that the probe covering the zzso region zzso to DNA preparations from strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso
