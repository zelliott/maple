We used a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to diagnose zzso zzso The DNA isolated from the nuclear extract obtained from frozen whole blood was found appropriate for zzso study both zzso and zzso The use of freshly frozen whole blood made the field work much easier, and the use of a nuclear extraction procedure allowed DNA isolation in just 4 zzso zzso We could not attain sufficient sensitivity to detect a single zzso with zzso zzso but zzso zzso was confirmed to detect a single zzso All samples of the zzso group including 94 blood donors, 66 mothers, and 13 children were positive in the zzso zzso while none of the zzso group, including 198 blood donors and 285 children, was zzso Although zzso zzso zzso blood samples obtained from babies born to carrier mothers were zzso none of 5 zzso children tested who had been zzso in the zzso blood gave evidence of infection later zzso Furthermore, all of 4 zzso infected children who were zzso had been zzso in their zzso zzso The results are not consistent with zzso infection, but suggest the presence of a zzso or zzso infection route other than through breast zzso
