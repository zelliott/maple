zzso calcium regulation has been implicated as a zzso factor in the zzso of retinal zzso cells zzso in numerous injury models of zzso zzso Since calcium has dual roles in maintaining zzso and triggering zzso pathways in healthy and injured cells, respectively, investigation of zzso zzso channel zzso regulation as a potential strategy to reduce the loss of zzso is zzso The accessibility and structure of the zzso provide advantages for the investigation of the mechanisms of calcium zzso in both the zzso of zzso cells as well as their zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to determine the distribution of zzso zzso in the cell bodies and zzso of zzso cells in the normal zzso and to define their contribution to calcium signals in these cellular zzso We report zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso channel zzso zzso was in zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso was only in the zzso zzso We patch clamped isolated zzso cells and zzso identified zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging studies of zzso in zzso zzso showed that selective zzso channel zzso reduced zzso calcium signals zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso channels in the cell bodies but only by zzso zzso channels in the zzso This differential contribution of zzso zzso to calcium signals in zzso zzso and their zzso may provide insight into the development of zzso strategies to spare the loss of zzso and their zzso following zzso
