To address the role of small regulatory zzso in rice development, we generated a large data set of small zzso from mature leaves and developing roots, zzso and zzso Using a spatial zzso algorithm, we identified zzso zzso groups of small zzso Most consisted of zzso zzso that are expressed in all four zzso and enriched in repeat regions of the zzso zzso clusters were composed primarily of zzso small zzso and, zzso zzso of these contained phased zzso and were zzso expressed in developing zzso zzso of the zzso clusters were also phased and zzso expressed in zzso The phased zzso clusters derive from zzso coding, zzso regions of the zzso and are grouped together into zzso containing zzso zzso The majority of these zzso clusters zzso are flanked by a zzso zzso motif that is offset by 12 zzso from the main phase of the zzso Small zzso complementary to these zzso zzso motifs define a new zzso family, which is zzso in zzso and expressed in developing zzso zzso in both zzso These results suggest that the zzso of phased zzso zzso resembles that of zzso and raise the possibility that these novel small zzso function in early zzso development in rice and other zzso
