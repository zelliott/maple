As a type II zzso protein in zzso zzso collagen zzso provides stable zzso between zzso and zzso in the zzso Its zzso can be shed from the cell surface, and zzso in certain blistering diseases zzso recognize the shed zzso Major zzso of collagen zzso are clustered within the zzso zzso 16th A domain, and zzso shedding occurs within this region, suggesting that zzso generates zzso However, the candidate zzso sites have been controversial, and the mechanism of zzso generation is zzso In this study, we investigated zzso sites in the zzso 16th A domain to understand the generation of zzso and their pathological zzso zzso zzso recognizing the stretch zzso zzso reacted with the shed zzso but not with the full-length form, indicating that a zzso was localized at this zzso The zzso zzso fixed complement and induced zzso zzso separation in zzso of normal human zzso The zzso zzso sites were identified using mass zzso N zzso were found at zzso zzso zzso and zzso among which zzso and zzso were blocked by zzso and zzso In zzso prediction of B cell zzso indicated that the zzso of the zzso region increased substantially after zzso regardless of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the skin and zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reacted with the zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso shedding of collagen zzso generates zzso which may serve as a target of zzso zzso
