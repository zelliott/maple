Many human primary zzso cells can be immortalized by inducing zzso activity through the zzso expression of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso This approach has been extended to the zzso of cell lines from several zzso Here, we show that zzso expression is not sufficient to zzso primary zzso from three zzso species, namely donkey, zzso zebra and zzso zzso In zzso analysis of a zzso zzso composed by zzso and an zzso zzso component of zzso zzso revealed a low activity of this zzso compared to human zzso suggesting a low zzso of zzso and human zzso zzso This conclusion was also strengthened by comparison of human and zzso zzso zzso which revealed zzso differences in key regions for zzso and zzso zzso We then succeeded in zzso zzso zzso by expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso of both human zzso zzso led to zzso activity and zzso zzso indicating that human zzso is compatible with the other zzso zzso zzso and proteins involved in zzso zzso The zzso procedure described zzso could be extended to primary cells from other zzso The availability of zzso cells from endangered species could be particularly useful for obtaining new information on the organization and function of their zzso which is relevant for their zzso
