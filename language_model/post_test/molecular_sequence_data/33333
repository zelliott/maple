Although essential for normal seed development in the zzso the zzso role of the zzso remains zzso We designed zzso nuclear magnetic resonance tools for the in zzso study of key zzso in the transient liquid zzso of intact pea zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso could be monitored and their distribution within the zzso zzso zzso zzso structure was zzso as a three-dimensional model, providing volume information for distinct seed zzso The nuclear magnetic resonance method, combined with laser zzso isotope zzso in zzso zzso and electron zzso was used to contrast the zzso zzso with that of a zzso in which zzso growth is zzso zzso of sequences zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso was zzso earlier in the zzso than in the zzso and this activity led to the zzso of soluble zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso provides a temporary source of nutrition, permits space for zzso growth, and acts as a buffer between the maternal zzso and its zzso The concentration of zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso controlled, while the total amount accumulated depends on the growth of the zzso The zzso concentration of zzso is a limiting factor for protein zzso The properties of the zzso ensure that the young zzso develops within a zzso environment, necessary to sustain zzso We argue for a degree of zzso control exerted by the zzso on the growth of, and zzso storage by, the zzso
