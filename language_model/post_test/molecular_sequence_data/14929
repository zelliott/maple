zzso may play a key role in zzso exchange of gases and in processing organic matter and pollutants that accumulate at the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso diversity of zzso has been poorly zzso We analyzed 24 samples each from the zzso and underlying water zzso at three sites in the zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques were used to compare zzso and zzso zzso zzso bacteria were enriched in the zzso The zzso community was dominated by zzso and zzso The presence of high numbers of zzso was a notable zzso zzso were confined to a few zzso overrepresented in zzso samples zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles were highly stable in terms of number and position of bands between sampling sites and dates but cluster analysis revealed a slight tendency for grouping according to sampled zzso zzso zzso bands affiliated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Low similarity between zzso sequences of zzso and previously reported sequences suggest the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso was questioned and the diversity of both communities was zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso zzso communities were not zzso In terms of zzso a zzso operational zzso unit was consistently overrepresented within zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the similarity between zzso and zzso communities depends on spatial and zzso zzso
