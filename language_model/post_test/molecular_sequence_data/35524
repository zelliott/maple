Heavily zzso zzso or zzso proteins often escape identification by zzso zzso due to weak zzso and low identification rates in zzso The present protocol refers to a chemical zzso zzso of proteins based on repeated zzso of zzso leaving the protein backbone intact at the gel position of the native zzso On zzso prior to spot zzso the zzso proteins are zzso at increased zzso zzso when applying fluorescent zzso or silver zzso Evidence shows that zzso of proteins in gels is efficient and does not introduce structural artifacts into the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as human zzso A, revealed strongly enhanced sequence coverage in zzso zzso The protocol is zzso in zzso and zzso gel settings within one working zzso
