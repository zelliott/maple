zzso zzso is a zzso pathogen that causes zzso or zzso types of food zzso The zzso of zzso zzso food poisoning has been gradually increasing over the past few years, therefore, zzso agents effective against zzso zzso need to be zzso zzso are zzso bacterial zzso zzso and have received considerable attention as promising zzso zzso 

The zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was identified and zzso In zzso analysis revealed that this zzso had the zzso domain at the N zzso as the zzso domain, and the zzso domain at the C zzso that appears to be the cell wall binding zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso activity showed that it had optimal zzso zzso activity at pH zzso and zzso The zzso activity was dependent on zzso metal zzso especially zzso The zzso spectrum was relatively broad because zzso zzso zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and some zzso bacteria when treated with zzso zzso analysis of the cell wall zzso products showed that zzso was an zzso zzso making zzso the first characterized zzso of this type to target zzso zzso 

zzso is believed to be the first reported zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The properties of zzso showed that this zzso has strong zzso activity against a broad range of zzso bacteria, which makes zzso a good candidate as a zzso agent against zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
