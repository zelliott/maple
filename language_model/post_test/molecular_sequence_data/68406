The reported conversion of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso form during attempted zzso of the zzso is highly zzso After failing to obtain zzso ourselves we concluded that the simplest explanation for the published observations would be contamination of zzso cultures with zzso zzso To address this possibility we used a method based on analysis of stable DNA zzso that allows the positive identification of individual zzso zzso The DNA patterns obtained using the zzso zzso proved to be identical to those of reference zzso present in the laboratories at the time of zzso We also found that very few cells need be transferred for a zzso contaminant to become established in a zzso zzso zzso fully explains the conversion phenomenon and thus recognition of zzso and zzso zzso as the distinct species zzso zzso zzso 1925 and zzso zzso zzso 1903 zzso Walker zzso respectively, is zzso
