The concept presented for the calculation of zzso mobility is based on three assumptions: zzso the molecular mass M can be treated as composed of effective mass E and hidden mass zzso M zzso zzso zzso the mobility zzso is zzso to the charge Z and zzso zzso to the effective mass to the power zzso and zzso both E and H are additive functions of zzso zzso acid was chosen as a standard fulfilling the condition M zzso zzso H zzso 0, resulting in the equation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The suggested approach involves the zzso of all special contributions to the hidden mass and calculation of the mobility from the effective mass E zzso M - zzso zzso The total hidden mass involves values dependent on hydrocarbon structure, H zzso dependent on functional groups, H zzso and contributions of certain zzso such as zzso acids in zzso zzso The H alpha contributions for zzso compounds can be expressed as a function of the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso but with the exception of zzso zzso group content in the zzso H alpha for aromatic compounds depends on the nature of the aromatic zzso The special contributions were derived from the zzso of about 200 zzso zzso calculated by the suggested approach indicate an average relative error of zzso zzso for organic acids and zzso zzso for zzso
