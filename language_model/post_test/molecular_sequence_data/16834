The zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso backbone was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso It represents a new zzso zzso fold with a protein chain where the zzso half is left-handed and the zzso half zzso folded around a zzso zzso As seen with other zzso the protein lacks zzso secondary structural zzso however, the zzso fold is zzso The metal coordination and the zzso spacing defines this unique zzso zzso is only the second zzso in the zzso form to be structurally characterized and the first containing the zzso zzso This motif is found in a variety of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso formation of the zzso identical to the native zzso was dependent upon the prior formation of the zzso and its zzso with zzso The enhanced sensitivity and resolution of the 800 zzso zzso spectral data permitted the zzso structure determination of the zzso backbone without the substitution and zzso of the zzso active spin 1/2 metals such as zzso and zzso These restraints have been necessary to establish specific metal to zzso restraints in zzso structural studies on this family of proteins when using lower field, less sensitive zzso spectral zzso The accuracy of the structure calculated without these constraints is, however, supported by the similarities of the 800 zzso structures of the zzso of mouse zzso compared to the one zzso without zzso zzso
