zzso among zzso operation and performance and microbial community structure were investigated for a zzso zzso system designed to remove zzso from drinking zzso zzso removal was monitored to evaluate reactor performance during and after the frequency and intensity of the zzso procedure were changed, while the microbial community structure was studied using clone libraries and quantitative zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso When zzso frequency was increased from once per month to once per day, zzso removal initially deteriorated and then recovered, and the relative abundance of zzso bacteria zzso initially increased and then zzso This apparent zzso suggested that bacterial populations other than zzso played an indirect role in zzso zzso likely by consuming dissolved zzso a competing electron zzso When zzso intensity was increased, the reactor gradually lost its ability to remove zzso and zzso the relative abundance of zzso zzso The results indicated that changes in reactor operation had a profound impact on reactor performance through altering the microbial community zzso zzso is an important yet poorly characterized procedure when operating zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso intensity, changes in zzso frequency exerted less zzso on the microbial community in the current zzso If this finding can be confirmed in future work, zzso frequency may serve as the primary zzso when zzso zzso zzso
