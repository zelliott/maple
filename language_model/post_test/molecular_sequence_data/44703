We have used the zzso differential display technique to isolate genes regulated by the synthetic zzso zzso zzso a cancer zzso agent in zzso and a powerful zzso of zzso cell death in zzso Here we report the identification of a novel zzso the expression of which is markedly zzso in tumor cells after treatment for zzso zzso with zzso The full-length zzso of this zzso determined by screening of a human zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso The gene is zzso zzso zzso to the mouse zzso a gene belonging to the family of zzso motor zzso and we therefore named it zzso zzso zzso zzso A shorter form of the zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso deletion in the open reading frame, has also been zzso Northern analysis revealed that zzso is widely expressed among zzso and zzso cell lines and zzso By the use of radiation hybrids, zzso has been localized to zzso zzso zzso constitute a zzso of motor proteins that use energy liberated from zzso zzso to move cargo along zzso and are implicated in mechanisms of zzso or zzso The role of zzso in the zzso and zzso responses zzso by zzso remains to be zzso
