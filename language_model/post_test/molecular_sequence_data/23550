zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease mainly consist of zzso and zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso that exhibit zzso ability and zzso Although the zzso of zzso peptides are rich in zzso zzso the precise secondary structure of zzso in the zzso remains zzso To identify the zzso acid zzso involved in the zzso formation, 34 zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and their zzso ability and zzso on zzso cells were zzso zzso are rarely present in zzso whereas they are easily zzso in zzso as a zzso zzso Among the zzso at positions zzso only zzso extensively zzso with stronger zzso than zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso at positions 15-21 and zzso are involved in the zzso and that the turn at positions 22 and 23 plays a crucial role in the zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hardly zzso with extremely weak zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with significant zzso These results indicate that the zzso of the zzso two zzso of zzso is not related to its zzso ability and zzso rather the zzso three zzso adopt the zzso These results demonstrate well the large difference in zzso ability and zzso between zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso at the zzso 13 zzso showed potent zzso ability and zzso similar to those of zzso zzso The identification of the zzso region of zzso is a basis for designing new zzso zzso of zzso zzso
