A study of the interaction of zzso organic compounds with the stainless components of a liquid zzso zzso zzso system zzso was carried out to disclose a zzso likely zzso in the zzso analysis of zzso zzso The retention zzso of some representative compounds of different important classes of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was investigated during their passage through the zzso and the stainless steel zzso zzso It became clear that the stainless steel components within the zzso setup were able to retain and trap zzso compounds when these compounds were introduced under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso Their release from these stainless steel parts was accomplished by applying an extreme basic mobile phase zzso ammonium zzso zzso pH zzso From the data collected one could conclude that the availability of a primary zzso group appeared imperative but was not always sufficient to zzso zzso on a stainless zzso Furthermore, the number of zzso zzso seemed to enhance the zzso properties of the molecules and hence roughly correlated with the zzso fraction zzso zzso of the inner surface caused by the mobile phase and the zzso process was found to be an important factor in the course of these zzso zzso
