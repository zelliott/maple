zzso class I typing performed in parallel by molecular biology and zzso has revealed cases where an zzso class I zzso was identified whereas the corresponding zzso was not detected on the cell zzso In the present report, we describe four members of a family in whom an zzso zzso identified at the molecular level was typed as A zzso by zzso This zzso blank zzso was zzso by zzso focusing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the promoter region to the eighth zzso region revealed zzso of a zzso zzso at the beginning of the fourth zzso as compared to the common zzso zzso This zzso causes a frame shift, giving rise to an early stop zzso in the fourth zzso
