zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the first zzso step of the general zzso metabolism in higher zzso The compounds formed are essential for zzso and defense against predators and zzso We recently reported the zzso of this zzso from zzso Jerusalem artichoke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein were used to screen a zzso zzso zzso expression library from zzso Jerusalem zzso allowing isolation of a zzso zzso Typical zzso zzso were identified in this incomplete zzso which was used as a probe for the isolation of a zzso clone in a zzso zzso zzso A full-length open reading frame of zzso base pairs, zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The N zzso essentially composed of zzso zzso matches perfectly the zzso N zzso of the zzso zzso The calculated zzso is zzso in agreement with the zzso behavior and two-dimensional zzso analysis of zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso is induced in wounded plant zzso in correlation with zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein exhibits the most similarity zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso but also good similarity with zzso and zzso or with zzso and zzso zzso According to current criteria, it qualifies as a member of a new zzso zzso
