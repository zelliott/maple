The zzso sequence of zzso zzso at approximately 10 zzso from the right zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The segment contains the zzso zzso one of the five zzso zzso sufficient for zzso zzso Until now, each of these zzso was considered to contain three genes (for regulator, zzso and zzso but a fourth zzso presumably an extra zzso zzso was found at zzso adjacent to the usual cluster of three zzso The two zzso genes are present in opposite orientation, forming an zzso repeat zzso In addition to the four genes at zzso there are 11 complete, zzso open reading frames zzso longer than 300 zzso in the sequence presented zzso A new ABC zzso gene zzso required for zzso resistance was found zzso zzso et zzso zzso and the previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were zzso The sequence of zzso a zzso zzso zzso required substantial correction and the size of zzso is zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso Two zzso show rather weak similarities to animal zzso zzso to an unknown zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso a member of a cluster of at least four zzso zzso The remaining five zzso do not zzso known functions, but three of these show weak to high similarities to other zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and one zzso codes for a particularly zzso zzso
