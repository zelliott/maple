As a powerful tool for gene function zzso gene fusion has been widely studied in zzso and certain groups of zzso but it has been little applied in studies of zzso zzso With the first fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso now available, we defined and collected a set of zzso zzso segments zzso based on structured organized zzso zzso The statistics of the sequence features highlighted the zzso against their random zzso We found that there are three groups of zzso with different component pairs zzso zzso zzso and zzso in all three zzso zzso The proteins zzso by the components of zzso in the first group shown a strong tendency to interact with each zzso The zzso components in the last two groups which did not contain any zzso zzso were found not only to be transcribed to some level, but also more zzso than the random zzso Thus, these segments are possibly carrying certain biologically functional zzso We propose that zzso may be a potential tool for prediction and analysis of function and functional interaction of genetic zzso including both genes and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The full list of the zzso in the zzso of the three zzso is available as supporting information at zzso
