zzso zzso in the developing nervous system are guided in part by repulsive zzso zzso analysis in zzso reported in a companion to this paper, identifies the zzso protein as a candidate zzso for the repulsive guidance zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the characterization of three zzso zzso zzso and show that the zzso zzso protein and at least one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso processed and show specific, zzso binding to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso can repel embryonic spinal motor zzso in cell zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso proteins have an zzso zzso role in zzso guidance as repulsive zzso for zzso zzso
