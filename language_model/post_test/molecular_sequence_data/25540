We report the identification of zzso a novel zzso zzso protein associated with developing cells in both zzso and avian zzso zzso was a zzso for zzso protein zzso C zzso in zzso and the protein was zzso in a zzso manner in cultured cells, indicating that it is a zzso zzso in zzso zzso coding for chick zzso was zzso The deduced sequence revealed an unusual zzso acid composition that zzso resembled that of rat zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Further predicted features of zzso included a zzso zzso site at zzso and the presence of basic zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso by an zzso of approximately zzso zzso whose distribution during chick development resembled that of the corresponding zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed the presence of a single main zzso species in the chick zzso The distribution of zzso during development was analyzed with Western blots and by zzso on tissue zzso In cultured cells the protein appeared to be distributed in a regular spotted pattern below the entire cell zzso In early chick zzso zzso zzso was present in most if not all zzso The protein then became progressively restricted to only some developing zzso and to only certain cells in these zzso In most zzso zzso levels fell below detection limits between zzso and zzso zzso levels of the protein were found in the nervous system, where zzso levels peaked around zzso and where elevated levels were still zzso at zzso
