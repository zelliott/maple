A rapid method for zzso zzso zzso which yields zzso quantities of pure zzso is zzso zzso from zzso plasma was selectively zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso exchange zzso The yield from this procedure was zzso The zzso zzso was composed of an alpha chain zzso zzso and a beta chain zzso zzso linked by at least one zzso bond, and it had an zzso point of zzso zzso acid analysis indicated a strong conservation of zzso acid usage between zzso and human zzso The zzso sequences of the alpha and beta chains were zzso to human, zzso and rat zzso and zzso of zzso produced breakdown products similar in molecular weight to zzso and zzso of other zzso zzso zzso appeared to be functionally dependent upon a zzso zzso as treatment of fresh zzso serum with zzso zzso its zzso zzso
