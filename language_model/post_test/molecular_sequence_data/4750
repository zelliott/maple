zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic studies were carried out on a 5-year-old zzso subject and on her zzso The father was also zzso whereas the mother had zzso of normal zzso zzso Although the typical zzso spectrum of zzso was absent in both the father and daughter, the father's zzso and not those of the daughter, contained material zzso related to zzso In the zzso gene of the father, two zzso were found, each located in a different zzso a T zzso C transition, causing the zzso replacement zzso and a zzso deletion within zzso zzso The zzso substitution occurred in the zzso region of the light chain that is included in the zzso zzso The daughter inherited the zzso deletion from her zzso The study of the zzso zzso present in liquid cultures of zzso precursors surprisingly showed that the same genetic zzso zzso the zzso zzso seemed to exhibit different zzso zzso in the father and the zzso In fact, zzso derived from the zzso zzso was not found in the father and an zzso spliced zzso zzso with a zzso deletion of zzso 9, which includes the zzso deletion and leads to the generation of a premature stop zzso was found in the zzso The possibility that zzso zzso could derive from other zzso linked to the zzso zzso was dismissed because no sequence differences were found in the region zzso and zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso of the zzso context caused by the zzso deletion provide a basis for the zzso deletion in the zzso zzso Since the zzso precursors from the liquid cultures of the father were more differentiated than those from the daughter, the observed different behavior of the zzso zzso in the father and daughter may be the result of a zzso dependent control of altered spliced zzso which may be tolerated during the early stages of differentiation but zzso at later zzso In the liquid cultures of the daughter's cells, in addition to the zzso with the zzso zzso a zzso with the wild type sequence was also zzso This zzso was inherited from the mother, since no zzso were found in her zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso might be caused by a regulatory zzso that zzso the zzso gene switch off at an early stage of zzso zzso
