zzso of zzso signaling 1-3 zzso were identified in a functional screen of zzso zzso that activated zzso signaling in the absence of a zzso We report the isolation and characterization of an additional zzso protein zzso from a human prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso is identical to zzso which is zzso by a gene within the major zzso class III region of zzso zzso The activity of zzso in the zzso functional screen was selective for zzso and independent of zzso exchange by zzso zzso blots indicated enrichment of zzso zzso in heart, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso indicated a zzso zzso zzso distribution within the cell following expression in zzso or Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso regulatory motifs downstream of an zzso zzso domain with multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins zzso with zzso zzso and peptides derived from each of the zzso regulatory motifs inhibited zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso was also zzso with zzso in zzso cell zzso following cell zzso However, zzso did not alter the generation of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest either that an additional signal is required to position zzso in the proper cellular location where it can access zzso and promote zzso zzso or that zzso serves as an alternative binding partner for zzso independent of zzso participating in zzso signaling events that are independent of classical zzso receptors at the cell zzso
