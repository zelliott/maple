zzso factor zzso is the cellular zzso for an activated form of zzso factor zzso zzso and the binding of factor zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and structural patterns extracted from a global alignment of zzso zzso zzso with zzso receptors of the zzso zzso super zzso Several recent studies suggested that zzso could function as a genuine signal zzso zzso However, it is unknown which biological zzso of cells are altered upon the zzso zzso binding to zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso binding to cell surface zzso on cellular gene expression in zzso zzso zzso display zzso technique was used to identify zzso changes in zzso upon zzso binding to zzso The display showed that zzso binding to zzso either up or zzso several zzso zzso The differential expression of one such transcript, zzso zzso was confirmed by Northern zzso zzso Isolation of a full-length zzso corresponding to the zzso expressed transcript revealed that zzso gene was zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of various zzso and normal human zzso revealed an over expression of zzso in cancer zzso zzso expression of zzso upon zzso binding to tumor cell zzso may potentially play an important role in tumor zzso
