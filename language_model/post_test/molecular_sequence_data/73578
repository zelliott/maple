The sequences of the entire blue zzso gene in the zzso monkey zzso zzso and the five zzso of the human blue zzso gene were zzso zzso 3 of these genes contains an zzso sequence and zzso 4 contains a partial zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso monkey zzso sequence with published zzso zzso sequences shows that features believed to be functionally critical are all zzso However, the blue zzso has evolved twice as fast as zzso and is only as conservative as the beta zzso which has evolved at the average rate of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso are, on average, actually more conservative than the zzso alpha zzso zzso The zzso of the blue zzso gene have evolved at the average rate of zzso in zzso zzso
