The zzso zzso assembles on DNA to execute zzso DNA zzso zzso This process is essential to repair zzso zzso zzso before cells enter zzso but how it is started and stopped during the cell cycle remains poorly zzso zzso assembly is regulated by the breast cancer zzso zzso via its zzso zzso zzso repeats, and a distinct zzso zzso motif whose biological function is zzso Using zzso gene targeting to insert zzso zzso into the avian zzso zzso we report here a previously zzso role for the zzso zzso 

We show that the avian zzso motif is functionally zzso with its human counterpart and identify point zzso that either abolish or enhance zzso zzso When these zzso are introduced into zzso we find that they affect neither the assembly of zzso into nuclear zzso on damaged DNA nor DNA repair by zzso Instead, zzso zzso more rapidly in a point zzso that fails to bind zzso associated with faster zzso zzso zzso the slower zzso of zzso in a point zzso that zzso binds zzso zzso with delayed zzso Indeed, zzso zzso do not persist in zzso cells even after zzso checkpoint suppression, suggesting that their zzso is a prerequisite for zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso binding by the zzso zzso motif is zzso for the execution of zzso but instead links the zzso of zzso complexes to zzso zzso This mechanism may ensure that zzso zzso before zzso zzso Our findings assign a biological function for the zzso zzso motif in a mechanism that coordinates DNA repair with the cell zzso
