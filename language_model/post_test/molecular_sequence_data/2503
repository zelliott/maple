A zzso clone zzso for plant zzso was isolated by screening a potato zzso tip zzso library with a chicken zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso revealed that it contained 80 base pairs of zzso untranslated region, the entire coding region, and 376 base pairs of 3' untranslated zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of coding regions of potato and chicken zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequence of potato zzso with other known zzso sequences indicated a high degree of zzso with a few zzso Three changes in the zzso acid sequence were found to be unique to the potato zzso zzso In our earlier studies we showed the involvement of calcium and zzso in potato zzso The zzso clone was used as a probe to study the expression of zzso zzso during zzso and to monitor zzso zzso level in various parts of the potato zzso zzso tips showed the highest levels of zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso was used to investigate the effect of zzso and light on zzso gene expression in zzso zzso fruit and zzso zzso corn roots, zzso Both zzso and light signals were found to increase the level of zzso for zzso These results suggest that the altered zzso gene expression could be one of the molecular events involved in the signal zzso process in zzso
