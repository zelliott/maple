zzso zzso 1) is a zzso toxin with three zzso bridges that has been isolated from the zzso of the Mexican scorpion zzso zzso zzso Here we report the chemical zzso zzso bridge organization, 3-D zzso solution structure determination, pharmacology on zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso indicated zzso pairs between zzso zzso and zzso The 3-D structure of zzso zzso by zzso showed that it folds according to the common zzso scaffold of scorpion zzso In zzso zzso was lethal after zzso injection to mice zzso value of zzso zzso In zzso zzso tested on cells expressing various zzso or zzso zzso zzso channels showed potent zzso of currents from rat zzso ( zzso value of 27 zzso zzso also zzso zzso with zzso zzso for binding to zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso on rat brain zzso zzso value of zzso zzso The 3-D structure of zzso was used in zzso experiments which suggests a key role of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in its interaction with the rat zzso zzso In addition, a zzso analogue zzso was zzso The two zzso replacements were selected aiming to restore the zzso motif in order to increase zzso affinity towards zzso channels, and to alter the zzso zzso moment such that it is expected to decrease zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited an activity similar to that of zzso towards zzso channels, while it was markedly more potent on zzso and several zzso zzso zzso
