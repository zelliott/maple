zzso zzso possess the capacity to zzso under various environmental conditions zzso to zzso zzso This zzso capacity is generally monitored using zzso activity zzso zzso zzso hormones zzso zzso growth zzso or their zzso zzso To date, few studies addressed the genetic zzso of adaptation to varying zzso at a molecular level in such zzso In the sea bass zzso zzso genetic differentiation was observed at specific zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso response of zzso zzso to zzso and freshwater zzso in two zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso By using suppression zzso zzso we zzso zzso partial zzso sequences zzso proteins potentially involved in the metabolism of sea bass zzso to zzso or freshwater under experimental zzso Using these results, we first zzso complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso and then zzso zzso expression of genes potentially involved in zzso mechanisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulation zzso and immune system zzso in zzso and zzso of wild fish from open sea and zzso Our analyses indicate a strong zzso and zzso expression pattern for all the genes zzso A zzso approach such as described in the present paper provides thus a first description of genes involved in zzso or structural functions important for coping with environmental zzso variations in a zzso fish like the common sea bass zzso zzso It should be supplemented by zzso to check the direct involvement of the gene products at the protein level, and by zzso analyses if one is to understand population or individual fluctuations in zzso to zzso zzso
