zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso Through a zzso of disorder, we localized a folded zzso domain in the zzso acid sequence of its zzso This domain consists of an autonomous folding unit that is zzso in zzso Its structure, solved by X-ray zzso reveals a zzso structure zzso five zzso The structure is different from that of the corresponding zzso of other zzso zzso and zzso only the overall zzso of the zzso chain seems to be zzso suggesting that this domain evolved under weak selective pressure and varied in size by the acquisition or loss of functional zzso
