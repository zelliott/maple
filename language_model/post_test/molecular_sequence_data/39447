The synthesis of proteins in the zzso zzso zzso is limited by the rate of correct zzso bond zzso This process is carried out by protein zzso zzso a family of zzso proteins which includes general zzso such as zzso that recognize unfolded proteins and others that are selective for specific proteins or zzso Using zzso X-ray scattering and X-ray zzso we report the structure of a selective zzso zzso and its interactions with the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that the zzso domain of zzso binds zzso with zzso affinity through a zzso patch of basic zzso zzso of this binding site by zzso abrogates folding of zzso B in an in zzso zzso The relative positions of the zzso zzso sites and zzso binding site suggest that zzso by zzso is due to zzso recruitment rather than a direct stimulation of zzso zzso zzso
