DNA sequences derived from the zzso region of a gene coding for the zzso skeletal zzso protein zzso of sea zzso zzso zzso were linked to the zzso reporter gene and injected into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso from these fusion zzso in zzso derived from these eggs, and in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso probe demonstrated that expression is confined to zzso zzso zzso A mean of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso a result consistent with earlier zzso indicating that incorporation of the zzso injected DNA probably occurs in a single zzso during early zzso In zzso zzso and deletion experiments showed that zzso zzso activity in the transgenic zzso is enhanced zzso by decreasing the number of zzso zzso acids at the zzso of the fusion protein from 43 to zzso zzso sequences that are sufficient to promote zzso spatial expression in the zzso are located between zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso initiation zzso
