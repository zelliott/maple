The zzso circular zzso zzso of zzso zzso Sydney strain, zzso was zzso zzso and structurally zzso The zzso strain is widely used in animal studies of zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso revealed three open reading frames zzso all of which are zzso Two zzso zzso putative zzso replication zzso zzso and zzso similar to zzso resident on zzso zzso In contrast, the function of zzso remains cryptic due to the absence of sequence similarity with any known protein in sequence zzso In addition, species specificity of these three coding regions was shown using DNA dot zzso zzso in 57 diverse clinical zzso zzso zzso and 32 zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to be the zzso zzso replication protein of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence was highly zzso zzso in 8 zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso was detected in 3 zzso zzso zzso examined in this study, 2 of which possess only the zzso zzso Analysis of the protein sequences of these two zzso together with previously characterized zzso zzso zzso replication zzso supports the formation of a distinct class of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, comprehensive analysis of the whole zzso sequence of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso sequences that are available revealed interesting insights as to the occurrence of zzso zzso within zzso zzso Common regions between plasmids and zzso sequences of zzso zzso were identified in this study which could only have arisen by genetic zzso thus providing the first line of evidence, albeit zzso of the contribution of zzso zzso plasmids in generating an extensive genetic zzso characteristic of this important zzso zzso
