zzso is a short zzso zzso from zzso which is transcribed by zzso pol zzso Its zzso is highly abundant in the brain, where it exerts a zzso regulatory role in zzso Upon transcription, zzso and zzso zzso gives rise to a zzso of short zzso repetitive sequences zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso can become integrated inside zzso regions of zzso pol II zzso units, and - although challenged by a couple of reports - their preferential location to zzso genes has been long zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso role in the control of zzso pol zzso transcripts has been suggested for these zzso In this work we used Northern zzso and in zzso analyses to examine zzso location among pol II zzso units in different zzso and in zzso zzso ID sequences appeared distributed in a similar fashion within zzso zzso populations of the brain, zzso and liver, and within zzso primary transcripts as zzso Moreover, when the lengths of the zzso transcripts were considered, ID representation was higher in zzso zzso On the other hand, ID elements appeared similarly distributed among the different gene regions, with the obvious exclusion of those sequences where strict constraints for proper gene expression zzso Altogether, the widespread distribution of ID elements in all the analyzed genes - including zzso - and in all gene regions, suggests a random location, raising questions about the specific zzso role of those zzso
