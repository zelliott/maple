zzso elements are found in abundance throughout the human zzso but only rarely have zzso of zzso genes by zzso insertions been zzso zzso we report that a human zzso zzso zzso type C is inserted in the human growth factor gene zzso zzso between the zzso untranslated and the coding zzso This insert in the human zzso expands the region relative to the zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso show that the zzso insert in the human zzso gene generates an additional promoter with zzso zzso Due to this promoter function, fusion transcripts between zzso and the open reading frame of zzso zzso were detected in all normal human zzso cell cultures as early as 9 weeks after gestation zzso zzso 7) and in all term zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) but not in other normal adult zzso Furthermore, only zzso zzso cell lines expressed zzso zzso whereas tumor cell lines derived from the zzso zzso or from other lineages failed to do zzso We investigated the significance of zzso zzso in a zzso model by targeting this transcript with zzso and found that the depletion of zzso zzso prevents human zzso growth, invasion, and zzso in zzso This suggests that the zzso expression of zzso due to the zzso zzso in the human zzso supports the highly aggressive growth of human zzso and possibly of the human zzso
