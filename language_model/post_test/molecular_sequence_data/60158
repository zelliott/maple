The zzso zzso zzso is involved in the genetic switch between the zzso and zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso The solution structure of its zzso zzso domain, which holds together the two zzso zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso This structure reveals an assembly of four zzso zzso consisting of a zzso of two zzso coiled coils with a unique right-handed zzso The zzso winding is considerably stronger and the zzso separation closer than those found in the well-known left-handed coiled coils in zzso proteins and zzso zzso An unusual asymmetry arises between the two zzso that comprise one right-handed coiled zzso A difference in the packing to the adjacent zzso of the other coiled zzso occurs with an offset of two zzso zzso The two zzso zzso within each coiled zzso zzso on a time scale of zzso Both with respect to symmetry and zzso of zzso zzso the C2 zzso zzso bundle of zzso differs from other zzso zzso that assemble zzso zzso such as that in the tumor zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso
