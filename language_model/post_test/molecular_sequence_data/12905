zzso zzso of the zzso is an uncommon benign zzso that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso studies nor molecular genetic analyses of the zzso gene have been reported previously for this zzso The authors describe two cases of clear cell zzso zzso of the zzso both of which were initially confused with zzso zzso cell zzso Both zzso showed positive zzso zzso for low and intermediate molecular weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso Each was negative for zzso Because clear cell zzso zzso is similar to zzso cell zzso zzso and because both occur as components of the von zzso disease complex, the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene zzso was detected in one of the two tumors by zzso chain reaction followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed a zzso to zzso transition at zzso zzso resulting in the replacement of an zzso with a stop zzso after the sixth zzso acid of zzso zzso As the zzso gene is believed to function as a tumor zzso zzso zzso gene zzso may play a role in the initiation of zzso in sporadic zzso of the zzso
