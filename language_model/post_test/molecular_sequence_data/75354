To identify which zzso zzso determine the zzso zzso binding sites on A beta zzso zzso Ak beta genes were constructed zzso single or multiple zzso acids of the d zzso at 14 zzso positions in the beta 1 zzso Cell lines expressing these genes were analyzed by quantitative zzso using 16 zzso zzso to Ak beta or Ad zzso zzso of d zzso zzso at positions 63 and zzso in the Ak beta zzso resulted in the loss of binding of all Ak zzso zzso and the gain of binding of most Ad zzso zzso Two Ad zzso zzso bound to the zzso Ak beta zzso containing d zzso zzso at position zzso In contrast, substitution of the other zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso regions of the beta 1 domain did not alter zzso zzso
