This work was carried out to complete the sequence of the arc cluster involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and particularly to characterize the genes zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso 

Using molecular zzso two zzso zzso proteins involved in the zzso zzso were zzso Their expression patterns were monitored by zzso to study the influence of zzso on their zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso performed directly on colonies with primer pairs specific of arc genes was used to discriminate strains zzso to degrade zzso 

zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso similar zzso Their expression is not influenced by zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The inability to use zzso is due to a lack of genetic information zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso expression of zzso genes points to the positive role of zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso The occasional presence of all the arc zzso genes together in zzso zzso strains might provide insights into the growth rate zzso within this zzso
