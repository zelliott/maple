The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to mediate a number of zzso effects in zzso brain and zzso Previous studies suggested that alternative zzso might contribute to zzso zzso diversity as zzso We now report that alternative zzso in human and rat zzso produces four zzso zzso zzso that differ in their predicted zzso zzso zzso Human and rat partial zzso zzso and zzso sequences were identified and zzso In rat zzso three zzso zzso here called zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso forms arise from alternative zzso donor zzso A third new zzso found in zzso zzso zzso results from a retained zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso were also identified in human zzso where only one zzso was previously zzso Two human zzso represent zzso and zzso forms zzso and zzso but the third form does not zzso to zzso Instead, it constitutes a distinct zzso zzso zzso resulting from retention of a separate zzso zzso zzso transcripts are not present in rat because the zzso zzso is absent from the rat zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso is present in the human gene but is not used in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso differences are present in human between brain and zzso These studies suggest that alternative zzso may contribute to diversity of zzso zzso action and that the human and rat zzso of zzso zzso zzso are substantially zzso
