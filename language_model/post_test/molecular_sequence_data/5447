We have identified a zzso zzso brain zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso that is localized between zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso disease gene zzso A, zzso at zzso The zzso shows zzso identity to the previously identified zzso 1 zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 263 (1988) zzso and probably represents a recent zzso of this parent zzso 1 zzso Although the typical features of a processed zzso are present, the open reading frame zzso of this zzso zzso is potentially zzso There are 11 zzso changes in the zzso zzso ORF, none of which are nonsense zzso or zzso The region upstream from the zzso shows some features of a possible promoter region, although it lacks a zzso island often associated with functional zzso We analyzed the expression of this zzso 1 zzso using zzso followed by restriction zzso zzso based on a 1 zzso zzso in this zzso to distinguish it from normal zzso 1 gene zzso With this sensitive method, we could not find expression in any of the zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude that the zzso 1 zzso upstream from zzso 2 of the zzso gene is likely to be a processed zzso originating from a very recent zzso of a zzso 1 zzso To our knowledge this is the first report of a zzso located within a zzso
