zzso zzso and zzso zzso catalyze the zzso zzso zzso of zzso acids to the corresponding zzso and sequence zzso between these zzso clearly indicates the existence of an zzso zzso related by divergent zzso We have undertaken structural studies on a number of members of this family in order to investigate the molecular basis of their differential zzso acid zzso 

We have solved the X-ray structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso Each zzso of this zzso zzso contains 364 zzso acids and folds into two zzso separated by a deep zzso The zzso ring of the zzso zzso binds deep in this zzso which is thought to close during the hydride transfer step of the zzso zzso 

zzso of the structure of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso has shown that these two zzso share a related fold and possess a similar zzso zzso A mechanism for the basis of the differential zzso acid specificity between these zzso involves point zzso in the zzso acid zzso specificity pocket and subtle changes in the shape of this pocket caused by the differences in zzso zzso
