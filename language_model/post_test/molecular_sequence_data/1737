Due to their high sequence diversity even among closely related species, satellite DNA sequences can be a useful molecular marker for zzso and zzso zzso To characterize the satellite DNA in the zzso of a native zzso species of Taiwan, the zzso zzso satellite DNA clones representing three different zzso satellite DNA families from this species were isolated and zzso zzso organization study of these satellite zzso was also zzso Three zzso zzso satellite DNA clones were obtained and designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and found to share approximately 82, 81 and zzso sequence zzso with the Chinese zzso satellite I clone zzso Indian zzso satellite II clone zzso and Chinese zzso satellite IV clone zzso zzso These three satellite DNA families are organized in a zzso orientation in the zzso region with zzso closely associated with the zzso zzso Satellite DNA sequence comparison, in combination with zzso data concludes that the zzso zzso is likely a subspecies of zzso zzso closely related to the Chinese zzso With the zzso satellite II DNA zzso with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso could be truly zzso
