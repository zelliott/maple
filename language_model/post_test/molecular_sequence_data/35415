During the establishment of an infection, bacterial pathogens encounter zzso stress resulting in the production of DNA zzso Majority of these zzso are repaired by base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso these, zzso sites are the most frequent zzso in zzso Class II zzso (AP) zzso play a major role in zzso of damaged DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a deadly zzso resides in the human zzso and is continually subjected to zzso zzso We have characterized for the first time two zzso zzso namely zzso IV zzso and zzso III zzso that perform distinct functions in zzso We demonstrate that zzso End is a typical zzso zzso while zzso is predominantly a zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity of End and zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso and displayed a preferential recognition for zzso site paired opposite to a zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, End exhibited metal zzso independent zzso zzso activity while in the case of zzso this activity was metal zzso zzso We demonstrate that End is not only a more efficient zzso zzso than zzso but it also represents the major zzso zzso activity in zzso and plays a crucial role in defense against zzso zzso
