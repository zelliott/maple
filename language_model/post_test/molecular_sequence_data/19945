zzso analyzes patterns in zzso protein sequences and predicts if a protein spends at least some time in the nucleus or no time at zzso zzso location of proteins represents functional information, which is important for understanding protein zzso for the diagnosis of human diseases and for drug zzso zzso is a novel web tool based on regular expression matching and multiple program zzso induced by genetic zzso A likelihood score is derived from the programs for each input sequence and each zzso zzso Different forms of zzso are provided to assist the detection of nuclear zzso signals zzso The zzso server also provides access to additional sources of biological information zzso and zzso for a better validation and interpretation of zzso 

The web interface to the zzso tool is provided at zzso In addition, the zzso code is made freely available under the zzso Public zzso zzso for simple incorporation into other tools and web zzso
