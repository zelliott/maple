We cloned and characterized a new highly zzso zzso DNA sequence from turkey zzso zzso This repeat family, which accounts for approximately zzso of the turkey zzso consists of a 41 zzso repeated element that is present in tandem zzso longer than 23 zzso In zzso zzso to turkey zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this sequence was located primarily on certain zzso approximately one-third of the 66 zzso showed a positive zzso With respect to the zzso zzso was seen only in a zzso position on zzso 2 and zzso The turkey zzso zzso sequence shares motifs zzso zzso and zzso clusters separated by zzso zzso that have been found previously in other avian zzso repeated zzso zzso a chicken zzso zzso and W zzso zzso sequences of chicken and zzso However, the TM sequence does not zzso under moderately stringent conditions with these other zzso The spread and amplification of related repetitive sequence elements on zzso and W zzso is zzso
