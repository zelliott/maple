Several human zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 49 zzso The zzso protein is 50% identical in DNA sequence and zzso identical in protein sequence compared with the previously cloned human zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with human zzso also yielded similar results, with 51% identity in DNA sequence and zzso identity in protein zzso The expressed zzso protein is functionally active because it possesses zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso when zzso to a promoter, and binds zzso factor zzso Similar to zzso and zzso zzso is zzso expressed in many different cell zzso
