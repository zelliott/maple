zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that plays an important role in combating a wide range of pathogens and contributes innate protective defenses of zzso 

We cloned and zzso the full-length zzso for zzso from Taiwan zzso The zzso activity and zzso ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined and compared with those of human zzso zzso 

The complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso precursor with a zzso signal zzso The zzso sequence of zzso showed the highest identity to the zzso monkey zzso zzso whereas the putative zzso acid sequence of zzso showed the highest identity to the zzso zzso The zzso and natural zzso showed almost equivalent zzso activities against zzso zzso and zzso presented a slightly lower activity against zzso zzso than natural zzso In addition, the patterns of iron release from zzso and zzso were nearly zzso
