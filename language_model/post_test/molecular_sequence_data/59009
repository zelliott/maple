Recent evidence suggests that zzso zzso formation from the zzso is regulated by zzso signaling pathways involving small zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso At the cell surface, protein zzso and zzso on zzso zzso can rapidly zzso zzso signaling pathways in response to zzso stimuli and have been implicated in the zzso and sorting of signaling zzso to determine if zzso metabolism might also regulate zzso zzso budding from the zzso we treated zzso rat zzso zzso cells with zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zinc zzso inhibited budding of nascent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso also prevented zzso zzso release, suggesting that zzso formation requires both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso of the small zzso protein zzso zzso factor 1 zzso antagonized the zzso effect of zzso indicating that both agents influence the same zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that protein zzso zzso was enhanced after treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso identified several zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso approximately zzso and zzso zzso that were enriched in zzso zzso zzso and tightly membrane zzso The zzso of these zzso correlated with zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest that in zzso cells, protein zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso release from the zzso
