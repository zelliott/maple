A zzso zzso catalyst is shown to carry out the chemistry required for zzso being zzso several times from zzso with an zzso rate, thereby meeting one definition of an zzso Furthermore, a newly applied gel zzso zzso suggests first order zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is a competitive zzso though zzso is not zzso zzso consistent with a zzso complex through the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This idea is supported by measurement of elevated zzso zzso with zzso and zzso The rate of zzso increases with zzso consistent with attack of a terminal zzso zzso on the zzso carbon atom of the zzso
