The zzso sequences of genes zzso to the zzso zzso zzso genes have been determined in zzso zzso zzso The coding regions for the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso are linked, and separated by 95 zzso In the region of 12 zzso that separates zzso from zzso the stop zzso for zzso zzso the putative zzso binding site for zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso genes are linked to the zzso genes in the same zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso and zzso genes reveals considerable zzso between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso Several protein zzso containing highly zzso zzso zzso are zzso among the gene products of zzso zzso zzso and zzso This result allows us to propose a probable evolutionary zzso for the common origin of these zzso
