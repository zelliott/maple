zzso gene deletion is now available for molecular genetic research of zzso and the zzso roles of several genes have been zzso However, this method cannot be applied to essential zzso which can be potential drug zzso To overcome this zzso we have developed a conditional gene zzso system using a zzso zzso The promoter sequence of the copper zzso gene zzso zzso and that of the copper zzso pump gene zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso were examined for their response to copper in zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to repress expression of a reporter gene in the presence of copper, while the activity of zzso was induced by addition of zzso zzso zzso regulated the gene expression more zzso Furthermore, when zzso was applied to regulate the expression of the zzso genes zzso and zzso their conditional zzso exhibited decreased growth activity under the repressive zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene regulation system represents a powerful tool for identification and characterization of a broad range of zzso including essential zzso in zzso
