For use as an zzso agent, a zzso inhibitor must be potent and specific, zzso it should not significantly inhibit the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso systems zzso zzso and zzso Previous evaluation of potency and specificity has been based on zzso zzso zzso zzso However, consideration of the kinetic parameters for natural plasma zzso zzso zzso indicates that a low Ki value with zzso is not zzso the inhibited complex must also form zzso Moreover, potent zzso of activated protein C and zzso could be tolerated providing the inhibited complex only forms zzso An ideal profile of kinetic parameters with zzso activated protein C and zzso is formulated and discussed in relation to various classes of zzso zzso zzso of kinetic data for zzso zzso currently in clinical trials zzso and zzso indicates that they possess this ideal profile of kinetic zzso
