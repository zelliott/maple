zzso is a zzso zzso with excellent zzso activity against mouse zzso and it is a potent inhibitor of protein zzso zzso zzso This compound has been predicted to zzso bind to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso via a zzso addition zzso However, this binding has not yet been zzso zzso To confirm such zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso which has an zzso activity against the proliferation of mouse leukemia zzso We showed that zzso directly binds to zzso in zzso zzso cells by pull-down zzso using zzso Moreover, we directly demonstrated that zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso assisted laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso From these results, the zzso mechanism of zzso on zzso activity is zzso
