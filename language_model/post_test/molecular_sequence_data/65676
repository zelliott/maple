zzso protein zzso ranks among the most important zzso zzso and zzso of zzso sites is essential to understand the regulation of key cellular processes such as signal zzso zzso of zzso peptides is a prerequisite for successful analysis due to their low zzso zzso and low zzso zzso is often performed zzso which is inherently zzso and a major hindrance in large-scale zzso zzso of the enrichment method would vastly improve zzso and thereby facilitate zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a robust and automated online zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso approach to selectively enrich zzso peptides from zzso of complete cellular zzso We demonstrate method enhancement for both zzso and zzso of zzso peptides resulting in lower limits of zzso zzso peptides from a mere 500 zzso zzso digest of a protein mixture were easily zzso With the combination of strong zzso exchange zzso with the online zzso 2 enrichment, zzso zzso were enriched from 250 zzso of protein originating for the cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This is a zzso improvement when compared to an enrichment strategy based solely on strong zzso zzso zzso enrichment methods are zzso biased against relatively basic zzso Analysis of the p I zzso of the zzso zzso showed that the p I profile resembles that of a total zzso protein zzso revealing that the current described online procedure does not discriminate against either more zzso or basic zzso However, careful comparison of our new and existing zzso enrichment techniques also reveal that, like many enrichment techniques, we are still far from comprehensive zzso zzso and we describe several factors that still require to be zzso Still, as the online approach allows the complementary zzso of zzso and their zzso counterparts in subsequent zzso this method is zzso for automated quantitative zzso
