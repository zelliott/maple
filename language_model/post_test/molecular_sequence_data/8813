The mouse W locus encodes zzso the zzso zzso zzso for stem cell factor zzso Kit is required for several zzso zzso including the proliferation and survival of zzso Because of the nearly complete failure of zzso zzso to colonize the skin, the costs of zzso mice are characterized by a majority of white hairs zzso among pigmented zzso giving a zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso mice exhibit zzso zzso zzso spots of zzso color on their coats with an otherwise zzso zzso zzso cell lines were derived from each of six independent zzso spots on the skin of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All six zzso cell lines exhibited the general characteristics common to normal, zzso mouse zzso Of these, three zzso cell lines had lost the zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso between the zzso and the W zzso One of the cell lines remained zzso but showed zzso stimulation in response to zzso and zzso increased Kit zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso can be rescued by increased zzso expression of the zzso zzso Finally, two cell lines showed no zzso genetic change at the zzso locus and failed to respond to zzso stimulation in zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso can create large patches of zzso hair on the coats of zzso zzso zzso This shows that zzso zzso occurs spontaneously in normal healthy tissue in zzso Moreover, these experiments confirm that other mechanisms, not associated with loss of zzso may account for the coat color zzso zzso
