zzso in a gene zzso zzso a novel zzso protein in zzso zzso lead to the formation of zzso cells in the zzso central nervous system and in the zzso cells of adult egg zzso Some zzso zzso survive to adulthood and also exhibit zzso defects indicative of abnormal cell cycle zzso including rough eyes, missing zzso and abnormal abdominal zzso In zzso zzso there is no zzso of zzso cells and the frequency of zzso figures is comparable to wild type, suggesting that nuclear division is not zzso Such brains contain zzso cells with zzso and zzso zzso associated with bipolar zzso Such zzso have a number of zzso zzso at their poles reflecting the degree of zzso of the zzso zzso cells frequently contain two zzso of roughly equal zzso Taken together, we conclude that these zzso zzso lead to a failure of zzso resulting in zzso and discuss whether or not this is a direct effect of the zzso
