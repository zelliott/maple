Local zzso systems zzso exist in many cell types, and zzso II zzso has growth regulatory effects in some zzso We demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso zzso in cultured human zzso cells zzso and zzso human zzso cells using reverse zzso and the zzso chain reaction zzso followed by zzso to a human zzso zzso zzso We speculated, therefore, that zzso might act in an zzso or zzso fashion to regulate the growth of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were next zzso complementary to the zzso zzso start zzso zzso but not sense zzso decreased zzso incorporation into DNA by both zzso and zzso zzso Growth of zzso zzso cells was restored to control levels by the addition of zzso but not by the addition of basic zzso growth zzso Neither zzso affected zzso incorporation in mouse zzso zzso These data indicate that locally produced zzso can act in an zzso or zzso fashion to alter the growth of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso they suggest a role for local zzso in the zzso of growth abnormalities in the cardiovascular system as well as in some forms of zzso
