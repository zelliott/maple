The zzso associated with tumor zzso was the name given to the zzso that tends to zzso resulting in slower moving in a zzso zzso gel zzso than normal zzso zzso zzso zzso A complementary DNA zzso library was constructed from a human zzso cancer cell line, zzso which zzso an amount of zzso into the culture zzso and screened with zzso zzso zzso against zzso and normal zzso One of six zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso recognized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed by zzso in zzso coli also had zzso zzso recognized by the other zzso against normal zzso The zzso pair zzso sequence zzso by zzso was identical to the stem region sequence of zzso which encodes a full-length zzso of human zzso Using zzso proteins directed by deletion zzso zzso the zzso zzso recognized by each zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso which zzso to both the zzso and normal zzso was localized to the zzso side of zzso zzso site where the zzso form zzso is zzso to be converted to soluble forms, while zzso zzso was at the zzso side from this zzso site between the zzso end of the zzso domain and the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is produced by zzso zzso zzso at the different site, closer to the zzso domain, from the normal zzso
