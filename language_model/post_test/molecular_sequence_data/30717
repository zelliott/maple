To investigate the role of charged chain ends in the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso were zzso and tested in isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso to 1 zzso zzso the zzso production of zzso zzso cells, whereas these peptides did not stimulate the zzso production of zzso zzso cells, even at 1 zzso zzso As zzso has been shown to have a zzso effect on both types of zzso cells, both charged chain zzso seem to be essential for triggering of the zzso production of zzso zzso cells, but for zzso production their presence appears not to be zzso
