zzso zzso is a rapidly evolving technology that has gone from the first zzso studies to more demanding zzso profiling applications, during the last zzso zzso zzso can be printed with large number of zzso zzso predetermined zzso capable of targeting zzso as well as zzso zzso in complex, zzso zzso zzso the resolution of such zzso profiling efforts correlate directly to the number of zzso included, which today is a key limiting zzso To overcome this bottleneck and to be able to perform in-depth global zzso surveys, we propose to interface affinity zzso with zzso zzso as outlined in this technical zzso Briefly, we have defined a range of zzso zzso each motif being present in zzso different zzso In this manner, 100 zzso binding 100 different motifs commonly distributed among different zzso would potentially target a protein cluster of zzso individual zzso zzso around 50% of the zzso human zzso zzso these zzso zzso would be directly zzso to any zzso in a zzso independent manner and not biased towards abundant proteins or certain protein zzso The biological sample is zzso exposed to these immobilized zzso zzso zzso peptides are specifically zzso enriched and subsequently detected and identified using zzso
