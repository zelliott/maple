zzso zzso function by a guard zzso transgenic approach with the aim of increased stress tolerance and crop yield requires knowledge of the natural fluctuations of zzso gene expression under stress zzso We developed a fast method for the isolation of zzso from zzso fragments of potato leaves zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso preparation is highly enriched in guard cell transcripts and used this method to investigate the response of gene expression in guard cells to mild drought zzso zzso was applied in zzso by withholding water over a period of 2-4 zzso In the following work responses observed under these conditions are called zzso in contrast to immediate zzso zzso opening and closing responses to environmental zzso We observed both zzso increases and decreases of zzso transcript zzso In particular, the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were elevated zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, expression of an inwardly zzso zzso channel from guard cells zzso and of a plasma membrane zzso zzso was reduced to zzso and zzso respectively, of the expression in watered zzso In addition, expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a novel zzso of zzso zzso were also zzso Other genes exhibited zzso zzso Compared with the response in whole leaves, the transcript levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were regulated guard cell zzso Most importantly, changes in zzso transcript levels were complete before the onset of a decrease in leaf water potential, when zzso zzso closure was already zzso These data support the hypothesis that a systemic zzso signal acts not only on short-term zzso movements but also on long-term gene expression in guard zzso Such long-term changes in gene expression might contribute to the zzso of guard cell responses to environmental zzso
