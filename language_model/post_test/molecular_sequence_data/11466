Software packages zzso and zzso are zzso which can be used to understand sequence directed structural variations in zzso zzso by analysis and generation of zzso zzso A set of local zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso roll, twist, shift, slide and zzso have been zzso which use geometry and coordinates of two successive zzso only and can be used to generate zzso structures with varying zzso for each of the 16 possible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso opening and the zzso distance can also be zzso if required, while the sugar zzso backbone atoms are fixed in some standard zzso in each of the zzso zzso can be used to zzso both DNA and zzso structures, with single as well as double stranded zzso The zzso software generates double zzso models with the backbone fixed in zzso DNA, but with appropriate modifications in the input data, it can also generate zzso DNA and zzso duplex zzso
