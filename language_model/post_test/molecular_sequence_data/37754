In zzso cells, zzso DNA replication begins with the formation of zzso complexes at replication zzso zzso and maintenance of zzso complexes is dependent upon zzso zzso 1), a protein which allows assembly of zzso zzso which are putative zzso zzso The functional assembly of zzso proteins into zzso zzso to replication zzso zzso of these proteins from zzso in S phase is crucial in origins firing zzso We have identified a protein that is required for the assembly of zzso complexes, in a screen for zzso expressed genes in zzso This factor zzso is a relative of zzso zzso zzso a protein proposed to function in DNA zzso and is the first to be identified in zzso Here we show, using zzso in zzso systems, that zzso is required for zzso DNA zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso in a manner dependent on zzso protein and is removed from zzso at the time of initiation of DNA zzso zzso and zzso experiments show that zzso is required to load zzso proteins onto zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso is an essential component of the system that regulates origins firing during S zzso
