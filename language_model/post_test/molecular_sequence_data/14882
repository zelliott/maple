DNA is constantly damaged by physical and chemical factors, including zzso oxygen species zzso such as zzso radical zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso radical zzso zzso mechanisms to protect and repair DNA zzso produced by zzso have been developed in living zzso In zzso coli the zzso system, an zzso response activated to rescue cells from severe DNA damage, is a network that regulates the expression of more than 40 genes in response to this damage, many of them playing important roles in DNA damage tolerance zzso Although the function of most of these genes has been zzso the activity of some others, such as zzso remains zzso The zzso deduced zzso sequence shows a high zzso with membrane proteins of the zzso and toxic compound zzso zzso zzso We describe here that expression of zzso protects against zzso zzso probably by decreasing the effects of zzso which is consistent with the observed decrease in zzso and protein zzso These results, together with its ability to decrease the level of zzso zzso suggests that zzso can zzso either direct or zzso zzso molecules that can damage DNA and proteins from both the bacterial metabolism and the zzso Although the exact mechanism of zzso activity remains to be identified, we describe for the first time a role for zzso
