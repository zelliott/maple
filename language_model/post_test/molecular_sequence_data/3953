To understand the role of the zzso zzso zzso region of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso 41 in viral infection, we examined the effects on virus replication of single zzso acid deletions spanning this region in an infectious zzso of the zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso only the deletion of one of the two adjacent zzso zzso located at positions 832 and zzso zzso the Delta zzso zzso for zzso greatly reduced the zzso zzso levels of the zzso precursor and zzso as opposed to the zzso zzso The altered zzso zzso resulted in severely impaired virus zzso and zzso incorporation into this zzso zzso zzso of additional zzso with deletions at zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that the Delta 830 zzso exhibited the most significant zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region is critical for zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso viruses zzso zzso proteins in which zzso zzso and zzso were individually zzso by zzso zzso acids Ala, zzso or zzso which were expected to disrupt the zzso structure in the increasingly severe manner of Pro zzso zzso zzso Ala, only the zzso zzso exhibited significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso Pulse labeling and zzso studies demonstrated that the Delta zzso Delta zzso and zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso more rapidly in a zzso manner after zzso than did the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso 830 and zzso zzso are likely to induce a zzso change in zzso that targets the zzso protein for cellular zzso Our study has implications about the structural zzso located at the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso that affect the fate of zzso in zzso zzso
