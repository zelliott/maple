The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso and zzso hormone zzso family of seven zzso zzso Point zzso of a zzso at the junction between the first zzso loop and the second zzso domain and a zzso in the sixth zzso domain of the human zzso have been reported to be associated with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we explored whether such zzso in the zzso might similarly induce zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Single zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso were made by zzso zzso and zzso binding and zzso levels were measured in zzso human zzso kidney cell line zzso zzso of the zzso at position 340 in the sixth zzso spanning domain to zzso zzso led to zzso zzso activity and exhibited a zzso increase in zzso zzso level as compared to the zzso zzso The increase in zzso level in zzso zzso was zzso to the amount of zzso zzso and corresponded to the zzso number on the cell zzso Despite its high zzso zzso level, the zzso zzso could be further zzso by zzso with zzso zzso generation comparable to the zzso zzso The change of zzso acid zzso at position 169 to zzso zzso however, behaved like the wild type zzso and did not possess zzso zzso These results illustrate that a point zzso of zzso to zzso at position 340 results in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso without affecting its sensitivity to zzso zzso
