zzso virus zzso infection has caught attention yet again as it zzso around the globe affecting millions of zzso The virus caused epidemic outbreaks affecting more than 15,000 people in zzso Eastern India since zzso In this study, complete genetic characterization of zzso gene of zzso circulating in zzso from 2010 to 2011 was performed by virus isolation, zzso molecular zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed the circulation of Indian Ocean zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Several zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which had various zzso roles during the evolution of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was predicted to be the most probable zzso zzso and zzso zzso predicted to be the common T and B cell zzso having high zzso The zzso acid positions zzso and zzso were predicted to be zzso zzso zzso and indicated zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso for effective interaction with the host zzso Positive selection pressure was observed in five specific sites, 210, zzso zzso zzso and 377 which were observed to be fixed zzso in most viral zzso zzso modeling revealed that zzso gene of zzso was composed of 3 zzso and the major zzso zzso were detected in domain B, which can zzso binding of zzso to host cells, while the zzso domain in domain C and the zzso were located in domain A, which was found to be most zzso This is the first report from Eastern India demonstrating a zzso approach to the genetic variations, zzso regions and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The results of this study, combined with other published zzso will expand our knowledge about the zzso region of zzso which can be exploited to develop control measures against zzso
