The synthesis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso requires two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In bacteria, zzso zzso and plants, the two zzso are present on separate zzso zzso We have identified the first animal gene coding for these zzso In the marine worm, zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are present on a single zzso zzso This zzso which we call zzso zzso zzso is able to complement zzso zzso lacking either zzso The zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso but is not translated until after zzso At least three adult zzso gut, zzso and body wall, also contain the zzso but at lower zzso than are found in zzso zzso sequences of a similar gene from zzso zzso zzso were detected in a search of the zzso expressed sequence tag zzso zzso of these zzso and zzso zzso sequences with the sequences of cloned genes from zzso organisms strongly suggests that the animal genes evolved through the fusion of the zzso and zzso genes from lower zzso
