A method for the rapid identification of proteins and their zzso was developed through the use of two parallel columns directly connected to a mass zzso Both porous zzso carbon zzso and zzso zzso columns were connected in parallel with two switching valves for the simultaneous analysis of zzso and zzso zzso To verify the efficiency of the zzso system, profiling of zzso and proteins from human serum was zzso This method is suitable for zzso analysis and automation, is zzso for the identification of zzso and proteins in a complex biological sample, and can be applied to zzso and zzso
