zzso zzso is a zzso zzso originally isolated from human zzso and then found to be widely distributed in the various body zzso zzso derives from zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso containing at its zzso a zzso acid zzso named zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been detected in the zzso zzso axis of humans, rats, and zzso zzso zzso possess binding sites for both zzso and zzso the former being mainly of the zzso 1 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts a direct zzso action on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This effect is zzso by the zzso zzso and its mechanism probably involves the blockade of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso enhances zzso production by in zzso zzso rat zzso and human adrenal slices zzso zzso zzso zzso again through the zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso effect of zzso is blocked by the zzso zzso zzso thereby suggesting that it is indirectly zzso by the release of catecholamines by zzso zzso The effects of zzso on adrenal zzso release are doubtful and probably zzso by the increase in adrenal blood flow rate and the zzso of zzso release by zzso zzso The zzso reached by zzso and zzso in the blood rule out the possibility that they act on the zzso axis as circulating zzso zzso their content in both adrenal and zzso complex is consistent with a zzso mechanism of action, which may play a potentially important role in the regulation of fluid and zzso zzso
