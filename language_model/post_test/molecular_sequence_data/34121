zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso processes in which zzso zzso are formed from zzso and zzso zzso including zzso agents and zzso zzso Although the common zzso zzso of the human zzso gene has been studied zzso little is known about the consequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have examined the effects of two zzso that alter zzso acid zzso in the zzso interface of the zzso zzso protein and one that causes a conservative substitution in the core of the zzso zzso proteins were expressed in an zzso coli strain in which the metabolism of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso We measured the kinetic properties of the zzso with the characteristic zzso zzso zzso and determined the specific activities with several other zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been reported as zzso showed weak but zzso activity with each zzso zzso zzso was expressed at lower levels and showed zzso zzso zzso The results are interpreted in the context of the three-dimensional structure of human zzso zzso
