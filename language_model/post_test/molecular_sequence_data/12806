The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on 18 strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 strains of zzso zzso were studied by a zzso zzso zzso as used in this study were clearly divided into two groups with respect to their zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso zzso for zzso strains zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for zzso strains zzso to 25 zzso All the zzso strains of zzso tested contained the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso decreased the viable counts from approximately zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso within 3 h at zzso greater than the zzso against both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso produced zzso effects at 3 h after exposure against zzso strains at zzso which were greater than the respective zzso whereas these zzso were zzso against zzso zzso The rapid zzso activities of zzso against zzso zzso were reduced when the zzso group of zzso at the 8 position was zzso with zzso or zzso Thus, our data suggest that the introduction of a zzso group into the 8 position of zzso contributes to the zzso activities of zzso against zzso zzso
