zzso zzso zzso allow zzso signals to influence zzso events, while other zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso They may therefore be involved in the development, maintenance and repair of the sensory zzso of the inner ear, since these are believed to be affected by zzso and zzso zzso In order to zzso possible zzso zzso expressed in sensory areas of the inner ear, a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction screen of zzso sensory zzso was zzso using zzso targeted at zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso was taken from the zzso of the mouse zzso zzso and consisted mainly of hair cells and their supporting zzso Of 80 clones zzso 49 coded for zzso zzso and 11 for other known zzso Further analysis of one of the zzso for zzso zzso 4, showed a novel zzso expressed in the inner ear and elsewhere, with a variation in the zzso domain which suggests differential zzso of known zzso zzso Other clones coded for zzso zzso expected to be involved in cell surface and zzso zzso The technique forms a powerful tool for zzso a range of the zzso zzso zzso and provides a starting point for the analysis of zzso zzso in the inner zzso
