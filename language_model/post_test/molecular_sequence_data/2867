We have zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso gene in 77 primary breast zzso in zzso tissue derived from 16 of those primary zzso and in a variety of benign breast zzso zzso of zzso was also assessed in most samples by zzso detection of the zzso protein in tissue zzso zzso abnormalities to zzso were detected in DNA from zzso zzso of primary breast zzso zzso Where DNA was available from zzso tissue derived from such primary zzso the same aberration could be zzso No zzso were seen in benign breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso examined for expression by zzso methods showed a proportion of zzso cells to be completely negative for the zzso zzso All zzso in which a structural zzso to zzso was detected had a proportion of negative cells, except for one case where all cells were zzso Several primary zzso samples were identified where there was no zzso structural change to the zzso but there was loss of expression in some zzso zzso The data presented here demonstrate that changes to the zzso gene leading to loss of expression of both zzso are frequent in primary human breast zzso
