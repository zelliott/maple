We report the zzso sequence and the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter is controlled by a zzso zzso promoter and situated in the 308 degrees zzso region which contains genes involved in zzso acid zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein which resembles integral membrane proteins belonging to zzso systems of zzso zzso Gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein whose zzso contains the zzso motif and shares extensive zzso with a number of zzso zzso particularly with those associated with the transport of zzso zzso and zzso That the zzso zzso is essential for cell growth was established by the failure to zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso During limited zzso zzso cells exhibited a zzso zzso while their walls contained reduced amounts of zzso as well as zzso These zzso revealing impaired metabolism of both wall zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso combined with sequence zzso suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso through the zzso membrane of the latter zzso acids or their zzso
