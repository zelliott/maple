zzso zzso proteins with zzso to protein zzso zzso have been identified in zzso soybean and zzso Each contains a predicted zzso domain containing sequence motifs characteristic of zzso protein zzso zzso which play an important role in signal zzso in other zzso and are distinct from zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso Their identity as zzso was confirmed by zzso the soybean zzso expressed as a zzso zzso fusion zzso The zzso had zzso activity towards zzso zzso and zzso but did not zzso zzso or zzso at a zzso zzso zzso containing peptides also served as zzso with zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso was abolished by zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso but was unaffected by zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso was a zzso The zzso zzso sequence was isolated both as a zzso clone and as a partial zzso whereas the pea and soybean sequences were isolated as zzso Southern analysis suggested a single gene in zzso and a small gene family in pea and zzso In zzso zzso transcripts were present in zzso and decreased in level with zzso transcripts were also zzso in other zzso The plant zzso all contain a similar zzso domain which shows no similarity to any known protein zzso This domain may be involved in zzso functions unique to zzso
