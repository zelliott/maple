The zzso degradation of zzso and subsequent formation of volatile sulfur compounds zzso is believed to be essential for flavor development in zzso zzso zzso can convert zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso was cloned from the type strain zzso linens zzso zzso known to produce copious amounts of zzso and related zzso The disruption of the zzso zzso achieved in strain zzso zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso activity and a zzso decrease in total zzso production in the knockout zzso Our work shows that zzso degradation via zzso is a key step in the formation of zzso in zzso zzso
