A series of zzso deletions and a point zzso in the binding site for nuclear factor zzso B were introduced into the zzso region of a molecular clone of zzso zzso virus from zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso regions was analyzed by transient zzso zzso zzso Two distinct regions in zzso appeared to contain important zzso sequences for zzso zzso zzso of the single nuclear factor zzso B site in the zzso zzso region attenuated zzso in zzso zzso and zzso T zzso A second zzso element was localized to sequences between zzso and zzso in zzso deletion of long terminal repeat sequences up to zzso significantly attenuated zzso activity in zzso zzso Furthermore, sequences between zzso and zzso contributed to zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso T zzso zzso of long terminal repeat sequences to zzso in addition to zzso of the nuclear factor zzso B site, was necessary to zzso the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso A negative regulatory element analogous to that identified in the zzso region from the human zzso virus was not found in the zzso region from zzso
