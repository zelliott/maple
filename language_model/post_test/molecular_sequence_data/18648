DNA zzso is important for the zzso of zzso and other repetitive elements in many higher zzso However, plant and zzso zzso have evolved to contain repetitive elements near or inside their zzso How these genes are kept from being silenced by DNA zzso is not well zzso A forward zzso screen led to the identification of the putative zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso as a cellular zzso factor and regulator of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso contains a composite Plant zzso zzso that recognizes both active and repressive zzso zzso marks at the zzso repeat elements in genes such as the zzso 3 zzso 9 zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso 1 zzso and is necessary for maintaining the expression of these genes by promoting zzso zzso zzso Because of its role in maintaining zzso zzso zzso is required for preventing zzso zzso in the bodies of thousands of zzso Our results thus increase the understanding of zzso zzso zzso patterns, and regulation of alternative zzso processing by zzso zzso
