The novel zzso zzso zzso isolated from the marine sponge zzso zzso has a unique structure, with zzso and zzso zzso attached to a zzso zzso through an zzso and zzso linkage, zzso We zzso zzso 1 and some zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2-6 containing a zzso zzso Among these compounds, the natural type showed the most potent zzso oxide zzso production zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that both the presence of a zzso and the zzso zzso portion are crucial for optimal NO zzso
