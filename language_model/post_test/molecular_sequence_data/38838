The three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain zzso of zzso A1 zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that zzso zzso and is composed of an zzso zzso domain, two zzso type zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds specifically to zzso zzso zzso has a compact and zzso structure with the zzso of a twisted zzso This domain contains two zzso zzso one composed of three strands and the other of two zzso The core region formed by the zzso and aromatic zzso makes the overall structure rigid and zzso The overall zzso of zzso is similar to that of the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso Z zzso However, zzso lacks the three aromatic zzso aligned zzso and exposed to the zzso which probably interact with cellulose in zzso zzso the binding mechanism of a group of zzso including zzso may be different from that proposed for zzso
