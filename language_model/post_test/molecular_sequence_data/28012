We have constructed the expression plasmids harboring protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso with a series of deletions in the zzso coding zzso These plasmids were zzso into zzso cells to characterize the zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso zzso identified proteins with the Mr values expected from the zzso zzso zzso in the extracts from zzso zzso The zzso zzso when expressed in zzso cells, zzso increased zzso zzso binding activity on intact zzso but the zzso zzso with the deletion around the C1 region did not show this zzso The zzso zzso showed protein zzso activity dependent on zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas these zzso zzso exhibited protein zzso activity independent of the zzso in a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso with the deletion in the C2 region gave increased zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso activity of this zzso was much less dependent on zzso compared with the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso with the deletion in the zzso region zzso increased zzso zzso binding activity, but neither zzso nor zzso protein zzso zzso These results indicate that elimination of the C1 region of zzso gives rise to zzso active zzso independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that the zzso regions play distinct roles in the regulatory and zzso function of zzso In another series of experiments, zzso of some zzso zzso zzso with the deletions around the C1 region into Chinese zzso zzso and zzso cells activated the zzso zzso element or the zzso gene zzso linked to the zzso zzso reporter gene in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso into zzso zzso induced initiation of zzso zzso breakdown, indicating that they zzso the zzso zzso in zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a powerful tool to investigate the zzso signaling zzso zzso by zzso
