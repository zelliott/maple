The C1 complex of complement is assembled from a recognition protein zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of two modular zzso zzso and zzso Resolution of the zzso structure of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso segment has led to a model of the zzso interaction where the zzso collagen stem binds at the zzso interface through zzso bonds involving zzso zzso contributed by the zzso zzso module zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify the zzso sites of zzso a series of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso binding ability of the resulting zzso zzso was assessed by surface zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso stretch in the zzso zzso module had no effect on C1 zzso ruling out our previous interaction zzso Additional zzso targeting zzso expected to participate in the zzso sites of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided evidence for high affinity zzso sites contributed by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and lower affinity sites contributed by zzso zzso All of the sites zzso zzso zzso also contributing zzso zzso zzso thus contributes six zzso sites, one per zzso zzso Based on the location of these sites and available structural information, we propose a refined model of C1 assembly where the zzso interaction zzso of zzso and zzso are entirely clustered inside zzso and interact through six binding sites with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This mechanism is similar to that demonstrated for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
