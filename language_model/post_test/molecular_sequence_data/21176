zzso are zzso bacterial communities encased in an zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso required for zzso formation and zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso release is controlled by zzso a regulator essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coincided with localized cell death and DNA release, and could be zzso by conditions resulting in membrane zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated increased cell zzso and zzso release suggesting zzso to zzso but not zzso these zzso zzso zzso profiling indicated that zzso was required for repression of genes associated with zzso assembly and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of direct zzso targets identified the promoter of zzso termed here zzso zzso a previously zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family of zzso Lack of zzso expression coincided with impaired zzso development and increased cell death, a zzso comparable to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso restored zzso release, cell zzso and zzso formation to zzso levels, with zzso zzso promoting resistance to the zzso zzso zzso detected only in zzso zzso we propose that zzso regulates zzso development by limiting zzso zzso and thus, zzso release, via zzso
