The behavioral and cognitive effects of nicotine suggest that zzso zzso receptors zzso participate in central nervous system zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nicotine binding sites are common in the brain, there is little evidence for zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso To test whether, zzso zzso might modify rather than mediate transmission, the regulation of zzso synaptic transmission by these receptors was zzso zzso zzso of nicotine enhanced both zzso and zzso synaptic transmission by zzso of zzso zzso that increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso deletion experiments reveal that these zzso zzso include the alpha 7 zzso These findings reveal that zzso zzso enhance fast zzso transmission, providing a likely mechanism for the complex behavioral effects of zzso
