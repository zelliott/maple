An alternative zzso event in which a portion of the zzso bounded by the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso is included as an additional zzso coding zzso zzso zzso or coding zzso zzso has been described for normal and tumor zzso cells that express zzso We show here that this alternative zzso event is zzso in human zzso zzso In addition, another novel zzso zzso zzso or coding zzso zzso is identified in human zzso zzso expressed in normal and tumor zzso Although the zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso is larger than the major zzso zzso the predicted products of both forms of human alternatively spliced zzso transcripts are zzso zzso proteins that terminate in the alternative zzso These proteins are predicted to lack the same zzso zzso as the viral zzso proteins zzso by avian zzso virus and zzso zzso The junction sequences that flank these zzso closely resemble the consensus zzso donor and zzso zzso zzso yet the alternative transcripts are less abundant than is the major form of zzso zzso The contribution that alternative zzso events in zzso expression may make on zzso function remains to be zzso
