zzso protein zzso zzso belongs to a small group of zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene cause dominant zzso and zzso lethal zzso zzso in zzso zzso Studies in several organisms suggest that zzso is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and cell zzso In this report, we used an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to clone a zzso zzso from the Mediterranean fruit fly, zzso zzso The isolated zzso contained both zzso and 3' untranslated regions, and zzso a zzso of 83 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence showed zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso zzso and strong zzso with all known zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso indicated the existence of a single zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso untranslated region revealed the occurrence of a major zzso tract at the zzso end, which characterizes most zzso undergoing a zzso zzso zzso Study of the zzso patterns during development suggested that the expression of zzso zzso is temporally regulated at the level of zzso
