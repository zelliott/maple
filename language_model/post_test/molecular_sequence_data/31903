A method for detection of the zzso K zzso structural gene and its active promoter preceded by the zzso box, controlling the expression level of this zzso was zzso The method was applied for the purpose of the analysis of 47 bacterial strains belonging to the zzso zzso group isolated from different food zzso It was found that the majority of the analyzed strains carried the fully functional zzso gene with its zzso regulated zzso The zzso gene was not detected in four zzso strains of zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene and potentially producing an zzso toxin - zzso The zzso K gene was detected in 4 zzso classified as zzso zzso and one reference strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The promoter region and the zzso part of the zzso gene from two strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed similarities to the corresponding sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It was shown for the first time that the zzso gene promoter region from strains zzso and zzso of zzso zzso had a similar arrangement to the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of the zzso gene in zzso zzso shows that this species, widely recognized as zzso may pose potential biohazard to human zzso
