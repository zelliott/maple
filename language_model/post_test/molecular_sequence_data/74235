Copy number variation zzso is emerging as a new tool for understanding human zzso variation, but its relationship with human disease is not yet fully zzso The data for a total of zzso zzso were collected for a zzso association study of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a Japanese population zzso and controls, zzso using zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso zzso we visually inspected all zzso clusters of zzso zzso markers covering the whole zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso As a result, we identified zzso zzso zzso markers for common zzso loss zzso zzso regions in a Japanese population zzso The identified zzso markers shared the following zzso enrichment of zzso zzso zzso inconsistency among families, and high missing zzso zzso All zzso information for those markers is summarized in our database zzso In addition, we performed zzso association analyses of identified zzso zzso markers with the risk of zzso zzso zzso One zzso marker zzso within a zzso region neighboring the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso was significantly associated with a risk of zzso zzso We also validated the zzso around zzso using real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso Information and methods used in this study would be helpful for accurate zzso of zzso on zzso regions, which could be used for association analysis of zzso markers within zzso zzso
