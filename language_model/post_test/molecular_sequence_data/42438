A strategy, based on competitive zzso chain reaction zzso after reverse transcription, was developed to zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this rare zzso is achieved by zzso of a constant amount of the complementary DNA zzso with successive zzso of a competitive DNA template of known concentration and with the use of the same zzso The unique zzso site located in the zzso coding sequence has been abolished in the competitive zzso The two zzso zzso used are both located in the zzso coding sequence at equal distance from the zzso zzso After amplification, the zzso products from the zzso to be zzso and from the competitor DNA are zzso by zzso zzso followed by separation of the resulting fragments by zzso gel zzso DNA amplified from the target zzso is the only DNA zzso by zzso into two fragments of identical size zzso in an zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso comparison of the intensity of zzso of the resulting bands in a competition series permits us to estimate precisely the amount of zzso zzso and therefore of the zzso to be zzso
