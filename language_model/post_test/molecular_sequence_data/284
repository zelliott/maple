zzso zzso is an essential modifier zzso in all zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been proposed to be able to bind with zzso which plays important roles in zzso zzso degradation, zzso formation, and DNA damage zzso We have identified a core domain from the zzso family zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso namely zzso that can bind zzso and zzso its solution structure and zzso mode by zzso zzso The zzso domain possesses equal population of two zzso in solution by zzso whereas the two zzso exhibit almost equivalent zzso binding zzso This domain structure takes a novel fold consisting of four zzso and two zzso and the zzso site on zzso locates in the surface of zzso which is to some extent analogous to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study provides structural basis and zzso information for zzso recognition of the novel zzso domain from a zzso family protein that may connect zzso and degradation in zzso zzso zzso
