zzso is the zzso form of zzso a major zzso protein of the zzso elastic zzso of zzso zzso with properties of zzso and elastic zzso zzso and avian species contain a single gene for zzso A zzso gene has also previously been identified in zzso In contrast, two zzso genes with different tissue expression patterns have been described in zzso While general characteristics of zzso such as alternating arrangements of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso across a wide zzso range, sequences of these zzso are highly zzso particularly when zzso and zzso zzso are zzso For this reason zzso correspondence is not clear, and overall alignment of zzso sequences across all species is not zzso An exception to this is the zzso zzso whose coding sequence has been very zzso across all species described to zzso In zzso this zzso domain has been shown to be important for interactions with cells and other zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso Here we identify and characterize a second zzso gene in the zzso with several unusual zzso the most striking of which is zzso of the zzso domain, deleting normally zzso sequence zzso We demonstrate that, in spite of the absence of these zzso both zzso zzso genes are expressed and incorporated into the elastic zzso although with differential tissue zzso
