We have previously shown that patients with the Hunter syndrome frequently have suffered from a zzso event between the zzso gene and its putative zzso zzso resulting in an inversion of the intervening zzso The zzso which might be the consequence of an zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso between sequences located in zzso 7 of the zzso gene and sequences located zzso of zzso 3 in zzso In order to gain insight into the mechanisms causing the zzso we have isolated both inversion junctions in six unrelated zzso DNA sequence analysis of the junctions showed that all zzso have taken place within a 1 zzso region where the sequence identity is zzso An interesting finding was the identification of regions with alternating zzso gene and zzso sequences present at one inversion zzso suggesting that the zzso event has been initiated by a zzso break in zzso 7 of the zzso zzso The results from this study suggest that zzso zzso in man could be explained by mechanisms similar to those described for zzso zzso The results also have practical implications for diagnosis of patients with the Hunter zzso
