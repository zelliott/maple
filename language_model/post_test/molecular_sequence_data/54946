This study describes the results of the sequencing and analysis of segments of zzso II and III of the zzso zzso L gene of zzso virus zzso from different zzso species of zzso The zzso relations of the virus were determined and a variety of zzso zzso were found in the analyzed areas, but the majority of these zzso were found to be zzso However, an analysis of the putative zzso acid sequences were shown to have some characteristic zzso between some zzso species of Brazil, indicating that there was positive selection in the zzso zzso L gene of zzso zzso On comparing the putative viral sequences obtained from the Brazilian zzso and other zzso it was determined that zzso acid zzso occurred in zzso zzso This study of the L gene of zzso virus is the first to be conducted with samples of virus zzso from Brazil, and the results obtained will help in the determination of the zzso relations of the zzso
