It has been suggested that T cells primed by processed donor major zzso complex zzso (the zzso zzso of zzso may be responsible for zzso chronic zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a clinically useful zzso to study the occurrence of indirect zzso during chronic rejection in zzso 

A panel of 20 zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso recipients were zzso with these zzso zzso was zzso by DNA incorporation of zzso and positive proliferation was defined by a statistically significant increase in counts per minute over background with a minimum stimulation index of zzso The precursor frequency of zzso zzso T cells was determined by limiting dilution zzso 

zzso from zzso of patients who were mismatched for at least one of the three DR molecules and had chronic zzso dysfunction specifically proliferated to the mismatched zzso zzso zzso was seen in only zzso of control subjects zzso zzso The zzso response was low grade and was best detected on day zzso of culture in zzso The precursor frequency of zzso T cells was more than zzso higher compared with controls zzso 

These data demonstrate for the first time that T cells of patients with chronic graft dysfunction are primed to recognize and respond to specific zzso major zzso complex zzso Our results support the hypothesis that T cells primed via the indirect zzso of zzso may be important zzso of chronic rejection and provide the rationale to develop specific therapeutic strategies to prevent or interrupt this zzso
