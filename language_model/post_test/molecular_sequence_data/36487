Having previously demonstrated that the zzso growth factors zzso induce expression of the zzso zzso we have now extended our investigation of the induction of zzso by the zzso to a second member of the zzso family, zzso This is the only zzso gene other than zzso expressed early in the differentiation of zzso zzso so its regulation was of particular interest because of our observations on zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso but the steady state levels of zzso zzso fell zzso for 48 h after the cells were switched to low serum medium containing zzso in both zzso cell lines and zzso cultured from human zzso In spite of this decrease, translation of zzso zzso appeared essential during the early stages of stimulation of zzso by the zzso an zzso zzso complementary to the first five zzso of zzso blocked the increase in zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso aspects of zzso We conclude that expression of zzso is essential for the initial induction of zzso by the zzso but that subsequent zzso of zzso expression is independent of zzso possibly resulting from zzso of the zzso zzso The functional significance of the dramatic decrease in zzso zzso levels during differentiation is not zzso
