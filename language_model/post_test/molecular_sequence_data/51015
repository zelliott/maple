zzso gene zzso are present in most zzso zzso zzso These are usually detected by Southern zzso zzso In this study, the ability of the zzso chain reaction zzso to detect the zzso zzso zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso gene zzso was zzso DNA from 14 zzso and 42 diffuse zzso zzso was examined using zzso zzso specific for opposing sides of the zzso gene zzso on zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and opposing sides of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso region of the zzso gene on zzso 18 and zzso zzso sequence on zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in 57% of zzso zzso and zzso of diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso using zzso were detected in 50% zzso and zzso of the diffuse zzso Either or both of these zzso were detected in zzso zzso and in 59% of diffuse zzso zzso is a rapid and easy technique that can detect the abnormal zzso of the zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso indicating the presence of zzso This may be of benefit in monitoring response to therapy and in predicting prognosis in this zzso
