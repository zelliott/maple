In a screen for zzso proteins in embryonic chicken brain, we have identified a novel nuclear protein structurally related to zzso zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso We have called this protein zzso for chicken zzso zzso In this screen, zzso was zzso with two zzso zzso and, in common with the unconventional zzso bound zzso in zzso in both the presence and absence of calcium zzso zzso of 757 zzso acids of the zzso sequence revealed that it shares zzso zzso acid identity with human and rat zzso although zzso and zzso appear not to be zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso of all chick zzso and, as one of a growing number of zzso proteins to be identified in the nucleus, further highlights the potential of zzso as a regulator of nuclear zzso
