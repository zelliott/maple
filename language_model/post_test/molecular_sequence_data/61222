We have constructed a complete coverage zzso zzso map that spans a zzso zzso segment in the human zzso zzso zzso The map consists of 68 previously mapped zzso and zzso zzso zzso 51 of zzso to a total of zzso zzso of zzso zzso been zzso and provides a high resolution physical map of the zzso zzso were initially built based mainly on the analysis of zzso contents and restriction fingerprint patterns of the zzso To close the gaps, zzso derived from zzso clone ends were used to screen deeper zzso zzso zzso end sequence data obtained from zzso zzso zzso as well as from public databases, were used for the identification of zzso that overlap with fully zzso zzso by means of sequence zzso This approach allowed precise alignment of clone zzso in addition to restriction fingerprint zzso A zzso zzso drawing software tool was developed and used to manage the map data zzso and generate a real scale physical zzso The map we present here is approximately zzso zzso deep and provides a minimal zzso path that covers the region in an array of zzso overlapping zzso
